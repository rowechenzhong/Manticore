BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Nike Golf has announced the addition of two athletes from China Hao-Tong Li and Xin-Jun Zhang to its talented Tour roster. In a multi-year agreement, Li and Zhang will represent the Swoosh in clubs, ball, footwear, glove, apparel, headwear and accessories.
Hao-Tong Li
From the Hunan Province in China, Li turned professional in 2011 at the age of 16. As an amateur, Li took home nine gold medals and six silver medals in the Asian games in various cities in China. He finished T21 in the 2011 One Asia Nanshan Masters and was named the Best Amateur Player. Li represented the Chinese National Team in 2010 and 2011. More recently, Li competed in this year's Australian PGA Championship and the New Zealand PGA Championship where he finished T39 and T5, respectively.
Xin-Jun Zhang
From the Shanxi Province in China, 26-year old Zhang turned professional in 2010 at the age of 23. In 2007, he was selected to be a Chinese National Team member to represent China for international tournaments. When Zhang turned professional, he had a remarkable T13 finish in the 2011 Shanghai HSBC Championship. He won two gold medals and one silver medal for Chinese Professional Tournaments in 2011 and 2012.

PROBLEM: The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM), an intervention program developed at the University of Washington and UC Davis, was previously shown to have measurable effects on the IQ, communication skills, and social interactions of toddlers under the age of two with autism spectrum disorder. The findings highlighted the importance of identifying and working with young children, presumably while their brains are still malleable.
METHODOLOGY: Half of the original 48 participants had been receiving 20 hours per week of ESDM, implemented in home visits by a trained interventionist for the entire two years. Their parents were also taught how to use ESDM strategies, which emphasize social behavior and face recognition.
As a control, the other half of the children were given routine community-based intervention. Now four to five years old, the children were hooked up to EEGs while being shown randomized images of toys (neutral objects) and female faces (social stimuli), the latter of which children with autism typically have trouble identifying and responding to. Their brain activity during this exercise was compared to that a group of children without autism.
- For Body Fat, 30 Minutes of Exercise as Good as 60
- Marijuana Alleviates Muscle Pain in MS
- Writers Are Twice as Likely to Commit Suicide
RESULTS: All of the children were similarly able to process faces, which suggested to the authors that intervention in both forms was somewhat effective.
But 74 percent of the children in the ESDM group demonstrated active attention to and active cognitive processing of the faces. Only 36 percent of the children who received community intervention had the same response, and in general, these children actually tended to respond more to the objects than to the social stimuli.
The increased brain activity of the EDSM children was positively correlated with improved social behavior.
CONCLUSION: Intervention, when early, intensive, and focused on social engagement, can help to normalize the brain activity of children with autism and lead to improvements in social behavior.
IMPLICATIONS: This intervention in no way claims to cure autism -- the brain activity did not correlate with diagnostic scores, IQ, language, or adaptive behavior. But it might be a way of mitigating one of its secondary effects: the social disengagement that children with autism exhibit early in life can be self-perpetuating, keeping them from learning how to properly recognize and response to faces. Especially for those on the less extreme end of the spectrum, such as those with Asperger's Syndrome, effective social-based intervention can profoundly influence their ability to function in social environments.
The full study, "Early Behavioral Intervention Is Associated With Normalized Brain Activity in Young Children With Autism," is published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.While fund managers and investing pros may play it safe when rattling off their picks for the coming year, reporters and editors often go with some serious long shots.
With disquiet in Washington and Europe as a backdrop, many companies the business press has highlighted this year — such as AIG and Barnes & Noble — have been among those hardest hit by the financial crisis and recession.
Business reporters aren’t full-time stock pickers, of course. But since they keep a close eye on the market all year, their editors ask them each December to answer the same question: Where on that great roulette table would you place your chips?
Every publication approaches the task a little differently. Some, like the mandarins at Barron’s (which, like MarketWatch, is owned by Dow Jones), rely mostly on their own expertise. Others, like Fortune and Forbes, tap prominent fund managers for recommendations.
This year, the exercise is taking place at a moment of particular uncertainty. The good news is stocks turned in a solid year in 2012, with Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbing about 15%. For 2013, economists forecast average U.S. GDP growth of 2.3%, with unemployment falling and home prices on the mend.
As for the bad news: Just turn on the TV. Washington may have struck a tax deal to help avoid the fiscal cliff, but battles on spending and the debt ceiling still loom. Across the Atlantic, debt-ridden economies like those of Spain and Greece are still giving investors fits.
As a result, investors that look to Wall Street experts for advice are getting a wishy-washy response. To take just one example: UBS chief equity strategist Jonathan Golub titled his 2013 outlook“Uncertainty Reigns.” (Golub, pointing to the deficit’s drag on long-term growth, sees the S&P gaining only about 3.6% in 2013.)
Does that lack of clarity leave room for the business press to shine? Maybe so. But while we at MarketWatch often warn about how Wall Street analysts and fund managers are talking their books, that’s no less true of journalists, in a way.
Why analysts remain bullish on Facebook stock
In over 40 analyst reports released since Facebook's May 2012 IPO, each report has urged investors to buy despite the stock's drops, Aaron Lucchetti reports on digits. Photo: Getty Images.
Why might reporters favor certain stocks? Let’s face it, the comeback of a well-known but down-at-the-heels brand makes a better yarn than another plug for Apple (although you’ll find plenty of those too) or the contention that some electrical utility you’ve never heard of will maintain its dividend.
“It’s a popularity contest,” says blogger and financial adviser Josh Brown (whose work has often been published by Dow Jones.) “It’s hard to get people’s attention if you pick 10 stocks nobody’s ever heard of.” Table: The media’s favorite stocks
That’s not to be cynical, by the way. Many reporters really do root for the just-took-it-on-the-chin player whose luck may have already run out. Just look at the industry they chose to work in.
Some highlights from this year’s picks:
- Forbes: GM GM, +1.60%
- Fortune: Ford F, +1.37%
- Kiplinger’s: TRW Automotive US:TRW , Ford F, +1.37%
Forbes and Fortune both cite portfolio managers arguing that, with the economy picking up steam, people will start buying cars again. Not to be outdone, the editors at Kiplinger’s picked two auto-industry stocks: supplier TRW Automotive, which has fast-growing businesses in China and South America, and Ford, the only major U.S. automaker to avoid taking bailout money during the financial crisis. One key advantage Ford has, writers point out: Despite returning more than 20% this year, it still trades at less than eight times forecast profits. See CNNMoney, Forbes, Kiplinger
- Fortune: Moody’s MCO, -0.34%
Moody’s played a starring role in the financial crisis, but for 2013, Fortune highlights this pick by Akre Focus fund manager Chuck Akre. Moody’s big strength: Its bond ratings remain indispensible to investors. See CNNMoney
- Kiplinger’s: AIG AIG, +0.43%
It once would have been hard to think of AIG as an underdog. But this company has been through the ringer, becoming a financial-crisis poster child after seeing billions of dollars’ worth of credit-default bets turn sour. But recently, AIG has enjoyed some-long awaited good news: Earlier this month, the Treasury Department sold its last parcel of AIG stock, ultimately reaping a big profit on the much despised 2008 bailout. Kiplinger’s thinks that investors, still punishing AIG for its past misdeeds, have failed to see that its shares are cheap — trading at roughly half book value, while many peers trade in line with their book value. See Kiplinger
- Barron’s: Barnes & Noble BKS, +2.65%
The book business is tough these days. But as Barron’s points out, Barnes & Noble is practically the last brick-and-mortar giant standing — a fact likely to give it some respite from other Main Street competition. Meanwhile, the Nook e-reader, if not exactly the second coming of the iPad, has proved a worthy competitor to Amazon’s Kindle. See Barron’sCAF president Issa Hayatou says Algeria and Nigeria have the capabilities to overcome their Round of 16 FIFA World Cup opponents and go as far as they possibly could at the ongoing championship in Brazil.
In hailing their qualification to the knock-out round, Hayatou said CAF and the African continent were solidly behind Africa's two representatives and reminded them of the support of the entire continent.
"Following the historic qualification of the Algeria and Nigeria National teams for the 2nd round of the FIFA World Cup - Brazil 2014, I would like to convey to you, on behalf of CAF, its Executive Committee and the Entire African Football Family, our sincere congratulations as well as all our best wishes for the rest of the competition," Hayatou said in separate letters to the presidents of the Algerian and Nigerian football federations Mohamed Raouraoua and Al Hadji Aminu Maigari respectively.
"Kindly convey as well our congratulations to the players and officials of your teams as well as to the Algerian and Nigerian people for this superb performance," Hayatou said.
He expressed confidence that Algeria and Nigeria would gave historic encounters against Germany on 30 June in Porto Alegre and against France in Brasilia also on 30 June.
"We urge you to transmit to the Desert Foxes and Super Eagles all our encouragements and our wishes of success. Your teams will have the support of the entire African continent and we are aware and confident that your national teams are capable of winning against any opponent now," Hayatou said stressing that the two nations' qualifications to the knock out round made Africa proud adding that the continent wished them "altogether that their runs in the competition continues as far as possible".Form M1PR and Form CRP, Minnesota Property Tax Refund

Resumen
CUEVAS-GUZMAN, Ramón et al. Structural and diversity analysis of Abies forests from Jalisco, Mexico. Rev. Mex. Biodiv. [online]. 2011, vol.82, n.4, pp. 1219-1233. ISSN 2007-8706.
Structure, floristic composition and diversity in Abies forests were determined in twenty-four 0.1 ha plots in 5 areas in Jalisco State. The resulting attributes were compared between areas. Sixty four species, 47 genera and 35 families were recorded. The families Asteraceae, Pinaceae and Fagaceae, as well as the genera Quercus, Pinus and Abies had the highest species richness. More than half (56%) of the individuals had a height ranging between 2 and 14 m, with Abies religiosavar. emarginata, A. guatemalensis var. jaliscana, Quercus xalapensis and A. religiosa var. religiosa presenting the taller trees. The highest density values, basal area, frequency and importance values were for A. religiosa var. emarginata, A. religiosa var. religiosa, Pinus pseudostrobus y Podocarpus matudae. Individuals of the species presented an inverted "J"- shaped diameter distribution, while no statistical significant differences were observed for richness and species diversity in the 5 study areas. Average similarity between plots in the 5 areas presented significant differences in 4 of the plots. Despite being quite different in floristic composition, Abies forests in Jalisco were similar in structure, diversity and richness. The presence of tall individuals and emergent trees in all strata suggests a good regeneration capacity in the communities of the 5 areas studied.

I use this when I am going to be out of town for just a day or two. I know with this watering system that my pets will not run out of water while I'm gone. It keeps unused water in the bottle where it stays fresh and clean. This system is also easy to wash.
Pros: constant supply of water, keeps water fresh, clean
Cons: none

Cats like it
posted 7 years ago
My cats liked this water container. I have three cats and two of them used it frequently, the other really didn't care for it. He seemed to like the sink more. I still have this but since the one cat wouldn't use it I choose a different container. This also gets very dirty will need to be clean at least twice a week to get rid of dirt and hair that gets dropped in there from the cats/or dogs when they are drinking. I would recommend this for a low cost option.
Pros: Didn't have to fill up all the time
Cons: gets dirty - need to cleanthis is a discussion within the Saints Community Forum; NFL total access reports that the Saints may surprisingly make a push for Dwight Freeney, if they can not sign Nnamdi Asomugha....

When we were knitting in her living room yesterday, Gwynne complained that there are never any photos of me knitting on the blog. This is partly because I want to lose weight before I post any more pictures of myself and partly because I haven’t figured out how to take a photo of myself while I’m knitting. But of course Gwynne wasn’t having any of that, so she took this photo of me working on the Fair Isle lumber jacket.
And now that I’ve started the first sleeve, I wanted you to see the sweater with its bottom corrugated ribbing and the beginnings of the right sleeve. So I snapped this photo this morning.
A word about the colors. The last two photos that I’ve posed have captured the colors more accurately than this photo does. The florescent lights at my house seem to skewer the colors with a little more yellow in them than they actually have.
I will try to post more later, and perhaps I can get to the next book list tonight.
As I said in my email to you — Look at that pretty smile!!!
Love the phot of you knitting, thank you for giving in. I am so happy the sweater is progressing the way it is. WOWDefinitions

Today’s Website Visitors Are More Skeptical Than Ever
It’s getting harder and harder for people…consumers and business customers, to figure out who’s credible and who’s not.
It’s nothing new…but, it’s a lot harder to do these days-mainly because of the internet.
It’s pretty easy to slap together a credible-looking website. A nice design combined with good copywriting can produce great results…for the owner of the website.
Except, it’s not about them. It’s about the person looking for credible information.
What Makes A Website Or Blog Credible?
Here are a few things you should look for to determine if a site is credible:
1. History
How long has the site been around?
While there are websites and blogs that have been online for several years that are less than credible, more times than not, the longer a website or blog has been around the better. Especially if it ranks high in the search engines.
Fact: The Franchise King Blog is the first-ever blog solely focused on franchising. It’s been around since 2006.
Click Here To See Examples Of Sponsored Posts On The Franchise King Blog
2. Active Press Page
Does the website or blog receive media mentions, including links back to the site?
If so, it’s a good sign that it’s being taken seriously-as a serious and credible resource.
3. Blog
Is there a blog on the website?
If so, is it updated regularly?
Does the blog provide useful information and tips?
4. Social Media
Does the website owner take social media seriously?
Are there buttons or links to the major social media networks on the site, and are the accounts active?
5. Kudos
Is it easy to find out if others are impressed with the website, blog, and it’s owner? In other words, is there a section on the site where you can read what people have to say about it?
If so, do they seem to be written by real people?
Credibility Is King
Aligning yourself-your company, with a credible source can do wonders for your brand.
If you’re trying to figure out ways to reach your target market, a sponsored post or two may be the ticket.
You can write them-or you can have me do it.
Here are some examples of what sponsored posts on The Franchise King Blog look like.
A Sponsored Post Is For You
- If you’re a franchisor trying to generate leads, sponsored posts are for you
- If you offer products/services that future and current franchise owners need
- If you’re trying to reach franchisors, because you offer something that can help their organizations
Fact: Sponsored posts keep on working 24 hours a day, 365 days a year-forever, because they’re archived on the site and are indexed in the search engines. Sponsored Posts are not one-time things. Plus, as soon as I publish them, they’re sent around to all of my social networks. Currently, I have 23,000+followers and fans. I’m one of the most active franchise professionals on social media.

Happy New Year from Vectorform!Posted by Vectorform – January 9, 2009
So what is 2009 going to bring? Well if our January antics are the prelude, we’re in for quite a show. Starting off with turning 10 years old, showing off a new brand identity, our first iPhone app, CodeMash in Cleveland, CES in Vegas, NRF in New York and wrapping it up with the 2009 NAIAS in our hometown of Detroit…Whew! It’s a wonder we were able to look out the window and see the snow fall in December, well there’s no snow at our Hyderabad office, but you know what I mean.
Details? Well, I’m going to take a little liberty to sneak outside of the ‘Surface Only’ blog for a moment…
*10 years old: Growing up and in need of a new brand identity. What did we find out? Vectorform has become a place where employees feel comfortable and valued, like a family, and that creates a culture that is innovative and exciting, with people who are passionate about the work that they do and supported to bust out and try new things, meeting employee and client needs alike. Happy Birthday, Vectorform!
*iPhone: Debuting in the iPhone app business with the SurfaceDJ, and it looks like it’s being picked up at a good rate. Definitely more to come in this realm.
*CodeMash in Sandusky, Ohio: Our lead Tech Dev., Joe Engalan will be speaking at 11am on Thursday, Jan 8th about multi-touch developing and demonstrating apps that we’ve been working on.
*CES in Las Vegas: already making a splash with our NBC SurfaceDJ in the NBC booth, you just have to check out Al Roker’s dance moves. Yeah, it’s for entertainment…but just think if each little head were bits of information that were being passed around the world?
*NRF New York, NY: This year Microsoft invited Vectorform to take part in their future of music concept store “Sonic” at the National Retail Federation “The Big Show” in New York at the Javits Center. Adapting one of our retail prototypes to match the music realm, we’ll be featuring not only a Surface app, but also a Windows7 application featured on a TouchTV Networks screen. Yeah, Big Stuff….
*Last, and certainly not least..NAIAS in Detroit, Michigan we’ve been brewing a good one. For what feels like a really, really long time we’ve given up, and missed like crazy, some of our swankiest developers to work onsite at Chrysler on a top secret integrated multi-touch development that will be unveiled at the 2009 NAIAS in Detroit…that’s still all we can say! Be sure to check it out!
For now, that’s what we have going on. In the little moments when we come up for air, we’ll keep blogging with the happenings in the tech world.
Thanks for stopping by!

Steve, make sure to tell Lis to get on here and start posting. We need more girls like her around.
I am still waiting for MaineiacRam to make his appearence as well.[SIGPIC][/SIGPIC]
Re: I just wanted to say
Looks and sounds like I missed a great time. I am going to try and make it next year unless of course there's another bash this year. Lots of great pictures and articles, the icing on the cake of course was the BIG WIN by our RAMS !
I am going to Game 4 vs the Lions. If anyone else is going let me know and maybe we can meet up ?
Re: I just wanted to say
In all seriousness though, I really hope she does! All she has to do is be herself and she will be fine here. Its not like she is posting on an opposing teams board or something. LIS, DONT BE AFRAID. THEIR BARK IS WORSE THAN THEIR BITE (WHICH CAN ACTUALLY FEEL PRETTY GOOD IF ITS JUST A NIBBLE BY THE WAY) <WINK>
Re: I just wanted to say
As I mentioned on Saturday, I did find it curious that while most of the Rams fans were eating ribs or steak, the one Eagle fan was eating chicken.
Hmmmmmmm......
Re: I just wanted to say
As I told you, my brother is an Eagle fan too (AvengerEagle?). So, we're happy to have have you at the Bash - as long as the Rams aren't playing Philly.
Re: I just wanted to say
MaineiacRam is a bit shy as you saw at the Bash. He's got to get that phone out of his ear first, then decide if it's Maineiac or Kermie Ram.
It was nice to meet you also PA_Gal. Coming to the Bash in an Eagles jersey is courageous.

Re: I just wanted to say
Since we're all talking about what a great time we had, let me assure you that me and mine also truly enjoyed meeting all of the quality folks that were there. As much fun as Heather and I had, the kids really enjoyed it, and the girls are still talking about the t-shirts and toasted ravioli! Thanks again for all your friendship and generousity, and of course, we'll be there next year to see you all again!

Overnight, all my cherry tomatoes, button squash and some strawberries were eaten by the local marauder. It also enjoyed nibbling on the leaves of various shrubs in the garden. I cursed it (yet again) and took myself off to work, plotting my revenge as I went. Obviously the possum has not yet dropped dead from lack of water, unlike some of my plants. (Just 25mm of rain fell on Sydney in January, down on the 103mm average. )
This evening, I read the day's newspaper, in which gardening writer Cheryl Maddocks describes how she stopped possums attacking her vegetable garden. Ah hah! Very explicit advice on how to enclose the vegetable patch with a possum-proof structure. Action stations! I will not be beaten.
Good luck!Our culture’s pre-occupation with self-esteem has been knit into the fabric of modern day Christianity for so long that, though some in the world now consider it fallacious, many within the church still do not see it for what it really is—a subtle form of pride that is diametrically opposed to the biblical call to esteem God first, through our loving obedience, and others second, by loving them as we already (naturally, effortlessly) love ourselves. Consider some of the prominent voices of self-love within professing Christianity for the past few decades.
“Self-esteem is …the single, greatest need facing the human race today.” .” “A person is in hell when he has lost his self-esteem.” – Robert Schuller
“If I could write a prescription for the women of the world, it would provide each one of them with a healthy dose of self-esteem and personal worth (taken three times a day until symptoms disappear). I have no doubt that this is their greatest need.” – James Dobson
“Under the influence of humanistic psychologists like Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, many of us Christians have begun to see our need for self-love and self-esteem.” – Bruce Narramore
Is self-esteem really what our children need? Or do we need to prayerfully instill in their hearts and minds an awe for God and a loving respect for others who are created in His image? I think the answer is obvious. Our children need God-esteem built into their hearts by the Holy Spirit, through the gospel, as we faithfully train them in the fear of the Lord and point them to Jesus. Here are 11 practical ways we may do so:
- Make the pleasure of God the guiding principle of our home (Rom 8:8; Gal 1:10; Col 1:10; 1 Thess 4:1).
- Make the glory of God the goal of our home (1 Cor 10:31; Ps 86:9-12).
- Teach each of our children that he or she is a unique creation, made by God for a specific purpose (Ps 139:13-16; Isa 43:7).
- Practice the “Two Commandments” – loving God, loving others (Matt 22:36-40). By the way, notice there are only two commandments here, not three, as some self-esteem teachers proclaim. Jesus is not saying we must learn to love ourselves before we can learn to love others. We already love ourselves and are now—in Christ—called to live a life of self-denial.
- Teach our children to esteem others as more important than self (Phil 2:3-4; Mark 10:45).
- Teach our children that God is more concerned about the inner person than outward beauty (1 Sam 16:7). Protect them from becoming preoccupied with what Dobson rightly calls the “beauty cult.”
- Consistently speak to them as fellow persons made in God’s image (James 3:8-10).
- Keep the Lord’s Day and God’s work through the local church very high on our family’s priority list (Heb 10:24-25).
- Teach our children that to follow Christ means they must continually learn to deny self (Luke 9:23-26).
- Teach our children that their adequacy is in Christ, not themselves (2 Cor 3:4-6).
- Train our children to honor and obey our divinely-delegated authority, which is the basis of submission to all other earthly authorities (Eph 6:1-3; Rom 13:1-7; 1 Pet 2:13-25).
“Man must come to the knowledge of himself, be terrified of himself, and be crushed as a prelude to receiving and appreciating God’s grace, forgiveness, and new life in Christ Jesus.” — Martin Luther

TQ 3635 48<<The book: The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business, by Charles Duhigg; Random House.
The big idea: Habits can be our making or our undoing. Either way, they are powerful. Canny marketers use cues to activate consumer spending habits, and wise leaders create strong institutional habits.
The backstory: New York Times journalist Duhigg has won numerous awards for his reporting.
Your business on autopilot: Duhigg reminds us that business processes and routines are nothing more than habits practiced on an organization-wide scale. If you can get your kids to brush their teeth every night, you can get your employees to provide great customer service.
If you read nothing else: Chapter Four recounts Paul O'Neill's turnaround of aluminum company Alcoa. Duhigg uses the example to illustrate how improving a single habit-;practicing safety, in Alcoa's case-;ripples out to improve an entire organization. If all companies followed Starbucks's lead and trained employees in self-discipline, as described in Chapter Five, customer service and productivity would soar.
Rigor rating: 9 (1=Who Moved My Cheese?; 10=Good to Great). Duhigg interviewed more than 300 scientists and executives and consulted many academic studies. Sixty pages of concluding notes offer a window into the sausage-making process, complete with responses to fact-checking queries.Definitions

I can take a look at this over the weekend. Keen to start looking into some core development.
Comment #3Sam152 CreditAttribution: Sam152 commented
I have run through all the instances of module_exists and replaced with the updated method. I have also removed the deprecated function as per Crells recommendation. It didn't seem to break anything, hopefully it can pass the testbot so it doesn't have to be rerolled too many times.
Comment #4benjy CreditAttribution: benjy commented
Not sure if we are removing the functions at this point. @catch mention in IRC we should leave them.
Updated status for test bot.
Comment #5Sam152 CreditAttribution: Sam152 commented
Here is a version without the deprecated function removed. Either one should work depending on the final decision made in this issue.

I noticed a few places where \Drupal had not been 'use'd, so I will wait for the test results to come back negative and then fix up the individual cases when they arise.
I need to setup the test suite locally.

see for when to use absolute vs relative. It seems if the class is global and the file has a namespace it should be absolute. However if the file does not have a namespace it should be relative.

Yeah, I will manually repeat the work required for this patch as I doubt re-rolling would be very clean either. Will repost and hit up someone on IRC to have it applied quickly after it's creation.

The current patch replaces module_exists() with \Drupal::moduleHandler.
I suggest that this patch broken into two. One part to deal with the procedural code (everything not in a /lib/... directory. And another to do the OO code correctly.
All the changes to procedural code in this patch look great!
What follows is a review of the OO code.

This is just one example from the patch... there are so many more I did not bother to list them all. In tests the simpletest runner has access to the container and therefore we can use
$this->container->get('module_handler')instead of
\Drupal::moduleHandler().

This is in OO code, so shouldn't use \Drupal. There are several examples of this in the patch.
Let's leave it for now, and then remove all the module_* functions together for the meta. It would be good to expand the comment though, to make it clear that it's not going to be around much longer.

Regarding using \Drupal in OO code, the same problem applies in #2055371: Replace all module_invoke_all() deprecated function calls in OO code, where it has been decided to use \Drupal for now, then do propery dependency injection in a later patch. We can do the same here DI is going to be tricky, but at the very least CustomBlockTypeFormController has a $moduleHandler property that we can use (I've not checked the others).

Comment #47ianthomas_uk CreditAttribution: ianthomas_uk commented
Actually, the functions for this meta are all next to each other, so if we remove or edit the docblock on one then it will trigger a reroll for one of the other patches.
Let's just remove the uses, then we can follow up with a quick patch to remove the functions themselves.
We still need a followup to switch to DI.
Comment #48catch CreditAttribution: catch commented
Yes removing uses then separate patch to remove the actual functions is the easiest way to do these - reduces the chance of broken HEAD due to commit conflicts. And the removal patches themselves are much easier to re-roll/roll-back in case of conflicts.

Laura: Hi, everyone! I'm Laura Max and you're watching The BusinessMakers Show, brought to you by Comcast Business; "Built for business." I am here in Kriser's with the owner and founder, Brad Kriser. This is an all natural pet supply store and I am so excited to be here. Welcome to the show, Brad.
Brad: Well, thank you for having me.
Laura: So, tell us a little bit about Kriser's. What is your mission? What do you do here? How many stores do you have all throughout America?
Brad: Kriser's was conceived out of, really, a passion for pets and really wanting to give them the best possible nutrition and the best possible ways to be able to live their life; an "all natural lifestyle" is what we call it.
Laura: Very important for humans and for dogs and cats.
Brad: Absolutely; very, very important. So, what we do is - we wanted to create somewhere that, when you came in, not only is it a place that is nice to shop in and aesthetically pleasing, but with an educational environment, most importantly. So, you can come in and find out what is gonna be best for your pet - for your dog or cat - and put them on the best possible track for a healthy life.
Laura: So, an "educational environment;" that's very interesting 'cause so many of us - we're starting to learn a lot more about our own health and how to take better care of ourselves, how to exercise. When it comes to dogs, I mean, a lot of us are going to Costco and saying, "Oh, look! This is cheap. I'm gonna give it to my dog." Why do we need to stop doing that? And what is it you're offering to help people really give their dogs the best - and cats - the best meals possible?
Brad: Well, I mean, first of all, is we all know pets are a part of the family now. They are -
Laura: Absolutely!
Brad: The amount of pets that actually - 67 percent of people say that their pets sleep, in bed, with them.
Laura: I'm one of those people.
Brad: Exactly! You know? And even higher give gifts for holidays or for birthdays.
Laura: Guilty!
Brad: So, you know, it's really a part of it. So, it's an - there was not a lot of possibilities and options out there, before, to be able to feed your pet -
Laura: No; absolutely.
Brad: - in a "natural lifestyle" and all natural foods. So, now, with that being available and there, and people getting more and more involved in, "What is in my pet's food?" I mean, that's a question that they ask. And there have been numerous issues and things, over the years, with a lot of other mass, commercial brands, that people have said, "I gotta know what I"m feeding my pet because I want them to live - to have a long life."
Laura: Yeah! I mean, our pets are our best friends.
Brad: Absolutely.
Laura: I call my dog before - like the love of my life Hampton Roads.
Brad: We call them "furry family members," "furry kids."
Laura: My "fur baby." I've called him that, as well.
Brad: Yeah, exactly; "fur baby."
Laura: So, how did you get so passionate and so invested in this business? You started this business eight years ago in Chicago?
Brad: Yes.
Laura: And you're now in four states across the US. What - I mean, we all care about our pets but - what made you care this much; that you're helping pets all across US?
Brad: Well, you know, it was one of those - I've always been a life ling pet lover. I had my first dog - I was born and we had cats. And then, my first dog we got when I was six weeks old.
Laura: Wow!
Brad: So, you know, pets have been a part of my life my entire life. And I always actually looked and wanted to. I remember talking to my brother about opportunities and things that we could possibly do with pets. But, it all sounded like it would just be more fun or a hobby rather than a business that could be done.
Laura: Right.
Brad: So, back in 1998, I was loving in Boulder, Colorado. I had just been married and my wife and I moved there. And my cousin introduced me to all natural pet food. I had no idea that it even existed. I thought that a lot of them out there had some fancy names so they must have been good foods. It just really wasn't available. So, I started feeding my pets all natural food and I saw the difference that it was making for them.
Laura: You saw the difference? So, what happened?
Brad: So, they have more vitality. They have less health issues; their skin and coat is better. They mental acuity is better. Just all sorts of things. Basically, what I like to do is think about it in human terms. If you eat well and you eat the way that you're supposed to and take the proper vitamins and eat the proper foods, you're healthier, happier, you have better energy; it completely equates over to the pets.
Laura: It's very true. And we love our pets. We should take care of them. And I have a confession to make. I can't believe I'm telling everyone this but, before the show started, you actually gave me a dog treat.
Brad: I did!
Laura: That I can eat!
Brad: We both ate it, together. Yes!
Laura: We both ate it. I did not wanna eat it, originally. It tastes like a Teddy Graham.
Brad: Yep!
Laura: It has all natural, human ingredients that I would eat. And I can give it to my dog. And, I mean, when you think about it, why would we give them anything else?
Brad: You shouldn't. They should be eating the exact same things that we get so that they can ave a proper health. Unfortunately, in many ways, the old pet food world was built on things that were not really fit for human consumption. And so, that they're able to put it in the pet food now, it's the same foods that go into our tables, into our foods from our shelves in the grocery store, go into these pet foods. And that makes all the difference in the world.
Laura: Well, I'm so glad that you're, sort of, headlining the movement over here in Houston. This is your first store out of two in Houston. Your second one is actually now open.
Brad: Yes it is!
Laura: Recently. And it is in the Tomball/Champions area.
Brad: Yep! It's in the Vintage Marketplace in the Tomball/Champions area. Yes. And very excited to be in Houston. I really do like it.
Laura: Well, congratulations! We're really excited to have you. And, as I mentioned before, you did start this business eight years ago and I love speaking to business owners; that's what we do on "The Businessmakers Show."
Brad: Yep!
Laura: And, something that I read about you which I really loved was that you said, being a business owner and starting your own business, you really have to know who you are and what you stand for; that that's so important in communicating your message. Can you talk a little bit more about that?
Brad: I'm a firm believer in one of those - in that, you have to be able to wake up every single morning and wanna do what you do.
Laura: Mm-hmm.
Brad: For me, it could never be a job; it had to be something that I was passionate about, something that I can really sink my teeth into and something that was also, I felt, a positive impact on the world and on society. And I, truly, do believe and know that we are having a positive impact on society.
Laura: And you can see that success. When somebody's passionate -
Brad: Yes.
Laura: - the money follows. You know?
Brad: Yeah! So, I did those. Woke up in the morning and I wasn't happy in my current position and what I was doing and the job that I had. And I said, "Alright. What do I wanna do?" And so, I said, "I love pets. OK. What can I do with pets that's not just gonna be something that's, maybe, a hobby or doing something that wasn't gonna do?"
Laura: Mm-hmm.
Brad: At that time, I had had my first child. And it was important that I had a career and that. So, I really researched into it and I said, "OK. This is something that I can do." And I started off, in Chicago, opening pet care facilities which had the retail component to it which is where I developed the Kriser's out of. So, that was - it was always all natural pet foods and Kriser's just took the pet foods and the grooming aspects of that business - that also included boarding and daycare and walking services and all sorts of different things - and we brought it into here and then, created a different kind of shopping environment.
Laura: And it turned into so much more than a hobby. You also do grooming here.
Brad: Yes.
Laura: I'll have to take my dog to test it out. It looks great.
Brad: Absolutely!
Laura: So, the pet supply business; it's a very niche business to get into. How is that business doing? And how is Kriser's doing on top of that?
Brad: Well, pet - the pet supply and the pet world is, actually, an extraordinarily large business. It's a 58 billion dollar business which is -
Laura: Wow! I don't think a lot of people would know that.
Brad: No; a lot of people don't know that. And so, it's extraordinarily large. And us; we've been doing fantastic. I mean, we're now up to 25 stores in 4 states. 2013, we had 43 percent revenue increase. And, since, our inception, we've had double digit comp sales.
Laura: OK. So, anyone who wants to get into the pet supply business, it might be a good time to start; right now?
Brad: Oh! It's definitely getting a little bit more challenging to be able to do it. It's a different business than it was when I started, even, in it.
Laura: So, you got in at the right time?
Brad: I think so, yes.
Laura: So, you have 25 stores across the US. A lot of food, a lot of toys coming into these stores; how do you pick them all out?
Brad: You know, it's very important what's in here. What I do is, I actually - every single thing that goes on the shelves in here I hand pick and I approve. So, nothing goes on our shelves unless I've, personally, inspected it. And what we do is, we look for it for the quality in there. So, your dog or cat - unless they have an allergy - they can come in here and freely shop for anything because I've already worried about it for you to make sure that it is the highest quality that it can be. And that is from the food to the treats to the supplements to the toys. Everything is looked over and made sure that it is gonna be best for your pet. So, with our consumables and any of the dog and cat food that we have - for example, there's no corn, there's no wheat, no soy, no byproducts, no artificial colorings, preservatives.
Laura: Amazing!
Brad: So, it's different things that make it so that it's "all natural." And really, truly, "all natural" and not just a term that gets loosely used these days.
Laura: Well, it does get loosely used. And we look for those ourselves. We should have it for our dogs. And we have somebody that we can trust who's doing it for us and all we have to do is come to the store.
Brad: And that is exactly what we're here for.
Laura: That's the goal.
Brad: Yeah.
Laura: Cool. Well, thanks so much for coming on the show today, Brad. It was an honor having you.
Brad: Well, thanks for having me.
Laura: And, if any of you wanna shop at Kriser's All Natural Pet Supplies for your dog or cat, you can find Kriser's on Buffalo Speedway and in Vintage - now in Houston, Texas. You're watching The BusinessMakers Show brought to you by Comcast Business; "Built for business" and I'm your host, Laura Max. We'll see you again, next time. Bye, everyone!It’s one thing to have your account hacked into by an experienced computer hacker. But, what if that hacker happens to be a five-year-old?
When Kristoffer Von Hassel of Ocean Beach, California, couldn’t figure out his father’s Xbox password, he did what most five-years-old probably can’t do, he bypassed the security screen. According to ABC10, he first typed in the wrong password. Then proceeded to type only space keys followed by hitting enter, when shown a password verification screen. This allowed him access to his Dad’s account.
His parents started noticing that he gained access to games he shouldn’t have been able to play, and contacted Microsoft to inform them about the glitch in their security system. The software giant awarded Von Hassel four games, 50 bucks, and a one year subscription to Xbox Live.
“We’re always listening to our customers and thank them for bringing issues to our attention,” the company said in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post. “We take security seriously at Xbox and fixed the issue as soon as we learned about it.”
This isn’t Kristoffer’s first time getting pass a security screen. According to ABC10, he was able to unlock a cell phone by holding down the home key at age one. His father, who happens to work as a computer technician thinks this is awesome. Clearly, the knack for computers runs in the family and it looks like this little guy may have found his calling.
However, as a mom of a three-year-old, I’d be be a bit concerned. It’s obvious that Kristoffer’s parents didn’t intend for him to play these games. I only hope that they take precautions to ensure that this doesn’t happen again.
I’m always trying to take preventative measures in my home. We don’t have Xbox, but Princess does have an iPad with different apps – including Netflix. One day my husband noticed her watching something she wasn’t supposed to. We then changed the settings so that the kids only section would appear. She hasn’t been able to bypass this feature. But after reading about Kristoffer, I wouldn’t be surprised if she eventually figures it out. Kids nowadays are just way too smart for their own good.
What precautions do you take to ensure your kids don’t get into things they’re not suppose.
Kristoffer is very, very clever. I hope when he grows up he’ll use his powers for good.
My son, age 6, is very good at listenting when told he’s not allowed to do something. I realize I’m very lucky and that this probably (most likely) won’t last forever. Also, he asks before using his ipad or playing video games, and our xbox is in the living room, where we will see him playing with it. He’s not at an age where we typically leave him alone for long enough periods of time to break into anything.Hygienist

Our View:
The Brazilian defence sector is set to continue to be one of the most active and open for foreign players, both with regards to imported goods from more established countries, and its relatively unfettered export market. In addition, the government’s emphasis on creating a self-sufficient defence sector over the longer term is resulting in an ever-increasing number of partnerships and joint ventures on various development programmes between Brazilian companies and their foreign peers.
At present, the domestic defence sector is comparatively well developed, particularly with regards to small firearms, ammunition and aerospace products, and relatively diverse. However, the armed forces and police force lack advanced maritime, surveillance and rockets/missile capabilities and are keen to expand these areas. This is not only resulting in a ramping up of imports relating to these segments, (from countries such as France, the US and Russia) but also fostering partnership opportunities, as companies such as Odebrecht and Embraer seek to develop their R&D capabilities via joint ventures (JVs) and development programmes with foreign companies predicated on technology transfers..
Hispaniola Dialogue
The Hispaniola Dialogue promotes dialogue between the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and among Dominicans and Haitians and other interested individuals and groups around the world, to promote the protection of human rights and the reduction of poverty on the island shared by these two nations. The Dialogue is in keeping with WPI's focus on problems that cannot be addressed through approaches within borders alone, but require transnational collaboration.
The project began with WPI Executive Michele Wucker's acclaimed book, Why the Cocks Fight: Dominicans, Haitians, and the Struggle for Hispaniola (Hill & Wang, 1999/2000).
The Hispaniola Dialogue includes a discussion group, founded in 1997 and comprised of approximately 700 scholars, experts, government officials, activists, and individuals. To join, visit the group homepage at
For more information, email wucker@worldpolicy.org.
Border of Lights
Border of Lights is a collective coming together to commemorate, collaborate and continue a legacy of hope and justice. The first Border of Lights was held October 4-6, 2012, at the Dominican-Haitian border at Dajabon, commemorating the 1937 massacre of Haitians that took place there.

"The purpose of this project is twofold: aside from helping advertise the plight of the braceros and helping those who work to help them, I am also very much intent on testing the potential of the web as a new publishing medium and, to some extent, to cultivate new ways of communicating with or even creating our audience," Jon says. "It is my belief that as journalists it is incumbent upon us to explore and exploit new media and ensure that we continue to play an important role in its development."

Before a soccer match last week, the players from a local second-division team, Midland Portland Cement, were told by their coaches to take a dip in the Zambezi River near Victoria Falls.
The intent, the coaches said, was to "cleanse the team of bad spirits." Not a great idea, as it turns out.
"The area where the team was swimming is prohibited because the current is strong," local police official Peter Rodzi told the Harare Chronicle. "The river is also infested with crocodiles and hippos."A perceived threat tweeted at American Airlines ignited the Internet Sunday morning, with thousands of individuals reacting to an online exchange between the airline and the individual who sent the initial message.
The threat was made by a user named Sara with the handle @QueenDemetriax_:

Near the end of the Nebraska-Lincoln 7-9 loss to Iowa State on Saturday, a fan behind me held up his Maverick hat and yelled, "At least we have got a good hockey team in this state!" After jumping out to a 3-0-1 start that includes a tournament championship, a new era in Maverick hockey has begun.
Prior to June (or maybe even October), the name Dean Blais probably didn’t mean much to many people in Omaha. Around the country, he has been building a name in hockey since the 1970s, when he played at the collegiate level. As North Dakota’s head coach from 1994-2004, he went 262-115-33 and led his teams to five regular-season WCHA conference titles, two WCHA championship appearances, seven NCAA tournament appearances, one Frozen Four Runner-Up and two National Championships. Last year, Blais led UHSL expansion team Fargo to a 32-23-5 record, including a trip to the USHL Finals and was named USHL Coach of the Year.
When Blais was hired as UNO’s second-ever head coach, he said he would bring more of an offensive-style of play to the Mavericks. This has proved true so far this season, and has looked great. The team is hustling down the ice, making a lot of passes and taking more shots. They definitely look like a team that’s been practicing together for months.
The battle for goaltender will also be interesting to watch this season. You have senior Jeremie Dupont and redshirt freshman John Faulkner both aiming for the starting position. As a senior, there are high hopes and expectations for Dupont. The attention has shifted to Faulkner, who came out in relief for Dupont in both Icebreaker games. In his two starts at Colgate, Faulkner earned a win and a tie. It should be exciting to see how this plays out.
The Mavericks face Bowling Green (0-4) this weekend. The teams play October 30th at 7:35 p.m. and October 31st at 8:05 p.m. Bowling Green has been outscored 18-6 and outshot 153-95 in their four games. It will be a perfect weekend for the Mavs to continue developing their new style of play.
This year is one of the most anticipated seasons in the history of UNO Hockey. It is great to represent Omaha and the University of Nebraska at Omaha. This year marks the beginning of a journey of unlimited potential and we look forward to sharing that journey with you.
Are you planning on attending the game? If so, give your feedback after or before the game.

Just three couples who have known one another for a few decades. We all used to live in the same community in the Old Country and now we are all here. Only one of the six of us has any real fluency with Hebrew, so watching us try to order dinner with a waitress who spoke little English was like a skit of Kita Bet ulpan on the first day of class. The waitress asked how many people we would be. I said, "shaysh" and she said, "shisha". That was kind of how it went.
Eventually, the food came and the talk turned to the spiritual merits of our lives in Israel. How we feel closer to Hashem here. How praying, even out loud and with our hands raised in a posture of urgent pleading, feels more natural here. How geula feels closer. How Gd's Hand in our daily lives is clearer.
Earlier in the day, I was on a bus on my way to my office in Jerusalem when the Yom HaShoah siren went off. Ironically, my watch was a few minutes slow, so I wasn't expecting it quite then. The driver stopped the bus, shut off the engine, then everyone, and I mean everyone - soldiers in uniform, young children, Russian immigrants, native Israelis, religious men, secular women, old Ethiopians, everyone stood up inside the bus in absolute silence for two minutes of memory.
Please Hashem, redeem your people from the ravages of antisemitism. Let us live in peace in our Land. Bring back those of our people who were killed because they were Jews and also all those whom we have loved. Let us live in a world of truth and of spiritual clarity.
The moment passed. The driver started the engine, the radio came back on, announcing that it was 10:02. I wiped a small tear, reset my watch and thus began another day.
3 comments:
Absolutedly beautifully written. From your mouth to Hashem's ears.
Amen, my friend. Lovely "stam" moments, beautifully shared.
I like the difference in the waitresses here at Home. They understand that we really want to understand and be understood. So rather than just smiling at the quaintness of the "foreigners," they correct us. Next time, you'll say shisha. Hope I'm there for your small triumph. ;-)
So beautiful. I love the little moments in my day.CHOW's "Jelly Shots" recipes
I was going to a Mardi Gras party last night and I thought it might be fun to bring a couple of these:.........
I decided to go with the Sazerac and Hurricane recipes.
The Hurricane Shots: I used cherries without food coloring, which were a bit pale, so I didn't get the nice color variation shown in this picture. Also, I think the picture here was made without the food coloring in the bottom later, because mine weren't this lovely orange, but more or a pink-red color, much like the top layer. Flavor-wise, they came out a little too tart. I followed the recipe exactly, although my oranges were a bit on the tart side. I had tasted and thought it was a bit too tart, but wasn't sure if adding sugar or simple syrup would affect the jelling ability so I left it alone. I wondered if straining the lime pulp would have helped as well, or using less lime juice.
The Sazerac shots: I couldn't get the Peychaud's bitters, so subbed in an orange bitters, which seemed to work fine. I couldn't find white sanding sugar; mine was multicolored, which ended up looking a little muddy after it was mixed with the lemon zest. This recipe doesn't say so, but I think the zest really needs to be left to dry out before being mixed with the sugar. The oils and dampness in the lemon zest didn't seem to do anything good for the sugar.
Both of these recipes are really strong, not what the average person expects from a "Jello shot". I think when people see "Jello Shots" they expect something sweeter and more neutral tasting. I think these shots are a tough sell. They are too intense for the rum and coke set, and the jello shot aspect turns off the craft cocktail snobs who actually could appreciate the flavors. You'd really have to get the right kind of crowd who likes good cocktails but who are able to be a bit more silly and irreverent.
Of the two, the Sazeracs were more popular, although I think the Hurricanes would have gone better if they were sweeter. I don't think anybody who tried these even knew what a Sazerac was, but the people who really liked them were looking forward to trying the actual drink. I have a lot leftover, so now I'm wondering how long they'll keep...
In the end it was fun but all told, I'd rather be drinking an actual Sazerac.

I still have 3/4 of a tray in the fridge... I think I'm jelly shotted out for a while. We're snacking our way through them, and they do come in quite handy as I'm prepping dinner and don't have the time or hands to make a cocktail!
The interesting thing is that they've both mellowed a lot in the fridge. I think letting them sit for a day or two is beneficial in this recipe... I'm not sure why!Free This Blogger!

Autophagy: Scientific Cell CleansAutophagy (‘self-eating’) is a catabolic (breakdown) process used by cells to degrade and remove some of their internal components deemed to be unnecessary or undesirable. Our cells are little factories of a sort‚ and as such they function under many of the same dynamic considerations: Things accumulate and byproducts are produced that can’t do anything‚‚ having misfolded proteins in the secretory parts of the cell factory (an organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum) results in what is known as the 'unfolded protein response‚' a cell-wide stress reaction to these weird proteins. Autophagy is the process by which the cell attempts to rid itself of these misshapen proteins.
In addition to acting as a type of cell cleansing mechanism‚ autophagy is a very old survival tool. Like a factory deprived of raw materials because of a transit strike‚ cells deprived of nutrients will scrounge around the workplace looking under tables and behind cabinets for surplus parts. When deprived of nutrients the cell will begin to breakdown parts of itself to keep going. Much of the time‚ this breakdown is a good thing‚ and perhaps explains why calorie restriction appears to increase lifespan: under those conditions the cell is munching away at itself‚ and since it is no fool‚ a lot of what it munches away at is junk best gotten rid of anyway.
Trehalose.
Enhancing autophagy looks to be a winning strategy when it comes to neurodegenerative problems and maintaining healthy cognition. Slower aging is also associated with increased autophagy. One interesting agent with well-recognized effects on autophagy is the natural disaccharide sugar trehalose. Trehalose is found in many organisms‚ including bacteria‚ yeast‚ fungi‚ insects‚ invertebrates‚ and plants. However humans make very little to no trehalose. It functions to protect the integrity of the cell against various environmental stresses like heat‚ cold‚ desiccation‚ dehydration‚ and oxidation by preventing the disruption of the cell’s protein insides.
Trehalose prevents cells from dehydrating‚ a phenomena that disrupts much of the cell’s insides in ways that are not reparable. Trehalose-treated cells seem to resist this because the trehalose ‘splints’ their inner organelles in place‚ so that when the cells get a chance to rehydrate they come back good-as-new. Dehydrated cells are common with aging‚ as the aging process tends to thin out the cell membrane‚ and now from D'Adamo Personalized Nutrition‚ it is available in dietary supplement form.
Trehalose Complex acts on multiple levels:
- May protect nerves from the destructive forces of aging and environmental toxicity.
- Stimulates the activity of your own neural stem cells.
- Energizes your existing nerves to maximize their functional capacity.
- May improve the activity of the brainWith 1.7 million freelancers, we'll match you with the perfect talent.

When I look into your despairing eyes, I just want to cry
the heaviest tears possible and gift them to the ocean of emptiness
you're holding within, but I must be the stronger person here
and hold you close to the dreams I cannot abandon for instability.
Because I have welcomed pain my entire life but now this cycle
has to end for the grace waving from the sidelines is suggesting
that I no longer skim the future or shed another tear, but simply
move on after whispering goodbye to the slashed parachutes.
And although I'll provide new effort to life, this poetess
will eternally have to view the previously favoured scar on her
left cheekbone when glancing at anyone even remotely resembling
your shadow which is capable of reflecting the undesirable past.
Nevertheless, I won't give in to hypocrisy by eating cherries after this shower
and believing that I can be knocked over with the touch of a feather, rather
I'll make sure that an undetailed one word per line poem is never written into
existence again, thereby proving my determination for you to succeed with me.Cee Lo Green, Nicki Minaj, Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez, the Black Eyed Peas, Rihanna, Lady Antebellum and Taio Cruz are among the performers in the "Billboard Music Awards" (ABC, 8 p.m.), hosted by Ken Jeong live from the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

To kick off a week of reality competition finales, the first comes from would be-presidential candidate Donald Trump, who effectively fired himself from that possibility last week. Time to concentrate on the finale, where the last two left are Marlee Matlin and John Rich, with many of the rest of the season's cast returning to help, but problems when Def Leppard fails to show at a charity concert.

Raise your right hand, please.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give in this deposition proceeding before the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I do.
Mr. ADAMS. Mr. O'Brien, the purpose of this deposition is to get from you your knowledge of the facts surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963.
I would like to start way back, if I may, at the point of the conception of the trip, the origin of the trip. How far back was that before November 22?
Mr. O'BRIEN. My recollection is the contemplation of the trip to Texas was back some, perhaps, months before the actual trip.
However, I should quickly add that many discussions took place about potential trips to all parts of the country at some future time, to some degree in the political context. The President, No. 1, enjoyed getting out to meet the people; and, secondly, over a period of time we had anticipated the President would travel rather extensively when the opportunity presented itself. But the difficulty in pinning anything like that down specifically in advance is the obvious difficulty of scheduling any travel by the President, because of the duties of the office and the obvious day to day changes in the problem.
Mr. ADAMS. But you, yourself, were concerned and involved in discussions looking towards this?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; Mr. O'Donnell was responsible for the handling of the specifics of trips. He would engage in discussions with the President and projections of possible trips of one sort or another. In his role as Appointments Secretary, of course, he was constantly discussing with the President invitation of all kinds that came across his desk.
The Vice President had expressed an interest for some time in a possible trip to Texas.
Mr. ADAMS. Had he expressed that interest to you?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't recall specifically. It became generally understood in our discussions that he was interested, the President was interested, Mr. O'Donnell was charged with the responsibility of maintaining a day to day relationship in this area.
Mr. ADAMS. At that time, what was your official title?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Special Assistant to the President for Congressional Relations.
Mr. ADAMS. Now--
Mr. O'BRIEN. A trip of this nature, as many trips within the United States would involve the inclusion of Members of Congress, appropriate members of the delegation, and what-have-you. So that would be pretty much my involvement in any arrangements for a trip of this nature.
Mr. ADAMS. To put it another way, you did not yourself have the responsibility for the specific planning?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Not at all.
Mr. ADAMS. And were you involved in making--in the discussions which led to the final decision about this Texas trip?
Mr. O'BRIEN. There were some discussions that involved me as to the specific stops on the trip, because there immediately you would have the matter of the congressional districts that would be involved in the stops, and matters of that nature.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you happen to know how it came to pass that Mrs. Kennedy went along on that trip?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I do not. I think Mr. O'Donnell would be the proper person to direct that to.
Mr. ADAMS. Did you have anything to do with the security or protection arrangements for the President?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No.
Mr. ADAMS. Neither on that trip nor at any time?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No.
Mr. ADAMS. This didn't come within your duties at all?
Mr. ADAMS. Now, is it fair to say that the substantial purpose of this trip was political?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I would not say--in my belief it was not the substantial purpose. An invitation that had been extended by the Congressman Albert Thomas dinner committee, and I assume arrangements that were appropriate for that time for a dinner in Austin contributed to the decision on that particular time for this trip. This would be typical of the situation, as I recall it, where you knew there would be an occasion when the President would visit Texas.
He was interested in visiting Texas, as he was other sections of the country. And this sort of fell into line. It presented to some degree an opportunity to make the trip at that time.
He was particularly fond of Congressman Thomas. And he had had a close working relationship with him in the Congress.
I, of course, became very well acquainted with Congressman Thomas, because of my role representing the White House with the Congress. And I am sure that was a contributing factor. He was most interested in attending this dinner to honor him.
Mr. ADAMS. I suppose it would be fair to say that almost any activity of the President is in some measure political.
Mr. O'BRIEN. I would say that is perhaps true.
But he had been interested, also, in having an opportunity to visit the Space Center particularly. And he had watched the development of the space activity in Texas with great interest.
Mr. ADAMS. Now, going back to the time that you left Washington on that trip, did you leave with the President?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I did.
Mr. ADAMS. From the White House?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I did.
Mr. ADAMS. By helicopter?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes.
Mr. ADAMS. And what was the time do you recall?
Mr. O'BRIEN. It was approximately forenoon, about 10:45, from the White House lawn, in the President's helicopter.
Mr. ADAMS. And where did you go in the helicopter?
Mr. O'BRIEN. We went to Andrews Field.
Mr. ADAMS. And did you go onboard Air Force I?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; I did.
Mr. ADAMS. And you went from there to Austin?
Mr. O'BRIEN. We went from there to San Antonio.
Mr. ADAMS. I am sorry. I misspoke myself. San Antonio?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes.
Mr. ADAMS. Arriving in San Antonio about when?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I think you would have to refer to the record on that.
Mr. ADAMS. Some time early afternoon? Some time in the afternoon of that day?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; I remember it was, weatherwise, an uneventful trip. The weather was fine. There is no reason to suggest we didn't arrive at pretty much the established time.
Mr. ADAMS. Then, just briefly, what happened in San Antonio?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Well, there was a motorcade in San Antonio to the Aerospace Center for a ceremony. And, as I recall, the ceremony was relatively brief. The President spoke briefly. And then he inspected the installation.
The overall elapsed time I don't recall--perhaps an hour or an hour and a half.
And then we proceeded back to the airport for the trip to Fort Worth.
Mr. ADAMS. What happened in Fort Worth?
Mr. O'BRIEN. In Fort Worth, as I recall, at the airport there was--from the airport into the hotel in Fort Worth, it was rather a lengthy trip. It also involved crowds at various stops.
The hour--I am sorry I cannot recall the hour of arrival--but it was, as we say, an offbeat hour. It was rather surprising to have the interest shown crowdwise as we went in. It delayed the motorcade into the hotel and outside of the hotel there was a large crowd of people.
Mr. ADAMS. What was the reaction of that crowd? Was that a friendly group?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I would describe it as friendly; yes.
Mr. ADAMS. Then what happened next, after you arrived at the hotel?
Mr. O'BRIEN. The President and his party checked into the hotel for the night. I do not recall any other official activity.
Mr. ADAMS. And what happened next?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Well, the following morning the President arose early to attend a breakfast. As I recall, it was a civic breakfast, sponsored by the local civic group or groups.
Mr. ADAMS. Did Mrs. Kennedy attend that, also, as you recall?
Mr. O'BRIEN. She arrived at the breakfast, as I recall, following the President. The President spoke at the breakfast, and received gifts, and Mrs. Kennedy received a gift. I recall one of the gifts to the President was a Stetson. I recall that he did not try it on, but he appreciated receiving it.
Following the breakfast, he then spoke to a large crowd in front of the hotel, in the parking area opposite the hotel. There had been indications of bad weather. There was some rain, and then the rain became intermittent.
Upon completing his speech in the parking area, he returned upstairs to await the normal departure time.
When that time arrived, I went downstairs ahead of the President and Mrs. Kennedy, and the Secret Service were determining whether or not they would have the top up or down on the car, because there was still an occasional drop of rain. However, a few minutes elapsed, and it appeared the weather would stay good for the drive to the airport. So he left, to the best of my recollection--I feel sure of this--in an open car to the airport from the hotel.
Mr. ADAMS. While we are on that subject, just to digress for a moment, what was his attitude toward riding in open cars?
Mr. O'BRIEN. It was certainly his preference. He had always expressed a view that in our democracy a President should, whenever possible, be exposed to the people. And I think, also, he felt the people should be exposed to him. He always wanted to have the closest possible contact with people. And in that context his preference certainly at all times was an open car.
Mr. ADAMS. And these preferences were expressed to you personally?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Not in the context of this particular situation.
Mr. ADAMS. No; I mean through the years.
Mr. O'BRIEN. But certainly we were totally aware of his desires in that area. And this had, of course, been his position not only in the United States but in trips outside the country.
Mr. ADAMS. Did he have--did he ever happen to express any particular view to you about motorcades, in terms of security?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I cannot recall any discussion I had with him in that regard.
Mr. ADAMS. Generally speaking, what was his position as expressed to you about security?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I cannot recall any specific conversation in that area. There may have been. But certainly it was not of sufficient substance to be of any importance.
Mr. ADAMS. More specifically, did you ever discuss with him the possibility of assassination?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I did not.
Mr. ADAMS. Did you ever discuss it with Mrs. Kennedy?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I did not.
Mr. ADAMS. Well, I took you off the track there. We will come back to Fort Worth, now, if we may.
When we left we were discussing his concluding his talk and going out to the airport in Fort Worth.
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; there were, as I recall it, some bands en route. There was a great deal of excitement, enthusiasm. The weather had cleared. And it was a thoroughly pleasant trip out to the airport. The President obviously enjoyed it.
When we arrived at Air Force I, he commented that that certainly had been a very interesting and pleasant morning.
Mr. ADAMS. And you went with him on Air Force I?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is correct.
Mr. ADAMS. To Dallas--arriving late in the morning?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I would estimate our arrival time at Dallas perhaps around 11:45. I know that we anticipated the motorcade through the streets of Dallas at the noon hour.
Mr. ADAMS. Did you yourself have anything to do with the planning of that motorcade?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I did not.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you-----
Mr. O'BRIEN. With the exception of insuring the inclusion in the motorcade of the Members of Congress and Senator Yarborough, that they be properly handled so that they would be included in open cars in the motorcade.
Mr. ADAMS. And it was part of your responsibility to see that--what cars they got into and all those arrangements?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I would not say specifically that. They would have their car assignments. But for the most part, it was, if anything went wrong in the arrangements at some point, I would then be able to have a staff man correct it. So I would keep a close eye on the congressional people traveling with the President on a trip of that nature to be sure that they were well taken care of.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you know when the information about the precise route was released to the press?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I do not.
Mr. ADAMS. Was there any thought--I withdraw that one, and ask you this: Do you know how it came about that Dallas was chosen as one of the cities to visit?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't recall specifically, except that the size of the city, the concentration of population, would make it an obvious stop in Texas, if you were going to be in the State for 2 or 2 1/2 days. It is rather an obvious decision, that the Dallas area would be one of the stops.
Mr. ADAMS. As far as you know, there was never any consideration given to omitting Dallas?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I do not recall any.
Mr. ADAMS. Well, we are back now at Love Field. Would you tell us what happened there, as far as you observed it?
Mr. O'BRIEN. The President moved over to the fence, where a large crowd had gathered and shook the hands of several in the crowd, as the motorcade was awaiting his departure. All those in the motorcade proceeded to get into their cars. There was the usual amount of minor confusion--people hustling around to locate their car number, and I stood watching the President engaged in this activity, until he had gotten into his car, and a quick observation indicated to me that all those traveling with us had gotten into their cars.
I came very close, however, to being left at Love Field, because I delayed a little longer than I normally would, observing the scene, and, consequently, I had to make a little dash, myself, to hop into a car, to insure that I would travel into town.
Mr. ADAMS. When the President was greeting people along the fence there, was he accompanied by Mrs. Kennedy?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is my recollection.
Mr. ADAMS. And do you recall at that time what the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson were doing?
Mr. O'BRIEN. They were engaged in the same activity, as I recall it.
Mr. ADAMS. I think you said this was a large crowd.
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; it appeared to be a large crowd. The difficulty in judging a crowd from the ground at an airport is obvious. But as we came down the steps of the plane, looking out over the crowd. I had the impression that it was a large crowd for an airport stop, considering the fact the President was about to travel through the heart of the city.
Mr. ADAMS. Was it a friendly crowd?
Mr. O'BRIEN. It appeared to be friendly.
Mr. ADAMS. Now, getting to the motorcade, what was its organization, as you recall it, in terms of what cars at what places?
Mr. O'BRIEN. As I recall it, following the usual police grouping in the front and sides, the President's car, Secret Service car, the Vice President's car, additional Secret Service car, wire service cars--I would think there probably were two---the VIP cars followed, and then following those cars, which was rather a long line of them, as I recall, were, I believe, one or two buses containing the press, traveling press.
Mr. ADAMS. When you refer to the VIP cars, those would include the Congressmen and the other gentlemen you referred to before?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is right, Senator Yarborough was in the car with the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson. The members of the congressional delegation traveling with us at that point were then in open cars--I would think there were perhaps four open cars to accommodate them.
Mr. ADAMS. Which one were you in?
Mr. O'BRIEN..
Mr. ADAMS. Do you know who the driver was?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I do not.
Mr. ADAMS. Now, would you say that between you and the Vice President's followup car, there was more than one open car? As I get it--to put it another way to perhaps refresh your recollection--there was the Vice President's car, then there was a followup car behind that, and then came, as you have recalled, the open cars, in which you were seated in one of them.
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes.
Mr. ADAMS. Now, were you in the one directly behind the Vice President's followup car, or farther back?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I do not believe I was in the first VIP car, because, as I stated when I looked around and the motorcade started to move slightly, I moved toward a car handy to me. I would think that I was in the second or conceivably third open car, because, at that time, we had approximately 10 or 12 members of the Texas congressional delegation, and obviously we, therefore, had perhaps four open cars. I don't recall that I was in the first one--it was the second or third. I was not in the last one, either.
Mr. ADAMS. Were you assigned to a particular car, or would you just have taken any that would happen to be available?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I am sure I was assigned to a particular car. As a rule, I would be assigned to the first VIP car--VIP meaning as a rule, again, a congressional delegation. And in this instance, I don't recall the actual car assignment. And it was not unusual for me to not adhere strictly to the assignment.
Mr. ADAMS. And as the motorcade left Love Field--let me withdraw that and put it this way: You were seated in the back?
Mr. O'BRIEN. On the right back.
Mr. ADAMS. On the right-hand side?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is correct.
Mr. ADAMS. From where you were seated in that car, as you proceeded toward the city, could you see the President in his car?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Only occasionally. There were occasions when you could not see him. Other times, depending on the turns in the road, and what-have-you, you would get a view of him. And there were times when he was upright in the car, and you could spot him.
But, generally speaking, I would say that I was concentrating on crowd attitude and size for the most part, going in toward the city.
Mr. ADAMS. From what you could see of the President's car, where was he seated?
On the right-hand side or the left-hand side?
Mr. O'BRIEN. As I looked toward the car, he was seated on the right, with Governor Connally seated directly in front of him.
Mr. ADAMS. That is right. And Mrs. Connally
Mr. O'BRIEN. Mrs. Connally on the jump seat in front of Mrs. Kennedy.
Mr. ADAMS. As the motorcade proceeded, could you at all times see the Vice President's car?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; similarly, the photographers and others would often times block the view. The view of the President's car and the Vice President's car from where I was seated during the motorcade into and through the downtown Dallas was not a clear view. There was an obstructed view for the most part.
Mr. ADAMS. As you recall it, what were the seating arrangements in the Vice President's car?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I know that Senator Yarborough, Mrs. Johnson, and the Vice President were seated in the rear of the car, and my recollection is that again the Vice President was on the right, Mrs. Johnson in the middle, Senator Yarborough on the left.
Mr. ADAMS. Now, as you went on in town, tell me about the crowds, if you would.
Mr. O'BRIEN. The crowds were large, unusually large for an extremely long--mileagewise---long trip into the city. I was impressed with the size of the crowd. The comment in our car, however, was that the crowd was rather reserved. As a matter of fact, Congressman Rogers, who, as I told you, was on the left rear, commented and called out from time to time in a jocular vein, "Hello", "Howdy", and suggested to them that they ought to smile and look perky, which we felt they were not doing during the course of the trip from the airport to the outskirts of the business area.
Mr. ADAMS. Up to that point, I suppose it was chiefly residential areas that you passed through?
Mr. O'BRIEN. It seemed to be residential, and a great deal of small industry. The crowd looked to me to be middle to upper class business type to a great extent.
Mr. ADAMS. Did you know the city of Dallas yourself?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I did not.
Mr. ADAMS. Had you been there before?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I had not.
Mr. ADAMS. Then as you got into the city, what was the nature of the crowds?
Mr. O'BRIEN. There was a tremendous change in crowd attitude, which, again, we commented on in the car. It seemed as though it occurred suddenly, but yet nevertheless in retrospect it did grow as you approached the business center. Then you found yourself going down a road, on both sides high buildings, confetti, the crowds out in the street, allowing just a narrow lane for the motorcade. And I would have to describe that crowd as enthusiastic. In fact, perhaps I should say wildly enthusiastic.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you remember any special incidents of any kind on the way into town?
Mr. O'BRIEN. On rare occasion you saw a Goldwater sign, or some sign of that nature, conservative sign, I guess, but not many. It was not an unusual situation, as I recall.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you remember the motorcade stopping at anytime?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I recall the motorcade stopping, and it seems to me it was for the purpose of the President greeting some school children. However, I am not clear in my mind. I do recall a slowdown or an actual stopping on at least one occasion, and perhaps more than one occasion, between the airport and downtown Dallas. And I should add that those in the car in which I rode, to a man, commented on the great enthusiasm of the crowds in downtown area. I think they were making reference to it particularly because there was somehow or other--we all concluded this was a comparison that could be made with the crowds we had just gone by.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you recall the motorcade passing down Main Street in Dallas?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; I do.
Mr. ADAMS. And then do you recall it turning off Main Street?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; I do.
Mr. ADAMS. And then around onto Elm Street? You might not remember the names.
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't recall the name of the street. But I recall distinctly a right turn.
Mr. ADAMS. And then another swerving turn?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is right.
Mr. ADAMS. At that point, were there a lot of buildings or only a few?
Mr. O'BRIEN. It seemed that when we made the turn off the Main Street, that the crowds petered out. It was a very normal termination of a parade route. And we just felt that while there were people on the streets, it was not the massive crowd that we had just passed over several blocks. And I believe that my reaction was this is about the end of the parade route, and we were about to just sort of settle back. There were people still on the street, but you could see that this route was--this parade route was about to terminate.
Mr. ADAMS. And as you came around those turns, did you hear any shots fired?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; I did.
Mr. ADAMS. Would you tell me as best you can whether at that time you could see the President's car?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I could not.
Mr. ADAMS. Was that because your car had not turned the corner yet?
Mr. O'BRIEN. As I recall, our car was about to make that turn, and it would seem to me, therefore, the President's car was in the process of making the left turn. I would think that approximately the time he was swinging on this curving left, we were swinging out of Main Street right. We heard the shots very clearly.
Mr. ADAMS. How many shots did you hear?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Three.
Mr. ADAMS. Can you estimate for me the time interval between the first and the last shot?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't believe I can estimate the timing, but I can tell you about an exchange that took place in the car, from the first shot through the third shot.
Mr. ADAMS. Please do.
Mr. O'BRIEN. The first shot was fired. I just didn't conclude it was rifle fire. I was completely unsure. And I must have almost immediately said to the driver--I directed the question to him, for some unknown reason--"What was that?" The driver replied, "I do not know. They must be giving him a 21-gun salute." By the time the driver had concluded that sentence, we did not hear explosion No. 4. And it was apparent to us that No. 1 was not a 21-gun salute. I believe everyone in the car concluded it wasn't, in any event, because it just was not that kind of a sound. And we just had no idea of what had occurred at that moment.
Mr. ADAMS. Could you tell me your best recollection as to where the sounds appeared to come from?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I didn't have any idea specifically on the location of the sounds, and I do not recall that anyone in the car did.
Mr. ADAMS. Is it your recollection that these sounds were evenly spaced?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is my impression. As I say, I apparently immediately engaged the driver in conversation after the first shot which forces me to conclude that there had to be a time between the first and second and third shots--because I simply-- describing the exchange of my question and his answer, and his answer, I must say, probably was completed after the third shot. But he had started his answer to the question at about or just before the third shot.
Mr. ADAMS. Well, one way of getting at the time interval of all three shots, I suppose, would be your recollection that it all was encompassed in the time it took you to ask the question and the driver to answer.
Mr. O'BRIEN. At least in the time that it took me to ask the question and the driver to initiate the answer, but perhaps not complete it.
Mr. ADAMS. Then would it be fair to say it was a very small number of seconds?
Mr. O'BRIEN. It certainly would be. And I think the driver completed his answer--for 1 or 2 seconds all of us in the car were awaiting the fourth explosion, if I can term it that, which did not occur, and there was dead silence in the car.
Mr. ADAMS. Then do you remember anything that anyone said immediately following the dead silence?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I do not recall. I recall that just prior to this, which indicates to me that perhaps we had turned that corner before the shots, Judge Thornberry pointed to a building and said that that was where his offices had been located at one time, either in military service or in government service, and pointing over in the direction of the building. We were turning the corner--and that took place before the shots.
Mr. ADAMS. You don't happen to know the name of that building?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't recall. But he mentioned it in the term that he had been stationed in that building. Now, it could have been either a military activity or in government agency activity.
Mr. ADAMS. How did the knowledge come to you that the President had been shot?
Mr. O'BRIEN. We noted, as the cars continued to move after the third shot, and there was a great deal of movement on both sides in front of us, scurrying in various directions.
Mr. ADAMS. Scurrying by whom?
Mr. O'BRIEN. People on the street--the crowds had thinned out. There were people along the road.
Mr. ADAMS. We didn't specifically cover this, but was there a motorcycle escort?
Mr. O'BRIEN. For the motorcade?
Mr. ADAMS. Yes; around the President's car.
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes.
Mr. ADAMS. Did that motorcycle escort extend as far back as your car?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; it did not.
Mr. ADAMS. I interrupted you there. You were telling me how this knowledge came to you, that something serious had happened.
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't think even up to that point, as the motorcade started to move out in front of us, as each car seemed to move out from great speed, we were at all aware of--certainly we had no idea of the specific nature of the occurrence. And we just were, I think you would have to describe, very confused. I remember particularly a Negro man with a youngster in his arms running up the slope of the lawn.
Mr. ADAMS. On which side of the car?
Mr. O'BRIEN. On the right. And that was typical of all kinds of movement, as we tried to determine what had occurred, and we just didn't know.
Mr. ADAMS. Did you have any radio communication in your car with the front cars?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; we did not. At that point, a photographer--we started to move a little more rapidly. Our driver intended to follow the motorcade and move out. The motorcade moved out with great speed in front of us. And a photographer jumped on the trunk of our car--it was a convertible--holding onto the edge of the seat, and pounding his fist on the trunk, and obviously in a most excited state. We did not get anything coherent from him. I do not think we really attempted to, because at that point, as he hung onto our car, obviously to try and keep up with the motorcade himself, our car moved out with great speed.
The driver lost sight of the car in front of him in a matter of two or three minutes. He had no idea where the motorcade was headed. And they, therefore, proceeded to take us directly along the highway, passed the trade mart, which was to be the location of the President's stop and speech following the parade route.
We pulled up in front of the motorcade, slowed down, and someone called out, "He has been shot, he is draped over the back seat." And at that point the driver concluded that perhaps his destination should be the nearest hospital. And he started to move out with great speed toward this hospital. And as we came closer to it, it became obvious that that was our destination, because then you saw the cars, the motorcycle police, and what-have-you. As we arrived at the hospital, there was a great deal of commotion at the front.
Mr. ADAMS. I think you misspoke yourself. You said you pulled up in front of the motorcade. I think perhaps you meant to say you pulled up in front of the trade mart.
Mr. O'BRIEN. Trade mart--I am sorry.
Mr. ADAMS. Now, just to make it perfectly clear, did you see the President or Governor Connally at the moment that they were shot?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I did not.
Mr. ADAMS. How long would you think it took you to go from the point where you heard the shots to the hospital?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I would say overall it could approach 15 minutes.
Mr. ADAMS. And what was your estimate of the rate of speed of your car?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I would say 60 to 70 miles an hour.
Mr. ADAMS. When you arrived at the hospital, what did you do?
Mr. O'BRIEN. When I arrived at the hospital, two of the Congressmen that had been in the motorcade, obviously, therefore, in a car ahead of my car, because they had arrived, came over to the car as we pulled up, and asked me to follow them immediately. There was a large crowd--I will correct that--there were many people in front of the entrance to the hospital, and the entrance was being guarded by police.
Congressman Thomas and Congressman Brooks went up to the officers at the door and said, "This is a Special Assistant to the President. Let him in." So he immediately opened the doors, and I went through, with the two Congressmen, who asked a hospital attendant inside the corridor the direction in which to go. There was a little confusion in the corridor as to direction, and we headed at first in the wrong direction, and were again rerouted. And in a matter, however, of a couple of minutes from the entrance of the hospital, arrived behind these swinging doors with glass panels, and my first--I saw to my right sitting--yes--sitting in a chair, and to my left, in this corridor sitting in a similar chair--to my right Mrs. Kennedy, to my left Mrs. Connally.
Mr. ADAMS. You didn't go in through the emergency entrance, then? You went through----
Mr. O'BRIEN. Apparently not. I am not sure of the entrance. But I just don't know. I assume that was not the emergency entrance.
Mr. ADAMS. And you said that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Connally were sitting there more or less together?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No. They were sitting--obviously chairs had been placed outside the door in each instance one door to the left as you walked through these swinging doors with the glass panels--one door to the left that was closed, one door to the right that was closed. And outside of the door--this was a fairly wide corridor that ran down perhaps through three rooms on each side, these first two rooms right and left, the President had been placed in the emergency room to the right and Governor Connally in the emergency room to the left. Both doors were closed at that moment.
Mr. ADAMS. Was there anyone with Mrs. Kennedy at the time?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Mr. Powers and Mr. O'Donnell were standing there.
Mr. ADAMS. Were you accompanied all the way up to this point by the two Congressmen you mentioned before?
Mr. O'BRIEN. The two Congressmen did not go through the doors with me. They left me at some point several feet from the doors, when it was determined that I was being taken to the right location.
Mr. ADAMS. Now, at that point, you knew that--from the Congressmen and from others, that the President had been shot?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is correct.
Mr. ADAMS. Then did you go up to Mrs. Kennedy or Mrs. Connally, or what did you do then?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I immediately engaged Mr. O'Donnell and Mr. Powers in conversation.
Mr. ADAMS. Can you recall that conversation?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Neither Mr. Powers or Mr. O'Donnell had a clear idea of the situation at the moment, but Mr. O'Donnell certainly gave me a positive indication that there was little or no chance.
Mr. ADAMS. Did you have any conversation with Mrs. Kennedy at that point?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I did not have any conversation other than attempting to comfort her, asking her if there was anything we could do---brief moments of that nature. But conversation was extremely limited.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you know where the Vice President was at that time?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I did not see the Vice President in the hospital. I was given to understand by Mr. O'Donnell he was down the corridor--again, if I did an about face, headed across in the other direction--that he was in a room across the hall.
Mr. ADAMS. How long did you stay there?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Until the President was taken from the hospital.
Mr. ADAMS. You stayed there with Mrs. Kennedy?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is right.
Mr. ADAMS. During that whole time?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is right. During that period General McHugh at one point, Malcolm Kilduff from the press staff from time to time came in and out, Mrs. Lincoln, Dr. Burkley came in and out from time to time.
Mr. ADAMS. Was Dr. Burkley also in the emergency room?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't recall.
Mr. ADAMS. Now----
Mr. O'BRIEN. As we stood there, they moved equipment, heavy emergency equipment into the emergency room, and there was a great deal of what you would just envision--scurrying around of nurses and doctors, a great deal of activity.
Mr. ADAMS. Did you go into the emergency room yourself?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I did not.
Mr. ADAMS. Taking it from the point that you arrived there in the corridor where Mrs. Kennedy was seated, how long a time passed before it came to your knowledge that the President was dead?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I cannot recall the length of time I had with specific knowledge. My impression is I had perhaps at the outset in the first seconds or minutes, I had some doubt this had occurred.
I think perhaps what happened is that it penetrated, without a specific statement by anyone. I just had to conclude this had occurred, and it became obvious. At that point, however, Mr. Powers, Mr. O'Donnell, and I were not at all sure that this had penetrated with Mrs. Kennedy for a few minutes.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you remember anything about a priest?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; I do. I recall that Mr. O'Donnell told me that he had asked the staff, or it might have been a Secret Service man, or hospital staff person--in any event--someone to immediately secure a priest. There was no priest on the premises. And he had assumed perhaps a priest was en route, because by that time the knowledge that something serious had occurred certainly had become known through police radio and what-have-you.
But the priest arrived in a relatively short time. I don't know the specific time. But it didn't seem to be an awful long time. And, as a matter of fact, my recollection is that a second priest arrived, and then a third priest.
Mr. ADAMS. And you don't know who they were?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I do not.
Mr. ADAMS. During this interval, between the time that you arrived where Mrs. Kennedy was seated and the time it was officially determined that the President was dead, do you recall any conversation with Mrs. Kennedy?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No conversation other than, "Is there anything we can do for you?" Or a conversation of that nature in very brief and occasional sentences--no conversation as such.
Mr. ADAMS. Did Mr. Powers stay with you all that time?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; he did.
Mr. ADAMS. Mr. O'Donnell?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes.
Mr. ADAMS. Did there come a time when Mr. O'Donnell left?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Mr. O'Donnell, at one point we discussed the situation--and Mr. O'Donnell at one point determined that he should cross the corridor and advise the Vice President of what the situation appeared to be at that moment. And as I recall, it was the conclusion that this was an extremely serious matter, we hadn't any formal advice or official advice on the situation, but the seriousness of it should be imparted to the Vice President.
He left briefly for that purpose, I assume, and returned to the position where we had been standing.
Mr. ADAMS. How did it come officially to your notice that the President was dead?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Again, I just don't know- It was a matter of standing for what seemed to be an interminable period of time I have no idea the specific time and, again, I cannot recall a specific instance when an announcement was made. It was more just finally having what gradually became obvious penetrate with you, it was, that it was an actuality.
Mr. ADAMS. How was the fact conveyed to Mrs. Kennedy. Do you remember that?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't remember a specific conversation by anyone with her. People came to her, hospital staff people, doctors from time to time that would lean down and whisper to her. I don't know whether at one of those occasions this was specifically stated. I think, again, perhaps it was just gradually we all came to a conclusion.
Mr. ADAMS. Well, at any rate, after the fact was--had, as you well put it, had penetrated, what happened next, as far as you know?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Our concern, in our discussions--Mr. O'Donnell and I discussed what should be done. Our major concern was that obviously you just could not leave Mrs. Kennedy sitting in this chair, drenched in blood. Something certainly had to take place.
In that context, we felt steps should be taken to remove the President from the hospital. And someone, either Mr. Powers or Mr. O'Donnell, had suggested at one point during the several minutes, that Mrs. Kennedy might want to retire to a room a couple of doors down the corridor. Our attempt to bring this about was not successful, because she started to walk and then turned around and said, "I want to stay with him." And she went back to the chair.
Mr. O'Donnell, at a point in these proceedings, issued the directions to the Secret Service to secure a coffin. As I recall it, the coffin arrived in a very reasonable time. Whoever handled those arrangements certainly did it--carried out his responsibility well, because. again, time had a way of going on, and it is hard to determine a matter of minutes. But the coffin arrived, in any event, and was wheeled into the room.
Mr. ADAMS. Did Mr. O'Donnell leave at this point--did he leave Mrs. Kennedy and go somewhere else, do you recall?
Mr. O'BRIEN. He, as I recall, again, went to the room in which the Vice President was waiting, to tell him specifically that the President had died, and to discuss with him the steps to move the Vice President out of the hospital and to the airport and on to Washington.
Mr. ADAMS. Did Mr. O'Donnell come back and tell you about that discussion?
Mr. O'BRIEN. He came back and told me that he had advised the President, and he had had a discussion with the President. And I don't remember any of the details of it.
Mr. ADAMS. That covered two basic points--that President Kennedy's body was to be removed from the hospital forthwith, and the other was that the Vice President was to return to Washington?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is right.
Mr. ADAMS. What were the reasons that led to the decision, if you know, that the Vice President would return to Washington?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I believe it was in the context of the death of the President, what steps, if any, were necessary for the Vice President to assume the responsibility of the office forthwith, and our great concern about the situation in which Mrs. Kennedy was being left in this corridor, without any plan for taking care of her. So I think the basic idea was to leave the hospital.
Mr. ADAMS. Was there any discussion as to whether there might or might not be some general conspiracy?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Not with me.
Mr. ADAMS. Now--
Mr. O'BRIEN. I must add, however, that during the course of this, that none of us had any knowledge of actually what had occurred. And I am sure that some of us gave thought to what might still occur. We just had no idea. And we felt that certainly the first step was the protection of the new President and the taking care of Mrs. Kennedy as best we could. We tried to give some clarity of thoughts to the steps that were necessary.
Mr. ADAMS. Now, you discussed these problems with Mr. O'Donnell and Mr. Powers, I suppose.
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes.
Mr. ADAMS. And anyone else?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't believe so.
Mr. ADAMS. I will take you back to the point where the coffin arrived. What happened then?
Mr. O'BRIEN. The coffin was wheeled into the emergency room. At that point, a man arrived on the scene who, I assume, was the coroner, or someone representing the coroner's office. I do not know his name. And he stated that the President could not be taken from the hospital.
Mr. ADAMS. Was this in Mrs. Kennedy's presence?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I recall this conversation took place just outside those swinging doors with the glass panels. And I would--I believe, therefore, that she did not hear this conversation.
Mr. ADAMS. Now, at the time the coffin was wheeled into the emergency room, what did Mrs. Kennedy do? Did she enter at that time, or at any time, so far as you recall?
Mr. O'BRIEN. My recollection is that she did enter the room, but I don't recall it was at that time, and I am not sure what specific time.
Mr. ADAMS. Well, going back to this official who said the body could not be removed--you were present at that time with Mr. O'Donnell and Mr. Powers?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes.
Mr. ADAMS. And what happened with respect to that discussion?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Well, Dr. Burkley, the President's physician, entered into that discussion. And as I recall he and this official went into a little room just outside these doors and carried on further discussion that seemed to involve members of the hospital staff and others. And the discussion went on for a period of several minutes. Burkley---Dr. Burkley was quite exercised. It was apparent that this fellow was not going to---he was going to be adamant in his position. And very soon another official arrived on the scene that was described to me as a judge.
Mr. ADAMS. Does the name Brown refresh your recollection?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't know as I heard his name. But he was then described, as the judge--a judge, and the indication was that he, therefore, was in a higher position of authority than the other official that had been carrying on this discussion with Dr. Burkley.
He was equally adamant. The reference was made, either specifically by him or by someone in the official group, that this had to be treated as just another homicide, and that no other--no special considerations could be given to the problem. That, of course, increased our concern about Mrs. Kennedy, who said she would not leave her husband, and that we could envision Mrs. Kennedy in that state in the hospital for hours or even longer. So, therefore, it was our determination that the President should be taken from the hospital.
Mr. ADAMS. This was the determination of you, Mr. O'Donnell, and Dr. Burkley?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is right.
Mr. ADAMS. Then what happened?
Mr. O'BRIEN. The casket was brought out from the emergency room, wheeled out through these two folding doors. And the members of the Secret Service gathered around it. They had made a determination on their own as to the exit. An ambulance was waiting. Preparations had been made by the Secret Service to accomplish this. And we all--Mr. O'Donnell, Mr. Powers and I, General McHugh, and two or three members of the Secret Service proceeded to push the coffin down this corridor.
My recollection is that objections were still being raised by some or all officials. My recollection is also that we paid little heed to it.
Mr. ADAMS. These were vigorous objections, I gather.
Mr. O'BRIEN. I would say they were. And the only very minor problem that occurred in reaching the exit was that the priest who was third in point of arrival was still present. The other two priests had departed after expressing their condolences to Mrs. Kennedy. But this priest was standing in the corridor and was rather insistent that he formalize some prayers at that point. And I suggested to him that he step aside. Our concern still was whether or not there was going to be an effective block put in our way.
Mr. ADAMS. And who accompanied Mrs. Kennedy at that time?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I believe in the grouping behind the casket that at one time Mr. O'Donnell, another time me, and another time perhaps Mr. Powers--but among us we escorted her along.
Mr. ADAMS. Then when you finally got the casket out through this corridor, and got it into the ambulance, how did you go to the airport?
Mr. O'BRIEN. In a car that was parked alongside the ambulance. The driver in the car--Mrs. Kennedy went into the ambulance. And Mr. O'Donnell, Mr. Powers, and I went into the back seat of this car.
Mr. ADAMS. Was this a police car?
Mr. O'BRIEN. It was an official car of some sort.
Mr. ADAMS. At that time do you know whether or not the Vice President had left the hospital?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I do not know.
Mr. ADAMS. Had he arrived at Love Field by the time you got out there?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes.
Mr. ADAMS. And what happened when you arrived at Love Field?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Well, again the Secret Service and those of us in the official party that had arrived at the field--I guess specifically again the three of us-- helped to move the coffin up the steps of the plane. It was a difficult job because the steps, of course, were the normal set of stairs for a plane, and, therefore, it was too narrow to accomplish this without some difficulty. But it was brought onto the plane.
At that point I.
Mrs. Kennedy came aboard and was seated in the remaining two seats at a table to the left in the rear compartment, and Mrs. Johnson and the President went over to her.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you know how it came to pass that the President was sworn in at that time?
Mr. O'BRIEN. The President and Mrs. Johnson, after a brief discussion with Mrs. Kennedy, went into the Presidential compartment--I guess that is the best way to describe that section of the plane this would be where the President's chair and desk are located. He asked Mr. O'Donnell to join him..
So while we awaited the arrival of the judge, the President, Mr. O'Donnell and I, joined by Mrs. Johnson, after a couple of minutes, sat at this table with the four seats, and just discussed the fact that the departure would take place immediately following the swearing in ceremony. And during that period we briefly discussed the first step of the President to insure continuity, and either just before the swearing-in or immediately following it, the President discussed with Mr. O'Donnell and me his desire that we stay, as he put it, shoulder to shoulder with him.
The judge arrived----
Mr. ADAMS. During that interval, who was staying with Mrs. Kennedy?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Mrs. Kennedy had at that point gone into the restroom adjacent to the bedroom in the compartment.
The judge arrived in minutes. And it was suggested that those in the---I guess the best way to describe it--the front of the plane, those who could move into the compartment, including those representing the press, a single photographer was brought aboard. The wording of the oath was available. The judge took her position. The President said that he certainly wanted Mrs. Kennedy with him at this moment. I went to the bedroom. The door to the adjoining rest-room was closed. I went out and asked Mrs. Lincoln if she would see if Mrs. Kennedy was available. She went in and came out with Mrs. Kennedy, and she took her place to the President's left, Mrs. Johnson to the President's right, the others grouped around. I stood behind the judge, and just as the judge was to start the ceremony, a member of the crew handed me a small Bible in a white box. I took the Bible from the box, interrupted the judge just momentarily, and handed her the Bible. She completed the ceremony.
Then everyone immediately settled down. The judge departed from the plane, the photographer from the plane. Everyone settled down, and we took off without further delay.
Mr. ADAMS. As a matter of detail, do you happen to know what happened to the Bible?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I do not know.
Mr. ADAMS. The plane then departed immediately?
Mr. O'BRIEN. That is correct.
Mr. ADAMS. And----
Mr. O'BRIEN. Mr. O'Donnell and I went to the rear compartment where we joined Mr. Powers and General McHugh. Mrs. Kennedy was seated in one of the two chairs. Mr. O'Donnell took the other chair. The three of us stood. The plane took off. And we remained with Mrs. Kennedy for the duration of the trip to Washington.
We consulted, or were consulted by General Clifton and Mr. Moyers on two or three occasions during the trip, on arrangements for the President's activity upon arrival here in Washington. One suggestion was made that we---that they call in for a meeting of the White House staff. But that was discarded as impractical at this point. Arrangements were made, however, which Mr. Moyers checked with me, on the calling of the bipartisan leaders to a meeting with the president, and arrangements were put in effect for the President to meet the Under Secretary of State in the absence of the Secretary and other officials here.
Mr. ADAMS. How did it come about that the remains of President Kennedy were taken to the naval hospital?
Mr. O'BRIEN. It was my understanding that the President would be taken to a hospital. I don't recall any discussion of the reason specifically other than my assumption that the autopsy would take place at one of the military hospitals in Washington. And obviously there were two to select from, and the President being an ex-Navy man, it seemed just sort of normal to suggest Bethesda.
Mr. ADAMS. And you remained with Mrs. Kennedy during the entire trip?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes; I did.
Mr. ADAMS. What was her condition?
Mr. O'BRIEN. She conversed a great deal with us. The one impression left with me from the entire trip and conversations with Mrs. Kennedy during the trip, participated in by all of us, was her great concern for us, really-her feeling that we had, as she put it, been with him at the beginning and we were with him at the end. We were all bereft. And I am afraid that the four of us who felt that we should be of some comfort to her were inadequate to the job in the sense that it was difficult for us to come up with anything that made much sense by way of being helpful.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you remember any other general subjects of discussion as you made the trip up?
Mr. O'BRIEN. No; I do not.
Mr. ADAMS. What happened when you arrived?
Mr. O'BRIEN. A lift was placed at the rear door of the plane. The honor guard came up the front steps, through the plane, to the back compartment. We concluded that we would take the body off the plane.
Mr. ADAMS. You say "we." You mean Mr. Powers, Mr. O'Donnell, and yourself?
Mr. O'BRIEN. General McHugh. And so we proceeded to do just that. We took the--lifted the coffin, with the help of the crew people, and placed it on the lift, and it was taken from there.
We---the three of us---four of us--McHugh was with us--got into a car. The Attorney General and Mrs. Kennedy went into the ambulance, if that is what it was. And we followed in a car directly behind that, went out to Bethesda Naval Hospital.
Mr. ADAMS. What did you do when you arrived there?
Mr. O'BRIEN. We went immediately to an upper floor of the hospital, where we joined members of the President's family. General McHugh went elsewhere. And we then spent several hours in these rooms on, I don't know what floor of the hospital.
Mr. ADAMS. When you referred to the President's family, what particular members were there?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Well, Mrs. Stephen Smith was there.
Mr. ADAMS. Mrs. Attorney General Kennedy?
Mr. O'BRIEN. Yes. I don't recall all the members of the family. The Attorney General--and there were there was an occasional person that came and went during the night. But that was basically the group.
We had coffee and received reports from time to time from General McHugh as to the length of time it would take for the trip from Bethesda to the White House. And the hours went on and on, until the early hours of the morning perhaps 4 a.m.
Mr. ADAMS. And then what did you do?
Mr. O'BRIEN. We came to the White House, at which point several of the White House staff, Mr. Shriver, were awaiting the arrival of the President. He was placed in the East Room. A brief prayer was given, and terminated the evening.
Mr. ADAMS. I would like to ask you to go back again and give me recollections of the President's views about the nature of the protection should be afforded him, or what his attitude was towards security.
Mr. O'BRIEN. I cannot recall any specific conversation I had with the in this area. All I can say is that the President at all times was most interested in close contact with his fellow Americans, and in that sense he was quick to move to a fence that separated him from the people, he was quick to move towards people. He certainly moved quite freely. But I do not recall ever having a conversation or being present during the course of a conversation when the specific protective measures were discussed or what his views were relative to them.
Mr. ADAMS. Other than what you have said here, do you have any knowledge at all about the person who did the shooting, whoever it might be?
Mr. O'BRIEN. None whatsoever.
Mr. ADAMS. Do you have any other thing I have not covered that you would like to put in this record?
Mr. O'BRIEN. I don't believe so. I believe that to the best of my recollection I have tried to carefully review all aspects of the matter, from departure from the lawn of the White House to arrival back at the White House. And I cannot call anything to mind now that I might have overlooked.
Mr. ADAMS. Now, finally, it is a custom in this Commission to make transcripts available to the witnesses if they want to read them before signing them, or if you would like you can waive that. That is entirely up to you.
Mr. O'BRIEN. I would like to have the transcript.
Mr. ADAMS. Then we will send it along in the next few days, and when you have an opportunity to consider it, if you will just send it back to the Commission we would appreciate it.
Mr. O'BRIEN. I certainly will.
Mr. ADAMS. That closes this deposition.A Sneak Peek at Dragonlaird Gaming’s Savage Settings

The interim welterweight champion talks about wanting to wait for that shot, even if it means he will have a long layoff from the cage.
”
If he does end up waiting, that would defeat the purpose of the interim title and the UFC welterweight division would essentially be at a stand still for what could be 10-11 more months. And with the UFC pumping out shows left and right in this new FOX deal, that would definitely put a strain on headliners.

Hmmmm Seems condit wants to make a big payday by waiting for the paper champion gsp. I guess thats his GAME PLAN. Condit is not hurt but wait he will probably get hurt while sparring maybe his ACL. What a joke the guy ran for 5 rounds now he wants to wait for gsp. Is this the same guy that was willing to step aside and let diaz fight gsp? What a joke this guy is. Me personally i want Diaz/ Condit rematch while the paper champion recoups from his little ouch.

I really dont understand all the Condit bashing?? He is the most exciting fighter in the division who has fought and beaten the best the division has to offer. Which is more than can be said for Diaz. There is a big difference between running and clever footwork. He out struck Diaz and played a smart game. If you want to beat Diaz you have to move, simple. Why should he stand there and let him hit him??? would you??. And as for the big payday, why the fuck shouldnt he wait for it?? look at his record, look how many top notch competitors he has been up against. He deserves the payday, especially over Diaz (who I am a big fan of). To call him a marathon runner is retarded and shows you know nothing of Carlos or the fight game.

He was one of the most exciting fighters in the division. Till his gameplan to run away from Diaz.
The big difference between running and clever footwork? Frankie Edgar has the best footwork in the UFC but I've never seen him turn his back and run away from anyone. I thought Condit was the same type of fighter till that fight. He never ran from anyone before.
It was a good gameplan but a good gameplan would also be to hit a few leg strikes and get a takedown. Who the hell would want to see that.

Condit is fun to watch he was just way too cautious in his fight with Diaz. I'm starting to get sick of Greg Jackson game plans.

Personally I would like to see Condit fight Ellenburger in June…then the winner of that fight going at GSP in October/November. But I get it. He's got a family and future to think about. Dana needs to sweeten the deal with a big payday if he takes a fight with Ellenburger.

How about this. The UFC should have a policy that if you're the champ and don't defend your title in 8 months. Injury or whatever. You should have to vacate the title.Pa Song

Excellent TypeErnest Salazar JR.
Ernest Salazar Jr., 87, passed away unexpectedly on Monday, April 30, 2012. He had always been healthy and in exceptional condition and lived a full life. He was born in Key West, Fla., on Sept. 19, 1924, the eldest of two sons, to the late Ernesto "Baby" Salazar and Eva "Cuca" Acosta, who were also Conchs. He grew up in his hometown enjoying life in simpler times where neighborhoods were like extended families who shared what little they had and watched over each other's children. He loved fishing from shore or bridges, developed a passion for planes, and learned model building at an early age.
He entered the Army Air Force at 19 during World War ll and was sent to the Airplane and Engine Mechanic technical school at Seymour Johnson Field, N.C. From there he went to the propeller specialist school at Caldwell, N.J., where he excelled in this field. His military tours took him to India, Burma, and Okinawa. He marveled at the Taj Mahal and carried a picture of himself by it in his wallet for the rest of his life. He returned to the United States and was honorably discharged in January 1946.
Ernest then returned to his Key West family, eventually joining owner John Scribner's Key West Electrical Repair Service as an electric motor repairman. As the shrimping industry grew, he began working in the maintenance and repair department on shrimp boat electrical systems and was soon in great demand.
In 1948, he married Edna Eatherly and they soon had two daughters, to the delight of grandparents Ernesto and Eva. They left Key West in 1959 to pursue job opportunities in coastal Louisiana and Texas in his field of electrical work in the shrimping industry. They then moved to Downey, Calif., in 1964, where he spent 25 years working for a large electric motor repair facility. During that time, he and Edna parted ways and his daughters grew up and married. Upon his retirement in 1989, he headed back to his island home to join his now extended Key West family.
He lived at the Senior Plaza, where he returned to model building and collecting. He made many new friends there, as he was a kind and compassionate man with a great sense of humor. He was well liked, often volunteering his electrical skills to neighboring tenants. He and his brother Lenny shared a passion for planes and went to many air shows together. He also enjoyed big band music, going to the movies, and attending performances at the TWFAC theater.
Ernie was a member of the local Old Coots group who met for lunch every week for many years. He was a member of the Interplanetary Society and an active, contributing member of the Air Force Association. He began accumulating more models than he could build and, through the AFA, he sent several boxes to an Army group stationed in Iraq. His stockpile of models has been donated to the military. He was also a member of the First Congregational Church for many years, where he served as an usher along with his brother.
His favorite local group was the Long Time Locals Breakfast Club, where he joined his brother nearly every morning. He enjoyed the camaraderie and often brought in his own "show and tell" inventions. Their last breakfast together was on Sunday, April 29, followed by some shopping and a leisurely phone call that evening with lots of laughter and Ernie's big band music playing in the background.
He will be greatly missed by his family and many dear friends and will live on in the hearts of those left behind. Left to honor and remember him are his younger brother, Leonard (Kathleen) Salazar Sr. of Key West; two daughters, Rosemary (David) Holbrook of Falling Waters, W.Va., Theresa Salazar (Jeff Cook) of Bentonville, Va.; two granddaughters, Christina (John) Lewis and Angelina Mitchell; one grandson, Matthew Merrick; nine great-grandchildren; cousin Lorraine (Cucho) Sanchez of Key West; numerous nieces and nephews and their extended families. He will be sorely missed by his dear, longtime friends Charlotte Wrana of Seal Beach, Calif., and Art (Doreen) Omand of Las Vegas, Nev., with whom he had frequent communication.
Ernest was cremated in accordance with his wishes and all arrangements entrusted to Castillo & Thurston's Key West Mortuary and Cremation Center. A private family memorial and internment will be held upon arrival of out of town family members.KIRKUS REVIEW
Reminiscent of Aesop’s Fables, Ketteman (Shoeshine Whittaker, 1999, etc.) tells a mirthful moral tale wherein a busybody armadillo learns the consequences of eavesdropping and gossiping. Armadillo has ears as long as a jackrabbit’s, which allow him to hear everything he shouldn’t and make it very difficult for him to get around. Those pesky ears are always getting under foot. Moreover, all the other animals, stung by his misspeak, have excluded him from the watering hole. Despite his constant thirst and “the what-for and the how-come and the why-not” scolding he’s been treated to, Armadillo persists in his disagreeable behavior. He creeps about, bending an ear to other’s conversations and then twisting what he’s heard. He really gets himself in a fix when he crosses Alligator. One day he overhears Heron and Alligator discussing the way Toad’s skin has improved, perhaps because of a changed diet. Armadillo passes this along to Toad, only his version has Alligator calling Toad’s skin “plug-ugly” and suggesting she go on a diet. When Alligator discovers this she gives Armadillo what-for but she also adds gnashing teeth and some precise nipping here and there until all Armadillo has left are diminutive ears. From then on, Armadillo cannot hear quite so keenly, but his ears never trip him up again. Graves’s waggish illustrations, an ideal match for the text, are painted in striking deep hues and make for fabulous eye-candy. Rarely is learning a lesson this much fun.

-The Tories have unleashed a new line of attack on Dion, claiming that a Liberal government would plunge the country back into deficit. I think even Tories will agree this isn't likely, for the exact same reason I don't expect Harper to ever ban abortion or bring back the death penalty - it would be political suicide to run a deficit in this day and age. But it is interesting to get a sneak peak of some of the themes we'll see during the next election, expected to be called in...ummm....ahh....well...
-The Bloc are also advertising...they target the Tories on a wide range of policy positions.
-While I did miss all the fun of the Ontario elections in the fall, the OYL elections figure to be just as intense. Jacob Mksyartinian is running for re-election with OYL Beyond, while Mary Rose Brown is running for President with OYL Roots. Being new to the scene, I don't know all the players, but I would like to put in a good word on behalf of bloggers Justin Tetreault and Danielle Takacs, along with Elyse Banham and Chris Drew, who I hear is running for VP Policy on a "fund faith based schools" platform.

CP Aviation is so proud of Judy Phelps, 2011 National CFI ofthe Year. She is a 3-time Master CFI-A, and a member of IAC as well as SAFE (Society of Aviation and Flight Educators), who recently renewed her Master CFI-Aerobatic accreditation. Judy specializes in aerobatic and Emergency Maneuver Training. Judy will be recognized as the 2011 National CFI of the Year at Oshkosh, later this year. Judy has also been named the 2011 FAA Western Pacific Region CFI of the Year, and she serves as a FAASTeam representative in the FAA’s Van Nuys FSDO area.
The following is excerpted from the Master Instructors LLC press release regarding Judy Phelps:
“Master Instructors LLC takes great pride in announcing a significant aviation accomplishment on the part of Judy Phelps, the 2011 Western Pacific Region CFI of the Year and resident of Santa Paula, California. Recently, Judy’s accreditation as a Master CFI-Aerobatic (Certificated Flight Instructor-Aerobatic) was renewed by Master Instructors LLC, the international accrediting authority for the Master Instructor designation as well as the FAA-approved Master Instructor Program. She first earned this national professional accreditation in 2006, has held it continuously since then, and is one of only 81 worldwide to earn the credential three times.
To help put these achievements in their proper perspective, there are approximately 93,000 CFIs in the United States. Fewer than 700 of those aviation educators have achieved that professional distinction thus far. The last 15 national Flight Instructors of the Year were Master CFIs while Judy is one of only 51 California teachers of flight to earn this prestigious “Master” title and one of only 24 nationwide to earn aerobatic accreditation.
In the words of former FAA Administrator Marion Blakey, “The Master Instructor accreditation singles out the best that the right seat has to offer.”
.”
Judy also holds a CFI-Instrument certificate, earned in 2005.
Judy also serves as the President of the Board of Directors of the Aviation Museum of Santa Paula. Judy and Clay have been part of the Museum from its inception, and are very active volunteers for this nonprofit organization. The mission of the AMSP is “To educate the public of all ages in aviation and its history, both in general, and as it relates to Santa Paula, and to inspire, motivate and challenge the younger generation to carry on the dreams of our aviation pioneers.” As President she is currently focused on the renovation and development of the Museum’s new Home Hangar and offices.
In addition, Judy Phelps has been recognized by the Ventura County Chapter of the Ninety-Nines International Organization of Women Pilots as “2006 Woman Pilot of the Year”, and the Southwest Section of the organization awarded her “2008 Professional Woman Pilot of the Year.” As Past Chair of the local chapter, she remains active in chapter activities, promoting and encouraging women in aviation. She has also taught seminars for pilots throughout the state.
Judy has also been an active member of the International Aerobatic Club (IAC) Chapter 49, serving on the board, competing and working in various volunteer positions at aerobatic contests, and hosting many of the chapter’s meetings at CP Aviation. Judy is qualified as an aerobatic judge, and has sponsored IAC judge’s schools at Santa Paula airport.

Today's Groupon uncovers one of the few remaining with $25 worth of fresh Italian fine dining and drinks at Cucina Tagliani for $12—good at any of its three locations in Glendale, Avondale, and Peoria.
This family-owned-and-operated famiglia of restaurants prides itself on making everything on its menu, from the most delicious substance of all—scratch. That includes starters such as the Mediterranean-style calamari ($8.49), the hefty tagliani combo appetizer platter ($13.99), pizzas ($6.99–$10.99), and the Romano chicken salad ($9.99). For entrees, the rigatoni diavolo (shrimp and chicken in spicy alfredo, $12.79) will give you a kick, and Nana's Combo (lasagna and spinach manicotti, $11.79) will give you a taste-punch. If you think you know better than Nana, build your own pasta bowl out of your choice of 10 different pastas, 10 sauces, and a plethora of veggies, meats, and cheeses. Save room for a little cannoli and cookies ($3.99) or chocolate mascarpone cake ($5.99). For the truly daring, there is the leaning tower of Pisa (chocolate cake and spumoni, $7.99) and for the indecisive, there's the "I Cant Decide" platter (three of the best-selling desserts and coffee, $9.99).
Cucina Tagliani also boasts a list of red and white wines that would satisfy your boisterous uncle, as well as straight-outta-Tuscany specialty cocktails such as the Limoncello-tini (limoncello and vodka, $4.99) and the Italian Dream (coconut rum, amaretto, orange juice, and grenadine, $5.99). Each Groupon is good for one table, so you can laugh it up with your whole vivacious Italian family, or pretend that your dour brood of Scandinavian filmmakers is a vivacious Italian family.

I think we can all agree that the chances are Harvin won't come out tomorrow and say, "the specialist says I'm good to go". What is more likely is that the specialist has suggested surgery and the team are now talking to Harvin about the options. Otherwise we'd have heard something by now.
... he is doing the same thing by stating that the fact that we haven't heard anything definitive probably means that Harvin will have surgery. The problem is this case goes back to my last post: Harvin will almost certainly have surgery on his hip AT SOME POINT. I can't remember any player with a torn labrum in either his shoulder or hip who didn't eventually have surgery on it. So by Florio saying the delay makes it likely that Harvin will have surgery, he's not really telling us anything. What matters is when Harvin will have the surgery, and whether he can delay it until after the season, and the fact that we haven't heard anything yet doesn't tell us anything about that question. Florio's post leaves people with the impression that it does, which is wrong IMHO.

I like Florio fine when he sticks to reporting the actual news. When he gets obsessed over something (such as the "Fail Mary" or the name "Redskins") or pulls something out of thin air like he did today, it's shoddy journalism. We need less of that these days, not more.Microsoft Visual Studio Net

She’s right I happened to get married and have kids pretty quickly. However, I started working in some form of ministry very young, and I know what it’s like to be single, and in ministry.
I know what it’s like to have people walk up to you and ask, “When you will be next?” when they hear of the engagement of anyone in a 5 mile vicinity. In America we do not have pre-arranged marriages, so I was never sure how to “make this happen.” At the same time everyone thinks you have all the free time, so you can just be the one to “drop your life” when “something needs to be done.”
There seem to be plenty of books out there (especially for us girls) about how we are supposed to make Jesus the center of our lives then we are “ready” for our spouse. This is what I was taught. If I could just “Kiss Dating Goodbye,” and be about the Lord, then my husband would come. It was almost like he was locked behind a door, that would get opened when I had enough faith in Jesus. The problem of course is that we are pursuing Christ while having one eye open on the moment we arrive at enough “Jesus time” to “deserve a spouse.”
Us “married in ministry” folks do a miserable time at helping a lot of times. I have realized as my friends reach over 30 I don’t always know how to be supportive. The reality is that all of my friends, who aren’t married, would like to be. Yet, at the same time, I know we can’t wave a magic wand and our “prince” shows up. How many of us have heard stories of parents and grandparents who knew each other for like a week and then planned a wedding soon thereafter, only to go on to be married for 50 years? So in our idiocy we start looking around for viable options of other “singles” for you. You date someone for like a minute and we want to talk about the wedding. We mean well, but we are not always helpful.
Part of the solution is that we realize unmarried does not equal undead. Paul himself talked about ministry and singleness being a good combination. You can’t just snap fingers and “get married” so living like you need it to come along any sec can just be frustrating. So my “single” friends know that for now they do just focus on where Christ has them and then see if/when a spouse comes along. So I guess this article is really to us married folks. We need to back off, and for now, let the single be single.
God has each life… He really does…

I was in ministry and single until I was 35. You pointed out that a lot of the pressure is on single women in ministry, which I found to be true. I felt that people acted as if something was wrong with me because I lead a happy, fulfilled life serving the Lord without a spouse. Of course now the question has switched to, “When are you having kids?” I’m trying to be gracious again in answering.
Good article and speaking from a single guy I wish there were more for our gender on this issue. For me, I am 35 and have the gift of singleness (after I said “I surrender ALL”…I meant it, even that area). The issue I have with churches (the people not the building) is most suggest ones life does not begin until one gets married. Why is this? Why do people constantly make those single, and even those called to be single feel “less than” because we haven’t “settled down” yet? People think I am gay, weird, an outcast or worse just a selfish boy who isnt’ ready to grow up yet when they find out my marital status. Could it be that I “settled down” when I said yes to Christ and this is when my life began!? I don’t need a partner to be complete, I have Christ.
I can honestly say after 9 years in youth ministry at my current church I don’t have a problem any longer. They all know me and my calling, gift of celibacy now. Sadly two of those years I was “fixed up” by the church to date a particular lady whom the pastor and other Godly people “knew” was the one for me. I spent two years distracted by what God called me to do. I spent days worrying about if maybe I was wrong all these years of being single that I wasn’t hearing God correctly. I tried everything to make it work but my heart was not in it and I felt so lost. I became angry and it affected my ministry and my relationship with my adopted son. I felt worried of splitting the youth after a break up and being looked down upon for breaking up with her. The battle was intense and never want anyone to experience Gods people persuading them into something for the sake of “you need to and have to be married one day”. For now, I just have a list of snazzy comebacks when someone asks why I am not married.
Chris- Thanks for sharing. I definitely think having the gift of celibacy is unique and also foreign to most in trying to understand it. “Why would you want to be single?” I think is probably what people ask or want to. Sounds like you have a way of explaining it now, and truthfully it really isn’t anyone else’s “business” when it comes to our marital status or why.
If God has called you to be his alone, that is awesome.13th Jun - 13th Jun 2015

It has been a week of painful schoolwork, heart-wrenching annoyance and big-headed idiots...but now it's the weekend and I can proudly say that 'I have survived! I will again!'
Anyway, here's chapter eight, and thanks for all your opinions, favorites and alerts!
Disclaimer: Don't own anything of Peter Pan, Neverland or Doctor Who. However, I do own Ginny and any other things I may have changed or added to Neverland's plotline.
Everything was so…shiny. Gold and jewels glittered within glass cases. A large, ornamental statue of an angel reflected the light given by the oil lamps. The marble counter, where I'm positive people paid, even appeared as though it'd been freshly polished. Once I had taken this all in I turned to lads who seemed to be in a trance like state; ogling the goods like small children in a candy store. "Not bad." Fox whistled somewhere to my right. "Not bad."
That snapped them out of it. In an instant everybody was looking around and stuffing the valuables into their bags, I however didn't find much interest in the rubies and diamond's. Traveling with the Doctor had taught me that old things such as books and ancient weapons can have a much more exciting history about it. History that could very well save your neck one day.
After studying some of the said items through the glass, I took interest in an old, tattered blue book that looked as though it may be a journal. Going behind the counter I unclasped the latch on the glass case before grabbing ahold of the book. Turning it over in my hands I realized that it had some lines going down the sides of the leather. Ignoring the strange texture I flipped it open; expecting to find blank a page only to find it full of slanted writing. Frowning I turned to the next page, and then the next, I continued flipping until I'd gotten through almost half the book when something cold slipped past my hand and clattered onto the floor.
Placing the book on the counter I quickly bent down to see that the clatter was made by a small ring. But it wasn't just any old ring. It had small strange stones that were in the shape of tongues of fire, their colors were a blend of warm orange, dark blue and a fiery red and the band was blazing silver. It was also mine. For what felt like ages I could only stare at the ring and for a second the forbidden word impossible crossed my mind. Why is that word forbidden? Because I learned the hard way that nothing and I mean nothing was ever impossible. However this was pretty damn close to it. I lost it, I told myself as I absentmindedly turned the ring in my hands. Ages ago in Rome. During the Roman Empire! How could it just end up here in all places…I trailed off, my gaze had landed on the blue book.
Getting to my feet I seized the book and read the seven words written in slanted writing on the page. Nobody likes spoilers Ginny; especially you. R.S
I nearly dropped it. Not many people knew me, and out of that percentage only a select few knew what my interests and major pet peeves are. So, very few would know that I hated spoilers for books and movies alike. And then there are one or two people who know the spoilers I loathe the most; my dreams. Closing the book I flipped it back over to the front, my breath hitching when I realized that the lines weren't just the texture of the leather or some random pattern. They crisscrossed to make windows, a door and the wood paneling that would be side, creating a police box. The TARDIS.
"What are you looking at Ginny?"
I spun around, instinctively hiding the journal behind my back as I faced a curious Fox. "It's nothing." I reassured him, although he didn't seemed convinced
"You sure?" Fox questioned, attempting to peek over my shoulder forcing me to take a step to my right so that the counter was no longer blocking my way. "You look really pale."
"It's probably just the light." I insisted, quickly growing annoyed with his persistence.
He stepped towards me a small grin finding its way onto his face. "I heard you made a good mad woman."
"Yeah, well we needed to get in right?" I reminded him wearily.
He frowned, no doubt recognizing the tone. "C'mon Gin, you can tell me." He whispered before taking another step towards me and looking at me with his big blue eyes.
I sighed before holding out my hand, "it's just a ring."
"Fire huh?" Fox asked, taking it in his hand and examining it for a minute before looking back at me. "Suites you. But why did you try to…?"
Thankfully Fox never got to finish his sentence. Sadly he had to be the cause of it. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"
I knew that voice. Turning around I was faced with none other than Jimmy who was staring at Peter with disappointment written all over his face. Wait, disappointment? I thought he wanted the job done? Unless…I glanced around furiously until I found Peter who wore a guilty expression. You sneaky son of a bitch, I fumed silently as Peter tried to speak in his defense.
Finally gaining his nerve Peter replied stonily: "Isn't this what you wanted?"
"You know it isn't. I told you that I'd changed my mind, that I was doing this one alone."
My fists clenched tightly at my sides, as I gritted my teeth fighting to keep my anger at bay. But that didn't stop me from feeling glad when Curly spoke angrily. "Why didn't you tell us Peter?"
We stood there for a moment waiting for the excuse that he didn't have. "I wanted to show Jimmy that we could do it. He thought we were too young!" Peter blurted out making me shoot daggers at the back of his head.
"I am too young." Tootles spoke suddenly, making everyone turn towards him and notice that he was wearing a helmet too big for his head.
I would have laughed but I was too angry. Peter had lied to me twice now and then on top of that; he decided to lie to all of us just to impress Jimmy. I was so angry that the words that came out of my mouth next weren't ones of laughter. "Peter when you say that we could do it, don't you mean that you could do it?" I spat through my teeth, glaring at him furiously when he turned to face me.
"Ginny," he began looking sincerely hurt, but I cut him off.
"Wow! Two lies in one day! You've...really got it going for you huh?" I asked in a falsely cheery voice and a dead smile on my face. "You know it's funny, that after two weeks of living with someone you'd think that you would know them enough to know that they wouldn't do stupid stuff like this just so that they can have their fifteen minutes of fame." Everybody was staring at me at this point, some with concerned looks, others confused and some well, both. But I wasn't even finished yet. "But it turns out that they are full of shit!"
I felt Fox place his hand on my arm as Peter recoiled at the words. "Ginny…"
"Don't tell me that I'm out of line." I hissed fighting to keep my voice level by reminding myself that it wasn't his fault. "He lied to every single one of us Fox! And you know what!" I continued turning back to Peter as I spoke with malice. "I bet he only feels sorry that he got caught doing it."
If Peter was hurt before he was pissed now. His warm brown eyes darkened till they almost looked black with anger as he hissed: "what would you know about loyalty Ginny? You can hardly last a day without trying to knock someone!"
My eyes narrowed and I started forwards just to be held back by Fox. "What do I know about loyalty Petey boy?" I spat not bothering to fight against Fox's tight grip. It wasn't him I wanted to hurt. "I know that you obviously don't know that it doesn't involve betrayal or greed. It involves decency! But then again you men clearly don't mind paying some whore to lift her skirts while your wife sits at home, waiting for you to come home!"
"Oh, so men aren't good enough for you then!" Peter snapped making me laugh.
"No Peter, actually I met a very nice lad today." I smirked at his confused expression, "he was handsome, kind and gave me all the money I needed without asking for anything in return. And he was also a very good kisser."
Peter appeared abashed at my words, which satisfied me. Although I didn't expect Fox's grip to slacken and for him to breathed in a hurt voice: "What?"
Glancing up at him, I noted with concern that he'd gotten somewhat pale and had a look of utter disbelief on his face. "Fox, are you alright?" I questioned, surprised and worried about his ashen face and that he couldn't seem to look me in the eye.
"You're joking right?" He whispered finally, his dark blue eyes finally meeting my own.
I frowned. "What? No, Fox…"
He let go of me, taking off his hat and running a hand through his blond hair. Biting on his lip so hard he drew blood; "I need some air." He said finally before going towards the back of the store.
For a few moments it was silent, the lads exchanged glances with one another, Peter continued staring at me and I…I was downright confused. After about three or so minutes of this, Jimmy spoke. "Fill your bags, Peter come with me." With that he went to the hall in the back as if nothing had happened.
Peter stayed for a moment, staring at me as though he had realized something. "What?" I snapped, not being able to take it anymore.
"It's just that you're wrong." Peter told me with a glare.
I scoffed; I wasn't in the mood for his games: "About what?"
"About me," He answered before following Jimmy.
I couldn't say anything for a moment. It was just all so overwhelming, everything had just happened so fast. We'd been happy when we'd got here. I'd been happy, proud even that I managed to pull off the mad sister character. Then I found the book and the ring and then Jimmy had to show up…Ugh! And Fox! What had happened there? It was all so confusing and mad that I found myself slamming my left hand down hard on glass cabinet in frustration. "Shit!" I swore when I felt something stabbing deep into the palm of my hand and hot, sticky sensation of my blood trailing down my hand before dripping onto what remained of the jewels inside.
Raising my left hand a little I tried to take the glass out, but only managed to make a deeper cut. Swearing silently at my stupidity I looked around the now empty front, searching for something that could get the glass out or that could at least keep more blood from spilling out. Noticing the small desk hidden in the corner of the room I checked the drawers and managed to find a small bit of white material that could be used as a bandage. Sighing I took it from the drawer before placing it on the desk; putting my hand palm up on the material I clumsily wrapped it around my hand tying it into a knot when I was finished. Staring at the makeshift bandage grimly I thought: Well, it could have been worse.
Turning back around I was shocked to be faced with a solemn Peter who was twirling an elegant dagger expertly in his hand. He didn't notice me staring at first, or if he did he didn't acknowledge it. But when he stopped twirling the dagger he looked at me than to the hand that I had pulled my jacket's sleeve over at the last second. "What are you staring at?" he asked an edge to his voice that I recognized as anger.
I glared at him, wondering how he had the nerve to say that when he'd been staring at me just moments ago. "Nothing; that's all there is to look at Peter." I sneered, fighting back a smirk when his eyes merely narrowed at me.
"Who's the one lying now?" He spat his brown eyes flashing with anger and betrayal that almost made me feel bad, almost.
Taking a few steps forward I raised an eyebrow at him, with a small challenging smirk on my lips. "I don't know about you Petey boy, but I honestly don't see anything remotely interesting to look at." I replied smoothly, the mocking smile growing slightly larger as he took a step back, as if startled by my words before walking forward stopping only when we were an inch away from each other.
I expected him to yell, to lash out. Honestly either one of those reactions would've satisfied me. But I didn't expect a cocky smirk to replace the angry mask or for him to lean forward and whisper: "Now I know your lying."
I went to argue just to find his piercing brown eyes staring straight into mine. I'd never noticed before, but he had little flecks of gold in his eyes if you looked closely enough. Shaking my head I went to push against him, ignoring the throbbing pain in my hand and found his chest firm. Glancing up again I took note of the youthful freckles, the messy hair, the pale skin and the pink lips spread into a cocky grin. "J-Just because you like what you see in the mirror, doesn't mean that I do." I told him making him chuckle.
"No, but the fact that you of all people are stuttering proves otherwise." He murmured softly, his gaze lingering on my face curiously.
I opened my mouth to argue, but suddenly found myself consumed by a brilliant flash of white light that half blinded me. Blinking furiously my vision returned to normal and I was staring at a big crater where half of Hobottles had been mere seconds before. Startled I backed away from Peter, staring at the empty void in front of me, words forming uselessly on my lips as if my voice had been stolen from me. That's when I noticed the strange orb thing floating in the middle of the crater. Peter and I glanced at each other, both of us seeming to be thinking the same thing: What the hell just happened?
Hee, hee...cliff hanger... not really, but I wanted to say it. Like it? Hate it? Well, I don't really want to hear you if you hate unless you give me an in depth reason as to why, and not just the excuse. 'Well, because I do.' Because seriously people, if you don't like a story then why are you wasting your time commenting on it? It makes absolutely no sense what so ever. Just wanted to point that out; constructive criticism is welcomed as are other opinions if you guys so wish to state them.As 260 fans of openSUSE descended upon Nuremberg, the second annual openSUSE Conference began at 9:30 sharp with Hendrik “Henne” Vogelsang delivering a very important and poignant message for us all.
In Henne’s keynote, “Get your ass up!”, he talks about where we are and how we can move forward as a Project. “We’re in a unique position”, Henne said. He asked the audience how old they thought SUSE was. Nobody guessed correctly – it is 18 years. Debian is 17, Red hat 16 – SUSE really has been around a long time. Yet it has only been a really open project for a few years – Henne considers the opening of Factory during 2009 the real milestone here.
So – an old distribution with a large userbase, yet a very young community with very little structure and few rules and limitations. Now is the time to change things – you can make a huge impact in openSUSE and Free Software in general.
Moving openSUSE means taking responsibility; you can do anything – nobody can and should question those who take responsibility!
Highlighting some of the examples of people who have stepped up and pushed their initiatives, Henne pointed to people like Andrew “FunkyPenguin” Wafaa who recently released the openSUSE incarnation of Meego, Smeegol. Wafaa, a true enthusiast of the netbook environment, didn’t wait for someone to give their permission or blessing to proceed with his initiative. He just did it, made it happen – beating Fedora and the ‘official’ MeeGo project in getting out the latest MeeGo user interface!
Henne talks about things stopping people from stepping up and doing what they think is needed. Fear of duplication or doing something contradicting other efforts often stop us from making a difference.
Henne’s advice is simple: don’t give ave a you-know-what. Just do it. What is wrong with having Emacs *and* vim? Nothing! we can have duplication – we’re an open source community! We can have a million text editors if we want! We can have 8 desktops – we actually do… We can’t possibly all want the same thing and that is perfectly OK. We need diversity, that is how open source works. Don’t fear duplication, don’t fear contradiction, don’t let others tell you not to do something. Just do it.
All of this points to where we can go as a Project, which has limitless boundaries. There’s room for everyone and everyone’s ideas. Even if your ideas seem minute or insignificant, don’t be afraid to try and play around with your ideas. Every big idea started out small. And don’t even *think* about stopping anyone with whatever they want – help or get out of the way.
And last but not least, have a lot of fun! This goes for everyone who is here at the openSUSE Conference, as well as everyone out there in the openSUSE Community throughout the world. We are at a unique place right now – any person at this conference (and those not here) can make a huge impact on the future of openSUSE and consequently on Free Software.
Make a difference!

i’m with suse 10 of those 18 yrs and i never really regretted it … yes there was this learning to do at the beginning (afterall, linux is not for the lazy), it take a little longer to tweak the system, but then linux in general and opensuse in particular mean freedom other platforms (windows and/or osX) can’t provide … suse rocks, and i hope we keep rocking … theo
SuSE has Yast. A unique tool which allows the users to tweak /etc/sysconfig like no other distro does. I often change distro, but always return to SuSE. I’ve been using SuSE since 6.0.
I still think SUSE is the best distro around.And that after all those years…
That’s why I promote SuSE on my website.
Yes, constructed with…Well, what do you think???
SuSe has been an excellent revelation to me,the concept of open source itself is one where I can see everyone and everything converging in due time.My personal opinion is,to spend more time with the operating system,contemplating on the functioning, open a landscape of thoughts and this thoughts,as rightly stated by Henne shouldn’t be treated as miniscule.I bet open source is one community where one doesn’t need to fear to exercise one’s thought as the essence of this community lies in mutual understanding and the power of collaboration.
Ola! A todos mis amigos! OpenSuSE is the BEST Distro around. I have been using it since 6.3 or 6.2. It has truly matured into a most solid and stable OS. Thank you Linus Torvalds and the GNU Bunch for providing us with good programs and freeing us Microsoft Slaves. I am on a mission to put Linux on school campus PCs. This saves the district money and the kids can take home a copy for their own use. Linux saves me 90 man hours per month on just 30 PCs. Think – Clean Disk, Degraggler, Spybot, and anti-virus run will take a good 3 hours per PC. Windows has become so bugged out that it is not now worth the hassle to use. Please continue to keep Linux secure and stable against all the maladies that plague Windows. My most sincere regards to all of you in the projects that make this happen and God bless.

Gaaaacckk! I almost forgot! – have a lot of fun! –

I’ve got to completely disagree with him about this “who cares if there’s duplication – do whatever the heck you want” message. That type of thinking will get you 1,000 different types of tires and no automobile. David Letterman once reflected on the state of film today and observing that studios release a few good movies and many poor ones each year, asked why the studios couldn’t just give us 4 or five movies a year “but make them all really good ones?”
There’s too much duplication of effort. Don’t like an editor’s key layout? Develop a whole new editor from scratch! Don’t like feature X in a desktop? Create a whole new DE from scratch! That’s not leadership, that’s a rudderless ship. At some point Linux is going to have to find areas where product X has a clear feature advantage over product Y and consolidate things so that all types of that software use that feature. What’s the point of open source code reuse with major redundancy? We don’t need multiple office suites – if KOffice is demonstrably inferior to OpenOffice, why continue to waste manpower to develop KOffice? If Krita and Kexi are its only advantages, continue developing those, merge them into OpenOffice, and abandon the rest. Take the extra functions of Gnumeric, add to OpenOffice, abandon the rest. By concentrating development on strengths and abandoning weaknesses, we move forward. We don’t need Reiser 4, for instance, when we already have ext4 and Btrfs in development. I’d rather have one great filesystem for Linux than a choice of three or four unfinished ones. Let’s abandon areas of development that offer no clear advantage over existing code and redouble our efforts on the most promising software.
Smeegol is not the same thing at all as developing another text editor. Moblin was locked into using CPU instructions present in the Intel Atom but not AMD CPUs. Merging it with openSUSE allows for a Moblin experience across x86 CPU manufacturers. In fact, Smeegol is an example for what *I’m* advocating – it merged the strengths of two software products and ended up producing a working product before the Meego team (which is in effect partly duplicating what already exists in openSUSE). Leveraging the core of openSUSE with the UI of Meego gave a product with a better netbook experience than either in less time. That is the kind of thinking we need, but I’m not sure the keynote speaker understands why.
Hey Joseph,
you really need to read up on the history and principles of free and open source software. The whole FOSS community is one big evolutionary process. There is no “we” that can dispense workforce at will. People have the freedom to do what they want, and freedom includes duplicating efforts and even contradict each other. I suggest you start out with “CatB” from Eric S. Raymond (BTW Everybody loves Eric Raymond!) and other essays like “Voices from the Open Source Revolution” from Bruce Perens or “The Free Software Definition” from the FSF.
BTW this keynote was about the openSUSE Project, not about the FOSS community and for us, at this moment, it makes a lot of sense to duplicate and contradict because we want to emancipate us from our creator (Novell) and kick start our evolution. The more we do the better!
Have fun :-)

My vote goes to Joseph, we have reached the stage to go beyond and not start from scratch, identify what requires enhancement and focus on it to make it the best across all software and hardware platforms. You attract new users by advertising in different ways but for me the “word-of-mouth” is the most powerful one. When you can say I recommend SUSE due to “this and that” plus we have “the leadership in the community that has a vision and a mission to …kick-butt”; the freedom to agree or to disagree goes without saying, we just have to accept valid critisem and turn the negative into the positive and as the selling team says; turn all the objections into acceptance and we have a sale. Allowing us to feedback and contribute shows that we are on the right track. Thank you for a great service as the product will not exists without it.Got News?

Associated Press= NORTH STONINGTON, Conn. (AP) — Workers at a Connecticut day care say the grandmother of two boys found dead with her was authorized to pick them up and nothing seemed amiss before she killed them and herself.
Instead of taking the children home as planned Tuesday, Debra Denison vanished with them, leaving behind a suicide note. She and her grandsons, 2-year-old Alton Perry and 6-month-old Ashton Perry, were found shot to death in Preston in an apparent murder-suicide.
The boys' paternal great-grandmother, Marcia White, says Denison's struggles with mental health were well-known, and employees at North Stonington's Kidds & Co. say they were aware.
White says Denison was supposed to bring another relative with her when picking up the children. But Denison had asked to get the boys that day to help celebrate Alton's birthday.Comment
The Roswell City Council demonstrated common sense, concern for the environment and support of homeowners last Monday night by granting an exception to Roswell’s “Steep Slope” Ordinance to allow construction of a home on Robinwood Court.
Without this exception, the Roswell Steep Slope Ordinance would not have allowed construction because the lot slopes steeply to the creek in the rear.
Roswell’s Environmental Department recommended approval of this exception because the owner is granting a conservation easement over the rear of the lot, permanently increasing the undisturbed stream buffer to 70 feet.
This wider stream buffer provides more water quality protection than the Steep Slope Ordinance.
Roswell City Attorney David Davidson assured the council that this exception does not set a legal precedent or weaken the Steep Slope Ordinance.
Every homeowner on Robinwood Court supported this exception because they felt the vacant lot made their neighborhood appear unfinished.
Mr. Fleck’s criticism of the Council’s decision appears to be based more on plans to run for City Council in November, than on logic or the facts.
Mayor Jere WoodAs the controversy over the firing of top officials at the World Jewish Congress entered its third week, much of the focus was on a topic that seems to riddle all national debates these days: the source of a leaked document.
The document in question was a letter written March 14 by the president of the WJC, Edgar Bronfman. In it, he accuses Rabbi Israel Singer, his longtime lieutenant, of helping “himself to cash from the WJC office, my cash,” of “playing games with his hotel bill” and of not paying taxes. A few days later, excerpts from the letter appeared in a number of news stories, triggering vehement denials from Singer and back-and-forth accusations about which side leaked the material to the media.
The secretary general at the WJC, Stephen Herbits, said that Pierre Besnainou, president of the European Jewish Congress, was the only one to whom Bronfman had sent the letter. Herbits claims that Besnainou must have supplied the letter to Singer, who then leaked it to the press.
“Even though it condemned him, it made him look like the person who is the victim,” Herbits said. “That is Singer’s style. I am telling you categorically that Mr. Bronfman did not distribute the letter.”
After hearing of Herbits’s claim, Besnainou said, “It is completely false.” He declared, “I categorically state that I did not ‘leak’ this private letter to anyone and made this very clear to Stephen Herbits when we spoke in Caracas,” where the two men met last week.
The mystery unravels as both the Israeli and European branches of the WJC are battling with Bronfman and Herbits over the recent firings. Herbits announced that there would be a meeting of the WJC’s steering committee May 7 to discuss the recent dustup.
A larger WJC governing board meeting is scheduled for June. There has been talk that Bronfman will step down as WJC president, allowing for an election at that time. One of the most prominent candidates has been Bronfman’s son, Matthew. But this week, Herbits said, “Mr. Bronfman may or may not tell them he is retiring.”Budget Bonanza or Bust?
Gasp! The state budget for fiscal 2000, which begins July 1, 1999, is projected to be $282 million in the red.
That is the dire warning sent to the Legislature in November by numbers crunchers at the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC).
This would appear to be stunning news. After all, the state has had money pouring in so fast the past couple of years that legislators were hard-pressed to spend it all. When the dust settled on fiscal 1998, which ended June 30, there was $523 million available to be carried over to fiscal 1999.
But now, on the eve of Governor Jane Hull's first legislative session as an elected governor, suddenly there's a major budget crisis looming for next year.
It seems more than a little strange--especially in light of the fact that Hull and legislative leaders are still talking about a $50 million to $100 million tax cut.
So what gives?
How can the state really be facing a massive budget shortfall at the same time key policymakers are prepared to add to the string of tax cuts ushered in by former governor J. Fife Symington III?
As with most things legislative, the answer is complex.
First, the projected $282 million deficit is a worst-case scenario prepared by a JLBC forecasting team that has vastly underestimated the recent vigor of the Arizona economy.
Private economists and key legislators say the deficit projection will narrow considerably as state revenue--especially from personal income tax and sales tax receipts--continues to increase at a brisk pace. The JLBC will issue an updated forecast on the nearly $6 billion budget next week when the Legislature convenes.
A waning deficit is not necessarily good news to the Republicans who control both the state House and Senate. Many Republican legislators welcome projections of a hefty deficit because it abets their mission of slashing the size of state government.
"I'm glad to see that there is going to be a shortfall that is going to force us to prioritize our spending," says Senate Finance Committee chairman Scott Bundgaard. "At some point this session we will come up with a budget that better reflects our priorities."
A tax cut proposal makes it all the more likely some legislators will push to eliminate certain state agencies (particularly the Department of Commerce), slash welfare spending and tighten the screws on university budgets.
Hull doesn't seem eager for a cutting frenzy, and instead is expected to present a budget proposal next week that calls for a tax cut, but little in the way of significant spending reductions.
There are two essential elements to the Republican governor's budget, and both revolve around spending for new-school construction.
First, Hull wants to roll over $110 million in unspent school-construction funds from this year's budget into fiscal 2000.
Second, the governor wants to sell up to $200 million in revenue bonds in fiscal 2000 to pay for school construction and repairs, rather than taking the money out of the state's general fund. Instead of a $200 million hit to the general fund, state payments on the revenue bonds would only be about $30 million next year.
Implementing the two proposals would free up about $300 million in fiscal 2000, allowing the governor to cut taxes, fund school construction and expand other programs she strongly supports.
Key Republican legislators are dead set against Hull's carry-forward and revenue bonding proposals. Ironically, some of the Republicans who fought the school-funding measure passed last spring now insist that the measure be financed fully out of general funds rather than using revenue bonds.
The looming battle over how to pay for school construction could evolve into a round of nasty GOP infighting.
The school-finance issue was foisted on the Legislature by the state Supreme Court, which ruled that relying on property taxes to fund such capital expenditures as construction and repair of public schools is unconstitutional because wealthy districts could fund capital outlays more readily than poorer neighborhoods. Poorer districts had sued the state, seeking equity. After years of contentious debate, legislative foot dragging and two legislative fixes that were rejected by the court, lawmakers last year passed a bill that requires the state to spend up to $200 million a year to fund construction of new schools.
The new spending obligation for school construction is squeezing the state budget. Conservative Republicans see the spending obligation as an opportunity to support public education while exerting pressure to trim spending in other areas.
Further complicating matters is the fact that for the first time, lawmakers this session will prepare budgets for the next two fiscal years. They hope that passing budgets for two years will allow them to more closely study individual state agencies next year.
The complex agenda almost guarantees a lengthy and fractious budget debate. Such a scenario will force Hull to crack her leadership whip--a practice she has eschewed since ascending to the executive office in September 1997, upon Symington's resignation.
rojecting budget surpluses and deficits is always tricky business. No one knows for sure how the nation's economy will perform over the next two years. The fortunes of state and national economies are inextricably linked.
The U.S. economy has continued to surprise forecasters with its robust strength, even in the face of international economic shocks in Asia, Russia and South America. The U.S. economy looks recession-free through at least 1999--and Arizona stands to benefit.
"Although the [Arizona] economy will post slower growth in 1999, there is no recession in sight," states the Arizona Blue Chip Forecast published by Arizona State University's College of Business.
The state is expected to remain among the top five in growth, a position it has held for 70 consecutive months.
This should all be good news to JLBC analysts. The committee, however, is known for vastly underestimating the amount of revenue state government will collect each year. The conservative forecasts play a crucial role at the Legislature, where lawmakers decide how many tax dollars to collect and how they should be spent.
"There are legislative agendas that are advanced as a result of artificially deflating revenue," explains Senator George Cunningham, a Tucson Democrat. "You create the perception in the Legislature and the general public that there isn't any money and we need to tighten the belt and swallow hard."
Conservative Republicans have controlled the legislative agenda in recent years--a period in which the JLBC budget forecasts have been increasingly off the mark. In fiscal 1993, forecasters underestimated the state's year-end budget surplus by $75 million. The error increased to $227 million in 1994, $266 million in 1995, $397 million in 1996, $516 million in 1997 and $513 million in 1998.
Legislators say JLBC forecasters were directed by former Senate Appropriations Committee chair Carol Springer, a Prescott Republican, to issue very conservative revenue projections. Springer was elected state treasurer in November. Her successor as Senate Appropriations chair is Randall Gnant, who is taking a different approach to budget forecasting.
"I want the forecast to be accurate," Gnant says. "I don't want large swings up or down."
Gnant believes the revised JLBC budget forecast for fiscal 2000 that will be released next week will be far more accurate than it has been recently.
"The chances of there being a major change in revenue for this year (fiscal 2000) are considerably less than in previous years," Gnant says.
While politics certainly have influenced the JLBC forecasts, economic variables have played havoc with the numbers as well. Year after year, economists have been forced to revise upward their economic growth predictions as the Arizona economy continues to expand.
"Over the last few years, we all, not just JLBC, have been short of the mark in forecasting economic growth in Arizona," says Brian Cary, an economist with Arizona Public Service Company, the state's largest electric utility. "It's continued to defy economic expectations favorably."
LBC's dire predictions of a $282 million deficit for fiscal 2000, and $205 million for fiscal 2001, have not been accepted as gospel by the governor's office.
"We don't agree with the $282 [million] or the lesser amount of $205 [million] at the end of the second year," says Ted Ferris, the governor's deputy chief of staff and JLBC's former director.
Ferris says he expects state revenue will be fattened by strong personal income-tax collections, which have been driven up by last year's cut in the federal capital-gains tax and continued strength in the stock market.
Sales-tax collections also are running ahead of JLBC projections for this year, further evidence that revenue will be higher than anticipated for fiscal 1999, which means there should be a surplus that can be used in fiscal 2000.
The only major state revenue source showing a decline is corporate income-tax collections. But Ferris says that downturn "may not be as great as anticipated."
The governor wants to bolster fiscal 2000 revenue by carrying forward about $110 million in unspent school-construction funds from this year's budget. The Legislature appropriated $375 million in the current budget for K-12 capital expenses.
Of this, $200 million was for new school construction, $125 million for repairs to existing schools and $50 million intended for equipment such as computers. Ferris says it is impossible for school districts to spend the full $200 million during fiscal 1999 on new school construction.
The state School Facilities Board says it can spend only $75 million of the $200 million this year. Ferris says the governor wants to shift $110 million of the leftover $125 million into next year's budget.
By carrying forward the unspent money into fiscal 2000, the governor essentially increases state revenue next year by $110 million. The money would still be earmarked for new school construction, Ferris says.
The combination of greater than anticipated state tax collections plus the $110 million in unspent school-construction funds would go a long way toward eliminating the projected $282 million budget deficit, Ferris says.
Hull wants to wipe out the projected deficit--and create a surplus which can be used to finance a tax cut--by selling revenue bonds to fund the $200 million annual school-construction outlay for fiscal 2000.
Ferris says the state should take advantage of historically low interest rates to build schools. The bonds would be relatively short term--seven to 10 years--and would be repaid out of existing general revenue.
"There would be no need for a tax increase to pay for the bonds," Ferris says.
Revenue bonds would also shift the repayment burden to taxpayers whose kids will use the schools in the future rather than simply dumping the burden on today's taxpayers, he says.
But most important, the use of revenue bonds would allow the state to meet its legal obligation to build new schools while keeping funds available for other programs.
"From our standpoint," Ferris says, "it allows you to fully fund [school construction] and keep commitments on other fronts, whether that's K-12 education, universities, opening new prisons, increasing state-employee pay, and instituting some further modest tax cuts.".
Others are less certain that the budget process will flow as smoothly.
Burns says it's too early to tell whether the rank and file will support leadership's budget proposal.
"We have to find out what the mood of the Legislature is. We really won't know until we get into it," Burns says.
Bundgaard says budget conflict could stretch the legislative session past the 100-day goal for adjournment.
"It could get down to the end of session and get very ugly," Bundgaard says. "We could take the gloves off and duke it out between the House, Senate and governor. The serious decisions would not be made until the end of the session."
If Bundgaard's fears come to pass, Hull's leadership skills will be put to the test.
The governor's challenge will be even more difficult if the more conservative House passes budget provisions that generate strong opposition from about a half-dozen moderate Republican senators.
Democrats only need one Republican to defect in the Senate to throw a monkey wrench into the budget.
"I think we are going to be around for a long time," says one Democratic lawmaker.After suffering a series of heavy share price falls, there was finally some respite for investors in SuperGroup.
Shares in the fashion retailer edged 16½ higher to 870p on Wednesday, a modest increase that was nevertheless significant, given it marked the first time the stock had risen since June 10.
Investors in the group have had a torrid time of late. In the space of five trading sessions, starting last Wednesday, SuperGroup lost a quarter of its value.
The stock’s poor run has perplexed some investors, given there were no announcements from the company in the past week, or developments in the retail sector that should have materially knocked the share price.
The retailer had unsettled investors early last month with its weak fourth-quarter trading statement, which reminded the market of the unfortunate string of profit warnings that hit the shares in 2011-12.
However, many in the market thought the May 8 update – when the group warned that profits would be at the lower end of expectations – should not have triggered the sustained weakness seen in recent days.
Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec, one of SuperGroup’s house brokers, evidently agrees.
Yesterday, she repeated her “buy” rating and told clients that the 39pc drop since the most recent trading statement was “overdone”, helping to stop the rot in the company’s share price.
“[The fall] seems excessive for a less than 2pc cut in consensus earnings and to us implies the market is expecting a profit warning,” she said.
“While we do not see the first-quarter interim management statement [on September 4] as a catalyst, we do expect full-year results [on July 10] to reassure on the brand’s longer-term growth potential.”
The 3.1pc decline in quarterly like-for-like sales that SuperGroup reported last month was “explainable” and, although the company’s update on the first three months of the 2015 financial year is likely to show another decline in sales, “the long-term story looks very much intact”, the analyst reassured investors.
Like SuperGroup shares, the wider market also crept higher, with the FTSE 100 advancing 11.79 points to 6,778.56 and the second-tier FTSE 250 closing up 38.74 at 15,624.2.
Shire was buoyed by takeover speculation for a second straight session and finished 125p better at a record £37.85, a 3.4pc gain that was the biggest in the benchmark index.
John Boris, an analyst at US bank SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, initially got Shire shares moving in early afternoon trade by telling clients that he believed a bid from US botox-maker Allergan was “imminent”.
The FTSE 100 company climbed even higher later in the day, after Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which has targeted Allergan, stepped up its hostile pursuit of the company. Traders are betting that Allergan makes an approach to Shire to fend off Valeant.
Vodafone was another notable blue-chip riser and finished 2.85 higher at 198.1p on hopes its $2.2bn Indian tax dispute may soon be at an end. R.C Laholi, the former chief justice of India, has been appointed arbitrator in the long-running row.
Imperial Tobacco advanced 17p to £26.56 after the City reacted positively to Tuesday’s investor conference in Paris. Chris Wickham, analyst at Oriel Securities, said that although the meeting was a “deep dive into brand rejuvenation”, instead of a trading update, “the presentation importantly relayed a strong message on its commitment to targeted investment, quality and growth”.
Meanwhile, with the turmoil in Iraq continuing to push oil prices higher, energy stocks were in demand. Royal Dutch Shell’s B shares added 44p to £25.33, BP rose 8.3 to 514.4p and BG Group closed the session 7p dearer at £12.67,
Ophir Energy, the Africa-focused explorer, added 2.2 to 236.4p. Traders said the market had picked up on news that oil had been found in Kenyan waters by BG, Australian firm Pancontinental and Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production. The discovery was made in a block that neighbours Ophir’s Kenyan acreage.
Elsewhere among the day’s risers was Daily Mail & General Trust, 25 better at 840p, having received a boost from the float of property website group Zoopla, which gained 10 to 230p on its first day of trading.
DMGT sold part of its Zoopla stake but retains 33.7pc following the intial public offering. Investec analyst Steve Liechti said: “[Yesterday’s] Zoopla IPO pricing is at the lowish end of the range, but this looks a decent result for DMGT, in our view, given a more soggy IPO market.”
Xaar, the digital inkjet printing technology group that slumped 27.7pc a day earlier following a profit warning, remained firmly out of favour and lost a further 37, or 6.9pc, to 500p in the FTSE 250.
The company has been hit by slowing sales at its ceramic tile decoration business and, to account for the slowdown, UBS analysts yesterday slashed their target price to 550p from 950p.
“As the ceramics market nears a saturation point and the competition fights for market share, we are wary that near-term earnings revisions are more likely to be downwards than up,” the UBS experts told clients, and repeated their “neutral” recommendation.
Home shopping company N Brown was another notable FTSE 250 faller, sliding 11.7 to 423½p after missing forecast for first-quarter sales. Lower down the scale, Premier Foods warned on sales and tumbled 5½ to 52p, a 9.6pc drop.- "Cresia" and other related articles are a work in progress by Article editor.

The flag of Cresia.
Cresia (1 Cresii II) is the second planet orbiting the star 1 Cresii in the Ionro Arm of Basilicus Prime. Its mean radius is 3,803.605 kdul. The semi-major axis of Cresia's orbit is 6.044457159 × 107 kdul, and its sidereal year is 326.988199172 dd. The tropical year is 325.872934635 dd. Its axial tilt is 0.080379612π rad. A Cresian sidereal day is 13.451401652 dh, and the solar day is 13.506965621 dh. About 16.91% of the surface is covered by water. The remaining 83.09% not covered by water consists of deserts. Cresia has a Bond albedo of 0.313.
The entirety of Cresia is governed by the Republic of Cresia (or the Cresian Republic in some sources).
EtymologyEdit
Cresia is named after the region of Cresia in Crystaldeep. The region itself was nearly synonymous with the former Cresian Empire, which was named after Cresius, the founder of Cresianism.
HistoryEdit
Cresia was created about −1.772 billion DT along with the Cresian System. About −1.551 billion DT, a group of Antheons seeded the system with oxygenic photoautotrophs, including blovions and plants, in an attempt to terraform the planets in the system. While the Antheons did not settle permanently in the system, the blovions and plants created a breathable atmosphere on Cresia. Life seeded by the Antheons evolved for about 1.551 Gda before the arrival of the Cresii.
The Cresii arrived in the system 34748-08 DT, after which they claimed sovereignty over Cresia and its satellites. The Cresian government also declared the Cresian System its exclusive economic zone.
The first settlement in Cresia was Avana, which was the first capital of the Republic of Cresia and remains the largest city in Cresia. The site for Avana was at 0.4π rad N. The Cresian government chose the location of Avana at a high latitude for its relatively temperate climate. Because Cresia is located much closer to its star than Crystaldeep was, much of the planet has a hot desert climate.
Initially, the Cresian government practiced strict preservationism, forbidding any settlement outside the city limits of Avana. Due to a high growth rate, the government partially rescinded limits on settlement. To strengthen its claim on the system and the planet, the government created colonies on Iscra and Belsca, the latter of which was located at the antipodal point of Avana.
The current year is 34980-09-61 3:71:71 DT.
PoliticsEdit
Cresia is under the sovereignty of the Republic of Cresia. The entire planet of Cresia is divided into sixteen sectors at two polar regions, each governed by a province. Nine provinces are located in the Northern Hemisphere, the rest in the Southern Hemisphere.
GovernmentEdit
The Republic of Cresia is a federation of provinces. Its government comprises of three branches:
- Legislative: The bicameral Congress is comprised of the Senate and the Parliament.
- Executive: The president.
The provincial governments of Cresia are organized in a similar fashion. Their structure was standardized in the Treaty of Union.
- Legislative: The legislature is unicameral, comprising of a parliament.
- Executive: The governor.
ElectionsEdit
Elections are held in Cresia every five years. The terms for the president, senators, national MPs, governors, and provincial MPs are ten years, staggered in five-year intervals. The president and governors are limited to two terms, while the senators and the MPs are limited to three.
The government of Iscra follows a different election schedule for its own provincial government.
Political divisionsEdit
The Northern Hemisphere of Cresia. Clockwise from the top: Zinetia, Hartusa, Vendusa, Fessa, Avana, Juna, Lisea, Nixea. To the south (left) of Lisea is Rohenna. To the north (center) is the Northern Territory.
The Southern Hemisphere of Cresia. Clockwise from the top: Belsca, Promea, Enza, Serna, Ozerna, Thelda, Mirsa, Damacia. To the north (left) of Mirsa is Gesenna. To the south (center) is the Southern Territory.
Cresia is formed by 16 sovereign provinces, 2 non-sovereign provinces, 2 capital districts, and 1 associate state. The 16 sovereign provinces are considered republics in their own right, though they cannot establish foreign relations outside the Republic of Cresia. The 2 non-sovereign provinces occupy the Arctic and Antarctic regions of Cresia. The 2 capital districts are enclaves in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. Centered at 0.375π rad N and S, they cover a circle of 10 kdul each. The planet of Iscra is an associated state of Cresia. As its cold climate is nearly inhospitable to life, its population has remained relatively low.
As strict preservation is still a policy of Cresia, the only permanently inhabited part of each province is its respective capital. In practice, the capital is synonymous with the province.
GeographyEdit
Universe > Basilicus Prime Cluster > Basilicus Prime Galaxy > Erepacus Arm > Cresian Sector > Cresian System > Cresia
Cresia has two natural satellites.
- 1 Cresii II-I (Cresia I)
- 1 Cresii II-II (Cresia II)
Most of Cresia is a desert. The Cresian Desert is located around the equator of the planet. The desert extends as far north and south as 0.25π rad.
EnvironmentEdit
Cresia is largely a desert, with some large endorheic lakes termed seas. It has no global ocean.
FaunaEdit
The Cresian government has populated the planet with animals imported from Crystaldeep and Telios for their economic importance. Animals from Telios are: bati, finit, tal, and valaru.
Due to the scarcity of water on Cresia, direct importation of animals from other planets is prohibited. Each species undergoes a series of modifications for adaptation to the desert climate of Cresia before they are released into the wild.
FloraEdit
Among the plants imported from Telios are: alafa, asillon, cani, eona, fina, hantil, illan, jalisc, lita, melic, ularn, and vent.
EconomyEdit
Cresia has a market economy with high GDP per capita. The currency of Cresia is the Cresian Currency Unit (crescu). The largest stock exchanges of Cresia are the Avanan Stock Exchange (Bourse of Avana) and the Belscan Stock Exchange (Bourse of Belsca). As of 34979, Cresia is the third largest economy—after Kelos and Nivalla—and has the second highest per capita GDP (PPP) at ₵21,755—after Nivalla—in Kelosian Space.Product.

We really like this game...noticed that a lot of people didn't like the two-person game...not sure what the actual rules for the two-person game are 'cause we've been using a dutch version and can't read the rules (we were taught by our friend)..but we made up a two-person version that we think is reasonable...Each player plays two colors, alternate placing of towns and taking turns, player cannot trade with himself but can use monopoly card to transfer a resource, play each color to 7 points...
Siedler has definitely turned into a favorite between me and my friends. We are so hooked on this game, that we have already purchased the expansion set to allow more than 4 people to play. The interesting thing about the expansion set is that the rules change a bit, so the game goes much faster.
We have the German edition, which we think compared to the English version, is much more colorful. But I guess if you cannot read German, you might have a problem.
I was first introduced to this game by a friend who brought it back from Germany. I was hooked from the beginning!
Then I went there myself for a few months. Needless to say, this provided many hours of entertainment with friends I made there. A great bonding time! It is challenging and exciting!
Don't get me wrong. I loved this game the first 15 or 20 times I played it. (And for me, getting 15 or 20 playings out of a game is Nirvana.) But it has a significant problem.
In general, assuming relatively normal distribution of die rolls, Siedler does a good job of rewarding skillful play and penalizing bad play, as a game should.
But in about one game in three, maybe one in four, at least one player will be completely, irretrievably hosed by the production dice roll. There's nothing that player can do to stand a chance of winning. It doesn't matter how well he picks his starting positions. It doesn't matter how sharp a trader he is. His settlements won't produce resources in usable or tradable quantities for the first 15-20 turns of the game.
When this happens, it's really not fun. And the game is not quick enough that you can just ride with it and say 'oh well, better luck next time.' And it happens more often than it should.
That said, most of the time this is an outstanding game. It's captivating, easy to learn, fun to play, offers a whole lot of interesting and competing choices, and has really attractive components. It's well worth owning and well worth playing.
In short, the game is simple to learn, and takes up about 2 hrs. That is good. However:
- A 2 person game is not fun. The game is very dependent on trade, and the trade concept is weak and poor compared to Advanced Civilization, for instance.
- The dice are too influential.
- The starting position influences 60% of your success.
- You can't blow up anything. It is all so constructive (made for families, the best market).
So it does NOT deserve all those stars, however it is a commercial success.
Mind you, the above concerns only the base board game.Service Dog Organization Invites Public to Los Angeles OfficeCanine Companions for Independence will host a special open house at its Los Angeles office at 2312 Westwood Boulevard on Sunday, December 12, 2010 from 1PM to 4PM.

“The experience forces you to get a deeper understanding,” Maaia explains. “You need to go back, to engage with the headlines, to think about the related issues. The stereotype of the nerdy academic who doesn’t shower, who can’t talk outside their field — it’s not true. People think of computer scientists that way, for example, but the computer scientists we’ve had on were the most eloquent and passionate about sharing their subject with the world.” Maaia talks about Fresh Air‘s Terry Gross as an inspiration, since she “makes the subject accessible, even when some answers might be over your head.” Grigsby cites Tom Ashbrook, of WBUR’s On Point, as an influence. “We’re sort of On Point meets Morning Becomes Eclectic, since that show also brings to light songs that aren’t widely heard.”
The other is Saturday afternoon’s Kittens vs. Godzilla:
Any Kittens vs. Godzilla listener will recognize the rhythm of this conversation, since all three of the team chat on-air about the music — Borzi at the deejay’s mic, Dadashi and Sloat sharing the couch mic — in the brief moments between tracks. There’s not much time for talk, though, since they’ve got so much to play: Each co-host comes prepared with music, and the show’s playlists are formed live by rotating evenly between each of their selections. This prompts friends listening in to match which host to which track. As all three are housemates sharing an Isla Vista residence with five other girls, those friends who happen to constantly be exposed to their particular musical preferences at home have a definite advantage.

ATLANTA – Out-of-state donations and business groups continue to fuel much of the campaign for changing the constitution so that a panel of state appointees could their last report in late August. In the latest report, 47 percent of the funds raised came from out of the state, including a $10,000 donation from the pro-business Americans for Prosperity organization in Arlington, Va., and $5,000 from an investment firm in Great Falls, Montana, the Davidson Companies.
Families for Better Public Schools drew a $10,000 check from the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, but 14 of its 31 donations came from other states. Meanwhile, a group called Committee for Educational Freedom that was organized months ago reported its first activity, and half of its four donations were from out of state, amounting to to oppose the amendment were educators or school administrators. However, one donor listed her occupation as "parent."
Don't expect to see a flood of television commercials about the issue since the campaigns for and against the charter-school amendment experienced modest fundraising. Proponents have raised $522,000 in.: I Feel So Very Windows

- The logo was designed with the help of Pentagram (designers of things like OLPC, MoMA, Citi, the Oprah Winfrey Show, Guitar Hero and others.
- Paula Scher of Pentagram asked, "your name is Windows. Why are you a flag?"
- " We did less of a re-design and more to return it to its original meaning and bringing Windows back to its roots – reimagining the Windows logo as just that – a window."
- MS was kind enough to show off its many Windows logos on its blog and the new one looks like Win 1.0 a bit

Anant Garg's method
.
Stanford researcher Jonathan Mayer's explanation of how he found the issue
.
- Stanford researcher Jonathan Mayer (and later confirmed by WSJ) found that Google's Doubleclick and Vibrant Media, Media Innovation Group, and PointRoll have used an iframe trick to set cookies in Safari that would otherwise be blocked. (This problem also occurs in IE6/7 but can be resolved by sending a P3P header.)
- Under its default settings, both the desktop and iOS versions of Safari only accept the files from sites that individuals specifically visit or interact with.
- developer Anant Garg first described the method in 2010, which uses a blank form sent in the background
- Google said in a statement that "the Journal mischaracterizes what happened and why. We used known Safari functionality to provide features that signed-in Google users had enabled. It's important to stress that these advertising cookies do not collect personal information."
- an update to Webkit that closes the loophole—and was prepared by two Google engineers—could be incorporated into future versions of Safari.
- The Consumer Watchdog advocacy group today asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Google violated a previous privacy agreement with the FTC
Essentially as I understand it,Safari blocks 3rd-party cookies by default, however third-party cookies are allowed when a form is posted. Google wanted to include +1 buttons in ads, but since doubleclick and G+ are at different domains, they used the form posting function to make the connection. Google claims this had the unintended side effect of allowing other cookies to be set from other advertising. Google has shut off the form and is actively removing the cookies that were set unintentionally.

The Washington Post reports the New York Times is angry with Apple. A NYT source tells the Post that, “They [Apple] are playing access journalism...I’ve heard it from people inside Apple: They said, look, you guys are going to get less access based on the iEconomy series.” The "iEconomy series" refers to the Times piece about Foxconn factory conditions in China where iPads are assembled. The Wall Street Journal was granted access to Mountain Lion in advance of its release and scored an interview with Apple CEO, Tim Cook.

Members of the University of Minnesota's College of Science and Engineering have devised a low-cost way to find you based on your GSM cell phone. Attackers call the target's phone number several times, hanging up in about 5 seconds each time so that the phone doesn't ring. However it's enough time to see the cell tower page the phone using some open source monitoring software, as long as both attacker and target are in the same area known as an LAC for Location Area Code (different from a phone number's area code).
.
- When a cell phone is called the tower sends out a page containing a temporary MSI or Mobile Subscriber Number - not the customer's phone number, this temporary MSI changes often (but not often enough it seems)
- attackers also within the tower range of the victim can eavesdrop on these TMSI pages
- after several attempts attackers can figure out which TMSI is associated with their victim
- requires a cheap hacked Nokia feature phone, special cable and some open source software to pull off
- Only works against targets connected to GSM networks and configured to communicate over 2G networks: e.g. iPhones
- AT&T and Nokia have been notified

Hi everyone I love your show, I listen everyday. What struck me as interesting in your recent story about the next version of OS X is it's expected release date, sometime in the summer. I was thinking that this would likely coincide with a refresh of the Mac Book and Mac Book Air line of computers. If this happens then it is likely that Apple would leave the iPhone update to the fall so as to spread out it's product launches. This would be in opposition to what many people think, that the new iPhone would be launched in June. I was wondering what you guys thought about this as a likely scenario? Keep up the good job.

Hey guys and Sarah. Have you ever heard of an electric cooperative. If not, they are customer owned electric companies. There are also telephone cooperatives in areas of the country. Why don't people in rural areas form there own ISP cooperatives. Other cooperatives were formed when rural areas were underserved with electricity or phone service so why couldn't ISP's be formed. The infrastructure for supplying internet service is cheaper than it has ever been so now would be the time to do it. Also cooperatives are not meant to make a profit just provide the infrastructure and maintain it. Just sayin'
Thanks

Two Chinese Bond Auctions Fail
And while the US is no longer allowed to auction off debt, in China the PBoC appears to be no longer able to auction off debt.. The central bank also raised banks’ RRRs by 0.5 percentage points on the same day, effective May 18, the fifth consecutive month its has raised RRRs this year." And so the Catch 22 emerges: the more China fights inflation through RRR or rate hikes, the lower the purchasing power of domestic banks to purchase bonds (and yes, the US deficit is just a few hundred billions dollars too wide for it to come to China's rescue). Should the "15 minute" inflationary conundrum continue to express itself, and China be forced to rise rates even longer, very soon the country, just like the US to which it is pegged monetarily, will also be unable to raise any incremental capital.
More from the article:
Analysts had reckoned the restart of three-year bill issuance had satisfied banks’ needs to reinvest in the product as the bills were the major kind of bills to mature in May, the paper said.
Besides, the central bank had been net injecting funds in the past three weeks after it squeezed the volume of the one-year bills to RMB 30 billion in the recent issuance on May 10, and the restart of the issuance of three-year bills was seen as the central bank’s attempt to strengthen its open market operations.
The market generally believed that the influence of the central bank’s open market operations had weakened recently and the diversification in tools used would help drain liquidity.
The restart of three-year bills was considered an appropriate tool in the central bank’s measures to drain liquidity, and the central bank would be more prudent in using RRRs after the resumption of three-year notes as the RRRs had already reached a record level before its fifth hike this month.
After the most recent RRR hike, China’s biggest banks will be required to put aside 21% of their deposits in reserve, based on earlier announcements made by the central bank.
Compounded by the effect of the three-year bills, the consecutive increases in RRRs have brought “real and heavy pressure” on small and medium-sized lenders, the paper said.
“We thought the central bank might want to rely more on open market operations and there would be less chance of an additional hike in RRRs this month after the restart of three-year bills… but the recent RRR hike really surprised the market and completely reversed investors’ earlier optimistic expectations,” an unnamed bank trader was quoted as saying.
And it's about to get worse: those who remember our charts from early this year showing the one week repo rate exploding ti 7%+, well: we are about to have a case of deja vu.
A large commercial lender, which used to be a fund provider, has started borrowing from the interbank market after the RRR hikes, another banker, who was not named, was cited as saying.
“Repurchase rates may surge this week as the latest RRR hike will take effect on May 18, and the stringent market conditions will last for the next two months,” the analyst was quoted as saying.
A recent China International Capital Corp. report estimates that the seven-day repo rate, which reflects money supply in the market, may top 4% at some points and will remain above 3% for a relatively long period.
Bottom line, don't expect a bounce in the SHCOMP any time soon.

My very unpopular view is that many multinational corporations are going to get burned long and hard on their infrastructure investments in China.
Bank.
Bill Gross must have gotten word that the Chairman was displeased.
take notes Tim
Failed auctions = Real rates will soon be positive = The Chinese will stop buying PMs.
Goodbye gold, Goodbye silver.
Congrats on getting it completely backwards you dumb fuck.
Making sense is not part of MethMan's agenda. It's all about spreading FUD for his corporate masters.
Hey, MethMan, is that line part of the daily update you were mailed from your "marketing" employer today?
Why all the vitriole? Is it possible he has a point? All the anger sounds like some pretty defensive PM investors. There is a region where MathMan is right. If people believe in inflation but not in currency collapse they seek yield. That describes my parents. This is how they're investing their retirement funds. That is the Bernank's target region. Other investors, like me, believe he'll overshoot.
It is important to be asking why your investment thesis may be wrong. I'm glad you're here MathMan. I want to see what you have to say.
he is right. but real interest rates will not become positive in an inflationary environment
The only ones who have it wrong are you guys...
The Chinese and the Indians are the largest buyers of PMs - BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN INFLATION PROBLEM.
Real rates are negative - they have no choice but to buy hard assets.
Failed auctions mean investors are demanding higher rates...and that real rates will soon be postive.
Positive real rates will DESTROY precious metal demand from India and China.
And thus the price. Not to mention the impending collapse of the commodities market that will squash US inflation expectations.
From the 'bible' on hyperinflations:
Where do come up with this shit? Do you read anything posted here on ZH?
I don't think you do. In fact, I'm sure of it.
then real rates will never be permitted to be positive, because failure to grow = implosion.
Reuters;
Mathman gored by SilverRhino.
Meaningless drivel, as if PM values are only relevant to whether or not China is buying them? Hold whatever paper you want.
Meth much?
Remind me again, what happens when people lose faith in currency? The stop buying ______ and start buying ______?
They stop buying popsicles and start buying bubble gum.
I'm all out of bubble gum.
Although now that I think about it I shouldn't be surprised but... I was surprised that came from a movie rather than Duke Nukem....
Your face. Your ass. What's the difference?
"They Live" is EXCELLENT. One of the greatest fight scenes in western cinema.
Time for Chinese banks to dump reserves yielding a negative real rate to make room for Central Committee mandated purchases.
Real rates are negative, therefore they will soon be positive?
lol
China might have to sell some treasuries so they can buy their own paper?
We are drowning in debt. People are looking for a sandy beach.
Hey Tyler, Bill Gross just "spoke" about you over on CNBC
Said some blogger, misconception
Hehe, just watched the video from CNBC posted here, didn't realize he was talking about the Tylers!!!
It just means the Chinese don't have enough leverage over their primary dealers.........or who or whatever serves the function of drinking all the debt served with the noodles.
It's called Blow Back, bitchezzz
Or look up Newton's 3 law of physics
They will fully monetize their debt...just like the Bernank. Ultimaely this will be very good for PMs as the intellectually sleepy of the world come to realize the pervasive fraud of central banks.
FYI: China is not the US. They can't "fully monetize their debt" while maintaining the peg. The problem they are having right now is one of liquidity caused by the raising of banks' reserve requirements.
Amen on the eveilness of CB however.
They cant auction off 1 year debt? Wow amazing. I guess theyll dump the remainder of their worthless UST's now.
+69
Not a chance!
They only survive complete economic ruin if they maintain a suppressed currency.
They know the endgame is a rising yuan. They are trying to keep the rise as slow as possible.
Yes absolutely. Ben's playing Currency Chicken, trying to get the Yuan's rise to accelerate in order to rein in US current account deficit. He knows this will cause pain to China by way of inflation. Right now the Chinese are trying to suppress inflation through traditional means (rising RR & intersts rates), but nothing can be done with the cost pull inflation caused by the falling USD-Peg. China is clinging to the US tooth & nail, and Ben has jumped in the water with an air tank. It's only a matter of time when China has to let go to get some air, or drown.
Check the Yuan's peg. This will signal an end to PM's raise, unless this chicken game ends in a head-on crash. In that case, holding physical will might you.
America haters like to ignore that we have the advantage in this game and china is weak and about to implode the greatest malinvestment bubble in history.
America haters may try to ignore the truth, but the chinese government is well aware of their disadvantaged position.
The Treasury Bubble?

Chinese hard landing anyone?
Bbbbut....I thought the yuan was the new reserve currency!??!!
As far as monetization of debt is concerned, the Bernank and the Jeetner has a scam going on:
1. Geetner prints treasuries and sells them to primary dealers
2. Bernank prints federal reserve notes and buys from primary dealer
Those two have a stealth, incestous relationship.
The problem for the Chinese is that their Ministry of Finance doesn't issue bonds, the the central bank (PBOC) does. So if they want to monetize, this is what they need to do:
1. Zhou xiaochuan prints bonds and sells them to commercial banks
2. Zhou xiaochuan then prints RMB yuan and buys from commercial banks
That wouldn't be stealthy incest at all. It's more like masturbation in public

Forthcoming EventsACC M5: 03.04.14 EditionPosted by Matt Patton on March 4th, 2014
- Backing the Pack: I (like many) had been on the fence about ACC Player of the Year. No more. TJ Warren put away the competition (Jabari Parker and KJ McDaniels) with a 41-point outburst Monday night at Pittsburgh. In the process, the Wolfpack welcomed the Panthers to the bubble and managed to keep their own postseason dreams alive, if only by a thread. Warren did it all offensively against Jamie Dixon’s team. He knocked down 30-footers at the end of the shot clock; he got to the line; and he showed off some mid-range game.
- Duke Basketball Report: Virginia clearly won the regular season crown, but who is the best team in the ACC? There’s not a good answer. Duke probably has the highest ceiling (when shots are falling, obviously), and Syracuse has the most depth, but Virginia‘s consistency makes them a very safe bet. This is shaping up to be a really fun ACC Tournament in Greensboro next week. Potentially three schools playing for the final #1 seed or the best #2 seed, and four schools needing wins in the worst kind of way.
- USA Today: Good profile on Tyler Ennis from Nicole Auerbach. It’s funny that he was the super-talkative kid when he seems so quiet as a player. Also interesting is that he spent his middle school days dominating indoor lacrosse. Ennis has looked more like a freshman down the stretch, though. Jim Boeheim needs to make sure he’s not wearing down, because as Fran Fraschilla points out in the article, there isn’t anyone else. The one player the Orange can’t replace in their lineup is Ennis. He has to be at the top of his game for Syracuse to make it to Dallas.
- Sports Illustrated: Joe Harris was a diamond in the rough. As a freshman and sophomore he took a small (mostly scoring) role on decent teams. Now he’s the backbone of the Cavaliers. He nearly always draws the opponent’s best perimeter player on top of his already significant scoring load. Here’s to hoping Harris gets a shot to show the country just how good Virginia basketball has gotten over the past couple of seasons.
- Raleigh News & Observer: Roy Williams is getting a lot of unbiased, third party advice on free throw shooting. It’s true the Tar Heels have been historically bad from the charity stripe this season, but I’m not sure taking a few more reps after practice is going to fix the problem. And with their two primary ball-handlers making free throws, their struggles may in fact largely be overrated.Christening Mug

Hell's Haunted Palace (2013)
Roger Corman’s Hell’s Haunted Palace is getting some buzz around the internet but based on the trailer, I am not too sure what I think just yet. Here’s crossing my fingers hoping that the horror film that gets released is worth watching, it is produced by Roger Corman after all. At the end we get to see the evil awaiting and I am digging the feel they are going for but I feel the trailer or CGI may be off and needs some reworking..

Saw Star Trek the other night. Maybe 6 people for 7 pm weeknight showing. Can’t beat the price, including easy freeway access, validated covered parking across the street and student discounts with id. Hope it can survive the 14 screens and 3800 seats Regal multiplx at LA Live when they open later this year.
Here are some photos from last weekend. The box office is down in the hole:

Sad, sad, sad. Bummer about it finally closing. Knew it was going to happen for quite some time, but thought maybe it could hold on even with the ugly Regal 14 theaters opening soon. I won’t be giving my money to the Regal – I hate these supermarket theater establishments and the cel phone people are rude as can be. Loved the Laemmle Grande. Was there when it opened in 1984 and saw “Carmen” and many, many other films during it’s 25 years of operation. I’ll hate to see it go. I’ll be by one last time to say good-bye before they close their doors. God speed.
Closing is tomorrow:
Good-Bye Grande 4-Plex and thanks for 25 years of memories.
I guess it’s time to change the status above to closed now.
I saw “Titanic” at the Grande 4-Plex. It wasn’t the most memorable theater but it served a purpose for a while that no other did; to bring first-run films to downtown Los Angeles.
Well,at least they thought enough of the moviegoers to thank them for supporting the Grande.So many theatres don’t even do that.
You are so right.Holiday Gift Guide: For The Young Adult Fans On Your List Young Adult reader in your life …
Novel Ideas:
Hey, allowance only goes so far when buying books (and every booklover knows, it never goes far enough) so thrill the reader on your list by picking them up one of these snazzy gift sets! You are sure to score a smile with the Hunger Games Box Set from Suzanne Collins, but if your reader is already wise to the ways of Katniss and co., there are many other options out there. The fantasy lover is sure to enjoy the Christopher Paolini box set. This Cassandra Clare e-book collection will thrill the adventure seeking paranormal reader. But if your reader prefers a contemporary story, you’ll be a star with either this Pretty Little Liars set, this Gallagher Girls set or this Gossip Girl book bundle. Alternatively, you can keep it classic by gifting this fantastic (and shockingly inexpensive) collection of LM Montgomery works — including the Anne of Green Gables tales that made her famous!
And just like there are a variety of books, there are a variety of bookplates for every reader’s growing library. For the fantasy fan we love this epic looking Bird Queen and these vintage Jungle plates. The mystery reader will get inspired by this Magnifying Glass design that proudly pronounces who the book belongs to. Alternatively, the contemporary reader will adore this collection of preppy and fun plaid woodland animal plates. And we think that the paranormal enthusiast it could go either way, for the dark and disturbing tales, these masquerading women will inspire gothic daydreams but the reader who seeks softer supernatural stories is likely to prefer these fairies. And of course you can always opt to stay genre-neutral with these classic ex libris plates, the timeless Alice in Wonderland inspired prints or this fun personalized stamp.
For The Pop Culture Junkie:
We’ll let you in on a little secret, lots of YA fans are also pretty big make-up fans! We’ve got some cool themed make-up that will help the teen booklover in your life (even if she’s, you know, strictly-speaking not a teen anymore) look totally rad as she’s flipping those pages and attending the big-screen versions of her favorite books. Because let us not forget, 2012 is the year that is going to bring us The Hunger Games movie and the finale for the Twilight franchise!
Don’t you think it would be great for your YA book lover to head to the theater to check out Jennifer Lawrence’s Katniss in these Capitol-approved nail colors? Get these and the odds will most definitely always be in your favor, gift giver. Unfortunately, they are not in stores yet, but you can always gift a clever I-O-U, perfect for a gift topper to stocking stuffer! And to check out Bella and Edward’s last stand, the book lover in your life needs (yes, needs) this magnetic nail polish sold at Sephora. You read that right, magnetic. You apply the polish and then wave a magnet over it to get waves of color change. She’ll be the coolest kid in class … or, you know, the office. While you’re in the makeup aisle, any young (or young at heart) lady in your life clearly, clearly must have this Miss Piggy Make Up set from Mac. All you need is some fake eyelashes, some liquid eye liner and the perfect pink shadow to get that most perfect pig’s peepers (you can pair it with this hilarious “You call that a pocket?” Muppets tee for maximum effect).
But gifting make-up is not the only way you can make the holidays bright for a YA fan who loves pop culture. The Harry Potter enthusiast will appreciate this Ollivander Wand Shop practice wand, a Hogwarts Express ticket and from the truly crafty gifter a homemade Golden Snitch ornament. The Gleek on your list will love this Dalton Warblers Uniform long sleeve tee paired with a McKinley Football iPhone cover and this Trouty Mouth mug which references one of the show’s beloved Lady Gaga music-inspired episodes.
Make the Past The Present With These Great Gifts:
If your life has been graced by a reader who would rather be living in a different era, never fear, we have a fantastic selection of gifts that will delight and amaze. You can help make her room an oasis of historical artifacts with this 1893 piece of art called “The Interrupted Festival” that was taken from an actual publication of the era. Or gift her a portrait of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (better known as Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein and daughter of Mary Wollstonecraft, the famous women's rights advocate). But if your giftee’s walls are too cluttered, you can opt for this magnet of two historical children at play, which would go nicely gifted with this serving platter with a historical-looking birdcages pattern.
She’s also sure to appreciate a gift that will spirit her away from the hustle and bustle of modern life. You can make sure she starts each day in the historical frame of mind with this set of classic-looking makeup brushes that are topped with miniature goddesses and come in a smart carrying case. If you don’t want to go all in and give her a Tudor dress, like this one in wine and black, you can still help your giftee wear her historical pride all day long in the form of these cute cameo earrings or this necklace that calls to mind the hunting lodges of yore (that’s “yesterday” for those of you who don’t speak the history lovers’ lingo). But RT’s Whitney says, if it’s true that the best things take time, there’s no better gift than this Jane Austen cuff-style bracelet, that has Mr. Darcy’s declaration of love inscribed over text from the chapter.
There's Nothing Mysterious About Why We Love These Presents:
If you’ve got a YA mystery lover on your list, one who has aspirations of joining a league of spies (or at the very least uncovering who killed their neighbor’s beloved pooch), then treat your giftee to some of these murder, mayhem, suspense and strategy-inspired selections. You can help them get all “purloined letter” about their future plans for many acts of ninja-ness by gifting them this Stealth Attack tee from Threadless. Or help them face their fear of the shower (Thanks, Psycho) with this fantastic Killer shower curtain, which has see-through windows so that a bather can check for serial killers. Alternatively, if your loved one is worried about being forced on the run, they will need provisions — namely edible ones: like bottled water and these tactical sandwiches, which come in pepperoni and honey BBQ beef flavors, and more importantly, have a shelf life of two years, making it the perfect food for taking on the run, stocking a bunker or throwing in a backpack. And if your teen is working on recruiting minions and has a plan to become an evil mastermind, then this War Games laptop case is the perfect way to help them say, “check mate”.
Unusual Gifts For Those Who Love A Supernatural Story:
Your favorite Twi-hard will win the prize for “most devoted fan” when they slip on these custom Converse All Star shoes that have hand-painted images from the popular vampire meets girl series. And this “Blah, Blah, Vampire Emergency, Blah” pin may be meant for a True Blood fanatic, but we think it’s perfect for anyone who isn’t afraid of the things that go bump in the night. A younger reader, or a kitsch-loving older one, is sure to appreciate these Monster High Dolls, which are companions to Lisi Harrison’s Monster High series. We can’t decide which mini-monster we like best but we love the idea of topping the gift with a pair of these matching hot pink Monster High Skull Earbuds. Meanwhile, Emily the Strange fan in your life will flip for these Mimobot flash drives, and although the original is cute, the Save Yourself Drive is by far the most fun. And any fan of Richelle Mead’s Vampire Academy series is sure to appreciate this I “Stake” Strigoi mug. And we suggest that you pair any gift above with these silly chocolate zombie heads that come complete with a red cherry center!
For Those That Prefer Realistic (And Often Romantic) Reads:
Contemporary readers are sometimes difficult to please, but we know that these clever fish tank half bookends look like they’ve been stolen from the cover of one of your reader’s favorite stories. (RT’s Morgan reminds you, if you purchase this gift you should also remember to pick up some fish food … and the fish!) However, if you’d rather give a gift that does not involve living animals, we also have some fantastic selections from you. There’s this romantic print of a young couple sitting together, which is perfect for any bedroom, dorm room or common space. Alternatively, a giftee who loves love will be enchanted by this pillow set that features a pair of long-distance loves. But if your loved one’s living space is all filled up, then maybe a tee-shirt is a better route. You can help them express their heart’s desire with Threadless’ Start A Romance tee or this Sing A Song Of Freedom shirt as a caged bird channels teen angst. And if your giftee like to get crafty in the kitchen, then inspire their passion with a set of preppy penguin salt and pepper shakers, these moustache cookie cutters and a tin of cupcake mints that all look like they were lifted off the cover of a contemporary YA tale!
Fantastical Gifts For The Whimsical Soul:
It may be challenging to shop for a loved one who sometimes seems like a changeling, left by fairies, or plucked from a different dimension. But, these gifts are sure to suit the young (or young at heart) fantasy reader in your life. For example, this tee shirt has us dreaming of a wildly different world, one where penguins do really fly by our windows in droves. Alternatively, this “caught a whale of a tale” laptop case puts everything in perspective, but reminds us that things are not always what they seem … For a nautically fantastical gift, you can pair the laptop case with this mug that has a sneaky octopus hiding inside. Meanwhile if you’d prefer to keep your gift more kitchen-y, we suggest you add an Alien Attack Salt and Pepper combo and this candy unicorn horn to your gift. But if you want to take home the gold star of gifting, wow your loved one with this giant mushroom side table, a piece that is both useful and an excellent conversation starter — not to mention the amount of envy it will surely inspire!
Presents That Defy Categorization:
There’s no doubt in our mind that every YA fan will love the following four gifts. For the perpetually sleepy, we bring you Shower Shock, it’s caffeinated body wash (something RT’s Elisa wishes was around while she was in high school and college). This adorable Threadless tee, features a giraffe with almost more books than it can carry — perfect for the reading rabbit in your life. Alternatively, you can encourage someone’s interest in publishing with Whatcha Mean, What’s a Zine: The Art of Making Zines and Mini Comics. Or you can help your loved one join the YA Saves movement with this beautiful piece of art that includes snippets of different peoples’ tweets about how Young Adult literature changed their life.

Red Angus cattle are known for practical and profitable traits such as excellent mothering ability, improved uniformity and marketability in crossbred calf crops, superior carcass quality, moderate size, lower maintenance energy requirements, and gentle dispositions.
But the popularity of the breed extends beyond the valuable production traits that commercial cattlemen appreciate to the industry leadership and marketing services that have placed Red Angus as the cornerstone of today’s beef industry.
Red Angus’ tradition of progressive leadership has positioned the breed at the forefront of the industry and set the standard for which other breeds follow.
Established in 1954, the Red Angus Association of America (RAAA) was the first breed based on performance testing versus simple visual appraisal. It was also the first breed to promote crossbreeding and open use of AI technology. RAAA was the first breed association to establish mandatory Total Herd Reporting that requires performance data through weaning.
The association was also the first to negotiate a valuebased grid with a major packer, establish a USDA- Verified Program that proves source and genotype, the first to utilize performance data in the show ring, the first to release a Maintenance Energy EPD, and the first to base all its EPDs on the principle of Economic Relevant Traits.
Feeder Calf Certification Program
One of the greatest benefits of using Red Angus genetics is the Commercial Marketing Programs that are free for all Red Angus customers to use. The cornerstone of Red Angus Commercial Marketing Programs is the Feeder Calf Certification Program (FCCP), or the “Yellow Tag” program as it is commonly referred to. FCCP was created in 1995 and is the industry’s most experienced source-verified program. It identifies “Angus” genetics through genotype versus a phenotypic hide color.
Today, FCCP is a USDA Process-Verified Program that substantiates the source and age components for Country-of-Origin Labeling claims. Now over a decade old, FCCP has enrolled over 1 million head of cattle from more than 3,000 producers.
Calves enrolled in FCCP wear the “Yellow Tag” and qualify for export to the Pacific Rim countries, opening up greater market opportunities and giving feeder cattle buyers increased incentives to pay premiums on Red Angus-sired FCCP cattle.
The Red Angus breed offers all these benefits for only the cost of the ear tags— there are no enrollment fees or hidden charges. RAAA is currently running a special sale on the FCCP yellow tags through March 31 for only 99 cents for the visual dangle tag or $3 for the Visual/RFID combo tag.
Pro-Cow Program
The Pro-Cow Program is another major element of Red Angus’ Commercial Marketing Programs. Pro- Cow was established to draw industry attention to, and facilitate the sale of, replacement-quality Red Angus-influenced commercial females. This free service enables buyers to locate females that fit their program and sellers the opportunity to promote females they have available.
Since September 2003, over 100,000 open and bred heifers, bred cows and pairs have been listed or sold through Pro-Cow. Pro-Cow also serves as a value-added program by increasing the premiums buyers pay producers for the female side of their calf crop. It’s not uncommon for heifers to out sell their steer mates at feeder calf and video sales across the country because buyers place premiums on the heifers as replacement females.
Feeder calf sales
To assist Red Angus customers in marketing their calves, and help potential buyers find the quality cattle they are seeking, RAAA offers several media outlet options.
Red Angus marketing staff works with sale barns and market auctions across the country to schedule FCCP sales that increase the number of Red Angus-sired calves marketed, while attracting additional buyers by increasing the volume of quality calves offered in one sale. An outgrowth of the FCCP sales in auction barns is the inclusion of special Red Angus sections in various video sales. Superior Livestock Auction, Northern Livestock Video Auction and Hodge Livestock Network all held special Red Angus sections in their 2008 sales and are planning more for 2009.
RAAA advertises these marketing options on their Web site, through the American Red Angus magazine, and various other printed agriculture publications.
Red Angus Feeder
Fax Producers who are marketing feeder cattle can utilize the Red Angus Feeder Fax, a bulletin-based e-mail that the association sends out to active Red Angus buyers across the country. Whether cattlemen are selling calves or yearlings through sale barns, video or private treaty, they can use the Feeder Fax to draw additional interest in their calves.
Red Angus Stockyards
The Red Angus Stockyards is a Web-based listing service that allows customers to list their sale cattle or search for Red Angus genetics. The site is designed as a means of connecting buyers and sellers while adding additional value to their cattle.
Feedlot Partners
RAAA provides a special service to Red Angus customers searching for retained ownership possibilities through the Feedlot Partners listing on the Red Angus Web site. Feedlot Partners lists feed yards that feed Red Angus-sired calves. The list includes contact information, special services they provide, programs they offer, financial assistance, and any gridbased marketing options.
RAAA also works to add value for the cattle feeders who purchase Red Angus cattle by ensuring that all of the major packers recognize the added value inherent in cattle wearing the FCCP tag. These added-value options work to increase the premiums paid to Red Angus feeders and customers retaining ownership through the production chain.
The Red Angus marketing team has increased its allocated resources in 2009 to make certain Red Angus customers receive the greatest possible return on their investment—superior Red Angus genetics. If you have questions about the Red Angus Commercial Marketing Programs, please call Clint Berry or Myron Edelman at 940/387-3502, visit the Red Angus Web site at redangus.org, or email clint@redan gus.org or myron@redangus. org. — Clint Berry, RAAA Commercial Marketing DirectorMonthly Archive for March, 2008

Album Review
Neil Zaza comes from the school of Steve Vai and Joe Satriani. The thing is, he has learned his lesson well enough to bring into question who should be the teacher and who the student. Indeed, Zaza's sound encompasses that classic rock textured guitar instrumental type of music. It does, however, seem to have an energy and enthusiasm that are sometimes missing from the aforementioned guitarists' work. It has all the technical skill, but with a wonderful taste and fire that are sometimes lacking in the music of Vai and Satriani. Zaza is not tied to just those two guitarists for inspiration, though; from time to time you might hear sounds that call to mind musicians such as Edgar Winter, Steve Howe, and Carlos Santana. Add to that mix the killer Journey rhythm section of Steve Smith and Ross Valory and you can really see what makes this disc such a special work. Among the highlights of the CD is a wonderful take on Prince's "Purple Rain," with the guitar taking the vocal line on this instrumental arrangement. If your taste runs to guitar heroes, do yourself a favor and check this one out. You will be pleased.

You have to classify this one as adding insult to injury:
The Massachusetts state agency responsible for unemployment insurance and employment services admitted yesterday that its servers had been infected by a new strain of a particularly nasty virus that may have allowed attackers to make off with as many as 225,000 records on those receiving unemployment insurance and their former employers.
Records that may have been compromised contain Social Security Numbers, employer identification numbers, confidential work and salary histories, email addresses and street addresses of both the unemployed and former employers.
The Mass. Office of Labor and Workforce Development (OLWD) announced a version of the W32.qakbot virus had been introduced into as many as 1,500 computer terminals, including both those used by employees and those available to job-seekers at local customer-service offices.
The agency shut down external access to infected systems immediately after learning of the infection on April 20. It used software and direct support from Symantec to clean up the virus – successfully, it thought.
Monday the agency discovered the infection had not been eradicated. It respawned, reinfected the agency's computers and kept on about its business until OLWD shut the system down for a more thorough cleaning.
Qakbot is known as being particularly effective at scarfing up detailed financial data from secure systems, most often in banks.
Rather than crack back-end databases itself, Qakbot remains on infected workstations, recording keystrokes to identify and mail home usernames, passwords and any other data used or viewed by workers at an infected workstation.
The extraordinarily unprepared state agency has no way to figure out which records might have been compromised, but warns that anyone who came in to an OLWD office or even phoned one could be at risk if an employee pulled up their personal records at any time during April and May.
Employers who walked in to an OLWD office to file required quarterly employment reports in person – rather than automatically online – may also be at risk.
The agency put up a page with instructions on how clients can protect themselves from identity theft (maybe not go to a state agency?), but gave no information about any new precautions of its own except to promise it had asked the Mass. Attorney General's Cyber Crime Unit, the Office of Consumer Affairs and the FBI to investigate.
On its own account, the agency promised that "all steps possible are being taken to avoid any future recurrence."
It's not surprising OWLD had trouble getting rid of the virus, according to security researcher Roel Schouwenberg of Kaspersky Labs, as quoted by WBUR.org.
“These days, whenever I hear of a big corporate infection that’s very hard to get rid of, and people are struggling, I immediately think of Qakbot,” he said.
The agency is cleaning out its workstations one at a time, but has no estimate for how long that will take.
So. It's good to know that at least it was a quality virus that caused the trouble, rather than the face-palm-inspiring carelessness that allowed the Texas State Comptroller's office to leave unencrypted personal records of 3.5 million people on a public Web server for more than a year.
According to a 2009 study from Ponemon Institute, the threat from both viruses and carelessness is high in government agencies.
Eighty seven percent of IT people in government agencies responding to a survey believe too many people have access to sensitive information that is not required for their jobs.
Seventy-two percent of responding organizations said they can't close down employee access accounts quickly enough to ensure security when someone quits.
Fifty-nine percent or organizations don't have or don't enforce data-access policies; 65 percent don't have enough IT staff to enforce security; 37 percent allow business units with no security responsibility to grant and administer access to secure data.
Only 32 percent said they have good enough visibility across all their accounts to be confident their user access is secure, or at least secure enough to comply with security policies.
Not good. Really bad, in fact. Unfortunately, "really bad" is consistent with the security situation we learn about after nearly every data breach– not only at the organization that's been breached, but the rest of its industry as well.
There's a lot of hand wringing after every new incident. So far no one has come up with a good solution – or even suggested one – that might give potential victims greater control over their own information or more assurance that, if careless caretakers do let sensitive data escape, it will be difficult enough to extract or unencrypt to provide some protection.PwC has the knowledge and experience necessary to help companies and organisations both large and small.

Don built Granite Broadcasting into the largest TV group in the country controlled by an African American. In this 2000 piece from TVWeek’s predecessor, Electronic Media, we read how Don handled an earlier bumpy situation.]
By Diane Mermigas, Editor at Large , New York
ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED April 17, 2000
The maverick tendencies of Granite Broadcasting Corp. Chairman and CEO W. Don Cornwell and his longtime partner, Granite President Stuart Beck, are being put to the ultimate test.
Granite’s stock has plunged, closing at $53/8 a share Friday, off a 52-week high of $141/2 amid criticism from rivals and investors for doing what many admit was inevitable: agreeing to a first-ever cash payment to acquire a major network affiliation, or what some have dubbed "reverse compensation."
"They [Granite] have single-handedly destroyed the value of the broadcasters," veteran media investor Mario Gabelli said recently.
Indeed, Standard & Poor’s recently lowered Granite’s corporate credit and bank loan ratings to single B from single B-plus.
The negative response to Granite’s bucking of conventional wisdom "has been absolutely staggering and amazing to us," Mr. Cornwell said in an interview.
Mr. Cornwell, 52, is a Harvard Business School graduate who first met Mr. Beck, an attorney, during an earlier 17-year investment stint at the Goldman, Sachs & Co. investment bank. But Cornwell has built his 12-year career in broadcasting on pushing the envelope, and he says he refuses to be riled by peers and investors who won’t change with the times.
"I’ve heard as much as I need to hear of people’s reactions," Mr. Cornwell said. "I’m obviously not getting a lot of applause."
Granite set off all the controversy by agreeing to pay about $362 million over 10 years to nab an NBC affiliation for KNTV in San Jose, Calif. That came after the intended new owners of KRON-TV in San Francisco, Young Broadcasting, refused to make a more modest payment to keep the Bay area Peacock affiliation.
But the flap is only the most recent and dramatic example of how Granite’s founding executives have sought to reshape the status quo in a sanguine broadcast industry where change comes neither easily nor quietly.
As a result of the affiliation fuss, Mr. Cornwell and Mr. Beck now divide their time and energy between innovative projects aimed at tapping into new digital spectrum and more pedestrian–but urgent–concerns such as pumping up Granite’s stock price and shepherding KNTV’s transformation. The VHF station first will make the unprecedented move from an ABC affiliate to an independent in July and then will become an NBC affiliate in January 2002.
No regrets
"I’m only going to flagellate myself so much," Mr. Cornwell said. "I care about this stock–everything I own is in it, which gives me a little under 10 percent with my options. I’m looking to push our stock price up, come hell or high water."
Industry sources say that could mean modifying the terms of the controversial affiliation arrangement.
Other antidotes could involve a stock buyback by Granite, or–more radically–some sort of merger.
Mr. Cornwell said the latter scenario is not out of the question, but no such plans are in the works.
"People have raised so much hell about these nine payments that in order to placate people, we may go to NBC and say we’re going to pay NBC everything upfront," Mr. Cornwell revealed. "We could borrow the money from banks or raise capital by issuing more stock. We are finding that we’re being forced to do uneconomic things to force the desire of everybody to fit the round peg into the round hole.
"Right now, our cost of capital is 91/2 or 10 percent. We have to ask ourselves whether we are willing to spend another $30 million to do that. We would have to negotiate a different deal with NBC," he said. "That isn’t happening right now."
Sources close to the situation say Granite could be helped if NBC were to publicly agree to extend its affiliation for KNTV beyond 2011 without requiring cash payments from Granite.
`First-mover’ penalty
Analysts and investors acknowledge that Granite appears to be suffering in part from its willingness to be a "first mover," blazing a new path that others will follow in time. All of the major broadcast networks have been hinting about lowering the compensation payments they’ve historically made to affiliates, though no one else has yet tried to ask for reverse compensation.
"[Granite] is being punished for being the first to deal with this issue head-on," said one industry analyst, speaking anonymously.
"Some investors we sit down with don’t want to hear about the positives, because the momentum and perception about the deal is so negative they don’t want to hear about it," Mr. Cornwell said.
"I don’t get the impression there is much we can do to change people’s minds, short of abandoning the deal," he added. "So, I’m not sure I want to burn up the goodwill I have at NBC trying to restructure this deal. I’d much rather make sure I deliver on my promise to shareholders."
Some observers believe the NBC-Granite deal still could be derailed or modified prior to full implementation. Some speculate that NBC could end up owning KRON. Young Broadcasting is slated to acquire the station from Chronicle Broadcasting this spring.
If Young’s deal with Chronicle were to collapse, it’s speculated NBC could acquire KRON itself. If that were to occur, the NBC affiliation for KNTV would be off, and NBC would pay Granite a fee.
"I think a lot of people are in the land of wishful thinking on this," Mr. Cornwell said. "They think that’s where this is going to land up. [But] NBC has been very honorable. If NBC ended up owning KRON, they would probably find a way to make us whole."
But even though Mr. Cornwell and Mr. Beck would like to put all the fuss behind them, the likelihood is that the KNTV deal could well determine Granite’s future business fortunes.
Analysts say Granite’s affiliation gives NBC enough warrants to buy an 18 percent stake in the company. Doing so could prompt a renegotiation of the affiliation agreement. Granite could sell to NBC or another company.
"We have said all along that if somebody comes to us with something attractive, we’re more than receptive," Mr. Cornwell said. "Historically, our perception of value is different than a lot of people. We’re not about to give anyone any bargains. We’re not conducting a fire sale of our assets. But if it makes sense to join forces with somebody, then we do it."
Industry rebel
Mr. Cornwell expressed pride in a history of iconoclastic thinking at Granite, taking credit for forward-thinking initiatives, including an early movement into Internet-related ventures.
"We do unconventional things; that’s how we got our biggest station in Buffalo for a very cheap price," he said. "And from our perspective, we have done the same things with San Francisco, although we’re not getting a lot of credit for it on Wall Street. We have tried to find ways to think outside the box in order to increase the value of our company to shareholders."
Granite acquired WKBW-TV in Buffalo, N.Y., in 1995 for about three-quarters the price fetched by comparable stations at the time by acquiring the previous owner’s outstanding debt.
Mr. Cornwell and Mrs. Beck launched Granite Broadcasting in 1988 with $45 million to acquire stations in Duluth, Minn., and Peoria, Ill., backed by a handful of original investors. Two of them–Goldman, Sachs and Oprah
Winfrey–continue with the company today.
Today, Granite includes a group of 10 network affiliates in eight markets, covering 7 percent of U.S. households and generating almost $200 million in annual revenue. Its two WB affiliates in Detroit and San Francisco are growing at an annual rate of about 24 percent.
Granite is operating or developing duopolies in San Francisco, Buffalo, Detroit and Fresno, Calif.
In 1997-1998, Granite snatched WB-affiliated stations in Detroit, WDWB-TV, and San Francisco, KBWB-TV, out from under rival Tribune Co. Granite initially was chastised by Wall Street for overpaying for the properties; it was heralded a year later when the stations began churning out profits and federal regulators agreed to allow market duopolies.
Took ABC’s cash
Last year, Granite turned a tenuous situation into a gain by agreeing to a $14 million payment from ABC for relinquishing its ABC affiliation for KNTV five years early. The Walt Disney Co. was intent on consolidating two Bay area affiliations into one at the time.
Granite’s TV station earnings margins fell to 28 percent in 1999 from closer to 40 percent prior to 1998. But its claim to fame remains improving the financial performance of stations within a year or two of taking them over.
It has relied on aggressive and creative sales of advertising time and use of promotions, improved local news and community affairs. For instance, Granite acquired KSEE-TV in Fresno for 32 times cash flow in 1993 and improved station performance within a year, enough to cut that comparison to a multiple of six.
When Granite sold its Austin, Texas, station, KEYE-TV, to CBS in 1999 for $160 million, it represented a $100 million return on investment after less than $10 million in capital upgrades since its 1995 acquisition. Still, the sale of KEYE significantly impacted Granite’s 1999 results, in which broadcast cash flow dropped to $57 million from $71.3 million a year earlier.
An important key to Granite’s boosting the value of its stations has been extending the properties’ local franchises, customer connections and advertiser relations. Those strides have been made through new technology and other innovative means, observers say.
Granite was the first broadcaster to provide local news content from its TV stations to Yahoo! in 1996 before the Internet giant went public. "But I made the mistake of not buying Yahoo! stock at the time," Mr. Cornwell conceded.
Granite itself was one of the first pure-play media companies to go public in 1992. Granite also was among the first broadcast groups to negotiate the right to televise local sports games over streaming media on the Internet.
Thinking, acting locally
Meanwhile, localism always has been at the heart of Granite’s operating strategy.
"The importance of your station locally ends up being the determining factor as to whether you win or lose," Mr. Cornwell said. "So, it’s no accident that in some of our smaller markets like Fort Wayne [Ind.] and Peoria [Ill.] where we have stations that are very important, we get a way-disproportionate share of the revenues as compared to what one would expect."
Meanwhile, the company’s broadened NBC relationship will provide new negotiating muscle for syndicated content acquisitions, the Granite chief said.
"If we hadn’t done the NBC deal, it would become harder for us to be competitive in the acquisition of program rights," he said.
Granite’s San Jose property is expected to generate $7 million to $9 million in annual cash flow as an independent, analysts say. They estimate that will jump to $36 million when KNTV becomes an NBC affiliate in 2002.
"We took this thing from Avenue B and put on its 57th and Fifth," Mr. Beck quipped. "It’s a grand slam anyway it comes down."
Granite plans to triple local news broadcast time at KNTV to nine daily hours this summer, doubling the news department’s budget and personnel. KNTV’s overall expense budget will double to about $30 million in two years, two-thirds of that tagged for news.
KNTV’s expanded news presence will service a soon-to-be relaunched regional Web site to be called AbouttheBay.com, which will be developed by Granite into a full-service Bay area portal supported by KNTV, KBWB and NBC. It also will integrate material from CNBC and MSNBC, while primarily serving as a local destination and city guide.
"It will feature NBC national news content and Granite’s local content and services," Mr. Beck said. "It will generate revenues and help create a new network-affiliate paradigm."
NBC’s investment will accelerate Granite’s local digital TV initiatives and already has assigned top cable, Internet, news, promotion, sales, technology and public relations executives from its ranks to assist Granite with various transitions.
NBC also is helping Granite negotiate with AT&T Corp. to expand the cable footprint of KNTV, Mr. Cornwell said. Granite will expand KNTV’s current facilities or move to a new location in downtown San Jose, he said.
But Granite is not waiting for its NBC affiliation in San Jose to become official before brainstorming its use of the digital spectrum.
It recently organized the Broadcaster’s Digital Cooperative to collectively lease and program spectrum across hundreds of local stations in at least 132 markets.
The new group is expected to call on Microsoft Corp., AT&T, Intel Corp., Yahoo! and other media giants that have expressed interest in acquiring expanded spectrum through channel auctions.
"People are really bogged down in old models, and it’s really been hard to get people to think about anything new," Mr. Cornwell said. "So, it’s taken little bitty Granite, in an industry rapidly consolidating, to get the broadcasters together to cooperatively pool and sell digital spectrum."
Digital
KNTV is the first U.S. TV station to lease digital spectrum to a client–in this case, Geocast. The data distributor is marrying Internet content and digital spectrum, aided by Sky-Stream Networks and Harris Corp.
Granite lost several million dollars backing Datacast, a 1996 forerunner that transmitted data over the analog spectrum.
Mr. Beck recently demonstrated the results of some digital multicasting research for attendees at an industry executives summit of the National Association of Broadcasters. The test involved a digital multicast experiment with full-motion video relayed off Granite’s San Jose tower to PCs.
One of the company’s intended applications for the technology–code named "pirate TV"–will get a test run this summer. And the intended use for such media tools likely will involve live local weekend concerts transmitted over wireless devices, television sets and PCs, officials say.
Granite is also working with local content producers, whose work will be showcased on the new digital spectrum.
"We are the only VHF station licensed to Silicon Valley, and we will be Silicon Valley’s primary interface with the world," Mr. Beck said. "We’re going to create the model for the rest of the country, because in San Francisco we have the most wired market in the world. So, they will be the most receptive to it."
NBC has first rights to four megabytes of Granite’s spectrum.
Granite is also experimenting with 50 percent owned MyTVShop.com, an early e-commerce opportunity for television stations that allows viewers to buy products associated with the TV shows.
Minority role model
As the head of the nation’s lone influential, minority-owned broadcaster, Mr. Cornwell has been a vigilant campaigner for greater diversity in media ownership. And Granite is a supporter of the newly formed Prism fund desig
ned to help minority entrepreneurs acquire their first media properties.
"What’s been lost in all the hubbub is that NBC has created an African American-led and -controlled company as the first minority owner of a Big 3, major-market affiliate," Mr. Cornwell said.#

The one-hour tour will depart from the main lobby of Palamountain Hall at 2 p.m.
The present Skidmore campus is located on land that prior to 1960 was known as Woodlawn. Its grounds contained largely forested land with several estate homes, a large lawn, and more than 20 miles of carriage trails dating back more than a century. Those on tour will receive a current North Woods map along with a map from the 1880s and some historical photographs.
Skidmore’s North Woods, a 250-acre tract extending north from the main campus, is home to numerous native species, including migrating songbirds and 33 types of ferns. With southern oak, hickory, and northern hardwoods as well as ponds and marshes, the woods support a biologically diverse animal and plant population that is important to faculty and student research. Much of the area is available for public use.
A group of volunteers and Skidmore students, led by Saratoga Springs Commissioner of Finance Ken Ivins, will also do some work to the trails Sunday. The idea is to improve hiking conditions and prevent erosion by repairing boardwalks, digging trenches and picking up debris.(La Jolla, Calif.) -- A collaboration led by the Burnham Institute forMedical Research has found that an antibody which binds to an unusualsugar molecule residing in the gut halts the inflammation seen inCrohn's disease and other intestinal inflammations. The antibody couldprove to be a promising drug target for these common chronic intestinaldisorders.
Professor Hudson Freeze, Ph.D., director of Burnham's glycobiologyand carbohydrate chemistry program, together with staff scientistGeetha Srikrishna, Ph.D., and other colleagues found that a naturally"tweaked" sugar chain normally present on white blood cells andintestinal cells plays a role in inflammation. In addition, the teamfound that an antibody produced in reaction to the sugar's presencecurbed intestinal inflammation induced in mice. These findings will bepublished in the October 15th edition of Journal of Immunology.
"We looked at a number of sugar-binding molecules that mayhave had a role in inflammation," said Freeze. "One of the sugar chainselicited an antibody response, so we wondered whether the antibodywould be able to block inflammation in mice. If so, this could haveimplications for inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's, and also mighthelp combat other autoimmune inflammatory diseases, like arthritis."
The team identified a modified version of very common sugarsknown as N-linked glycans, which are found on the surface of whiteblood cells, as well as normal colon cells. These sugars are also foundin colon tissue of patients suffering from Crohn's disease.
The antibody was tested in a mouse model for Crohn's diseasecreated by transferring white blood cells with the capacity to inducesevere intestinal inflammation into mice with compromised immunesystems. "When administered 10 days after disease onset, the antibodywas able to reverse early symptoms of inflammation and halt furtherprogress of disease," said Srikrishna. The antibody also reduced theaccumulation of white blood cells armed to fight disease and inhibitedthe expression of cellular messengers (cytokines) typically seen ininflammation.
"There are a large number of signaling molecules that areactivated in inflammation," said Freeze. "Antibodies against thesesugar chain molecules, however, appear to curb inflammation beforecytokines associated with inflammation, like NF-kB and TNF, areactivated. The sugar chain must be used at an earlier stage, but in amore specific manner."
The sugar chain's specificity could be crucial to developingtreatments for Crohn's and other inflammatory disorders. The body'sinflammation response usually is a healthy reaction to harmful foreignagents; inflammation disposes of pathogens before they cause disease.Crohn's disease and other inflammatory bowel diseases, generally knownas auto-immune disorders, are a result of the body's immune systemoverreacting to non-existent pathogens, causing the body to attack itsown tissues. The optimal treatment would inhibit excessive inflammationlinked with disease, leaving normal immune function unaffected.
The antibody, Freeze suggests, could prove to be an effectiveremedy for autoimmune disorders if it can act specifically onhyperactive inflammation, while preserving the immune system. Remicade
"Our next step is to identify the molecular players in thebody's early inflammatory response in the intestine," said Freeze. Theteam is focusing on one particular molecule called RAGE (short forReceptor for Advanced Glycation End Products), which has beenimplicated in the pathology of inflammation, as well as cancer,diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. They are also determining the exactmolecular structure of the tweaked sugar chain, and will determine whatother molecules and receptors may interact with it.
Eventually, the researchers hope that they will have enoughpromising information to merit a clinical trial to test the antibody'seffectiveness. "Our antibody was developed for use in mice. We need to"humanize" it, make the antibody suitable for human consumption. Thiscould take some development, but the results could be very beneficial,"Freeze said.
Freeze's and Srikrishna's colleagues included ProfessorMitchell Kronenberg, Olga Turovskaya and Raziya Shaikh of the La JollaInstitute for Allergy and Immunology, Robbin Newlin of Burnham, DirkFoell of the University of Muenster, Germany, and Simon Murch of theUniversity of Warwick, England.

International Affairs, 81 (1). pp. 31-52. ISSN 0020-5850
Abstract
One frequently hears statements about the damage done to the 'international community' by disagreements about the invasion and occupation of Iraq. It is clear from the general nature and frequency of its use that the term 'inter-national community' has an important political function in generating legiti-macy for those who act in its name. It is also clear from its popular usage that 'international community' means very different, and often quite opposed, things to different people. Why is the strong term 'community' chosen when 'inter-national society' might be more useful? Longstanding debates within political theory and the English school provide helpful insights into why people use this term in the ways that they do. This article will argue that international community implies a deep and robust sharing of identity, and that in relation to the Iraq war, the most important meaning of it equates broadly with the West. The authors look at the effect of the war on the western international com-munity through its impact on NATO, the EU, the UN, the WTO and public opinion. They further argue that the evidence from these sources does not yet suggest that the western international community has been fatally damaged.Cowl Neckline Draped Dress

The best part about this recipe is that it’s not actually a recipe at all! She made it up, and you can add any amount of any ingredient that you want. The main ingredients are:
Sweet Potatoes
Avocados
Black Beans
Quinoa
It is such a quick and easy recipe–I love it! The quick and simple directions can be found on Anne’s blog. I didn’t add any salsa to mine–just some sea salt and curry powder. Try it out! Fun fact: did you know that sweet potatoes are not necessarily orange? Yesterday at Whole Foods I picked up 3 organic sweet potatoes because I knew I was going to try out this meal. When I cut into the first potato my heart sank because I saw it’s pale yellow color and thought that it was a regular potato. After a little research, I figured out that it actually was a sweet potato, just not the kind I am used to! With that being said, I will still buy the orange ones from now on because I enjoy the orange color so much :)

Pingback: Popped Quinoa (WHAT?) and IT Band Woes | thesecretlifecoachofdcI recall a TV interview from years ago where a child-rearing professional said he witnessed reckless innocence and ignorance in action in his own living room, albeit with two animals. (Let’s put aside for now the possibility that animals can be regarded with the labels innocent or ignorant.) The drama played out like this: his family’s pet hamster was trying to climb out of its cage, but little did the hamster know that across the living room, crouching around the corner of the couch and poised to pounce was the family cat. The professional used this example to warn parents to make sure their children stayed within the loving “cage” of their parents’ rules, lest they get harmed by negative influences and experiences.
A recent discussion between Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade and Fox’s legal eagle Peter Johnson brought this hamster-cat example to mind. In this discussion, which focused on the “mirandizing” of the surviving Boston bombing suspect, Kilmeade joins league with the hamster when he climbs out of the Constitution/Bill of Rights cage (actually, like all statist neoconservatives, he climbs in and out of that cage depending on which of their oxen is being gored) and expresses his dismay with the fact that an American citizen who most likely will be found guilty of a horrendous act of terror, will have at his disposal the option available to all Americans—even the nastiest–to remain silent.
Kilmeade goes on to answer Johnson’s statement that “we’re a nation of laws” with this zinger: “We are a nation to stay alive.” Johnson also states that “Either we believe in the Constitution or we don’t believe in the Constitution.” To this Kilmeade—not yet done with great retorts—puts Johnson in his place with “Not everyone is worthy of the constitutional rights that we have.” Wow! This comment could easily come from the mouth of any banana republic dictator. Johnson adds that Senator Graham wants to “suspend civil rights and constitutional law” (in cases like this). To this, Kilmeade adds: “For public safety.”
I don’t think that Hamster Kilmeade realizes what this kind of thinking can lead to. Johnson tries to warn him that it could be him or his family who could be in jeopardy under this sort of exemption. Kilmeade puts that silly notion to rest by saying that he is “not blowing up the subway.” Take that, Johnson. Johnson, however, is hardly off the hook, for he contradicts himself by saying that “I didn’t say end the public safety exemption.” So, basically, in this interview, he is little more than the Devil’s advocate. What else can you expect from “conservative” Fox News?
Yes, let’s have a “public safety exemption.” That worked well for the thousands of Japanese who were interned in camps during World War Two. Let’s deny an entire race of people the Constitutional right to own firearms because of “public safety” as well.
I can understand the frustration of law-enforcement personnel who feel hamstrung by an inability to gather intelligence from a mute suspect. (My eldest son is a cop.) However, we see on an everyday basis the actions of a tyrannical government that has turned the practice of skirting the Constitution into a decadent art.
So Brian—and you, too, Peter—my advice to you both is to climb back into that cage called the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and stay there. I know that the word cage sounds negative and limiting, but Jefferson himself said: “In questions of power…let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.” Benjamin Franklin also warned that those who would sacrifice their liberty for safety would end up with neither. So chains or cage, Brian and Peter. Take your pick. The Constitution is there for your own protection. Trust me, but more importantly trust the Founding Fathers.

Boy, ain’t that the truth!
Which is exactly what happened in Boston…
Along with common sense approach
What a large crap of lies.
The Constitution is a cage for politicians only meant to restrain their carnal natures of greed and lust for power.
Not usually,always.
they had every right to enter the country and were legal citizens before they acted alone. Besides why didn. THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON STILL HAD THEIR LIBERTY EVEN WHEN COPS CLOSED THE CITY DOWN FOR EVERYONE’S PROTECTION.
Reminds me of that crazy woman…the children are their parents responsibility…nobody elses!!! They don’t belong to everyone!!!!!!
I’m with Patrick on this, you don’t hear many people in Boston complaining about the lock down.
it’s t-h-e-i-r
I would contest that they entered the situation without ALL of their liberty, and left it still without it all. The first failure here was letting these animals in the country in the first place, the second was allowing them to stay after warnings from Russia.
Government controlling the schools has not the first thing to do with it. Parents are responsible for their children’s education. Period. If it weren’t public schools, it would be the mainstream media, the neighborhood snake-oil salesman, or someone else filling their head with garbage. The world is full of charlatans, and even more full of sheeple. That is why liberty is such a rarity in human history.
Just as a parent must make sure his child’s body is inoculated against disease, he must also make sure his child’s brain is inoculated against stupidity. We need to take responsibility for our own.
…for your own good.
everyone in Boston w/half a brain would disagree. they still have their liberty and didn’t complain when cops did their job protecting a big city. At least no idiots w/guns got in the way or shot. except the idiot bomber of course.
No tyrant can act alone. They need a group of rich & powerful “special interest” backers to help the tyrant rule. The oligarchy’s most powerful tool to concentrate wealth & power has ALWAYS been F.E.A.R. False Evidence Appearing Real.
The most used tool of FEAR used by the Oligarchy is the FALSE FLAG aided by the propaganda machines of Government Education (indoctrination).
As long as government controls the schools and therefore the minds of the next generation, there is no hope of a truly free society free from the grip of the Oligarchs.
yes it does,,, we are fools if we believe them……..
Very true
That or it’s “for the children”
Or maybe “and this is why we are ignoring the Constitution”., we promise we won’t do it too often. Really. Stop laughing.
America gas to learn to read between the lies, I mean lines… jk
So true
RT @TenthAmendment: Bombing at Fox News: #10th
RT @TenthAmendment: Bombing at Fox News: #10thEvery day, stressed young men in brightly coloured jackets scream their way through multi-million pound deals at London's International Petroleum Exchange (IPE).
As the world's governments gather in Buenos Aires to discuss action against global warming, these traders have their eyes on what will soon become a highly-prized commodity: the permission to pollute.
There is no guarantee of finding a way through the international squabbles which have bogged down the first few days of the meeting in Argentina.
One of the key arguments centres on the role that market forces will play in sharing out the pollution cuts - and this is where the traders come in.
The IPE wants the UK government to go ahead and set up a system of emission permits which could be traded in the City of London.
The City traders had a disappointment this week when a government-commissioned report by the British Airways chairman Lord Marshall said it was too soon to set up this kind of system, and recommended instead an energy tax to encourage business to pollute less.
But he did suggest that "dry run" trials should be set up to see how the permit-trading system might work.
BP goes ahead
Some companies are choosing not to wait for the politicians to set the rules.
The oil giant BP is setting up its own system of international emissions trading between a dozen of its major worldwide business units.
The system is aimed at achieving a 10% cut in pollution caused by its rigs, refineries and operations like the "nodding donkeys" pumping oil to the surface near Poole Harbour in Dorset.
While the principle of trading is now widely accepted, and is written into the Kyoto protocol, there are fears that if it's not controlled properly, it could open up a loophole threatening the whole process.
Because of the collapse of the former Soviet economy since 1990, Russia and the Ukraine could end up with a huge bank of cheap, spare emission permits.
If they are bought up by American companies, the world's biggest polluter could end up escaping real efforts to clean up its industry.
Dr Paul Ekins of the environmental think tank Forum for the Future says unless trading is confined to countries with well-regulated financial markets, the Kyoto agreement could be dead in the water.pkd600

Mindless Movie Monday: The Apparition (And The Sad, Sad State Of Ghost Stories Today)
Even though I knew it was going to be awful, I still rented this flaming sack of cow dung just to see how bad it really was. Well, it's a boring, utterly ghastly (and not in a good way) movie about a couple that are house sitting a property that belongs to the girl's parents. Said girl - Kelly - is played by the very pretty Ashley Greene of Twilight fame, with boyfriend Ben (Sebastian Stan) hanging the moon for her pleasure.
At the very beginning of the movie we see Ben, doing his best ghost hunter impression with a few other like-minded folks...except they bring something back (from beyond....um, yeah - that's original) that is now following them, including our guy Ben. Which means Kelly is in trouble too, as it has emerged as a force to reckon with at their current living space.
When the neighbors loveable dog finds his way into the couple's home, lies down in their laundry room and promptly dies, I knew this film was not for me. (What makes filmmakers feel the need to off the family pet? Do they think that serves some purpose in the film - as if "Wow! They killed the cat/dog/horse/bunny/gerbil, etc! I'm REALLY afraid now!" - It's more like, I'm pissed and probably never going to watch your crappy excuse for a movie again, god dammit!) And that only served as proof that The Apparition was bound to get worse. The couple does so many stupid and ill-advised things, acts that are so clichéd it's nearly unwatchable. No originality and lack of plot plague many films these days, but I would be hard-pressed to find one so blatantly trite and unimaginative as this dud. I really can't say much about it because though it's trying to be a ghost story, it's failing miserably and NOTHING IS HAPPENING!
The two leads are trying here, and it can be said that they did give it the old college try. But though they may be good in other films, they struggled to hit the mediocre mark here. It was almost laughable how many ridiculous facial expressions Ashley Greene delivered. Funny thing is, they all ended up virtually the same. All looking somewhere in between constipated and bored to tears. LIKE ME.
Thankfully for the male viewers of the film, she showed a bit of skin.
Plainly said, this movie is so outright boring that I was actually writing this review as I suffered through it. All we were subjected to were loud noises, lights flashing off & on, some carefully placed shrieking, doors opening by themselves, and strange molds growing on the floors, ceilings, and of course in the basement. (Why do spirits these days feel the need to manifest as MOLD? Try something less icky next time!) Kelly finds out Ben was lying to her (which in all actuality he just 'didn't tell her' all about his past spook hunting and "scientific supernatural studies") and she swiftly kicks him out of the house - leaving her alone to face the ghost/demon/entity of the week all by her lonesome. Have we learned nothing from watching past horror films!?
Friends, we can do so much better than this. We HAVE done better. See The Changeling, The Haunting, The Legend of Hell House... Christ I'll admit even The Grudge and Paranormal Activity were better. I just don't get why studios keep green-lighting dumb-ass movies like these ones. I was so disinterested in this about ten minutes in that I nearly turned it off. Figured I'd keep watching so I'd have something to write about! Shitty crap like this, Pulse, The Fog (2005), The Unborn, and the vast array of junk available that are trying to pass themselves off as scary are doing nothing but killing the sub-genre.
Where are movies like The Woman in Black (1989)? The Innocents? The Devil's Backbone? Though a rare gem breaks through occasionally, such as The Awakening, most ghost stories are just bullshit. Why aren't studios trying to find someone who will adapt something truly chilling, like any number of works by Ambrose Bierce or M.R. James?? I read two awesome books by John Harwood last year - The Seance and The Ghost Writer (not the one adapted into the Ewan McGregor film)- both if which seem fairly adaptable to me, and would translate to film fantastically. The Seance would be a wonderful period ghost story that would float the boat of any fan of the supernatural. But instead we are forced to watch this regurgitated dreck that wouldn't scare a two year old. Gah!!
So believe me when I tell you - don't watch this movie unless you are faced with making the decision to either watch this film or watch paint dry.
I know what I would choose.

I think that what filmmakers forget when it comes to ghost stories is that the less seen, the better. The more you can keep your audience guessing, the stronger your work will be. People who would watch a ghost story film are often on the fence about the entire topic anyway, and that should be played to. "Is this real or in the character's head?" That can do wonders.
Might I try to make a recommendation? Ghost movies are undoubtedly my favorite so I'm always looking for the next good one too (and have been disappointed by a lot of them lately). I've got a review coming up soon for a movie called The Pact, and I gotta tell you, I freaking loved it. Formulaic on some level, but also really well done and effective, with a fantastic twist. I think you should at least give it a shot if you haven't.
Lovely Molly is also an interesting one, but it never really shouted "ghost movie" as much to me.
I. completely. agree. I would write more but I have the flu. Love the blog.
Hollywood will always put out generic, cookie cutter horror films with CW Network-level casting. Just how it is. Independent horror(that doesn't suck) is our best hope.
But yes, The Woman in Black(89) and The Innocents are amazing. So is Whistle and I'll Come to You(68) and Ghost Story (81). Both terrifying!
Doug: Absolutely agree - the less seen the better. Just a glimpse of "maybe something" in a corner, a reflection in a mirror, etc. Instead of throwing all the cards on the table or going for blood and gore - both of which are unacceptable in my humble opinion.
Michele: So I want to thank you so much for the recommendation of The Pact. I had heard of it but somehow never got my hands on it. I took your advice and bought it outright. Watched it last night and loved it as well. Yes, there were some moments of "haven't I seen this done before?" but I enjoyed the hell out of it. And it spooked me out, which is what I'm looking for. Something that makes me shut my eyes tight when I go to bed so I can't see the shadows in the hallway! Thanks again!!
Ongoingly: Thanks for reading and I hope you are feeling better!
Trevor: I love Whistle and I'll come to you, despite having to see it on YouTube because I live here in America. Ghost Story has LONG been one of my most favorite movies! I've loved it from waaaay back.
Michele, I saw the Pact but was very confused at the end of it. Ghost story or not??
Christine: Ah, so happy you loved it! Wasn't sure if it was one you'd be impressed with or not.
Marie: See, that's the thing I loved about this movie - it's part ghost story, part not. There is the ghost of the murdered girl in the house, but not all of the strange happenings in the house were her - some of it was Judas. Like in the beginning when the little girl says "Mommy who's that behind you?", that wasn't the ghost, it was Judas coming out of the closet, see? Makes a rewatch interesting.Mar 13, 2009 7:47 AM
Chiasso claims that their Mateo Desk ($1,398) is "the coolest ever," and we won't quibble. From the generously sized, kidney bean of a glass top, to the leather and wood legs and drawers, this is one bad ass:

I love this bean shape desk. Where exactly it's available? I tried to find it in UK but with no luck. Any clue? in Charleston

HIGH STAKES AT HIGH COURT
Can the federal government force American business owners to subsidize activities they believe to be unconscionable? That’s the question before the Supreme Court today as justices hear arguments in two cases involving employers who are refusing to obey ObamaCare requirements. In one case, the family-owned Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores has agreed to cover 16 of the 20 birth-control measures required of insurance policies under the 2010 law. But the chain’s owners, the members of the Green family, refuse to cover the other four – which can terminate pregnancies in their initial stages – because their Christian beliefs strictly prohibit abortion. The Obama administration is seeking a ruling against conscience exemptions for corporations, arguing that Americans’ religious freedoms do not extend to their businesses. The other case involves a Mennonite-run cabinet company in Pennsylvania, Conestoga Wood Specialties, the owners of which are also forbidden by their faith to be party to abortion at any stage. More details here.
[Watch Fox: Correspondent Shannon Bream has the latest on the case from the Supreme Court.]
Why it matters - So why does this matter to non-business owners or to those who are not abortion activists? Simply put, the Supreme Court may take the chance to broadly redefine what the religious rights of Americans may be and whether the other challenges aimed at President Obama’s troubled law and its mandates may succeed. Of course, justices may opt to steer around the issue by narrowing the scope of their decision. But with what Americans consider their “first freedom” on the line as well as the implementation of the controversial health law, the attention on the court’s arguments today is intense.
For the left: “Corporations are not people. Corporations cannot have religious views. If religious rights are extended to corporations, it puts us on a slippery slope where any private company could argue that religious beliefs prevent it from offering vital employee protections… Although this country predominantly descends from a Judeo-Christian tradition… All sets of beliefs should be treated equally, but allowing any belief to override insurance law opens the door to many more extreme beliefs being able to do the same.” – WaPo OpEd from Democratic California state Senate candidate Sandra Fluke, made famous by her fight to force her Jesuitical alma mater, Georgetown University, to subsidize birth control for students.
For the right: . … In that letter, Jefferson thundered, ‘No provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of civil authority.’ My prayer is that the Supreme Court will agree with Jefferson.” Rev. Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, Calif. and author of “The Purpose Driven Life,” in a WaPo OpEd.
TROUBLED VETS AGENCY TURNS TO OBAMACARE SALES
Washington Examiner: “The Department of Veterans Affairs sent veterans and other Americans in its database a seven-page color brochure titled ‘The Affordable Care Act: For Veterans Who Need Health Care Coverage,’ with a letter dated March 7 that appears addressed to individuals who don’t use VA health insurance. The packet urges them to enroll in either VA coverage or Obamacare to ensure that they meet the federal mandate to carry health insurance or pay a fine. A VA spokesman told the Washington Examiner that the department estimates that up to 1.3 million veterans are uninsured, about 1 million of whom are eligible for VA health care. The spokesman did not dispute that the VA also is seeking to encourage uninsured veterans to consider Obamacare as a health insurance option. The VA is collaborating with other departments on the implementation of Obamacare, the spokesman said.”
STATES READY TO DELAY OBAMACARE PENALTIES
WSJ: …While the health law requires individuals carry insurance starting this year, it does allow for a gap of no more than 90 days, or up to March 31, for people who are currently uninsured.”
Tick, tick, tick - With less than one week to go until ObamaCare’s enrollment deadline, vulnerable Senate Democrats are looking for some electoral relief. A proposal offered by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , D-N.H., and backed by Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., and Kay Hagan D-N.C., would extend the time Americans have to comply with the law before fines are levied. But so far, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has kept it on ice. As Democratic hopes of holding the Senate slide, will Reid be moved to give the bill a chance? –Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel has the latest.
[The Atlantic breaks down recent polling to explain why the uninsured aren’t buying into ObamaCare.]
OBAMACARE MAKES MEDS HARDER TO GET
The Hill’s Elise Viebeck explains why patients with ObamaCare are having a harder time getting top-shelf prescription drugs.  ‘utilization management controls.’... At least 51 percent of brand-name mental health meds come with special controls on the exchanges, compared with only 11 percent on the employer-based market, the analysis found.”
REID BLAMES GOP FOR RUSSIAN LAND GRAB
Fox News: “The Senate voted 78-17 to advance a Ukraine aid package Monday sought by the Obama administration, setting up a final vote for later this week… Ahead of the vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sharply attacked Republicans, suggesting because of previous inaction they helped Russia annex Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and he urged the GOP to consider ‘how their obstruction affects United States’ national security as well as the people of Ukraine’….”
[Watch Fox: Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., discusses the ongoing crisis in the Ukraine in the 2 p.m. ET hour]
Republicans respond - “We are deeply concerned that the Ukraine aid legislation reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee contains ‘reform’ provisions that would unnecessarily double the United States contribution to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), part of the largest proportional increase ever, yet ultimately undermine our influence in that body in a manner that provides no actual relief to Ukraine.” – Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in a letter from GOP lawmakers to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Monday

TRUMKA TO TEAR INTO OBAMA ON TRADE
Richard Trumka, the head of America’s largest labor union, will rally liberal activists today against President Obama’s trade policies. Fox News First has a preview of the AFL-CIO leader’s speech to the Center for American Progress. The message is that Obama’s request for new trade authority is a bad deal. From the prepared remarks for Trumka’s speech to the group this morning: “We wanted a new template, one we could endorse. We can’t endorse these. We’ve seen nothing but the same [North American Free Trade Agreement]-era framework…But make no mistake about it, NAFTA-style trade deals that put Wall Street first and workers last are goners, no matter how ‘progressive’ their advocates portray them to be. We are ready to stand with President Obama in realizing the vision of global economic growth and equity. But first he has to decide if that is the vision that will animate his trade policies.”
MAKING ’EM SQUEAL IN IOWA
Not every campaign ad begins thusly: “I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington, I’ll know how to cut pork.” That’s the new message today from Iowa state Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican hoping to emerge from a crowded primary field for the chance to run for the seat being left vacant by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. Ernst is a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard who has won backing from, among others, Mitt Romney. Shekeeps it real in her first ad, which features a squealing piglet in a pen as she touts her, ahem, cutting ability. Ernst [Democratic frontrunner Rep. Bruce Braley's] Obamacare with common-sense, market-driven solutions.” You know you’re going to watch this.

DEMS’ KOCH HABIT WILL BE EXPENSIVE
A George Washington University Poll out this morning finds Democrats have a long way to go to make oil tycoons Charles and David Koch into effective 2014 stand ins for 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Democrats hope to replicate the success President Obama had in vilifying Romney, whom Obama’s campaign famously called a “vampire” for his work at Bain Capital, with this cycle’s top conservative benefactors, the Koch brothers. While Democrats can be glad that they have so far helped give the Kochs a net negative rating of 13 percent favorable, 25 percent unfavorable, the painful part for the blue team is in the fact that 52 percent of respondents had never heard of the Kochs and another 11 percent had no opinion. The press will help Democrats introduce Americans to the Kochs and reinforce damaging narratives, but is the party ready to spend the millions it would take to keep up the Koch attacks long enough to make their name a household word?
[The same GWU poll finds a tight top tier for the 2016 GOP nomination. Leading the pack is Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., with 38 percent, Former Gov. Jeb Bush, R-Fla., 36 percent, and embattled Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., 34 percent.]
REID GROUP PUTS ANOTHER $1 MILLION IN KOCH ATTACKS
WRAL: “…Sen. Kay Hagan’s,[ D-N.C.,] re-election campaign is getting some help from two outside spending groups who plan to air commercials on her behalf this month…[Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Senate Majority PAC] will spend $1 million airing the ads across North Carolina – double what the group plans to spend in other states that will see pieces of the same campaign.… A coalition of environmental groups will also come to Hagan’s aid as part of a $5 million national ad buy they are making on behalf of several members of Congress. The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy ‘will sponsor the North Carolina series of ads, thanking Senator Hagan for protecting North Carolinians from dangerous air pollution,’ according to a news release… The ad also riffs on the Koch brothers theme, starting its 30-second run by asking ‘Who’s behind the attacks on Kay Hagan? Oil industry billionaires, that’s who.’’’
MEANWHILE…
WSJ: “The latest television spot in…[American’s for Prosperity’s] $30 million media blitz is airing in Michigan, where the U.S. Senate race pits the former secretary of state, Republican Terri Lynn Land, against Democratic Rep. Gary Peters. Like other AFP ads, the spot features a personal horror story ….’’’
OUTSIDE SPENDING SCARES SHAHEEN BACKERS
The Boston Globe explains why Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., is pushing incipient Republican Senate candidate Scott Brown to limit contributions from outside groups: .” Democratic National Committee Member and former State Senator Peter Burling told the Globe, “Let me be clear: I am worried. . . . Democrats are in for a couple months of real worry and anxiety.”
HAWAII DEM HIGHLIGHTS MIXED FAMILY IN AD DEBUT
The Hill: “The first ad in Sen. Brian Schatz’s (D-Hawaii) primary bid showcases his multiracial extended family and touts his defense of Social Security. Schatz says he opposes cuts to Social Security because of the 200,000 Hawaiians who depend on the program — including his wife’s parents…Schatz has been running to Rep. Colleen Hanabusa’s (D-Hawaii) left in the primary. Hawaii’s Democratic politics are often split along race and class lines, and Schatz’s ad, featuring his Chinese-American in-laws, seems designed to help bridge the gap between cultures.”
MISSISSIPPI GOP SENATE CHALLENGER HEADING TO KENTUCKY
Washington Examiner: “…[O]n April 5, [Mississippi Republican Senate challenger Chris McDaniel] plans to take a brief detour from the campaign trail in the Magnolia State and travel to Louisville, Ky., to speak at ‘FreePAC Kentucky.’ The event, sponsored by FreedomWorks, is a political rally being staged to boost [Matt [Sen.

FINE, FINE…
Sen.Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., told the St. Louis Dispatch that she and 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton “are fine.” McCaskill was one of the first to enlist in the Clintonista group Ready for Hillary, but her 2008 endorsement of then-Sen. Barack Obama is just part of the bad blood between her and Hillary. A recent book on the Clinton campaign machine says the former first lady was furious with McCaskill over comments she made in 2006 in which stated she would not let former President Bill Clinton near her daughter. “Are we besties for the rest of our lives? No,” McCaskill said, but assured the paper that they could work together to retain Democratic control of the White House.
Dynastic road show - AP: “Their presidential plans may be uncertain but one thing is clear: [former Florida Republican Governor] Jeb Bush and [2016 Democratic frontrunner] Hillary Rodham Clinton keep bumping into each other.

SCOTT SLAMS CRIST OVER OBAMACARE CANCELLATIONS
Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is hitting the airwaves with a $2 million ad buy to blast Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Charlie Crist over his support of ObamaCare. The ad features Crist saying the president’s signature entitlement program has “been great” for the Sunshine State despite 300,000 insurance policies being cancelled in the state.
AND ALL YOU DID WAS BRING A FORM TO THE OFFICE…
It’s been a sweet season for Katie Francis and her customers and it isn’t over yet. The 12-year-old Girl Scout from Oklahoma is laying claim to a new national cookie-selling record of 18,107 boxes as of Sunday night, and is aiming for 20,000 by the end of March. For those wondering if they’ve got enough milk to wash ‘em down, that would be the equivalent of 506,996 Thin Mints. The sixth-grader told USA Today that she needed a bigger goal after setting the state record for cookie sales in 2013 and 2012. Her recipe for success? Time, persistence… and asking everyone she sees to buy a box. Since the start of the cookie-selling season this winter, Francis has been hustling mot weekdays from when she gets out of school until about 9:30 p.m. and 12 or 13 hours on weekends. Francis and her mom did some research to find that the previous national record was set by Elizabeth Brinton, who sold about 18,000 boxes in one year in the 1980s and 100,000 boxes over her career. A state Girl Scout official told ABC News that the organization will wait until sales end on March 30 to discuss Francis’ claim.

AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…
“[Russian ruler Vladimir Putin] has on the border of Ukraine 20,000 troops, artillery, and attack helicopters and we are now going to give the Ukrainians, what, tuna sandwiches?” –.I sat there looking at the stars. It was like any other night. I sat there and watched until the first faint stirrings of light showed on the horizon. The sign of a new day and the end of the night. I sighed as I heard footsteps behind me. That would be my brother coming to fetch me. "It is time to go." He said. It was what he always said. The night would end and we would move on. Always the same. He waited for me to get up before he turned and got in the car. I took one last look at the little town we were leaving behind. My brother rolled down the automatic window. "Coming, Dawn?" he said, as I looked out over the town and frowned. "Sure, I'm coming." I said as I turned. I smiled halfheartedly at my brother and got into the car.
He was silent as we sped down the empty highway. This was becoming too routine. We would stop in a small town for a day or two and then we would move on. We had been doing this for years. Sure it was an easy way of life, but my brother wasn't one to fill the long silences. He never talked much. Not since she died. My brother had been married once. He was so in love with her. I found it hard to believe he could live without her, but he did. He did because of the promise he made. I thought it was stupid. Why must he go on living when she had died just because he had promised her he would look after me. I am three hundred years old. I don't need looking after. Just because I am his little sister.
I couldn't understand the way he looked at me. So protective. How could he feel so responsible for me? I couldn't understand how he could live his life on just a promise to her. A promise he never meant to keep.
(My brother had hated me. He had never met me and yet he hated me. He hated me because I was born. Because our parents had me. He hated me even more when he asked them to choose and they chose me. He had been outraged. How could they chose me over him? He who had been their son for two hundred years. He who was their favorite. How could he be expected to share?
It had almost killed him when he came to and found in his rage he had murdered, not me, but the parents he had been so unwilling to give up. And I had survived, the little monster who tore his family from him. He was so disgusted with himself for what he had done that he fled and left me there alone. I survived , yes, but he never forgave me for being born. Not until that day. She was dying and he could not save her. The one thing she asked him as she died was that he watch out for me and keep me safe. He promised her that, of course he did, he would have promised here anything and everything at that moment . He would have promised her the earth and the sea. Yes, he promised, and he lied. He had no intention of living without her. The instant she was gone he would find a way to follow her.
When she had died he stumbled out of the house he had built for her, and he headed into the trees to look for death. That is when he first saw me. I had been waiting outside because of the dark feelings I sensed inside the house. He came across me cowering in the dirt and stopped. I never found out why he did what he did. I never could make myself ask. But no matter why he did it, he bent over and picked me up out of the dirt and carried me away. Away from the house where the bad feelings still hovered in the air and away from the girl who had mended my brothers broken heart after the day I was born.)
I was brought out of my memories as the car came to a stop at an inn. I looked at him questioningly, but got no answer as he got out of the car. I assumed that we needed gas and went back to my pondering.
I was unhappy in this life. I didn't want to move to a new place every two or three days. I wanted to stay in one place and have a house and go to school or get a job. Why did we have to wander for all eternity like vampires on the run from the stake and pyre. We did not harm the humans, so why did we hide from them as if we feared punishment for some crime? Why did we have to slip quietly into the darkness before anyone had a chance to realize we had come? The whole thing was pointless. I brooded over the unfairness of the path my brother had chosen for us until he got back in the car and drove on. I was no longer interested in the reason for the stop. I looked out my window until the sun began to slip behind the horizon.
We pulled to a stop in front of a small hotel in the center of a one light country town. I got out and walked with him to the front desk, as usual, to get the key to our room. My brother went up to the room with the few possessions we carried and settled in. I lay in one of the beds, staring up at the foam tiles and tried to get some sleep. But sleep would not come and no matter how I tried, I couldn't seem to relax. I looked over to see my brother had fallen asleep in the chair he had settled into for the night. I remembered when the feel of him watching me at night used to bother me. It seemed silly now that he had once made me uncomfortable. I thought for a minute about the things that used to upset me. Back before I adjusted to the almost overbearingly protective way he treated me. I used to think he had always been a tyrant. How wrong I had been.
I slipped out of bed and headed to the door. I had once been horrible at sneaking out. I remember the fury I would feel as he caught me, time and time again. He would wait outside the car with a reproachful look and I would do my best to hide how much it annoyed me for it made him even happier to see how it got to me.
(I smiled to myself as I sneaked out the door, into the night. I walked down the dirt road to the center of town and remembered the first time I outsmarted him. I had been with him for almost two years and was beginning to hate the way he hovered protectively. I waited for him to fall asleep in the chair where he kept watch over me every night. When I was sure his breathing was deep and even, I slipped out from under the covers and went to the door. I didn't care that I was in only a tank top and a miniskirt. I slinked out across the grass and headed down the street of the small city motel we were staying in. I did not trust myself to get the keys, nor did I think he trusted me enough to keep the battery cables hooked up. I made my way to a juice bar where teens hung out at the time. The 80's were so strange. How could people dress in such horrible ways. I admit the miniskirt was an invention from god, but other than that it was fashion hell.
I smiled at a boy who obviously didn't know it is impolite to ogle and made my way into the bar. I didn't know what it was males found so interesting. I was pale as a sheet and my hair was dark brown, almost black, matching the shade of my eyes. I was too tall and my posture was horrible, yet they stared without fail every time. It had bothered me immensely at first, but I got used to it. I strode up to the bar and smiled at the waitress. She looked at me as if I had slapped her. I could almost see the green that colored her emotions. Actually, I could see the green that colored her emotions. I always could. Their emotions could be seen in the color of the air around them. Mine was a weird talent. I could understand sensing emotions but seeing them portrayed in colors in the space around the one I am sensing was completely new. I thought it was a strange talent and tried to ignore it whenever I could. It bothered me to be different. I hated to stick out in a crowd. My brother often called me his wallflower. I would have liked that.
I smiled at the girl staring at me like I had a third eye growing out of my forehead and said "can I get a soda?" She frowned at the ringing in my voice and took the money I laid on the counter. A minute or so later she came back with a soda. I wondered in the back of my mind if she was shallow enough to spit in it. Probably not. I took the soda and turned around on my stool. I smiled, this was the most normal thing I had done since I met my brother. I couldn't wait to see the look on his face in the morning. A small part of me wondered if he would be too angry. But I dismissed it, I wasn't afraid of my brother and he knew it.)
I slipped into a movie theater that had just begun to roll the movies. I chose one that was playing a romance, smiling to myself as I thought of how easy it was to sneak in unnoticed, even in the brightly lit front entrance. As the movie began to roll, I thought of just what had happened as I returned from my first prison break.
(I walked into the room around two in the morning with my head held high. I wasn't going to feel guilty. It was his fault for being so protective. It wasn't my fault outsmarting him had become my new hobby. What else was there to do at night? I closed the door behind me and turned to face his fury. There was fury and I stood there as he chided me and ranted out all of his frustration with my head held high, trying to fight back the smile that threatened at my lips. Even through the yelling and anger I could see the pride and joy in the color of his surroundings at how quickly I had learned to outsmart him. As expected, when the torrent was over, he sat down on the bed and looked up at me fighting a smile of his own.
"So you finally managed to sneak out. You didn't take as long as I expected. You sure did better than I did the first time I got away from mom and dad." I was surprised. He never talked about our parents. I could feel a story coming and my brother was not the person I would pick to lead a conversation. I sat down so listen expecting a short memory that I would puzzle over for days. It was something to do in the endless vacation that was our life on the road.)
As the movie started I noticed a group of boys staring at me. I smiled politely and turned my attention back to the screen. A boy and girl were in the park and were working through the first akward stage of their relationship. I had seen it all before. The thing that caught my interest was how out of place the boys looked. I don't have to go too much into detail about why guys are out of place in a romance without girls with them. That was the only thing that would drag a guy into this Chick Flick. I began to speculate mildly as the couple on the screen went through meeting the parents. I noticed that none of the boys were paying the slightest bit of attention to the movie. Most of them looked at me with obvious lust coloring the air around them. It wasn't hard to put two and two together.
These boys were looking for a good time and they were expecting to get it from me. I smiled into the darkness as I imagined what they thought was going to happen. Humans could be so stupid. Did they honestly think that they would get far? I had to remind myself that they thought I was weak and human like they were. I got up from my seat and strolled out of the theater. I could use some entertainment. I hoped silently that my brother didn't come to my "rescue" before I had my fun. He could be such a kill joy sometimes. How often did I get a chance to break a few rules? You would understand if you lived with my brother.
I walked silently into the street and down an alley that I was sure would give them the perfect opportunity to corner me. I smiled to myself as I heard the footsteps of the boys behind me. I could hear the faster footfalls of the others who were going to block the other end of the short alleyway. I sped up slightly to give the impression of fear, how easy it was to toy with them, I almost disgusted myself. As the footsteps behind me picked up speed I broke into a light jog. My heart was racing, but not with fear, I couldn't wait for them to corner me in the shadows of the alley, smiling in triumph. I played my part perfectly, Stopping dead as the other group stepped out into the opening I had been running for. I stretched my eyes wide, fighting a smile, and looked from one group to the other. They closed in and one whispered, "Hey sexy, what are you doing out by yourself? You might run into some bad characters." He smiled as he said this and the others laughed. The leader reached for my wrist, and I prepared for the fun to start, but just as the boys hand closed around my wrist, a voice came from the farthest end of the alley. "Hey, it ain't nice pick on girls. Why don't you go play with someone who likes your games." It shouted. I looked toward the voice in irritation. Why did someone have to be heroic when you least want them to? Now I would have to save him and miss out on all the fun. What did he think he was doing? He didn't stand a chance against all of these boys; did he want to get his ass kicked? I sighed and let it go. I would get another chance someday. I grabbed the boy who still held my wrist, but before I had a chance to do anything fun, like throw him into a brick wall or fling him twenty feet into the air, the boy was ripped from my grasp.
The stranger threw him to the ground and, so fast the movement blurred, landed a solid kick into the next boys gut. He hit the wall and slid to the pavement at my feet. The others scattered soon after and I was still standing there with that irritated expression frozen on my face. This was no normal human. That was obvious, but then what was he? He walked up to me slowly, his hands in the air. It reminded me vaguely of a criminal showing he is unarmed as he surrendered to the police. A look of concern crossed his face as he approached me. He was probably wondering if I had gone into shock. I watched him warily as he put his hand on my shoulder. "Hey, you okay? Did they hurt you?" He looked my over swiftly and then seemed to notice the look on my face. "Hey why are you looking at me that way?" He leaned over me and I caught his scent for the first time. Immediately I was twenty feet away from him crouched defensively against a wall. How could I not notice it! All of the signs were there! What was I thinking, I should have checked his scent instead of assuming he was human. But why on earth would a vampire save me? Why would he chase off other humans just to get to me? It seems pointless. What reason could he possibly have? All of these questions flooded my mind as the concern in his face melted into surprise and suspicion.
"What are you?" He asked as he inched closer. The suspicion melted into raging curiosity. He cocked his head to the side and I could see the irritation in his face as he tried to figure what I was. I wasn't letting my guard down no matter how innocent his emotions were. "Why did you interfere, bloodsucker? What reason could you possibly have to chase those boys away?" I asked him, as I watched his slow advance. He straightened out of his crouch abruptly at the word bloodsucker and eyed me with suspicion again. "You seem to have the advantage here. You know what I am, so kindly tell me what you are." His silky voice pleaded in the darkness.
"I don't have a name for what I am. I just am. I am neither vampire, nor am I a werewolf. I am no half breed and I am certainly not human. What am I? Your guess is as good as mine." I said in a voice dripping with honey. I would be lucky to talk my way out of this one. I hope my brother doesn't catch wind of this or he'll be as overbearing as ever.
The vampire inched closer and then relaxed. He smiled at me sincerely. The smile made my heart miss a beat and I was embarrassed when he noticed. He smiled again at the blush that spread over my cheeks. How was I supposed to think straight with his beautiful crimson eyes looking at me like that. Then I was shocked as he crumpled to the ground in agony. The sun had begun to light the horizon aflame with the beginning of a new day. The back of my mind noted that my brother would be furious that I was out in the daytime, but most of my concentration was centered on the almost overwhelming need to protect the vampire I was recently so eager to escape from. The urge caught me so of guard it was a while before I realized that I had draped my jacket over his face and was racing through the street like a streak of lightening towards the motel we were staying in. I was grateful that my brother had already gone to search for me and was not in the room.
I set the boy on the bed I had recently lay in, turning restlessly in the darkness. After covering him completely in the quilts, I hurried to the windows to close the thick cloth curtains and shut out the rays of the rising sun. I streaked back to the bed when I was sure all light was barred from the room and pulled the thick quilt off of the boy. He was unconscious, but was breathing. The instant my mind caught up with what I had done, I gasped. I was still frozen in shock on the floor of the motel room when my brother stormed through the door.
"Where in hell have you been?!" He yelled before the sight of my face brought him up short. Before I could blink he was at my side and his arms were around me. "What is it sis? What has happened? It will be alright. It can't be that bad, Tell me. What is it?" He cooed in my ear as he stroked my hair and looked into my shocked and fearful eyes. I looked at him and wondered if he would hate me for what I had done. Would he leave me? Would he kill the boy I had saved from the sun? Would he hate me for my stupidity? Would he send the boy back outside to die? I didn't know, but as I stared at him in horror, he caught scent of the vampire in my bed. In an instant, I was against the wall. My brother was crouched in front of me and he was filled with the reddest fury. I was shocked by the vivid crimson that flooded through him as he crouched protectively in front of me. Before I knew what I was doing, I had thrown myself in front of the boy and threw my arms around him. My brother stared at me in shock for half a second before he realized what was going on. "NO!!" He yelled as understanding flooded his face. The vivid red of his anger grew ever brighter as he took a step in the boy's direction. The look on my brothers face frightened me but I stood my ground. Sometime during the endless silence that followed, where my brother alternated between protective glances at me and murderous glares in the boys direction, the vampire regained consciousness.
He sat on the bed looking from my protective stance in front of him to my brothers murderous glare with first, confusion and then fear. My brother finally found his voice as he noticed how I looked at the boy. What did he see in my face? I had no idea what he would see and I didn't care at the moment, for he was screaming at the boy now and I felt another surge of the protective instinct that led me to save him in the first place.
"How dare you try to take her from me! She is MINE! You can't have her. I'd have killed you already if she wasn't protecting you. What would make you stupid enough to try to take MY SISTER!! I don't give a DAMN what you thought you were doing! I will wring your filthy bloodsucker neck before I let her go, UNDERSTAND!! Give me one reason, ONE, Why I shouldn't let you fry in the sun for…"
The threats he was flinging at the boy over my shoulder were drowned out as rage flooded my system. He was yelling at the vampire like he had planned what had happened, yelling at him as if he planned to steal me the whole time. I was not going to let him talk about me as if I belonged to him. I did not belong to anyone! I was so mad my eyesight was tinged with red and I tasted the fury on my tongue. My brother's stream of threats and accusations cut of abruptly, as a feral snarl ripped through my chest and I leaped for my brother's throat.
The next thing I remember is crouching over the body of the boy I had saved. He was balled up on the floor between me and my brother. He had thrown himself between us before I could rip out my brothers throat, but I couldn't stop before I rammed into his chest at full speed. My brother was standing frozen in the same spot as I leaned over the vampire. After a moment, he sat up and rubbed his chest where I had slammed into him. My brother was looking between us with a mixture of shock, reluctant gratitude, and anger streaked across his face.
"Don't you dare blame this on him! We only met just now, how could he have known what was going to happen, and why does it matter?! I don't belong to you and you aren't the boss of me. You can't tell me who I can fall in love with!" I roared at him, still sitting on the floor with my teeth bared. He looked at me as if I had slapped him. I felt a momentary pang of regret as I saw hurt color the air around him.
"Just give me a chance to explain what happened before you do anything stupid, okay bro?" I pleaded as I slowly climbed off of the floor and pulled the boy to his feet. He looked from my pleading eyes to the fear streaked across the boy's face and nodded. He sat down on his bed and folded his arms. "I'm listening," he said.
So I told him what happened, quickly editing out my plans to bend the rules. He seemed to believe me and when I finished my story, he sighed. "I guess it wasn't your fault. I'm sorry to both of you" he said, looking from me to the boy. "I guess I should have asked you first." He looked at the boy again. "So, what's your name, anyway?" He asked.
"My name is Noel. I am from a family of vampires that lives in Mississippi. We have a permanent settlement there and live in a community of vampires. We call the place Ileana. That means Greenwood. We have lived there for hundreds of years." He said as he glanced from my brother to me. "We aren't the only species there. We have witches and werewolves, too. The elders have managed to keep the peace between us for so long that we have begun to mix breed."
"So, why did you leave?" I asked. He looked up at me and smiled, I felt my brothers disapproval from across the room. I threw him a warning glance before I look back. "I can't see why you wouldn't stay." He took a deep breath before he answered.
"I was bored. I had lived in that town for three hundred years and I needed a change of scenery. I left to look for a new home and never went back."
"Where did you go?" I asked, curious. "I went West first, traveling through Kansas and California before I turned North. I headed into Washington after a few years without finding a place I wanted to stay in. When I got there, I came across a little town called Dark Point. The town had an interesting scent, so I went to explore. When I arrived in the residential area, I was shocked to find myself face to face with the largest pack of animals I had ever seen. I knew almost immediately that they weren't normal animals. Together in the group, there were panthers, jaguars, tigers, wolves, eagles, bears, lions, horses, falcons, and something you could only describe as a dragon. They smelled nothing like normal animals and seemed naturally aggressive toward me. Then the power hit me. It-"
"What do you mean 'the power'?" My brother broke in.
"My vampire ability is that I can shape shift into anything I come in contact with. I don't just look like the species, I am that species. I become the thing genetically. I felt my body heat up and my skin changed from pale white to a smooth peachy brown and my hair turned black. I didn't understand why I had become human. The creatures in front of me were NOT human. I stood there, confused until one of them changed. He came up to me and glared in my face. 'What the hell did you just do? You don't smell like a leach anymore. What kind of trick are you trying to pull, bloodsucker? How come you smell like part of the pack?' Then it hit me, they where shape shifters. 'I'm sorry if I intruded on your territory. I didn't know that I was not welcome. As for my change, my ability is to change into any new species I come in contact with. If I am not wanted, I will go. Can you point me in the direction of the nearest town?' I said trying to stay on their good side. I didn't want to pick a fight with sixteen angry shape shifters. The human in front of me surprised me by laughing. 'Cool!' He exclaimed and threw his arm around my shoulders.
'Have you met the others, yet?' He asked me as he led me toward the group of animals behind him. 'They would get a kick out of you. Guys, meet the newest freak. Hey, what's your name anyway, new guy?' he said as we came closer. 'Uh, Noel. No, I haven't met the others. Who are they?' I asked, confused by his sudden change of attitude. 'The others are local vamps. They live in town. Noel, these are the packs. My pack and Johns pack we each have nine members.' He took me up the road and the others phased and followed us. We need to introduce you to the others before they catch your scent and freak out. They have a problem with nomads in their territory. They are very protective of their way of life. We can't let some wild vampire blow our cover, it would ruin our way of life. We live in secret. The vamps pose as humans and live their lives with the people of the town and we stay in our own community hidden in the forest. It is a great way to live if you aren't for the whole move every day thing. We try to keep the peace and the secret as best we can.' He explained as entered the woods. 'So if you are a shape shifter now, what is your animal?' one of the people behind us spoke up. 'I don't know yet. I suppose I will have to choose one. How do you get the forms you have?' I asked as we entered what looked like a large community of small houses. they were all set in what looked like a rough spiral pattern twisting out from the largest houses in the center. 'These are the vamps.' He said as several vampires wandered into the square that was the center of the community. 'Who is this?!' A male vampire demanded. 'Why have you brought us a nomad? You know others who see the hidden city must die to protect the secret!' He thundered at us. 'Chill, Volti. He is not a normal nomad and he won't tell anyone.' The man beside me stated. I wondered how he could trust me so completely. 'Why does he smell like a shadow walker?' A female asked. 'Because he is one. His talent is to become any species he comes in contact with. He won't be a danger to us.' The man explained. 'I Have come looking for a place I can stay. This place is much like my old home.' I explained to them my home and why I left. They welcomed me, but after a few years I felt the same restless boredom that made me leave my home in the first place. I left and began searching again for the place I belonged in." he finished his story.
We all sat in silence for a while. The story had taken us all in. We were amazed by how many communities there were that creatures like us could live out their lives and not worry about humans. The story had drawn both me and my brother in. I felt the urge to leave home now and search for the places in Noel's story. "Noel why do you think you weren't happy in those places?" I asked, unable to see what he would not have in such a perfect place. "I believe I was looking for you." He said looking at me with eyes that made my heart melt. "I traveled and traveled looking for the thing I did not have. I never realized that I was looking for love. It makes me feel as if I have lived my life with a hole in my chest and when I am near you the hole is filled. I have found what I was looking for. You don't know how happy that makes me." He finished.
Actually, I could see exactly how happy that made him. I didn't say so, for I had gotten lost in the depths of his crimson eyes. The force of his gaze held me and I never wanted to look away. I was sad when my brother cleared his throat and Noel looked away. "So what are we going to do now?" My brother asked. "We can't follow the same routine now. Pretty boy can't travel in the sun. I guess we need a new plan, and I'm Matthew and this is Dawn" I was surprised that my brother had given in so easily. He was going to let Noel Stay with us. I didn't understand. "You are letting him stay? What made you change your mind?" I asked against my better judgment. I should have just taken the miracle without question, but I couldn't hold back my curiosity. "The way he looks at you reminds me of how I used to look at Sadie." he stated simply. I was shocked. He hadn't said her name since the day she had died. I didn't know what to say.
"If you are not opposed to staying in one place a while, I would like to visit my family. I have not seen them in centuries." Noel said breaking the silence. "They probably think I am dead by now. It would be fun to see haw they have done without me." He continued when we didn't answer. "Sure, I can do that. It would be great to visit your family." said brightly. The thought of not moving around made me instantly love the idea. Richard, Do you want to go to Mississippi?" I asked my brother with a pleading look. "Sure." he said unable to fight the joy the idea brought to me.
We loaded up the car with our things and the few things Noel had. I sat in the back with him while Richard drove. We drove east from the little town in Phoenix we had stopped in, headed for New Mexico. My brother drove until the horizon began to lighten. We stopped in a small town, I don't know the name. I was too tired to care. I wasn't used to being up all night. I figured it would take a while for me to get used to the change. Noel noticed how tired I was and said, "You shouldn't have to stay up all night just because I can't go out in the sun." "It's okay, Noel. We will get used to it. It will just take a while." I said. "No I want to help. Would you consider letting me drive? I don't sleep, so it won't hurt me any, and you could get some sleep at night. It would make me feel better, and I bet your brother would like me more, too." He argued, persistent. "Okay, fine. You can drive." I caved. He could be very convincing when he wanted to be.
The next evening, we got in the car and Noel took the driver's seat. I rode up front with him while Richard took the back seat. He grumbles to himself about not getting to drive his own car and I laughed. We decided to head for a small human town near Noel's home to stop and prepare. It didn't take us long to arrive. Noel drove extremely fast.(Vampires, always in a hurry!) I thought to myself smiling. We pulled into the inn just as dawn was setting in. It had only taken four days. Noel went to check in as I woke Richard and got our things. Noel came back out to lead us to our room.
The room was small. It had only two beds and the bedside lamps were bolted to the tables. Noel went to take a shower as I rummaged through my clothes for a formal dress. I had had it for years and had never worn it. I was glad I would finally get the chance. It was an emerald green dress that flared out halfway down my thighs and swirled with every move I made. Richard gave me a disapproving look as he eyed the way it showed all of my shoulders. When Noel walked out of the bathroom he stopped dead and stared at me before shaking himself and going to search for something to wear. I walked into the bathroom and worked on my hair. By the time the sun set, I was ready and Richard was waiting impatiently by the door.
"Can we hurry this up some?" he grumbled. I ignored his foul mood and got into the car. Noel sat in the back with me this time as Richard drove. He wasn't happy that he needed instructions to find the hidden entrance to the town. "Welcome To Lliana." Richard said as we passed through some large vine covered gates. The air around him was tinged grey with his nervousness. "It will be fine." I soothed as he grew tense. He gave me a grateful look as we pulled to a stop in front of the house he had pointed out. "Someone is here. I can smell them." Richard said.
We got out and made our way to the front porch. I could feel the black waves of suspicion and fear emating from the house. "They don't seem pleased to have unexpected company. We should be careful." I warned as we knocked on the door. They nodded in understanding.
"Who are you? What is your business here?" a man's voice came from inside the house. Shock radiated from Noel "Father? Is that you? It Noel. I've returned home." Noel called to the man in the house. The door flew open and a man stood eyeing our group with suspicion. "You claim to be my son, but you can't be for my son left us centuries ago and never returned. How do I know you are him?" The man questioned. I looked at Noel and the look of shock was still frozen on his face. "How can you not recognize me, father? I would have thought you would eagerly accept my return. What has changed you?" Noel asked looking hurt. "The man's face softened as he read the honesty of Noels words. "We have hoped for your return since the day you left us. You nearly killed your mother when you left. I had long since given up hope of your return. Many of us believed you dead. We never heard word from you in all of the years that you were gone. We used to celebrate you birthday. Your mother checked the mail every day to look for letters. She would jump to answer the phone in hope that it would be you. It never was. I still think she never gave up on you. If you are my son, you have much to explain. What you did is unacceptable. You nearly tore our family apart. If you are not my son, then you better hope that you don't make it into your mother's room. If she is put through this again for nothing I will personally rip you to pieces and set your sorry carcass aflame." The man's forceful words had me speechless. I couldn't understand how he could hate his son so much for being unhappy. I couldn't help the words that rushed from my mouth at his threat. "Sir, I'm sorry, but you can't possibly blame him for leaving. If he was unhappy, it would have been cruel to force him to stay. He left to find his place in this world and you can't blame him for wanting a reason to live. I can't just let you judge him for leaving to find a life of his own." I was momentarily distracted by the blindingly vivid red that colored th e air around me. I couldn't let him take his anger out on Noel for no reason. It was unfair. The man turned to me. He seemed to just have noticed my presence. He looked me up and down, his eyes widening as he took in my curvy figure accented by the dress. Surprise and curiosity colored the air around him momentarily before being replaced by more suspicion. "And who the hell are you?!" He spat at me viciously. I was surprised by his anger towards me. What had I done?
I was snapped out of my thoughts as Noel placed himself firmly between me and he man. The man looked from me to Noel lingering on the protective stance he was standing in and noting the low growl slipping from his lips. I put my hand on Noels arm to calm him. "Noel" I warned. He looked at my pleading face a moment before dropping his protective stance. I didn't fail to notice that he still stayed between me and the other man. Neither did his father. "Who is the girl? Why is she here?" He asked Noel gruffly. "I have never seen her before." "This is Dawn. She and her brother, Richard have been traveling with me for a few days." Noel explained. "Well, don't just stand there. Come in and sit down. I'll get your mother." The man said, reentering the house. "Mary, Jake! We have company and I think you should meet them." He called, just above a whisper. (Again, Vampires, Ugh.) This would take getting used to.
A tall blond boy walked down the stairs and froze. Shock radiated from where he stood, quickly followed by anger. He didn't seem to know what to do with himself, so he just stood there gawking at Noel like he had never seen another person before in his life. A petite woman cam in from the study and looked up from the book in her hands. Her eyes froze on Noel and the book slid from her finger. Tears of joy filled her eyes as the pink of her love filled the room. She flung herself at Noel. She threw her arms around him and cried into his shoulder. I could feel his guilt as he realized how much his mother had missed him. He put his arms around her hesitantly and patted her on the back. "It's good to see you, too mom. I've missed you." He whispered into her hair. That's when the boy on the stairs snapped. "How dare you show your face here again! Do you even realize the shit we went through when you left! Of all the stupid things you could do, coming back was the biggest. You have some nerve coming back into this house after you walked out on your family!" He screamed, rushing down the stairs at full vampire speed to get into Noel's face. "Get out! I should kill you for coming back at all!" "Jake!" Noel's mother exclaimed in shock. "No mother! I'm not going to sit by and watch as he rips our family apart again! If father won't kick him out, then I will!" he raged. All of a sudden it was too much. His fury overwhelmed me and I collapsed.
"Dawn! Dawn, are you alright! Noel was holding me in his arms. It took me a moment to remember where we were. I was laying on the floor. Noel had me cradled in his arms and Richard was sitting on the couch glaring at Jake. I noticed the boy had a huge gash across his face. I wondered briefly what had happened. Noel's mother was sitting beside him tending the cut. His father was standing in the corner looking at me confused and suspicious as he eyed the way Noel held me to his chest. I looked back at Noel. He was looking me over trying to find out what had caused me to faint. "Dawn, what happened? You just collapsed. I don't understand." He looked worried. I smiled. "I'm fine, Noel. I just couldn't handle the pressure of it is all. It was to much, and my system just shut down. I will be fine after a moment." Then I realized what had happened to Jake. I eyed Richard suspiciously."Did you hit him, Richard?!" He didn't answer, but I took his guilty expression as a confirmation. "Why did you do that? He didn't mean to do it and you could have calmed him down without knocking him out." I scolded. I felt the smug satisfaction radiate from him. "It felt good, though, and he deserved it. He should learn to control his emotions better. I don't think I left a permanent mark though." he seemed disappointed. I laughed. "What the hell are you two going on about? What happened?" Noel looked confused and annoyed. "His emotions became too powerful for me to handle. I passed out from the pressure of his anger on my mind." I explained, I had forgotten he was new to my talent. I wondered what his family thought of me. I looked to Noels father. He seemed to have come to a decision about me at last. "Sir, it's driving me crazy. Can you please tell me what you are thinking." I asked. He gave me an amused look and cleared his throat. "I have come to several conclusions. You will have to tell me if they are correct. First, I get the feeling that my son is more than just traveling with you. It seems to me that there is something between you." He paused to get my reaction. I blushed and he took it to mean he was correct. "Second I have been puzzling over what you are. I noticed immediately that you are not a vampire. You have a heartbeat. You are not a werewolf. You don't smell like one and you would be in wolf form, seeing as it is a full moon tonight. You are not a shape shifter, for you don't run a temperature. You are magical, but not a witch. The magical presence is there, but it's not quite the same as in a regular witch. You are not whole or even part human. I believe you are a new species of creature. Your brother seems to have the same qualities as you. Since we have no record of your species I must ask what it is that you are."
I smiled. "I don't have a clue. I was hoping you could tell us. We are the only ones like this that I have ever met. Our parents were the same but they didn't have a clue either. As far as we know we are a totally new species." He seemed let down. "Well if you are a new species, you will need a name. Do you have any ideas?" He asked. "No we never thought about it. We were just different. I guess we could give ourselves a name, but what would it be? I puzzled over it. I looked up and noticed a faint stirring of light. I hadn't realized we had been here so long. At that point I realized how tired I was. I yawned deeply and Noel chuckled beside me. "I keep forgetting that you need sleep." He whispered in my ear. "Is my room still suitable for people?" He asked his father. "Yes, we kept everything exactly the way you left it. Your mother wouldn't let us touch it." He smiled lovingly at his wife. "Then you can sleep in my bed, Dawn. It is better than the couch, I guess." He offered. I was too tired to care. "Sure, it's fine." I mumbled into his chest as he helped me up the stairs. I was out before my head hit the pillow. The last thing I remember is him laying down beside me as I sunk into a deep dreamless sleep.UNCASVILLE -- Ryan Boatright was gone.
After three years in Storrs and fresh off a national championship, the 5-foot-10 guard was ready to forgo his last season at UConn. He and teammate DeAndre Daniels came in together and they were going to exit that way, too.
But, just before it was time to go, Boatright decided to unpack and stick around another year.
"I was definitely going to leave, but I took that long to make the right decision," said Boatright prior to Friday night's Jim Calhoun Charity All-Star Classic at Mohegan Sun Arena. "I think I made the right decision."
What made him do it?
"I feel like I worked way too hard all my life," he said. "I'm a better player than a second-round pick, so I just wanted to come back and raise my stock. I get another year of experience showing the world and showing the scouts that I can start at the point guard position."
Boatright's decision sounds similar to what Shabazz Napier did a year ago when the latter opted to return and ended up guiding UConn to its fourth national title since 1999. Napier also played his way into the first round of the NBA Draft, with the Charlotte Hornets taking him with the 24th pick in June and then trading him to the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat.
Napier had Boatright riding shotgun on the championship run, but this year coach Kevin Ollie will only have one of them in the backcourt.
"I shared that responsibility with Shabazz," said Boatright, who is the lone Husky senior. "Now that he's gone I'm kind of taking that leading role by myself. I'm looking forward to it. I got KO (Ollie) on my side. I got my teammates on my side and I just want the best for everybody."
In order to accomplish that, Boatright followed his coach's advice after a few days of celebration following the championship.
"Coach says all the time `don't get drunk on success,' but it's hard not to," Boatright said. "It started right after we won; we wanted that feeling again. Right after we won we let our bodies get right for a few days and we wanted to get right back to work.
"We've been working since a few days after the game and we look forward to the season."
Boatright has a solid grasp on what he needs to do going into his final college season.
"Just be me," Boatright said. "Just be myself. Play hard on both ends of the floor and be a leader. Lead the team. And those are the things I need to do to just help the team win.
"You can't really say what you need to do; you just try to play your game and not mess it up. Really, my main focus this year is leading the team and trying to make everyone else around me better."
The Huskies can use a guy like Boatright with a young, talented team that includes sophomore center Amida Brimah, North Carolina State transfer Rodney Purvis and heralded freshman Daniel Hamilton. UConn figures to be one of the top teams again in the American Athletic Conference along with SMU and Memphis.
"It's going to be great," Boatright said. "We're brothers. We love each other and we're all working hard to be better and win another championship."

Manon Iessel was one of the early French female comic artists. Mainly a prolific illustrator of books since the 1930s, she also drew comics for La Semaine de Suzette and Bernadette ('La Petite Fille aux Lions', written by Henriette Robitaillie, 1954-1955). She was the artist of the comics series 'Capucine', that appeared in the monthly magazine of the same name in the 1960s.

Current Projects
Following the successful completion of Oriole Park in 1992, the Maryland Stadium Authority has been asked to participate in a number of public facility projects throughout the State of Maryland.
The degree of MSA involvement differs from project to project, but they fall into two basic categories – those which are mandated by the Maryland General Assembly, and those initiated by local jurisdictions, agencies, or universities.
Those originating with the legislature involve language in the Maryland Code, which gives MSA the authority to issue bonds for the financing, oversee project management and have an operational oversight role. These projects include the two Baltimore stadiums, Baltimore and Ocean City Convention Centers, Hippodrome, and Montgomery County Conference Center.
With other projects, MSA has served as the owner’s representative, construction manager, or consultant. On projects where MSA provides management services, the agency is reimbursed for its professional services.
After more than twenty years of building projects throughout the State of Maryland, the Stadium Authority enjoys a reputation for delivering quality work on time and on budget.

UTSA hosts lecture and exhibit by renowned Luxembourg architect Lucien Steil
Architect Lucien Steil and art from the book he co-edited, "New Palladians"
(Oct. 13, 2011) -- The UTSA College of Architecture will host the exhibit "New Palladians" and a lecture by distinguished Luxembourg architect Lucien Steil in joint events organized by the Texas chapter of the Institute for Classical Architecture and UTSA. The lecture and exhibit are free and open to the public.
>> The "New Palladians" exhibit runs Oct. 14-27 in the UTSA Downtown Gallery on the first floor of the Durango Building. Gallery hours are 8 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday-Friday.
>> The lecture by Lucien Steil is 5:30 p.m., Wednesday, Oct. 19 in the Buena Vista Street Building Aula Canaria (1.328) on the UTSA Downtown Campus.
At the Oct. 19 lecture, Steil will discuss "New Palladians," a book he co-edited with Alireza Sagharchi that was published by ArtMedia. The book honors the tradition set forth by Palladio and, through the work of noted 21st century classicists, celebrates that modern classical and vernacular architecture are flourishing and evolving.
The book exemplifies commitment to the increasingly vital topics of ecological building and sustainable urbanism. The exhibit features work demonstrating the perpetual relevance of Palladio from nearly 50 architects worldwide including Leon Krier, Quinlan Terry, Allan Greenberg and Andres Duany.
"We are pleased to host Lucien Steil's lecture and exhibit," said John D. Murphy, dean of the College of Architecture. "It represents an important contribution to the contemporary architecture discourse which is focused on ways that architecture can relearn the important lessons of the past as we strive to create a truly sustainable and aesthetic built environment in which people live, work and thrive."
One of the world's most influential architects, Palladio began his career as a stonemason in the Republic of Venice; his vast understanding of building technology is apparent on examining his work. Palladio followed and learned from the masters of the Renaissance period, developing into an academic whose design process and analysis of contemporary needs became somewhat of a guide to approaching design for several hundred years. By distilling timeless and universal principles, his works became the true embodiment of sustainability.
"The great thing about Palladio's works is that they have continued to inform design," said Mac White of Michael G. Imber Architects. "They weren't fixed or stagnant models that were just being repeated."
White is on the board of the state chapter of the Institute for Classical Architecture, along with Michael Imber. Imber's modern classical design firm in San Antonio won a 2011 Palladio Award for its work on the Beachtown House in Galveston.
Though ecological building and sustainable urbanism are hot topics worldwide, they are particularly relevant to the current visioning process in San Antonio. White says our city benefits greatly from having local sources for building materials, while other metropolitan areas rely on materials trucked or shipped in.
He points to San Antonio's unique stone and steel resources in addition to a core of traditional craftsmen as our most valuable green-building assets. White indicates the redevelopment of the Pearl brewery district as a bright spot of activity, and one that can add to the discussion about HemisFair Park redevelopment and how the downtown urban core can become more integrated into its surroundings.
"In terms of larger-scale urbanism, we are compelled to think about the resultant architectural experience that is being created," said White. "Architecture should produce an attractive, memorable place to which people want to return. If you are creating urbanism and no one is using it, it's not successful architecture. We must change the way we approach development as well and consistently consider mixed use development and form-based zoning, rather than use-based zoning."

A 5-year-old boy is dead following a farming accident in York County.
The accident happened in the family barn Thursday evening in Washington Township on Blue Hill School Road. York County Deputy Coroner Steve Cosey says Jacob Nell was playing when a tractor wheel fell over and pinned him on the ground.
The boy was taken to York Hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after 8 p.m. Cosey says the cause of death is blunt force chest trauma.
Pennsylvania State Police are investigating how it happened.Definitions

Examples
All these different disciplines became known as parasitology—more of a loose federation than an actual science.
In the late 1800s, scientists sometimes referred to parasitology as medical zoology.
He has taught at the college ever since, only taking some time off to pursue his doctorate with a particular interest in parasitology, which is the study of parasites, their hosts and the relationship between the two.
He got his chance at a remote Methodist mission hospital in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where he learned blood chemistry, parasitology, and basic hematology in a rudimentary lab.
De-worming dogs monthly—instead of the previously recommended annually or quarterly—can greatly lower the infection risk, says Dr. Kevin R. Kazacos, a professor of veterinary parasitology at Purdue University.
This Business Grows Every Time Fido Does His
He graduated in 1953 from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and went on to receive a master's degree in parasitology there in 1955.

this wiki
The Gift Box is a feature that allows players to store their unplaced or unused gifts.
UsageEdit
The gift box is used as a storage place for:
- Accepted gift requests
- Prizes from opened Mystery Eggs
- Prizes from completion of a ribbon, mastery, goal or other achievement
- Trees grown from Mystery Seedlings in your Seedling Nursery
- Animals grown from Mystery Babies in your Baby Nursery
- Adopted animals or other objects obtained from links on a players' Facebook feed (besides fuel and coins for celebrations, which are both automatically applied to your account)
LocationEdit
Location of Gift Box - Bottom-right
The gift box is located on the bottom right hand corner of the game screen. To access it, click the gift box icon and then choose the gift box again. From the Gift Box, players can scroll through the pages of their gifts using the left and right arrows on the left and right sides of the Gift Box. They can choose if they would like to sell the gift for an predetermined number of coins based on the item's value, or they can choose to use the item, at which point the gift box will close and the player can place the item on the farm. Once an item is placed on a farm, it cannot be put back into the gift box.
CapacityEdit
The number in the pink box located on the Gift Box icon is the number of unique gifts your gift box is currently holding.
Timeline of capacity increasesEdit
The capacity officially increased from 30 gifts to 50 gifts on 24 February 2010.
On February 24th, 2010, FarmVille expanded the Gift Box from holding only 30 gifts to 50 gifts.
Expanded from 50 to 200 in the summer of 2010.
By November 2010 the maximum was 200, exceeding it resulted in older items being deleted.
The maximum increased beyond 200 on 20 November 2010 to an unknown maximum.
On November 30, 2010, it was announced that the Gift Box had increased to 500 items.
On June 29, 2011 storage capacity was increased once again, to a total of 1000 items per farm.
As of October 2, 2011 and for at least a couple months beforehand) the gift box cap is at 500. You could have more items, but will not be able to use various things (such as eggs), and items could be deleted after getting too many.
Features of the Gift BoxEdit
A gift box with 165 (not yet on max number = full)
The Gift Box has a two main features (besides the obvious storage for gifts): "Sell All" and "Make a Wish!". With the "Sell All" feature, farmers can choose to sell all of the gifts in their Gift Box at one time, instead of selling them all individually. The "Make a Wish!" feature was introduced on March 2 2010. With this feature, if farmers want their neighbors to send them a specific gift, they can pick and choose from a list of items which one they wish to receive. A subsequent status update is posted, notifying that player's friends of what they would like to receive. Some items in the gift box can also be Re-Gifted.
New Gift Box InterfaceEdit
A new gift box interface was released on April 20th. This new version has a search tab that allowed players to search for gifts when there are to much on their gift box and is now similar to the market: to search for gifts easily, player can filter by:

INERRANCY
TMS is committed to the historic evangelical doctrine of biblical inerrancy
Expository preaching is the hallmark ministry of a pastor consumed with the glory of God and the centrality of Scripture. Every academic program at The Master’s Seminary is designed to equip students to faithfully exegete and exposit the biblical text, whether as a preacher behind the pulpit, or a professor behind the lectern.

Charles Haddon SpurgeonNotes on Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper
Anthony ASHLEY-COOPER, First Earl of Shaftesbury, son and heir of Sir John
COOPER and Anne ASHLEY, born Julybourne St. Giles, 1661. In 1670
he became a member of the administration called "The Cabal" in which
he was a lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer; and on the
resignation of the Lord Keeper Bridgeman, November 1672, he was constituted lord
high chancellor of England, having been created, April preceding, Baron Cooper,
or Pawlett, and Earl of Shaftsbury.
He married first, Margaret, daughter of Thomas Lord Coventry; secondly,
Frances, daughter of David Cecil, third Earl of Exeton; thirdly, August 20,
1655, at St. Paul's Covent Garden, Margaret, daughter William (Spencer) 2nd
Baron Spencer of Wormleighton by Penelope, 1st. daughter Henry (Wristhesley 3rd.
Earl of Southampton, who delivered him two daughters. His son and heir was by
the second lady. The date of death of Margaret is not known. She was living when
he was created southwest to the Pacific Ocean, which
embraced almost the entire "Southern States" of today. Of this immense
region the king constituted them absolute lords and proprietors. Anthony died
January 21, 1683, at Amsterdam, Holland.
Other Information:
Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (1621-1683) was a prominent
English politician of the reign of Charles II. He was a student of Oxford
University, England. Cooper.
In 1663, the Earl of Shaftesbury was one of eight Lords Proprietors given
title to a huge tract of land in North America which became the Province of
Carolina..
Anthony Ashley Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury (1621-83), is Charles II's
committed and hard-working chancellor. He ruthlessly exploits the Popish Plot to
try and prevent James II becoming king and to generate anti-Catholic feeling.
His Deism and love of parliamentary government lead him into conflict with
Charles, who increasingly has pro-French and pro-Catholic sympathies. Hounded in
his last months on a charge of treason, Shaftesbury dies in Holland.
Miss Massie:
Evidence [that I have yet to locate but many people state].
Daughters of Anthony Ashley-Cooper by Miss Massie
1.Lucretia -
2.Penelope - b. England; d. VA. Married Peter MASSIE.
Another position is taken by the genealogist of the Johnston family. It is
agreed that Anthony ASHLEY-COOPER was the father of illegitimate daughters by a
daughter of Andrew MASSIE of Edinburgh, Scotland. But the intent of the visit to
London by the mother-to-be and her brother William was to seek passage to
Virginia, where William desired to be a surveyor. This version indicates that
the twins were born after William and his sister arrived in Virginia. The twins
were Sarah, who married William JOHNSTON, and Lucretia, who married William's
brother, John JOHNSTON. This position would, of course, remove the ancestral
line of ASHLEY-COOPER. No attempt will be made to validate either position. The
first stated option, and the MASSIE line narration, seems to better conform with
known dates and names.

Shaftesbury, Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st earl of, 1621-83,
English statesman. In the Puritan Revolution, he supported the crown until 1644,
but then joined the parliamentarians. He was an able general, was made a member
of the council of state, and supported Oliver Cromwell until 1654. Thereafter,
he turned against the Protectorate because of his distrust of autocratic rule.
He supported the Rump Parliament against John Lambert and then participated in
the Restoration in 1663, he took much interest in plans for the colony. He joined the
opposition to the 1st earl of Clarendon and was a member of the Cabal. Created
earl of Shaftesbury, he became lord chancellor in 1672. His name is closely
associated with the formation of the Whig party - in its early years a group of
men who opposed the designs of Charles II and his courtiers to increase the
power of the king at the expense of Parliament. The crown's efforts to improve
the position of Roman Catholics were opposed by Shaftesbury, who renounced his
earlier belief in toleration and supported the Test Act (1673). He was dismissed
from office in 1673. Out of favor at court and embittered by his imprisonment in
1677 for opposing the prorogation of Parliament, he made use of the Popish Plot
(see Oates, Tutus) to promote opposition to the earl of Danby and to encourage
anti-Catholic feeling. On Danby's fall he became president of the council,
pressed for the exclusion bill to keep James, duke of York (an avowed Roman
Catholic) from the throne, and supported the claims of the duke of Monmouth. For
this he was arrested (1681), and his position became precarious, since his Whig
party was now discredited and the king in complete control of government. He was
bitterly satirized in John Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel. An indictment
for treason failed, but he fled (1682) to Holland and soon died. Aided by wealth
and an exceptional mind, Shaftesbury has been called the most skillful
politician of his day. He was a friend of John Locke. See biography by L. F.
Brown (1933).Prohibition marks the years between 1920 and 1933 when the selling, manufacturing and transporting of alcohol for consumption was illegal in the United States.
Prohibition had strong support through the temperance movement, but the 18th amendment that put it into action was eventually repealed with the ratification of the 21st Amendment.
That day, on Dec. 5, 1933, Prohibition was officially over and alcohol was once again legal to sell and consume.
Here is a chronological list of key events that occurred during and after the Prohibition Era, mixed with important laws regulated by local and national government.

New Delhi: For 11 years he has been incarcerated in a 16x12 foot high-security cell in the Tihar Jail here. But Mohammed Afzal Guru, convicted for masterminding the attack on India`s parliament in 2001, does not dread the same fate that 26/11 attacker Ajmal Amir Kasab met.
Since Pakistani terrorist Kasab`s hanging Nov 21 in a Pune jail, the fear of a similar execution has not affected Afsal Guru yet, a jail official told IANS.
"Afzal Guru is lodged in a 16-foot-long and 12-foot-wide cell in Tihar Jail No.3. He has so far not shown any fear that he will be hanged like Kasab," Tihar spokesperson Sunil Gupta told IANS.
"So far he has not shown any emotions about dying. In fact, the gallows are just 15-20 metres from his cell," said the official.
Afzal Guru spends his time like any other prisoner, but unlike them he is lodged in a high-security part of the prison, meant for high-risk prisoners. His cell is guarded by a contingent of nearly 50 armed personnel drawn from the Tamil Nadu Special Police, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Central Reserve Police Force.
"He spends his time doing routine work like the other inmates," Gupta said.
On Dec 13, 2001, five Pakistani terrorists attacked the Indian parliament, but were killed by the security forces. Three other men, including Afzal Guru, accused of masterminding the entire plot, were absconding.. Afzal Guru was sentenced to death on Dec 18, 2002, by a trial court, which the Delhi High Court upheld on Oct 29,2003. His appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court on Aug 4, 2005. His mercy plea is pending with the president.
Human rights activists and liberal intellectuals say he should not be hanged, arguing that, unlike Kasab, he was not present at the scene of the crime and evidence against him was circumstantial.
According to jail authorities, Afzal Guru, in his 40s, spends most of his time either alone or with his books.
"There is a huge pile of books inside his ward. He has a radio, which airs only two stations. He occasionally listens to music but does not interact much with anybody," another jail officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, told IANS.
Hailing from Baramulla district in Jammu and Kashmir, Afzal Guru wakes up early in the morning between 5 am and 6 am and begins his day with Namaz (prayer).
For breakfast, he is provided bread, tea and potato vegetable around 9 am as per the jail manual. For lunch he is served dal, vegetable and chapati, which is also his evening meal.
Like other inmates, he goes to sleep between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m.
Every week, he goes through a medical check-up. He is allowed to take a round in the garden outside his cell but in the company of his guards.
Security officers guarding him said there are times when he interacts and talks to them.
But interacting with him is not easy otherwise. It is allowed only through the director general and deputy inspector general of the prison.
"If the jail superintendent has to talk to him, he has to seek permission from the DG," the officer'Jhumpa Lahiri's first two books were more vivid than free. Albums of precision, they depicted a Bengali-American world rich with customs and cuisine, with vermilion striping the parted hair of married women, with second-generation children wielding Ivy League degrees and navigating contradictory worlds. "Unaccustomed Earth" returns to this same upwardly mobile immigrant setting, but it achieves something more profound than either "The Interpreter of Maladies," Lahiri's debut short story collection, or "The Namesake," her novel. The eight longish stories here (three of them interconnected) drop their pose and by rearranging themselves -- shifting against themselves -- achieve something forceful and wise. It may be the hybrid length that gives them their naturalness. Lahiri seems to have waited on the unfolding, refusing either to expand the pieces into novellas or to fastidiously tighten the scope. The first story alone is more than 50 pages long.
The wisdom of the volume, though, is the way an abiding grief drifts through the stories rather than being captured and framed. Here, a contrast between this new work and Lahiri's novel is revealing. In what is arguably the key moment in "The Namesake," the main character, Gogol, learns about the tragedy that changed his father's life. Lahiri writes:  ..." The shock here is generic; the descriptions force emotion through repetition, like hammer blows to the head of a screw.
In a story from the new volume called "A Choice of Accommodations," however, a character in a similar moment of recognition shifts through self-contradictions toward a hard-won (but still ambiguous) affirmation of his life -- the patience of the screw being turned. A despondent character, Amit, is attending a wedding when he realizes that his world is not going to change: his wife Megan, "his job, his life in New York, the girls. The most profound thing, having Maya and Monika, had already happened; nothing would be more life-altering than that. He wanted to change none of it, yet a part of him sometimes longed to return to the beginning of his relationship with Megan, if only for the pleasure of anticipating and experiencing those things again." The certainty of his choices -- he wanted to change none of it -- is charged nonetheless with longing and loss, as if to say, not even deep happiness can save us feeling stranded. We are beyond consolation and orientation.
This stranded sense is everywhere in "Unaccustomed Earth." In the title story (to my mind the book's best), a daughter's grief for her dead mother is complicated by her awkward relationship with her father. The parents had moved to America from India, and now Ruma (the daughter) has moved to Seattle from the Northeast, repeating their immigrant isolation. In Lahiri's portrait, Ruma's independence is only a half-liberation, though, for the separation makes it hard for her to assess her own life. The underlying theme of the story -- indeed all of Lahiri's work -- is that dislocation requires boldness and produces character but then leaves us tentative inside. Ruma is successful but bewildered, and she longs to talk to her father about the mother she misses. The 70-year-old father won't admit to his daughter that he's in a Platonic love affair back east. Part of the power of the story is the way the father makes the kind of peace with family breaches that his daughter cannot. He is happy, and his self-consciousness is winning. When he goes back east, Ruma's vulnerability finally ruptures into grief: "Where had her mother gone, when life persisted, when Ruma still needed her to explain so many things?" It is moving -- also surprising -- to think of the absent mother as an explainer of the world, rather than simply as emotional support. And how simple but taut is the recognition that grief is a lost question rather than a declaration of despair. In her gust of desolation, Lahiri's Ruma echoes the disconsolate father in "The Brothers Karamazov." Returning from the funeral of his son, he notices the boy's empty boots and cries out: "Illusha, old man, dear old man, where are your little feet?"
Other characters in "Unaccustomed Earth" are stranded in their unspoken passions as well. In "Nobody's Business," a student falls in love with a housemate and then hides a secret he learns about her boyfriend. More intricately, in "Hell-Heaven," a mother's relationship with a male family friend is closer than her relationship to her husband has ever been. Reflecting on this, the daughter feels a complicated blend of compassion and pain. This friendship at its height, she decides, offered "the only pure happiness [her mother] ever felt," but then, in a searing coda, she notes: "I don't think even my birth made her as happy."
The linked narratives in the second part hinge on an early "secret attraction" and something like a repression of grief. Childhood friends Hema and Kaushik find each other as adults in Rome, where an abrupt, unhesitating romance is shadowed with images of death.
It is strange to praise stories this sad. But "Unaccustomed Earth" takes advantage of the inner strains of a particular immigrant world to say something important about the modern: the geographical distance from Calcutta to Boston reflects the historical distance from communal priorities (extended families living together, grandparents naming grandchildren, etc.) to the individual freedoms that are the American calling card. The experience of those freedoms may be less liberating than their promise. Saul Bellow's Herzog shuddered at the "victories of untrammeled autonomy" -- shuddered because freedom asks too much of us. Lahiri's stranded characters know this all too well.£110,000

love this seriesAs the global recession puts government aid budgets under pressure, and with the UN revealing a funding shortfall of nearly $5bn last week, calls are being made to expand the role of private philanthropy. There have even been suggestions that the wealthy should be given tax breaks to incentivise more private giving.
A new buzzword is "philanthrocapitalism", a view that the talents and methods of successful capitalists should be applied to the "business" of social welfare and poverty alleviation because governments, traditional charities and NGOs are comparatively ineffective and inefficient. This is part of the "New Philanthropy", the ascendancy of private foundations within public policy and international development, dominated by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
In 2007, the foundation spent $1.22bn (£718m) on its global health programme and $234m on its 700-plus staff and operations, a little less than the annual budget of the World Health Organisation. What Microsoft did in the software market, the foundation appears to be replicating in global health. Its reach covers an astounding spectrum of global health actors, and it has an active role in shaping their policies, plans and actions.
Between 1998 and 2007, 20 recipients accounted for about two thirds of the foundation's total spend. They included the WHO and Unicef, public-private partnerships such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, universities, key NGOs and even the World Bank. It sits on the governing structures of many global health institutions, and has the ear of government and business leaders worldwide.
The WHO, having been weakened as an independent multilateral agency over the past two decades, now has a private foundation as one of its biggest funders, which uses its financial leverage to guide the WHO in certain directions.
The influence of the Gates Foundation also has knock-on effects. NGOs and universities that are not recipients of its money or not aligned to its vision can become marginalised. Health issues it deems unimportant are sidelined. This is relevant, because the way the health problems of the poor are defined and prioritised is crucial in framing an effective response. But, unlike other big global health institutions, the foundation is unaccountable. It has no formal governing body. Though it has an advisory board and consults widely, some in the health community feel it only listens to what it wants to hear.
Given its widespread influence, the argument that private foundations built on private wealth need not be publicly accountable is mistaken. After all, most private foundations are publicly subsidised through tax breaks. Independent evaluation of private foundations is important because philanthropy can have unintended consequences. The health systems of poor countries are fragile, and it is not uncommon for misdirected aid to damage them further.
Accountability is also important because of potential conflicts of interest. After three decades of neoliberal orthodoxy coupled with the "public.
Threats to good governance and the accountable and democratic functioning of public institutions also need to be better recognised – and rigorously assessed. Historically, health has been built on the base of effective and accountable public bodies, coupled with technology and community empowerment. If the Gates Foundation's strapline – "all lives have equal value" – is to be meaningful, it must strive harder for a fairer distribution of power and agency, and recognise its responsibility towards enabling democracy and good?).
If he was drunk it is to bad he didn’t kill himself. If he fell asleep thank goodness he didn’t take anyone with him. If was sober, my god help him and his family and Id wish him a speedy recovery.
He was traveling in excess of 120 mph when he passed me. I saw him in my rearview mirror weaving in and out of traffic. I own a sports car and was able to guess the vehicle by the lights and lowered profile. When the vehicle passed me all I saw was his rear lights. My comments to my family, wow! Minutes later I approached the scene and the ball of flames on the freeway. When I saw the wide tie laying on the shoulder I new immediately it was the Lamborghini. I pulled over to offer assistance. Others onscene were offering assistance. He was amazed that he walked away; so was I! I own a sports and know what that kind of speed is like. He is lucky to have walked away.
Well, what do you expect? Thank goodness he didn’t hurt someone else!
I didn’t know that it took 20 minutes and both southbound and northbound lanes for a helicopter to land. It was either one large helicopter or the authorities were on a power trip.
20min no way. I got there right after it happened and was stuck for over an hour. Not to mention all cars were turned off during the wait and some idiots were running thru the parked cars to see what happened. I’d compare it to the opening scene of Revolution.
We were coming home from watching Hotel Transylvania (good show by the way), and we came on to the scene of the accident of this guy’s burning exotic. I knew right away that it was an exotic sports car (you can just tell), and it was a sight to see. Don’t think it had been on fire too long because southbound I-15 was not closed yet. We drove by maybe just a couple of minutes after. I’m surprised he lived to tell about it, but agree, if he was under the influence, he should face the harshest penalty available. That could have been anyone of us!!! Idiot driver either way…sober or under the influence. He showed a total lack of consideration for all, including himself.
What an *^(&$%$^%!!!! That’s just the kind of stupid crud that will make car insurance rates go up. And, just who do you think will be picking up the tab for the air ambulance? and all the responders? Hmmm? I bet you dollars to doughnuts he doesn’t have it and we the taxpayers will be footing all the costs for that plus his medical bills. I just bet ya.
This inconsiderate idiot was jeopardizing the safety of all the other drivers and passengers on the freeway!
Reality Checker (#7)
Who owns and races around in a Lambo without insurance?
Also, you might consider the necessity of putting out the fire and clearing the scattered parts and checking for possible additional passengers that may be injured before opening up traffic lanes again. I’ll never forget the accident that emergency responders left too soon to get traffic going again only to discover nearly a day later a father looking alongside the road and finding his now deceased son that had been thrown in the accident and overlooked. He passed away several hours after the accident alone in the bushes on the side of roadway. Life is short, but come on, better safe than sorry. He’s still an idiot, but imagine if you were a first responder and missed a big call for the sake of a few extra moments.
Have any of you driven I-15 Southbound at 5:00 A:M as the Temeculoids drive 90-100 mph in their Yukons, Suburbans and other SUV,s ? Talk about terrifying!
We saw the aftermath of the accident and the car looked very bad. He was pretty lucky to have survived this accident.
I was driving southbound and saw an orange explosion light up the sky and later the car in flames. It looked more like a boat to me. I don’t know how anyone could escape something that horrific and survive. I’m relieved that no one was killed.
This guy passed me and my friend going almost 150, he shook my entire car. His lights were not on. He had to swerve quickly to avoid hitting a car in front of him after that and that’s when he lost control and started spinning across the freeway lanes and then bam! a huge explosion. My friend parked the car, I called 911 and handed the phone to some man and sprinted to the burning car to make sure he was okay. I thought he was intoxicated. . . he smelled of alcohol (unless that was just something burning) and couldn’t talk without slurring all his words. The man I handed the phone too ran over eventually after he saw me having some trouble and helped me move the man away from the car as we were afraid another explosion would take place. It didn’t really dawn on me until I reached the car how pissed off at him I was. I jeapordized my own safety to save this inconsiderate guy! not the smartest move on my part, but I’m glad no one was hurt. I was surprised to see him in one piece when I ran to the car, I thought for sure he was going to be scattered across the road. Quite a relief to see him okay, just badly burned. Definitely my scariest moment on the freeway!
Do re really need cars that can go 200 MPH
I understand the whole sports car thing — had a few myself but we simply don’t need cars that can go that fast. For one thing they put all others in jeopardy. The average buyer of one of these machines doesn’t have the skills to handle the power or the brains not to practice their skills when drinking.
I love the comments, I worked this accident, when we came on scene, we were not sure how many people were in the car, if someone was inside still, and were was the driver..we also were not sure if this was going to be a fatality crime scene. so we delay cleaning up the debris until chp say go. also the reasoning for both side of the freeway being shut down was for the air ambulance. these guys against faa regulations dropped in underneath the fog bank and weaved thru powerlines to set down and save someones life. so the next time you are slightly inconvienenced by a road closure, think of this in your prospective as being that person that we are coming to help.
Possible Booze, Stupidity, Testosterone and a high powered machine………. the perfect storm.
Nice flying by the He-Lo Ambulance crew.
Do you work for the fire department? If so, how did you pass an oral/written???
You are extremely rude!
@ comment 17…..that’s really THE best you had to offer? Amazing, wish I could have a conversation with you. I am amazed, and glad, no one was seriously hurt. Speed DOES kill and I am thankful to all those who responded.
sounds as if the car was stolen from the comments that are given by the possible witnesses. I hope VN keeps up posted. Thank God he didn’t take out anyone.
the car was not stolen.hes not a bad guy.not to smart to be driving in that manner.i can not defend what he was doing.people drive like a** holes on the 15 I drive the 15 all the time SLOW DOWN we will all get there safe.thanks 99% of you driving fast could NOT control you car, if it gets a flat tire at the speed you are traveling.THINK before you head out. I want to see my family every day and not get killed by you a**s speeding by me.
Comment #21 goes to "the driver" that caused this also… another… I know him post: "was not a bad guy", "not too smart", "made a bad decision", when do these "nice guys" ever learn, when they take a life or near take a life, for their irresponsible actions….? He 35, give me a break. I am not taking this out on "know him", rather the driver and any other "nice person, that made a bad decision at the time"…

The event will take place at the Anthology Film Archives on August 17, 18, and 19 and is presented by Cinema Retro Magazine and David Savage.
SQUIRM - by Jeff Lieberman - 1976, 92 minutes, 35mm
The undisputed king of killer worm movies! Set in hot, humid, and creepy rural Georgia, SQUIRM traces the havoc that ensues when downed power lines pump electricity into the soil, creating an army of vicious, deadly earthworms. Despite its over-the-top premise, SQUIRM is a masterpiece of slow build-up, patiently and enjoyably establishing its characters and its atmospheric milieu…before unleashing the hordes!
Screening Details: Friday 8/17 at 7:00pm, 8/18 at 9:15, Jeff Lieberman & Don Scardino will be in attendance.
BLUE SUNSHINE - by Jeff Lieberman - 1978, 89 minutes, 35mm
Starring erotic-film luminary Zalman King (9 1/2 WEEKS, TWO MOON JUNCTION), who passed away earlier this year, BLUE SUNSHINE is a nightmarish take on the legacy of the freewheeling 60s, its plot hinging on a variety of normal, upstanding citizens whose early LSD experimentation comes back to haunt them (and their friends and neighbors) with a vengeance. Something like a counter-culture-fueled zombie movie, BLUE SUNSHINE channels elements of TAXI DRIVER (violence in the midst of a political campaign) and DAWN OF THE DEAD (shopping-mall-set climax), but transmutes them into something entirely unique and utterly demented.
Screening Details: 8/18 at 7:00pm, Sunday 8/19 at 8:30pm, Jeff Lieberman will be in attendance.
JUST BEFORE DAWN - by Jeff Lieberman - 1981, 90 minutes, 35mm
Why do fancy, rich city folk love to traipse out into the wilderness and disturb REAL people? … Anyway, the machete-wielding hillbillies of backwoods Oregon have had their fill of sexually active young professionals, and JUST BEFORE DAWN chronicles their extremely efficient systematic nerdicide in juicy detail. The blood-crazed locals use every available method of homicide, turning nature itself against our hapless, helpless protagonists.

Maxcess’ Fife brand literally invented the web guide over 70 years ago. The MAGPOWR brand provides tension monitoring and control through load cells and magnetic particle clutch and brake technology. And, the Tidland brand provides equipment for slitting different types of web-based products as well as the specialty shafts that are used to support the different types of product rolls.
“In web control, we’re usually talking about rolls of product rotating at different speeds, feeding a web that needs to be guided and have its tension controlled with varying levels of precision and stability,” Walker says. “So there is a lot of physics and engineering mechanics as well as electrical engineering that goes into it. To properly select the products that a customer is going to use, you need to apply a lot of the things that you learn through the engineering disciplines.
In addition to the components that control tension and guide the webs, there are also special shafts that are used to support the product rolls. We recently dealt with one that is 24-feet long and 12 inches in diameter. These can be used to support the large paper rolls for a paper mill, which can weigh eight to 10,000 pounds. Other special shafts may need to be balanced to a G1 tolerance which is a very tight rotating balancing tolerance. The tight balancing tolerance is required due to the size of the rolls and the high speeds at which it can rotate, to prevent vibration and maintain stability in the control of the web. ”
Walker graduated with an electrical engineering degree with an emphasis in biomedical engineering. He had a job offer and planned on working for a major phone company but was intrigued by an offer from Parker Hannifin Corporation. The company recruited people to train in technical sales. He signed on out of curiosity.
“It really hit a chord with me to be able to use engineering skill and aptitude to provide solutions for real world products, but also be more in the sales world dealing with customers and exercising people skills,” he says. “So I ended up taking a job as a Sales Engineer with an industrial distributor in St. Paul, Minnesota.”
After five years with the distributor, he took a position as sales manager with Exlar Corporation, a Minnesota-based start-up marketing unique linear actuator technology. He worked there for 16 years becoming vice president and division manager prior to joining Maxcess.
New to the company, he feels a bit like he’s drinking from an informational fire hose, learning all of the company’s history and technology, as well as the web control industry in a condensed period of time. Maxcess is private equity-owned, and has purchased three companies within the web-handling industry and put them under one umbrella. As a result, Walker says the company has a sales channel with mixed experience levels and varying technological ability levels. As vice president of sales, it will be his job to solidify that and create a more unified sales effort for his team and the company.What is a mentee? A mentee is a student who volunteers to be assigned to a UAH minority student mentor. She/he will ask for guidance when academic questions or other challenges arise. What is a mentor? A mentor is someone who provides students with support, counsel, friendship, reinforcement and constructive example. Mentors are good listeners, people who care and want to help others. What does a mentor do? A mentor will set up a regular meeting schedule with their mentee(s). She/he will meet with their mentee on campus, by e-mail, or phone. Discussion topics range from academic success, career goals and strategies for other topics. The mentor will serve as a resource to assist a student with navigating the university system and introduce them to various campus services. The Research Latest research indicates mentorship: increases academic success increases student self-esteem increases job success increases positive social interactions by students Mentorship benefits for first year students Immediate connection with a UAH student and trained mentor who can offer a full picture of campus life and answer your questions. To ENHANCE the student college experience and give students an edge-- making college life easier, and resources more accessible. Interactions with faculty, staff, alumni and mentors who can provide insight about UAH. Friendly advice in a supportive environment. Informal one-on-one and group guidance. Fun activities, programs and events that touch on broad aspects of campus life. Meeting other first-year students who share your same academic and extra- curricular interests and making worthwhile connections to faculty and staff. Learning about campus and community resources and activities with your own personal campus guide. How Does The Mentoring Program Work? The Undergraduate Minority Mentoring program is designed to ENHANCE (not replace) the student collegeexperience and give students an edge--we hope the program helps make collegelife easier, and resources more accessible; it works alongside a students'normal college experience, with their schedules and interests that may bebeyond the scope of Mentoring. Representatives from the Office of Undergraduate Minority Mentoring will be available during each new student orientation program to introduce the program and answer questions. Peer Mentors contact Mentees over the summer, to confirm their participation and remind them about upcoming events. All participating Mentees are invited to meet their peer mentor, faculty, and staff mentor and the other first year students during our fall kickoff mixer. Mentors follow up with mentees after the kickoff mixer to arrange meetings throughout the semester. In addition to kickoff, mentees are invited to a series of monthly programs that are planned especially for them by our staff, which they learn about through emails, newsletters and reminders from their Mentors. Mentees choose when and how frequently they would like to meet during each month. Mentors are required to meet regularly (minimum 1-2 times a month) with mentees and provide feedback on a monthly basis. Mentoring groups communicate with each other in person or by phone, email or face book during thesemester. Mentees have the opportunity to shape their own mentoring experiences through dialogue and action planning initiated by mentors, and attending and participating in the many planned events by our staff on a voluntary basis.[Letter Libraries Special Collections

The Federal Savings Bank thinks a recent report from Corelogic reassured potential first-time home buyers who have been concerned about whether owning a piece of real estate is a valuable purchase. This report follows CoreLogic's home price data, which showed appreciation is occurring at a noticeable pace, and also confirms rising property values which The Federal Savings Bank shared on June 4th.
According to the real estate analysis firm, 312,000 properties regained equity in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the previous quarter. This increase in positive home values brought the total number of U.S. mortgaged homes with equity to more than 43 million. The number of properties with with negative equity dropped from 6.6 million homes in the fourth quarter of 2013 (13.4 percent of all mortgaged residential properties) to 6.3 million homes in the first quarter (12.7 percent of all mortgaged residential properties).
The total aggregate value of negative equity fell from approximately $400 billion in the last quarter of 2013 to $383.7 billion at the end of the first quarter. This was a $16.9 billion decline.
"Prices continue to rise across most of the country and significantly fewer borrowers are underwater today compared to last year," said Anand Nallathambi, CoreLogic CEO and president.
The Federal Savings Bank also adds that apart from prices, mortgage rates are at more affordable levels than a few months ago. The combination of higher prices and lower rates creates a very attractive housing market. First-time home buyers should apply for a home loan now to at least try and get approved for a mortgage to lock in a current competitive rate. The process is well worth the satisfaction of knowing how much one can afford, instead of finding a property first and hoping the lender approves the loan.
Contact the Federal Savings Bank, a veteran owned bank, to find out how you can get affordable financing for a new home purchase.iHerb 顾客评论

A team from Heifer visited successful dairy farms in the Philippines to better prepare them to design and implement a dairy project that will ensure success for at least 1,000 beneficiary families.
This is the first time Heifer Philippines will be implementing a dairy project, just knowing that 1,000 original families will benefit from this deepens our dedication to explore, learn and apply best practices from successful dairy practitioners, Heifer Philippines Country Director Herc Paradiang said.
On May 1, 2013, a team from Heifer visited Toreja Dairy Multiplier Farm in Ibaan, Batangas, owned by Arnel and Dr. Eileen Toreja. Starting in July 2012 with 78 cattle from the National Dairy Authority, the farm now has 126 cattle. The visiting team included Asia/South Pacific Program Officer Dilip Bhandari, Heifer Philippines Senior Program Manager for the Field Lyndell Tagle, and Regional Program Manager for Southern Philippines Jun Ayensa. They discussed the availability of animal stocks in the Philippines over the next 10 years with the farm owners.
Next, the team visited the Batangas Dairy Cooperative (BADACO), a large-scale dairy multiplier farm focusing on cattle. The team visited both the dairy farm and the processing plant, where 25 $25,000 state-of-the-art automated dairy machines were recently set up. Edwin Sanchez, general manager of BADACO, talked with the visitors about the cooperatives plans for further expansion.
The last stop was St. Elmos Farm, a dairy goat farm in Nasugbo, Batangas. Owner Elmer Rivera shared with the team the daily farm operation process. The 4.9-acre farm has an average production of about 265 pounds of goat milk per day. He said that dairy as an enterprise is very promising, since there are very few players in the market and the demand for milk is very high and has grown continuously over the years.
At the end of the visits, Jun Ayensa said, The study visit has shared new insights for us. Through the lessons learned we can further improve our project design and implementation. It really shortened the learning curve, having seen it firsthand how the entire dairy process works.

Consequently, when you launch the Console standalone, you do not have access to functionality typically available through the Management Server and Intelligent Agent,.
Regardless of how you started the Console, you will be presented with the Console login dialog.
When the dialog appears, choose "Launch standalone" and press OK.
To bypass the Console login, you can enter the following command at any supported operating system command line:
oemapp console oem.loginmode=standalone
By entering the command, you will immediately see the standalone Console..
After adding databases to the tree, see the Oracle Enterprise Manager Administrator's Guide for details on how to use the standalone Console to perform administration tasks.
The standalone Console includes several integrated applications. Some of these integrated applications require a standalone repository in which to save information; they include:
The first time one of the above standalone applications is accessed, you will be prompted to create a database user who will own the standalone repository schema or if you have already created the user to specify its username and password.
Because this database user must have certain roles and privileges, Oracle recommends creating a new database user to own the standalone repository schema. In addition, because certain tablespace attributes are required for the standalone repository, you should also create a new tablespace. Once the user and tablespace have been created, you can supply the user's username and password, and the standalone application will automatically create the standalone repository for you.
When subsequent standalone applications which require a standalone repository are accessed, they will all use the same standalone repository.
The following database releases are supported for the standalone repository:
You must ensure that the database in which the repository will be placed has object support. If it does not, repository creation will fail. Either choose another database that has object support, or install and enable object support on the chosen database.
Create a tablespace with the following attributes:
To create a tablespace for the standalone repository, first select the database in which you want to place the standalone repository, ensuring it meets the requirements outlined. Then, follow the procedure described in this section:
You can start the standalone Console from the Windows Start Menu.
You can start the standalone Console from the command line using the command:
oemapp console
When the login dialog appears, choose "Launch standalone" to connect directly to databases and press OK.
for 9.0, 8.1.7, and 8.1.6 databases, choose Locally Managed as the method of space management.
for an 8.0.6 database::
Once you have a tablespace and a repository user, launch a standalone application which requires a standalone repository.
When the dialog appears informing you that certain features of Enterprise Manager require a standalone repository and you must create a new database user to own the standalone repository schema, click OK to dismiss the dialog since you have already created the user.
Supply the user's username and password for the repository login and press OK. The standalone application will automatically create the standalone repository for you.Dr. Stephen Podolsky, MD

Adolescents engage in behaviors, including intentional sunbathing, that result in increased UV exposure and therefore increased risk for skin cancer. A survey of approximately 10 000 adolescents (aged 12-18 years) from all 50 states found that the prevalence of routine sunscreen use was 34.4% and that 83% of those surveyed reported at least 1 sunburn during the previous summer.1 The recent work of our research group2- 5 with adults has focused on a multidimensional model of appearance-based tanning motives, including appearance reasons to tan (eg, enhancing overall appearance or body shape, covering up acne), appearance reasons not to tan (eg, skin aging), and sociocultural influences to tan (ie, media, peer, and family influences). Appearance and sociocultural tanning influences are significantly related to sunbathing and sun protection intentions in samples of female college students, thus explaining variance beyond that attributable to skin type and perceived susceptibility to developing skin cancer.
The primary goal of the present investigation was to extend our group's previous work on appearance-based tanning motives as attitudinal predictors of sunbathing and sun protection intentions to include an examination of middle school– and high school–aged adolescents. In particular, we wanted to determine if the factor structure of our new measure (the Physical Appearance Reasons for Tanning Scale, or PARTS) would replicate in a younger sample, and we also wanted to determine whether appearance motives would be related to sunbathing and sun protection intentions after controlling for more extensively researched factors such as skin type and perceived susceptibility to skin cancer.
Data were collected via a school-based administration of self-reported surveys to 202 adolescent students (115 girls and 87 boys), mean (SD) age, 14.79 (1.82) years (range, 11-19 years). Most subjects self-identified as white (85.1%), but 2.5% self-identified as black/African American; 1.5% as Asian/Pacific Islander; 1.5% as American Indian/Alaska Native; and 9.4% as other. In addition, 11.6% self-identified as Hispanic/Latino. The study was approved by the University of South Florida institutional review board, and parental assent was obtained. Students voluntarily participated during a health education class.
Participants completed measures of perceived susceptibility to developing skin cancer (eg, “If you don't use sun protection, how susceptible do you feel you are to skin cancer?”), future sunbathing intentions, future sun protection intentions, and appearance-based reasons for tanning (PARTS). Our group's previous work with these measures2- 5 addressed the issues of validity (using confirmatory factor analysis) and reliability. For the susceptibility measure, test-retest reliability has been found to be 0.82.5 Sunbathing intentions had a test-retest reliability of 0.89,3 and sun protection intentions had a test-retest reliability of 0.87.5 The factor analysis of the PARTS yielded a replication of the 3 dimensions (appearance reasons for tanning, appearance reasons not to tan, and sociocultural influences to tan), after the deletion of only 6 of the original 50 items.
The percentage of participants who reported current sunbathing (9.5%) is in line with the 9.0% reported by Geller and colleagues.1 Hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine which variables of interest would explain unique variance associated with sunbathing intentions and intentions to sun protect. For both analyses, age, sex, skin type, and perceived susceptibility were entered in step 1, followed by the 3 appearance-based tanning motives (appearance reasons to tan, appearance reasons not to tan, and sociocultural influences) entered in step 2. The overall R2 for both analyses was significant and indicated that a high level of variance was accounted for by the predictors (sunbathing R2 = .50; sun protection R2 = .62). In both regressions, appearance subscales of the PARTS explained significant variance beyond that explained by age, sex, skin type, and perceived susceptibility (Table). Appearance reasons to tan were significantly associated with sunbathing intentions (P < .01) but not with sun protection intentions (P = .07): adolescents who positively endorsed appearance reasons to tan also reported more frequent intentions to sunbathe in the next 12 months and fewer intentions to sun protect. Appearance reasons not to tan were significantly associated with sunbathing intentions (P = .03) and with sun protection intentions (P < .01): participants scoring higher on appearance reasons not to tan also reported fewer intentions to sunbathe and higher intentions to sun protect.
This study suggests that adolescents' sunbathing intentions are enhanced by the belief that tanning will positively impact appearance and are tempered by the belief it will negatively affect appearance. In addition, sun protection intentions are elevated by the belief that sun exposure will negatively affect looks, and reduced by the belief that exposure will improve appearance. These findings replicate our earlier work with adults, demonstrating that appearance factors explain unique variance beyond variables that have received more extensive evaluation, such as perceived susceptibility and skin type.
Limitations of the study include the cross-sectional design and the use of self-report as the method of measuring sunbathing and sun protection levels. Additionally, it will be important in future work to compare appearance motives with other factors such as perceived severity of skin cancer and behavioral willingness to engage in risky behaviors. In our group's previous 6-month prospective investigation,5 we found that appearance motives predicted sunbathing behavior via the mediational role of intentions. Therefore, future work with adolescents might address the potentially important role of appearance motives and intentions to sunbathe or sun protect in the actual prediction of future sunbathing behavior. Overall, this study indicates the potential need for interventions to include strategies designed to challenge appearance motives for tanning.

I hope EJ's black-out will spread among the other in the team. Yes, BMac, especially, you. We can prove to opponents that KU is not just about Defense.

I would love to bet KU -15.5 in this one, but the only time in the last 2 years I bet on KU was against TCU the 1st time and that went horribly wrong. I've bet against KU in their last 3 big games against KSU, OSU and ISU. So far so good, not going to mess with it. I'll save my money to bet on Baylor in the finale and then bet against KU for all 6, not 5, games of the NCAA tourney!
dylans 2 years, 2 months ago
Sounds like you are hedging your bet.
Curtis Stutz 2 years, 2 months ago
I'm just hoping for KU to kill them either way. I think in the NCAAs last year I bet on the other team and they covered once or twice. I had to bet OSU M/L 'cause they were favored against KU in that one. If I could avoid losing so much money on teams like Drake that can't win on their home floor against the last place team in their conference I'd still have money to keep betting against KU. The way those other games are going I'm not sure.
Eric Lee 2 years, 2 months ago
I bet on KU last week but only first half. They ended up covering anyway but looks like it will be the same thing.

I hope by "attack mode" EJ means getting the ball to the rim instead of trying to shoot out of his slump from behind the arc.
mikehawk 2 years, 2 months ago
Amen to that. I have blogged previously his shooting slump began to abate when he started to go to the rim more frequently, rather than trying to shoot himself out of it.
Brianna Zaleski 2 years, 2 months ago
I think he was pretty clear about that in his quotes about constantly applying pressure. That would infer (to me), "touching paint" with his drives, making a defender, other than his own, commit to him and then passing to the open man. EJ has proven to be a pretty effective finisher around the rim, he just has to be equally as effective kicking out to open teammates to truly maximize his role as the PG. Tharpe is a good example of someone who is opposite. An effective passer, once he's by his man, however lacks the size to be reliable as an inside scoring threat, consistently. Tyshawn Taylor being the most recent example of a player who had both capabilities and was deadly w/ both.
FearlessJayhawk 2 years, 2 months ago
This is something I don't understand. When I played I was always a fairly consistent shooter. If you practice and you're comfortable there shouldn't be that much difference from game to game. My advice to all players is to get the cob-webs out of your head, just relax and go out and have fun. I don't think many players really have fun anymore. If you're not having fun, forget it. When I played there was no real money to be earned; besides, I wasn't real big. My brother and I played for hours and hours strictly for the enjoyment of the game. Also, we played only during basketball season. We played other sports as well. Today, kids have to play year-round which will burn you out over time. I believe there are lots of players today who are playing basketball simply because their parents have made them or encouraged them to play and they have lost the joy in the game. They are doing it strictly for the hope of making it big some day.
Jack Wilson 2 years, 2 months ago
Great post. "Also, we played only during basketball season. We played other sports as well. Today, kids have to play year-round which will burn you out over time."
Right. Now for kids it's that crazy chase for a scholarship, starting at age 12.
But the sport that ruined it all was soccer. Soccer was the first sport that pushed the all year thing, have to play in the spring (through June), have to play to play in the fall, indoor in the winter -- no respect for the other sports seasons. Soccer really ruined it.
I knew a number of kids that had to choose soccer only or not play. And that's how it's become now with all the sports. In football, you have mandated 7 on 7 an other workouts that conflicts with baseball season. There's spring/summer/fall AAU basketball. Very rarely do you find a three sport athlete. Baseball is a year round deal even in this part of the country .. tournaments through the first weekend in November, starting mid-March, with mandated workouts over the winter.
In every sport it's .. if you don't commit, you'll fall behind. You have to commit.
The exceptional, top athletes can do all three -- baseball, basketball, football (I don't count soccer as a sport, by the way -- soccer makes it nearly impossibe to even compete in a 2nd sport). The next level of athletes just can't do three sports anymore, and it's even hard to really commit to two sports at a high competition level.

I read Carlin's autobiography last summer--great book. His life had real hardships that he worked to overcome. I liked the courage that grew from him as he matured.
Jack Wilson 2 years, 2 months ago
I have been the anti-soccer since I was about 10 years old. Some quick soccer issues I have:
1] Red cards, yellow cards .. ref runs in and holds up a card.
2] Clock starts at zero and runs up.
3] Everyone says "nill" instead of zero, even Americans who never say "nill" in any other context.
4] Players fake injuries and get carried off on a stretcher.
5] Game can be stalled out with no offense required, and a tie is common place.
6] Playoffs are a two game series, "aggregate" goals.
7] Exhibitions are called "friendlies".
8] Extra time .. no one knows what it is until the ref blows his whistle.
9] Those stupid horns, urine bombs, riots, hooligans, etc.
10] Sponsors all over uniforms
But most of all, I hate soccer because it is every day of the year. It changes its game to fit the season. There's indoor, outdoor, different field sizes, different goal sizes, futsal, ugh. And if you don't like it, soccer weenies simply respond that you "don't understand it." It is a horribly boring game.
Jack Wilson 2 years, 2 months ago
Ok, but I just don't want to hear you say that EJ's turnovers were nill .. but on the other hand, I guess that would be fine.
Woody Cragg 2 years, 2 months ago
Years ago when our kids were small & played nothing but FB, BB, & BB, the subject of soccer came up in a conversation among friends. My buddy, who had quite a knck for low key, country boy type humor at just the precise time said, "Yeah, my kids don't give a krap about soccer, I think you need to have a name like Zack Zsciewanadict to like that friggin game!" Trust me, the full impact of this pround statement is all in the pronunciation. LOL
Steve Gantz 2 years, 2 months ago
I'll tell my freshman daughter who is a soccer player it doesn't count as a sport. Here in Louisiana it's a winter sport, and the season just ended. She pulled double duty this year playing varsity 75 of 80 minutes, and then 15 minutes later played all 60 minutes of the JV match. She was on the field for over 2 hours! I'd love to know how much running she did in those matches.
Jack Wilson 2 years, 2 months ago
I begrudgingly acknowledge it is a sport. Wish your daughter great success in the future .. I bet dad is proud. Enjoy it all.
Steve Gantz 2 years, 2 months ago
Well, I am just a bit. She earned a varsity letter the other day for the sport. Excited for the next three years!
jhox 2 years, 2 months ago
Everybody has off days shooting. The key is recognizing when you're a little off before wasting too many shots. If the first 3 or 4 don't fall, try something else. Get in the lane and dish to a teammate or, if the lane opens up, shoot a layup and try to get a rhythm going. Our point guards have had too many games where they just keep jacking 3's even when they aren't falling. Sometimes a little too much confidence can be a bad thing.

joshuamc914 2 years, 2 months ago
I don't care if Kansas brings its C plus game against WVU it will still be able to beat WVU they're terrible. At home this will be a 20 point blowout I'm confident. We should've beat them by 20 the first time but to many careless turnovers. We're at home this one is going to get ugly and McLemore will break from his slump and we might see an Andrew White sighting today early watch for it.
joshuamc914 2 years, 2 months ago
I want to see more Andrew White because I know in the tournament were going to need him. There is always a game where the refs call it tight an foul trouble mounts what if Releford and McLemore get slapped with 2? We need to season him to have him ready down the stretch. I feel like WVU and Tech are prefect opportunities to use him. We don't need Rui getting minutes because he is a turnover waiting to happen. White always shows me flashes, but then he presses because he is worried about hitting the bench. I know we will need him in the tournament of a couple of minutes just like Naadir last year against Purdue when Tyshawn had foul trouble last year. For the future I'm not worried he will be a starter next year he an flat out score he needs to defen better and like Self said he isn't a ball handler but with next years team he will start I'm confident, and next years team will be young but talented going to take till Jan or Feb got them to hit their stride.
FL_Jhawk 2 years, 2 months ago
We will see today if EJ has gotten it all together, for sure. I believe he will have great games the rest of the year now, even if he never again scores over 20. If he is hitting shots, opposing teams will have to decide to concentrate D on Withey, BMac or him. We will be very tough to defend in that case.
And if Tharpe gets his 3 back; if Young can make those bunnies; if Perry keeps hitting those jumpers; if Travis get more open looks; if if if ....... The true excitement of this team might just be beginning.
bradynsdad 2 years, 2 months ago
I really hope we sign Randle. I think Rio is going to be good but I wouldn't shock me if he transferred. He was tweeting stuff again last night that made it sound like he was tired of it at Kansas.
Jonathan Allison 2 years, 2 months ago
It's strange how one can be such an enthusiastic teammate when the lights are on and the camera is rolling. He's always the first off the bench at the 4 minute media timeouts to high-five and chest-bump his teammates, he's always the one yelling the loudest whenever one of the players makes a dunk or a three. He looks happy in the locker room, he looks like he's fits in on the team, like he knows his role both now and in the future.
Then he tweets. It makes me wonder whats really going on in his head. Could his tweets be just a young kid trying to stir the pot? Is it just a game to see what kind of controversy he can create? Is he truly unhappy here? Does he really want to transfer?
That Bill Self had to address it publicly a couple weeks ago, indicates that it's a serious issue, but his body language isn't that of a malcontent or even just a kid who isn't enjoying himself. He looks like he's having fun, and he's telling the public otherwise. It's backwards.
Boouk 2 years, 2 months ago
He's been tweeting stuff like that since December. With that attitude I hope he transfers.

EJ went in attack mode the last 11 minutes (6 regulation and 5 OT). Scored 27. Round to 25. Extrapolate to 40 minute game. 100 points per game.
If EJ stays in attack mode, forecast reads: 100 points vs. WVU. :-)
tis4tim 2 years, 2 months ago
Ha! I once scored 2 points in the first ten seconds of a game and was well on my, so I dreamed, to 480 overall, putting Wilt to shame. I think I ended up with 2 points. It would have been four, but I dribbled out at the end of the game instead of going in for the breakaway dunk.
PVJayhawk 2 years, 2 months ago
tis, you should have kept it up. 480 points would probably have set some kind of record!

Didn't coach say that if Rio repeated his social networking that he, (Rio), was out of here? Or from where I'm sitting there.
Does anyone have info on the "conversation" between coach and EJ that "lit" a fire under his butt? Is EJ"s butt still on fire? If your butt is on fire can you use it to ignite other player's butts? Is it bad luck to light more than one other butt if your butt is the one on fire. Has there been as mass inferno of butt lighting going on? I hope so.
I smell a hot victory today. May the Jayhawk's butts burn united to the NC! And the butt flame be passed on to each incoming Jayhawk to burn eternal. RCJH!!!!
chriz 2 years, 2 months ago
Does anyone know if we've figured out how to play perimeter defense yet? Aside from Elijah going crazy, that's the biggest mystery from the Iowa State game. We know they're a three-point shooting team. The only way they can beat us is from three-point range. So we let them hit 18 threes on us?! Makes no sense to me.

Jeff Kilgore 2 years, 2 months ago
chriz, our D is fine. ISU has scholarship players who've hit those shots all year. Maybe not to that extent, but sometimes in games, it's not about you, it's about them. Here's another way to look at it: suppose an ISU fan said, "How come we couldn't stop Johnson? He almost scored 40!" Athletes are good enough to beat your best efforts--some nights, repeatedly.

I never really gave much thought to ISU. But I'm really starting to dislike them. I hope OU kicks the ^%^& out of them today.

I attended the Prestonwood Christian Texas State Playoff Game last night. It was played in Mansfield, not in Plano.
The first person that I saw when I entered the building was Zach Peters. I told him that I was sorry to see his career at KU end the way that it did. He told me that he will be attending OU this fall. No, he will not play basketball.
I am totally convinced that Julius Randall will be attending Kansas.
Self and Roberts were at the game. They were talking to Michael Irvin and watching Randall. Randall was a man among boys. He was 6" taller than anyone else on the court and absolutely dominated. He scored 40 points, had 4 blocked shorts and grabbed 15 rebounds.
He is in absolutely terrible shape. Midway through the 1st quarter he was buckled over and sucking for air. I realize that he has only played four games since his return from the foot injury that he suffered at Thanksgiving. He is a throughbred that just needs conditioning.
All night he was playing for Self. He looked up in the stands all night long. I was glad to see that Bill Self was the only coach in attendance because it really shows the interest on his part. My gut instint is that the competition for Randall will come from Florida. Kentucky has to many players that want the ball. Randall will be a OAD but he would be fun to see at Kansas.

The yarn I used is Manos del Uruguay Cotton Stria and it so incredibly soft. The color is called Bark. I used a pattern called Lillie's Little Sweater by Cottage Creations. This is knit in size 24 months. It fits well plus there is room to grow and wear layers underneath.
Perfect timing for a new handknit sweater. The leaves are beginning to change and the weather just right. I am definitely feeling the fall knitting crazies even more so after this weekend. I actually had trouble falling asleep the night I came home from the festival thinking about all the things I want to knit.

Little M's sweater is beautiful, great job Nancy! Did that take you a long time to make? Little M looks adorable in pictures.
Thanks. It did take a while to knit. It's knit on size 7 needles and so far it's the biggest sweater I've made. Next year, I plan to make one for me.

Hinch, a former manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks, is departing to pursue other opportunities in baseball, effective immediately.
"I want to thank A.J. for his hard work and commitment to the Padres over the past four years," said Padres executive chairman Ron Fowler in a statement Tuesday. "He has represented the organization well, and we wish him nothing but the best in his future endeavors."
Hinch was working with assistant GM Fred Uhlman Jr. and senior vice president of baseball operations Omar Minaya to direct the club's baseball operations in the wake of the June firing of general manager Josh Byrnes.
"During my time in San Diego, I dedicated myself to do everything I could to help this team win, in the short-term and for the long-term," said Hinch. "These last several weeks were no exception. I think the organization is ready for a transition and I've made a decision and told Ron Fowler and (team president) joined the Padres in September 2010 as vice president of pro scouting and moved into his role as assistant GM a year later. He was the manager of the Diamondbacks from May 8, 2009 through July 1, 2010 when Byrnes was Arizona's GM. He and Byrnes were fired in Arizona on the same day.Bones is embracing the public's love of reality TV.

December 2, 2012
When my father was 13 his mother kidnapped him from a small town in Guatemala.
This bold act liberated my father from a cruel and abusive stepmother — but it also brought an end to his education. My grandmother took her son to Guatemala City, where soon he went to work sweeping floors at a pharmacy.
During the school-free years that followed, someone gave my father a book he grew to treasure. "I read it so much, I wore out the pages," he tells me. That book was a history of the Roman Empire.
My father is in his 70s now. Today I'm the one who gives him books. Books for his birthday, books for Father's Day. And of course, books for Christmas.
Books about history remain his favorites. This year I added a few more to his collection, including two weighty, recently published tomes that, when wrapped, make for nice packages under a Christmas tree.
The first was Robert Hughes' "Rome: A Cultural, Visual and Personal History" (Vintage, $18.95 paper). It's an odd and idiosyncratic book by the legendary art critic, who died this year. But my immigrant father devoured it.
"I loved the way he described what life was like for poor people in Rome in the year 150," he told me.
Two months ago I gave my father "The Second World War" (Little, Brown, $35) by one of our favorite authors, Antony Beevor. Beevor writes smart, accessible and dramatic war narratives — his books have never failed me as gifts. Years ago I bought my father his brilliant "Stalingrad," a gripping account of that epic World War II battle. Three generations of Tobars ended up reading that book after my father bought a copy for my then-12-year-old son.
"The Second World War" begins with the capture of a Korean soldier by Allied troops at Normandy. During the course of a most unlucky war, the poor man had been dragooned into three armies — the Japanese Imperial Army, the Soviet Red Army and finally the German Wehrmacht.
"Ordinary" people are the stars of Beevor's books. Their stories are woven with lucid descriptions of troop movements and portraits of vain generals like Britain's Bernard Montgomery and the American Mark Clark. We also see Joseph Stalin give a series of macabre banquets, and witness life in a firebombed German city. Of the book's many heroes my favorite is the Russian-Jewish journalist Vasily Grossman, whose intimate descriptions of the death and survival on the Eastern Front bring the insanity of war to life again and again.
Over the years I've bought my father a wide variety of histories: from "Manhunt," the fast-moving account of the hunt for Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth, to "King Leopold's Ghost," Adam Hochschild's essential history of the colonial rape of the Belgian Congo. But the favorite gift my father has ever received from me is a novel: "Don Quixote" (Harper Perennial, $16.99 paper) in the lively English translation by Edith Grossman (beloved among readers for her translations of Garcia Marquez and others).
My father loves quoting from it. "I've eaten his bread, I love him dearly, he's a grateful man, he gave me his donkeys, and more than anything, I'm faithful," Sancho Panza says, explaining why he never leaves Don Quixote, despite many misadventures.
I suppose I feel the same way about my father. Instead of donkeys, he gave me a love of books. I've stayed loyal and tried to repay the favor whenever I can.Spazio Ft. Lauderdale
Just got back from dinner at Spazio in Fort Lauderdale. My girlfriend recommended this place, having been there before. We ordered 2 GIANT frozen margarita's and 2 Brick oven Pizza's.
The Pizzas: AMAZING!!! Brick oven is clearly the way to go. Crust was thin and crispy, but not too hard. Cooked well done, I ordered the four cheese and added hot peppers. The pizza was so good, I went to the chef and thanked him. I'm going to enjoy the leftovers thoroughly tomorrow morning!THIBODAUX - From Thursday to Sunday, Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning and New York Giants signal-caller Eli Manning take a break from the professional grind to teach high school players the tricks of the trade.
The brothers, New Orleans natives and Super Bowl MVPs, venture to Nicholls State University, the site of the Manning Passing Academy, where this year 1,200 athletes participate in a weekend all about the fundamentals.
Campers are under the tutelage of Peyton, Eli, eldest brother Cooper and father Archie, quarterback of the New Orleans Saints from 1971-82.
And that's not all. Numerous college and professional players and coaches served as counselors, making sure the rudimentary knowledge of the game doesn't get lost for the young quarterbacks, receivers, running backs and tight ends with their eyes on bigger dreams.
Camp counselors included Tulane quarterback Nick Montana, Alabama's A.J. McCarron, Texas A&M's Johnny Manziel, Florida's Jeff Driskel, and nearly 40 other college players.
Peyton Manning said he tries to teach the kids about the importance of a strong work ethic, a lesson his father taught him early on.
"You're naturally in that leadership role playing quarterback," Peyton said. "You better be in there lifting weights with the linemen and running sprints with the receivers. Having that platform as a hard worker is important to be a leader at that position."
Nicholls State has hosted the passing academy for the past eight years of the camp's 18-year existence. Archie Manning praised the university and the Thibodaux community for their gracious hospitality for the event, which brings in an estimated $1.8 billion economic boom.
The summer weekend hosted by the "first family of football" got another boost Friday when Gov. Bobby Jindal announced a $1.2 million investment into improvement of the 25 fields the academy utilizes on the campus of Nicholls State.
The combined 20 acres of fields will gain new drainage systems and further ensure the safety of campers during their drills and playing time. Jindal said the project will take about eight weeks to complete and will enable the Manning Passing Academy to benefit Louisiana for the long term.
"By improving these fields, this allows the academy to continue to come here for many years to come," Jindal said. "We want a safer environment for the kids ... We are in south Louisiana so we get summer rains down here, so it'll be nice to have a working drainage system, but it also benefits the university and the students as well."
Jindal commended the Mannings for setting a good example for children not only through their accomplishments on the field, but also away from competition. Archie Manning said the field enhancements will make for an even better passing academy next year.
"We've enjoyed our experience in this area ... this big field back here is one of the things besides all the hospitality that attracted us here," the Manning patriarch said. "Kids from all over the country come to this camp; it's just not right to have them in the parking lots doing their passing drills ... we're grateful, and we look forward to being here for many years."
Peyton Manning said the passing academy has steadily grown each year, expanding to include campers and counselors from all across the country.
Eli Manning remembers his days as a camper at the academy, recalling that he was "hungry" to soak up skills from the mentors present. He said it's encouraging that so many high school players - approximately 1,200 this year - want to spend a few days learning from the Mannings.
"It's great to see there's a lot of kids out there who want to be better football players," Eli Manning said. "It's good working with them and seeing them progress as the week goes on ... hopefully that goes into their high school careers and they can have a great career."

Professor Emeritus, Gail Renardson
It is a HUGE privilege to announce that Ms. Gail Renardson has been conferred the rank of Professor Emeritus. This is the highest honor that can be achieved by a faculty member, and carries some benefits as well as prestige. In conferring this rank on Prof. Renardson, UAA Chancellor Tom Case wrote the following in the letter to Prof. Renardson:
“This high honor is in recognition of your distinguished career at the University of Alaska. You have served the university long, providing exemplary teaching, research and service. UAA regards you to be among its most valued assets. Accordingly, we invite you and encourage you to continue to contribute to your discipline and to the academy. . . . Warmest congratulations to you on your appointment to Professor Emerita.”
PWSCC is lucky to have found Prof. Renardson in 1980, and even more lucky to have held onto her. Her contributions to PWSCC have been wide and deep, from establishing a chapter of PTK and assisting in the founding of the Last Frontier Theatre Conference, to building a service learning component into her classes and encouraging students to serve their communities. Her contributions to students’ lives are immeasurable, and her collegiality has been noted by all.
Prof. Renardson will continue to serve PWSCC and its students, teaching part time. Fortunately, even though she’s retiring, we’re not losing her completely.
Thank you for your service, Gail – and congratulations!A couple of weeks ago I was hanging out at Yale in New Haven, CT with a couple of friends. We were walking down one of the main streets and about to go into an ice cream place when a man called out to us.
“Hey, can any of you help me out? Even change will do.”
I just averted my eyes and kept walking. I don’t remember if I had money or not on me, but either way I completely ignored him, saying a quick prayer to try to feel a little better about myself,
“Lord, be with him.”
Then we continued on. I have to give a lot of credit to one of my friends, afterwards he actually went up to the homeless man and asked him his name. Me? I just kept walking, an ice cream cone in hand and fully determined to have a good time with my friends.
I’ve been thinking and praying about this event ever since. What sort of human being am I? Deliberately choosing not to even acknowledge someone who cried out for help. And even more hypocritically, I prayed asking God to be with him. But as a member of the Body of Christ, I am one of His hands and feet! When I don’t show up for people in need, then people think that God doesn’t show up. God gave me that opportunity to reveal His love for that man.
On top of it all, I’m a freaking Catholic missionary! It would absolutely make my day if one day a student cried out asking for help with life’s problems or something and I got to help him or her. I pray for those opportunities every day, but often they don’t present themselves. Now, this time, I had someone who really was in trouble and I did nothing to help. Not even acknowledging them as a person. Am I really helping to bring peace on earth when I act like that, or am I just kindling even greater social tensions?
Jesus told us that we serve Him personally when we serve the poor and needy. This isn’t just a nice suggestion but a matter of eternal consequences.
“For for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.” – Matthew 25:40
I need to foster a greater respect for the dignity of the poor and needy in my own life, especially the homeless.
The good news is that I have had really great experiences as well, for example last winter in Chicago I ran into a man who shared my name, Chris! He was very nice and yes he asked me for some money but I actually talked with him. It turns out that he used to work at O’Hare and was laid off. He is a veteran of the military as well, he showed me his drivers license to prove it because he was so excited about it. I asked him where he stayed and he said that he stays at the shelter that the Franciscans provide in Chicago. That was super crazy and I got all excited when I heard that because one (maybe two soon) of my college friends is a sister with the Franciscans of the Eucharist that helps out the poor in the city. He mentioned Fr. Bob, the CFR priest who helps them out.
If only all of my experiences were like that! Either way, this video inspired me to post my own experience that I’ve been praying about over the past couple of weeks. It really goes to show how much we don’t notice the homeless and how much more love we could potentially give them, instead of ignoring them.In the news...

Blind Veterans UK, previously known as St Dunstan’s, provides rehabilitation, care and training at three centres across the UK, including at Ovingdean in Brighton, which is now marking its anniversary.
The exhibition will show archive photos highlighting the centre’s history, plus modern images taken by photographer Darren Baldwin.
It will be hosted in the chapel in the grounds of the centre and will give an insight into the historic building and the inspirational staff and beneficiaries that can be found within it.
Blind Veterans UK helps blind ex-servicemen and women.
The centre in Brighton was the charity’s first of three rehab bases and every year it provides thousands of vision-impaired veterans with training, holidays, respite, residential and nursing care.
It also helps with fitness and mobility.
Photographer Darren Baldwin, from Peacehaven, made his name in the street photography world with his emotive and provocative 2012 series documenting the people of London Road.
He was given unprecedented access to daily life in the Blind Veterans UK centre earlier this year.
He said: “I wanted to collect images that defy the cliched young, muscular bare-chested hero; instead allowing the viewer to recognise for them- selves the once pivotal role of these now frail individuals.
“My subjects’ lack of sight mirrors the way that society sometimes fails to see the elderly, or truly appreciate the influence their actions had on the world of relative peace we are so lucky to live in today.”
The exhibition is open for weekends in May between 10am and 4pm at St Dunstan’s Chapel in Greenways.

Smoke began pouring from a manhole at 210 Second St. N. just before 3 p.m., according to Xcel Energy officials.
The space beneath the Warehouse District manhole contained some electrical equipment, and there was damage to multiple cables, said Xcel spokeswoman Mary Sandok.
Sandok said power went out in one building and several others experienced "voltage issues," such dimming lights.
Additionally, smoke from the fire clouded the area and prompted the evacuation of five businesses. Second Street was temporarily blocked between Second and Third Avenues North, according to Assistant Fire Chief Cherie Penn.
The fire was out and the scene cleared by about 4 p.m., Penn said. Xcel crews planned to begin repairing the damaged cables Tuesday night.

Dozens of ships and aircraft have failed to find any sign of the missing Boeing 777 that vanished more than two days ago. (Na Son Nguyen/AP)
The sudden disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 somewhere over the South China Sea has been called an “unprecedented missing airline mystery" by Malaysian authorities. Right now, it's hard to disagree with that description.
With very few clues and a number of odd details, right now the fate of the 239 passengers and crew on board is unknown. Here's how things stand right now:
The facts:
- Flight MH370, a Boeing 777-200 ER, departed Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 00:41 MST, and was due to arrive in Beijing Capital International Airport six hours later.
- The plane’s transponder, which transmits its location and identification, suddenly went dark less than an hour after take-off while the plane was cruising at a steady 35,000 feet.
- The Malaysian military says their radar indicated that the plane may have been turning around before vanishing.
- No distress call was received, and no debris has been found. Two oil slicks found near where the plane vanished are said to be unrelated.
- Two passengers with stolen passports were on board the plane, bound for Beijing, Amsterdam and then on to other European cities. Malaysian authorities have said these two passengers were not of Asian appearance.
- Five passengers checked into the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, but did not board. Malaysian authorities said their baggage was unloaded before take-off.
- Officials say that the cockpit door on the flight would have been locked.
The theories:
- A sudden twin-engine failure: While generally considered a safe plane, the Boeing 777-200 ER has had some problems. For example, a British Airways 777-200 ER crashed just before landing at Heathrow in 2008 due to ice crystals in the fuel lines. Rolls Royce, the engine manufacturer, later said it had fixed the problem. In any case, even if both engines iced or caught fire, the plane should have been able to glide toward the sea, and the pilots should have had plenty of time to send a distress call.
- A weather-related incident: Although no bad weather had been reported, pockets of clear air turbulence are not uncommon over the Pacific. Air France Flight 447 vanished in 2009 on its way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris after hitting an area of turbulence in bad weather; although pilots took control of the plane from the auto-pilot, they apparently did not send a distress call. Nevertheless, a pocket of turbulence in clear weather strong enough to bring down an airliner would be unprecedented. Similarly, a Boeing 777 is designed to be able to withstand a lightning strike. In any case, the failure to find any debris is puzzling – normally, the ocean's surface would be littered with seats, doors and other detritus had the plane crashed into the sea.
- A catastrophic failure of the frame or wings of the airplane: Malaysia’s military said the plane might have started to turn around before vanishing from radar screens. Could the plane have encountered mechanical problems, lost height suddenly and started to try to return home? This could be a reason why search aircraft might not be looking in the right area for debris. But in such an event, pilots would normally have time to send a distress call. No such call was logged. Alternatively, the plane could have disintegrated in mid-air. This is very unlikely when a plane is cruising at a steady altitude, but it could explain the lack of a distress call. Even then, the absence of any debris in the area where it vanished is puzzling.
- Pilot suicide: Pilot suicide was cited as a possible cause behind the crash of a Silk Air flight from Jakarta to Singapore in 1997 that killed 104 people; it was also a possible reason for the crash of an Egypt Air flight from Los Angeles to Cairo in 1999, killing 218 people. But investigations into both crashes were inconclusive, and no evidence has emerged that this could have been behind the latest incident.
- A bomb:. A bomb could have caused sudden and fatal decompression, and such a sudden loss of altitude that the transponder’s signal was no longer visible to the nearest receiving station. But why would a terrorist group not issue a statement claiming that they had carried out the attack?
- A bungled hijack: The fact that two passengers apparently boarded the plane with stolen passports prompted speculation about a possible hijack. A bungled hijack could also have explained the plane’s apparent attempt to turn before vanishing: if the plane departed from its route before crashing, that might explain why the debris has been hard to locate. Hijackers could have turned off the plane’s transponder, although the plane should in theory still have been visible on primary radar. Again, though, the lack of a statement from a would-be hijack group is puzzling. And why would a Malaysian plane bound for China be a target for hijackers? And how did they get around the locked cockpit door?
What's especially disheartening about this case is that it's not entirely clear when, or even if, we'll find out more information that could lead to a fuller picture of what happened. It took almost three years for those investigating Air France Flight 447 to come to a conclusion, and that was only possible because, after two years of looking, they found the black box. With no sign of any debris yet, that stage hasn't even begun.
By weeks ago. On the way home, I decided to listen for myself because I love those children’s voices.
I hummed my way through Shallowater to the likes of “Away in a Manger” and “Angels We Have Heard on High.” I sang along to “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” and others on the road toward Littlefield. I whistled right through Sudan and five miles out to “Jingle Bells” and “Up on the Rooftop.” I tapped by hands in rhythm on the steering wheel to “The Little Drummer Boy” and other melodies all the way into Muleshoe.
Right outside Muleshoe, one song came on that I had not heard in a long time. And with this song I had a theological awakening of some sorts. Once again this came to me: God does not expect us to give what we do not have. But he does want us to give to Him what we do have.
How did a children’ song remind me again of this? The name of the song was “The Friendly Beasts” by Robert Davis. The setting is the manger scene in the inn with the baby Jesus and the animals. The animals are carrying on a conversation among themselves. Then they tell of his birth in a stable stall with all of them standing around, observing the most wonderful event. But what could they give him? It seems that a bunch of barnyard animals did not have anything to give.
That is when the donkey, who was described as shaggy and brown, spoke up. He said “I carried him up and down… I carried his mother Mary into Bethlehem town.” Then the white and red cow entered in. “I gave him my manger for his bed and I gave him my hay to pillow his head.” Next the sheep told of his gift: “I gave him my wool for his blanket warm and he wore my coat on Christmas morn.” Then the camel had a gift to offer. “I carried the Wise Men through the desert on my back and they brought him a gift in their pack.” So every animal in the stable had a part and every animal was thankful that they had the opportunity to offer something to the Christ child — something only they could give and something unique to them.
The “Friendly Beasts” song reminded me again that God only expects us to give what we have — give of ourselves and our unique abilities. The sheep wasn’t expected to carry the Christ child because he couldn’t. The camel couldn’t offer wool for warmth because he did not have a coat of wool.
It is so simple and yet so profound. God only wants us to give of ourselves and in doing that, he is pleased. My spirit was lifted that day. It is in simplicity that the Christ child was born and it is only when we accept God’s gift in all its simplicity — no ceremonies, no legalism, no stringent rules, no judgments, no proving oneself — that we really become his children. I know, because it happened to me.

Testing new content
We had a private Word Press installation on our web server for a long time. We used it to test new content and verify updated Word Press and plugins still worked. It was fine, especially since our theme update in June which made the process much simpler. But, the process of verifying visual aspects still required time intensive “upload, refresh, check” workflow. Additionally, many Word Press settings had to be manually re-edited in public site as part of porting content from test site. So we decided to install Word Press locally on our Mac in hope to fasten the process.
Installing Word Press on local computer isn’t that difficult, but requires installation of MySQL and creating database and user in Terminal. And sure enough, none of the steps was a smooth sailing. Each required Google sessions to get specific answers when things didn’t work as expected. Finally we had the website working, so it was time to transfer the content from the main one. This also wasn’t out-of-the-box experience, but what isn’t achievable by man with determination? So in few iterations, local site was working. There were still issues which remained unresolved: the main one was with images - they still had to be uploaded to main site in order to have them usable in all sites. So the solution was far from perfect…
Our workflow at this point was: write the blog post as Markdown document, convert to HTML, copy to MarsEdit, iterate through HTML (read: publish/refresh cycle) until everything worked as expected, publish to main site. All in all, not that much of a progress as we hoped it would be. As mentioned above, it was during this time that Matt Gemmell wrote about converting his blog to baked one.
Static HTML - baked web sites
As mentioned above, we were aware of baked websites. We even did few tests in the past, but the initial setup wasn’t any simpler than local Word Press installation. Many of the generator tools are Rails based. Now, Mac OS X includes Rails out of the box, but not all the dependent libraries, so setup ended with gazillion
gem install commands with each one depending on few more and… you get the point. Although the tools worked after that, installation was a pain and upgrading computer would require going again through the whole process (hopefully some of the required components wouldn’t be discontinued in the middle). Some tools installed smoothly, but they seemed a bit too simple for our needs. So we continued with Word Press.
Then in October, One Thing Well blog mentioned PieCrust static site generator. We checked the website and it seemed promising, so we gave the tool a try. PieCrust is PHP based, so it runs out-of-the-box on every Mac, no dependency libraries required (all third party code is already included) so test site was up in seconds! That was encouraging. Playing with the tool made our impression even stronger so we decided to go for it. PieCrust also works on top of Markdown (you can also use many other formatters), and as we already had our blog prepared from previous testing, we got it covered quickly.
Porting website to PieCrust
Of course, we wanted to keep using our theme, so that was next step. First attempt was to simply use HTML rendered by Word Press, but it wasn’t working very well, especially with JavaScript content such as main menu and sliders. But we remembered the theme (Highlight) was also sold as static HTML/CSS files, so we went looking for it on Theme Forest. However we were not able to find it in that format. We did find few others though and finally decided to go with Anthology, also from Pexeto. They provide solid support and the two themes shared general layout, so whatever we learned with customizing previous one, we could probably use with new one too. The “theme” sells for $15, which seemed reasonable (fully fledged Word Press themes sell for around $35 on theme forest) and even if we later decided this wasn’t it, we’d at least support Pexeto team… Decision made, so few minutes and -$15 later, we were ready to go :)
Adapting “static theme” proved much simpler than dealing with WP. It’s not point-and-click, and did require working with HTML, but was progressing much faster and individual parts could be implemented in context. For example sliding images at the top of the page: Pexeto Word Press theme includes nice administrator panel where you can click yourself through the process for each image. Then you need to go to the page and select the slider from the custom controls below the content area. While user friendly, it’s time consuming and you have to switch pages in WP dashboard to get things done. And to port to another Word Press installation, you’d have to manually repeat the whole setup… In static version, you simply write few
<ul><li> lines and you’re done! And there’s no additional work to port to another site, just upload the same file to different location!
We used exitwp to copy content from WP to Markdown. Site was quickly building up and in few days the blog part was ready. We got stuck with few PieCrust issues in the middle and contacted the author through GitHub issues. The response was quick each time, we even stepped in and updated the PHP code to move things our way even quicker. After blog was done, it was time to handle the pages. Initial HTML was copied over from WP and it generally worked out of the box (surely Anthology theme being similar to Highlight worked in our favor here too). With Twig, simple template system which is default template system used by PieCrust, we could easily create a hierarchy of template files that ultimately made actual pages creation much simpler and removed lot’s of repeating elements. For example, all appledoc pages share the same template, so the context menu only needed to be implemented in that template and it was automatically used in each page. And the appledoc template is just descendant of the main template, so overall formatting and the rest was taken from there. This resulted in simple, fast and DRY (don’t repeat yourself) approach.
Few more notes on PieCrust and new look
PieCrust runs at version 0.1.3 at the moment of this writing, but it sure feels very robust and solid! Using it locally is so simple: it includes web server called
chef, which is simple and effective; to check the site locally, just run
chef serve and the site is rendered in your web browser on the fly - it doesn’t require generating static HTML or anything like that. If you want to test updated content, all it takes is save the Markdown source file and refresh the browser. To actually generate static content for uploading to real server, run
chef bake and upload files wherever needed! Actually you don’t have to bake site to use it on your production server as PieCrust can also run in CMS mode. Overall we find PieCrust PHP code of high quality: understandable, well structured and easy to dive into.
We use PieCrust with it’s default settings: Markdown for pages and posts and Twig as template engine. But PieCrust ships with a bunch of formatters (Markdown, Textile, HAML, SmartyPants) and template engines (Twig, Mustache, Dwoo and Haml), so you can choose different one if desired. You can setup default formatter and template for the whole site, but it’s a per-page/post setting and you can as easily use different one just with a specific page or post. For example, many pages for this site are written in Markdown, but some are plain HTML as their intricate setup would be difficult to describe otherwise.
Anthology is visually simpler theme than Highlight, but we love clean lines and simplicity. We also prefer serif fonts, so with Georga as main font, it fits a bit better our taste. Pages tend to occupy more vertical space than highlight versions, partially due to taller header. See side-by-side comparison below.
Conclusion
Overall, the conversion process went smoothly, actually much smoother than changing Word Press theme. There were few hiccups, but these were minor and we thoroughly enjoyed the process. The net result of converting to static content is bringing site maintenance and updating work to minimum while giving us full power of customizing parts that require it. And we don’t even need test site on our server anymore: we can do it much more easily and faster locally.
There are still bits missing, for example blog archive, but these are minor and will be added with time. Was it worth it? We definitely think so. While Word Press is wonderful platform for quickly building a site without requiring any HTML or CSS knowledge, it can turn into customization obstacle for tech-savvy user. And static site has an additional bonus of being able to serve much larger traffic without hiccups. Although this site doesn’t need that yet, we should be ready for a smaller fireball :) And now back to Startupizer.

Hello, I'm Bulgarian (Bulgaria is an x-Communist country) and I can't see any hidden meaningful message here. Probably the handcuffs has something to do with it
Maybe someone from China could give us some hints.
Also - maybe just having fun is a protest enough in China lol
Zhongnanhai, rather than being a vacation spot, is the headquarters of the Communist Party and the State Council, which gives some added punch to the double entendre: 生活离不开中南海 - I can't live without Zhongnanhai.
As for popular vacation spots of CP officials, you may have been thinking of Beidaihe.
China's censorship gave this video legitimacy it would have otherwise never had, and is a fail on the government's part to appear to have any semblance of openness. Censorship generally exists in some form almost everywhere, certainly in Korea, Japan and the USA, we all know it's there, not just in China. But to ban such a weak (protest, if you will) is simply adding fuel to the fire. Credit to the artist to manage to get this banned, illustrating his point.

Thirty years ago, in gyms all over Colorado Springs, he rose to astounding dunks. The windmill rim-shaker against Doherty. The helicopter dunk against Harrison. The Statue of Liberty slam against Palmer.
These were brief air shows from three decades ago, but Mitchell High's Sherlock Holmes lingers in the minds of those who watched him play. He remains, forevermore, the most extravagant basketball showman ever to compete in Colorado Springs.
He departed 20 years ago on Thanksgiving Day. Holmes, who had thrilled so many, who had risen to such heights, died on the floor of a Las Vegas apartment a few hundred feet from Interstate 15. It was morning, and a confused, enraged Sherlock was banging his body on the door of his former girlfriend, Nicole White. Her new boyfriend, Marlon J. Cullors, called 911, begging for aid as Holmes kept pounding.
When Holmes burst through the door, Cullors shot him twice in the chest. Holmes, only 29, died quickly.
Today, as we remember the basketball star with the funky name and the tragic finale, it's time to return him to his proper place. Holmes lost his way and squandered his immense potential, and that offends many who watched him on his best nights. So much more was expected.
His basketball reputation has tumbled. He's often remembered as a mere dunker, a basketball circus act, but he was much more. He deserves to be remembered as one of the grandest high school players in our area's history, right up there with Lewis-Palmer's Josh Scott and Pat Garrity, Palmer's Reggie Jackson, Manitou Springs' Justin Armour and Air Academy's Rodney Zimmerman.
Yes, his real name was Sherlock Holmes. On Nov. 6, 1964, Raymond Holmes Sr. welcomed a large son at Memorial Hospital. Raymond had decided long before to name his baby boy after a rather famous fictional detective.
"I thought it would be a pretty unusual name," Raymond told me in 2010.
Sherlock, known to his friends as "Lock," soon became an extremely tall, extremely talented basketball player.
Tony Frankmore, who lives in the Northgate neighborhood on the edge of Colorado Springs, heard stories about Holmes. At the time, Frankmore was in the sixth grade, playing for Lincoln Elementary, and he kept hearing tales about this sixth-grader named Sherlock at Adams Elementary who stood a foot taller than anybody else and rose to near rim level.
He wondered if the stories could possibly be true. He wondered until he encountered Sherlock when Lincoln played Adams Elementary.
"Oh, we were all in awe," Frankmore said this week.
Holmes led Adams to a breezy victory, Frankmore said.
How breezy?
"They beat us, 70-10."
By the time Holmes was an eighth-grader at South Junior High, he was dunking, and we're not talking about barely dunking. He was rising high above the rim and slamming with his left hand. He seized rebounds with one immense hand. He terrified opponents. He became a 14-year-old basketball celebrity.
He ranks as the best junior high basketball player in Colorado state history. Yes, I realize this is a big claim in a state that produced first-round NBA picks Joe Barry Carroll, Micheal Ray Richardson and Chauncey Billups.
But no other player was so dominating so young. When Sherlock arrived at Mitchell, The Gazette named him the city's most acclaimed sophomore "ever" and later described Mitchell's team as "The Sherlock Holmes Traveling All-Star Circus and Air Show."
Street and Smith named Holmes one of the nation's top 30 high school players. He could shoot, soar, defend, pass and dribble. He was refreshingly tough and fundamentally sound for a player of his immense talents.
And he was surprisingly kind. He humiliated dozens of opponents during his years at Adams, South and Mitchell, but he was considerate about his utter dominance.
"You know, he had a boyish grin all the time and he seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the game," Frankmore said. "He didn't make fun of our team and laugh. He just thoroughly enjoyed what he was doing out there."
The fun stopped immediately after Holmes completed his rollicking, successful career at Mitchell. He had been recruited by Memphis and Georgetown, among other schools, but a learning disability limited him in the classroom and his grades prevented him from playing for a marquee college program.
He played briefly for two junior colleges in Texas, but missed the mountains and his friends and family. He never adjusted to college life and soon returned to the Springs. Once he seemed destined for the NBA, but his flight had ended.
The Sherlock Holmes Air Show was over.
He wandered for several years, enlisting in the Army, driving a food delivery truck, working in Las Vegas casinos. He fell in love with White, but this was a turbulent, sad love.
On the evening of Nov. 22, 1993, Holmes met with his best friend, Darren Dunlap, The young men, as close as brothers, talked for an hour in the fading sunlight at the corner of Zion and Tahoe, near Dunlap's home. Dunlap and Holmes played together at Adams Elementary and South Junior. Dunlap became a star at Palmer before earning a scholarship to Colorado.
Holmes told Dunlap he planned to return to Vegas to see if he could rekindle his relationship with White. Dunlap begged him to stay in the Springs, near his oldest and dearest friends. Dunlap sensed grave trouble awaited Holmes in Vegas.
Sherlock ignored his friend's advice, climbed into his gray Ford Escort and departed for Vegas. Dunlap next saw his friend in a casket at the Emmanuel Missionary Baptist Church in the Springs.
For years, Thanksgiving was a sad day for Dunlap. He mourned. He could barely endure the holiday.
Those days are gone.
"I try to have a good time for him instead of a bad time," Dunlap said late Monday night from his Springs home. "If he was here, he would want me to have a good time."
On this Thanksgiving, on the 20th anniversary of his death, it's time to place Sherlock Holmes back where he belongs, back where he's always belonged. Yes, the young man who flew so high, who thrilled so many, tumbled to earth.
But let's remember him, on this day, soaring above the rim once again, soaring high above those two gunshots, high above his early grave.
Flying free and forgiven.

Twitter: @davidramzIntroductionThe history of Texas is very complex. From first being part of the Hispanic empire, the state became Mexican in 1821. With colonization and war Texas joined the United states in 1848. The state has, in other words, long been a huge reservoir for streams of races and cultures. For the bands of prehistoric hunters, for the waves of Indian tribes, for the Spanish and Mexican pushing northward, for the Anglo-Americans from the North and East, and for colonizers who came directly to Texas from Europe, there was more than enough room for settlement (Source: Britannica).
It was the settlements that marked the period, and especially the Anglo-Americans played an important role in history of Texas. In 1830 there were 30,000 Anglo-Americans in Texas, about tentimes as many as Mexicans. The immigration continued as the total population in the USA increased rapidly. There were two movements of Anglo-American settlers in the nineteenth century. The first movement started in the early 1820`s with settlers from Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas and Missouri, from now on called Upper South. The second after the Texas revolution in 1836 mainly from the Gulf Coastal Plain states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Louisiana, Lower South. These movements are in many ways different, and they both have had a big influence on Texan history and the Texan population up till this day.
The issue for discussion: What difference had these two Anglo-American movements economic, political and cultural.Helen Loraine Hon Maenhoudt Silver, 66, Hamilton, died on Oct. 24, 2004, at the Cameron Regional Medical Center.

Cannes 2015: best red carpet jewels
There was no test or rehearsal, we just had to learn as we went on and create it perfectly in one go.
There were many technical challenges involved in making the Patek Philippe Calibre 89, starting with the fact that each one of the four pieces was like a prototype, a first of its kind. There was a huge amount of work, learning and discovering as we went along. There was no test or rehearsal, we just had to learn as we went on and create it perfectly in one go. One of the most difficult technical challenges was to handle the central axis of this very complex double-sided watch.
A further challenge was to manage the inertia moment in a movement with 1,728 components - including many heavy components. The watch took nine years to complete. This led to me being described at the time as the “slowest watchmaker in the world”.
The unique thing about the Calibre 89 – over and above the hugely complicated movement – was that it was entirely designed by hand on the drawing board and its components were then produced on the first computer-programmed machines. This was really a first in terms of development and production with a new level of teamwork between engineers and watchmakers.
Since then, our techniques have changed in that we no longer use a drawing board. Now, developments are made alongside a team of engineers and the computer-programmed production tool has improved to a very high level of precision, giving new technical possibilities in smaller volumes. But luckily the watchmaker’s talent and experience are still key to making technical marvels.
The Calibre 89 was the result of teamwork between development engineers, watchmakers and the unique experience of Max Berney, my predecessor as master watchmaker. Working together, using the experience, talent and knowledge of the whole team made it possible to create this unique watch. In fact to enable this teamwork, offices and workshops had been moved next to each other and without this team organisation the watch would not have been created.
To be a good watchmaker takes passion, which cannot be learnt. At Patek Philippe there is no specific time limit for learning the trade, just as we do not check the amount of time it takes to dismantle and assemble a watch movement. As we say in French: “Quand on aime, on ne compte pas” - when you love you do not count.Please display it by a browser for JavaScript.
On October 21, 2010, the Low Power Radio System Committee (Chief Examiner: Hiroyuki Morikawa, professor at The University of Tokyo) at the Information and Communications Council Technology Subcommittee commenced deliberation over “technical requirements for an 80GHz-band high speed wireless communication system.”
Furthermore, together with the commencement of this deliberation, there will now be an appeal for proposals concerning “technical requirements for an 80GHz-band high speed wireless communication system” that can contribute to the Low Power Radio System Committee's deliberation.
(1) Background to commencement of deliberation
Wireless communication systems using microwave and milli-wave currently in use have transmission speeds of around 100Mbps.
Since in many regions it is difficult to lay optical cables, which utilize anywhere from several hundred Mbps to 10Gbps, there are hopes for the implementation of a system that can construct suitable circuits in a relatively flexible and simple manner, as well as requests for a wireless communication system that can maintain a transmission speed of 1Gbps or faster, which is necessary for latency-free transmission of non-compressed high-definition images.
It is against this background that deliberation has commenced concerning the technical requirements for a high speed wireless communication system (see enclosed document for illustration of utilization) that uses the 80GHz-band, which has yet to advance in Japan.
(2) Subject of deliberation
Deliberation has commenced concerning “technical requirements for an 80GHz-band high speed wireless communication system” under “Technical requirements necessary for better performance of low power radio systems” (Telecommunications Council Inquiry No. 2009 – September 30, 2002), and a report will be issued in March 2011.
(1) Summary of appeal for proposals
Together with the commencement of this deliberation, an appeal will be held from October 22 to November 22 (Mon), 2010, for proposals concerning “technical requirements for an 80GHz-band high speed wireless communication system” that can contribute to the Low Power Radio System Committee's deliberation.

Female genital mutilation: US pediatricians withdraw outrageous proposal
THE American Academy of Pediatrics has reversed its recent proposal that doctors be given permission to perform a ceremonial pinprick or nick on a girl’s clitoris if it would keep their families from sending them overseas for a full circumcision.
The AAP said last month that it would like American doctors to be given permission to perform the ceremonial procedure on girls born into communities that practice female genital mutilation.
The proposal, made to placate immigrants from mainly Muslim cultures – African, Middle Eastern and Asian – ignited a storm of criticism from opponents of female genital mutilation.
Dr Judith S Palfrey, President of the Academy, said:
We’re saying don’t do it. Do everything that you can to support that family in this tough time, but don’t be pulled into the procedure.
Writing in the Daily Beast, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the former Dutch MP who vigorously campaigns to protect women from militant Islam, pointed out:
Ayaan Hirsi Ali
Female circumcision is a custom in many African and Asian countries whereby the genitals of a girl child are cut. There are roughly four procedures. First there is the ritual pinprick. This is what pediatrics refers to as the “nick” option. To give you an idea of what that means, visualize a preteen girl held down by adults. Her clitoris is tweaked so that the circumciser.
She added:
There is a more sinister meaning to the word ‘nick’.
Then there is the second method whereby a substantial part of the clitoris is removed and the opening of the vagina is sewn together (infibulation). The third variation adds to this the removal of the inner labia.
Finally, there is a procedure whereby as much of the clitoris as possible is removed along with the inner and outer labia. Then the inner walls of the vagina are scraped until they bleed and are then bound with pins or thorns. The tissue on either side grows together, forming a thick scar. Two small openings roughly equal to the diameter of a matchstick are left for urination and menstruation respectively.
Hirsi said:
To understand this problem, we need to begin with parental motives. The “nicking” option is regarded as a necessary cleansing ritual. The clitoris is considered to be an impure part of the girl-child and bleeding it is believed to make her pure and free of evil spirits.
But the majority of girls are subjected to FGM to ensure their virginityâ€”hence the sewing up of the opening of the vaginaâ€”and to curb their libido to guarantee sexual fidelity after marriage, hence the effective removal of the clitoris and scraping of the labia. Think of it as a genital burqa, designed to control female sexuality.
Hirsi is universally reviled by Muslim fundamentalists. What seems to to irk them most is the fact that she’s a stunningly attractive female who refuses to cover up her features with a burqa or niqab. So its not unusual to see her depicted on Islamic blogs with her face digitally distorted. The one on the right appeared on the Rupee News blog.
If men could impregnate themselves most of the religious whackos would probably kill girls at birth, considering how evil and useless they find us.
Of course, as a “New Atheist” I am an arrogant bigot for objecting to this kind of thing. I am just so shrill and strident. When Chris Hitchens stated that ‘religion poisons everything’ there were some even on the atheist side that objected to this remark. My reply to them is, OK, prove him wrong, name one single aspect of human existence that religion does not poison. If you name just one, you have refuted his statement. … …
You ARE only a rib after all.
It would be not so much a brave man as a reckless one who dared attempt to nick my clitoris.
This kind of religious insanity makes me feel all the more justified in declaring my atheism to anybody who will listen.
[…] (via) […]
What are the odds the shitheads at Rupee have tried in their wicked way to “Judaize” Ayaan? After all in their weltanschauung someone who has seen the light of Islam can only be corrupted by those demonic Jews…
Apparently only racists have a problem with Islam. I must be an oddity as I don’t believe in the concept of race yet I fucking despise Islam…
I’m not cut, but it makes me wonder why FGM is so much more cruel than MGM. Do these guys hate women that much, and why do those women comply? We really are the only animal on the face of Earth that ‘invents’ this kind of crap. And how much dick would there be left if men were slashed to the same extent that women are? I doubt men would enjoy the result.
Genital mutilation of children of either sex is obscene and should be condemned. What is this obsession with sex that all these abrahamic religions have? And why on earth would any man want to deprive a woman of her clitoris? Have they never made love to a woman that has one? It’s not only the woman that gets pleasure out of it (not if it’s done correctly anyway).
Graham, this is a culture where a woman’s pleasure is at best irrelevant, at worst a threat: the fear is that a woman who can feel normal sexual pleasure is more likely to indulge in affairs. Not a comforting idea for the hysterical, insecure excuses for men you so often find in the Muslim world (not that many western men are any better, might I add).
Graham – I think that it has to do with separation tactics. Firstly, the men of the abrahamatic cults seem positively paranoid of the “mailman syndrome” as we call it here. Any child born of their wife(s) that is not their own should be put to death, blah blah fucking blah. Secondly, as many of the pagan faiths regard sex as a very spiritual thing, and have since before judaism, they sought to differentiate themselves by mutilation and deprivation (not so much deprivation in the old testament, if the stories of David and Solomon are to be believed). This is what eventually led to the doctrine of celibacy for priests, even though Paul explicitly states a priest must be married with at least one child. I think they believe it helps give them an air of mystery, though obviously they forget we were all virgins at some time, and have apparently forgotten what it is to be a nerdy teenage boy with no hope of losing said virginity, at least until college, the sado-masochistic bastards.
@MrGronk:
While these people might not want women to feel pleasure I’m certain that if they were to experience the extra pleasure THEY get from a woman who IS able to get pleasure from sex they would not be in so much of a hurry to stop women from enjoying sex.
It makes me sick. Even to consider any proposal to interfere with children is obscene. ANy circumsision is wrong, we cannot decide for our children when they are too young to understand.
Beware if Sharia law comes to this country beware for we will have no choice in anything, and freredom of speech will be gone. This is 2010 not 010.
Now is the time to bring to the World the nonsense that is stories told by madmen on pot out of their minds writing drivel.
We are continually forced to confront the notion of Muslim ‘grievances,’ ‘resentments,’ and ‘humiliations’, as well as compelled to deal with the stone-faced fanatics who are the murderous envoys of such horrible hate-based energy. Here by contrast.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s New Book:
NOMAD: A Personal Journey Through the Clash of Civilizations
. Nomad is a moving account of her personal journey out of bondage,
I highly recommended this book
Beautiful, brainy and brave Ayaan Hirsi Ali. It was possibly on her website that I read that most Muslim men loose their virginity with their fellow men so that when they marry they continue to use the wrong entrance. Ayatollah Khomeini said it was OK for men to use goats. I don’t get the feeling that these guys would know how to make love, they are probably totally unaware that women have sexual feelings.
“NOMAD: A Personal Journey Through the Clash of Civilizations
. Nomad is a moving account of her personal journey out of bondage,”
I’ll certainly look forward to reading this!
Hitchens also wrote about the death of Theo Van Gogh around the time it happened. The note wrapped around the knife that killed Van Gogh was not addressed to ‘Ayan Hirsi Ali’, but ‘Ayan Hirshi Ali’. Hitchens reckoned this was to make her sound more Jewish, and after looking at what the scum have done to her picture, who would bet against it?
Fedupwith said:
” It was possibly on her website that I read that most Muslim men loose their virginity with their fellow men so that when they marry they continue to use the wrong entrance.”
Being your first offense, I am reluctant to call you harwood II, but, on making that kind of unsubstantiated accusation, you might require some sort of documentation.
You also said, ” Ayatollah Khomeini said it was OK for men to use goats.”
Bad boy. You get a negative three harwoods.

Actually the two pictures explain the stupidity of the clit-cutting.
The 1st is the normal innocent girl, the 2nd is the silicone injection into the nose to make ‘her clean and pure’ and is a good thing to do.
Now compare the two pictures and even women imprisoned into that evil religion could be convinced that blowing their nose up to fill their face is a good thing.
The clit is in the ‘hidden’ part of the body and is not talked about, so the girl is ignorant of it and will sort of go along with their mom and sisters.
Talking and blogging about it will expose it to the light of reason and make the problem as plain as the nose on your face.
Sorry but…
Now compare the two pictures and even women imprisoned into that evil religion could be convinced that blowing their nose up to fill their face is a good thing.

Now compare the two pictures and even women imprisoned into that evil religion could NOT be convinced that blowing their nose up to fill their face is a good thing.
Jesus Christ, LLong,
That shit was photoshopped. It’s a pixel smear to hide your identity, and atheists use it too on their avatars. I might download the function to hide the ridiculously enormous size of my penis in my Playgirl photoshoots.

For those with none or little knowledge of Islam
The Prophet Muhammad (May peace and blessings be upon Him)forbade this horrific act
So please do not confuse this act that some narrow minded cruel people carry out with Islam
Please learn and study true Islam not from the acts of so called Muslims today but from authentic sources such as the Holy Quran
Read it in English for yourselves get real Muslims who are taught to explain things to you
Then for sure like so many people who have converted to Islam will see what the true beauty of Islam isAll are welcome to join the fun.

When Someone Asks If You’re Pregnant … And You’re Not
Yesterday, I was checking out at the vet when the receptionist smiled. “I shouldn’t ask this,” she said, looking at what I thought was my wallet. “Is that a baby bump?”
“No,” I said.
Where is my dog? Bring back my dog. It’s time to get out of here.
The dog came back. I played it cool, smiled at the receptionist even. The dog wagged her tail as we walked to the car.
And then I cried for thirty minutes in stop-and-go traffic, on my way to pick up my daughter.
Apparently I’m fat, I thought. And then my thoughts got very, very ugly. I used to have an eating disorder — anorexia nearly killed me. Since yesterday afternoon I have encountered the ugliest body-image thoughts I’ve had in more than a decade.
On this blog I have written extensively about my experience with pregnancy after an eating disorder and related concerns. Less than a month ago I served as a keynote speaker and did a workshop on pregnancy and postpartum concerns at an eating disorder recovery event hosted by the Center for Eating Disorders at Sheppard Pratt. I spoke honestly, as a person in recovery who has been doing damn well for a long time.
It is because of this, in part, that I want to be honest. Recovery is not always easy, and things can come up and bite you in the ass out of nowhere. Living in recovery means confronting those inconveniences at inconvenient times.
What happened yesterday hurts me so much.
I cried another round telling my husband later last night. I was ashamed to tell him, for fear he would see me differently.
Shame is the dominant emotion I feel, which raises a flag. Shame is what is causing me to write about this incident openly and honestly now. I have long felt that unmasking shame is at the heart of the feminist project, that when we talk about shame it loses its power to keep us down.
It is shame telling me my body is not acceptable, when I know perfectly well that my body is healthy and a gift and powers this amazing life that is mine. It is shame telling me to feel bad personally, when in reality we should all feel bad about a culture that deems it acceptable to comment on women’s bodies and make pregnancy (actual or presumed) a spectator sport. It is shame telling me that you will look at me differently after reading this post, staring at my stomach and judging me, when in reality if that is true I should grab my dog and get away from you as quickly as I can.
A good piece of what has made me cry so hard is being forced to have the ghosts of my eating disorder engage in open combat with my political beliefs of today. I know better, and I also want better; being forced to contend with a reality I very much don’t like — being the weight my body wants to be, getting assessed and confronted by others on the basis of how I look, considering the civil rights implications of presumed pregnancies — is unpleasant.
Another piece revolves around my daughter. She watches everything I do, even when I think she’s not, and mimics my behaviors to hilarious precision. If I hate my body, I am teaching her to hate her own. If I let an idiot comment stop me from moving forward, I am teaching her to do the same thing.
I refuse to do that. Not just for her. For me. And frankly, for all of us.1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates generally to a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), and specifically to a method and an apparatus for controlling charging and/or discharging of a HEV battery.
2. Discussion of the Prior Art motor called a generator. The generator, in turn, provides electricity to a battery and another motor, called a traction motor. In the SHEV, the traction motor is the sole source of wheel torque. There is no mechanical connection between the engine and the drive wheels. A parallel hybrid electrical vehicle (PHEV) configuration has an engine (most typically an ICE) and an electric motor that work together in varying degrees to provide the necessary wheel torque to drive the vehicle. Additionally, in the PHEV configuration, the motor can be used as a generator to charge the battery from the power produced by the ICE..
The desirability of combining an ICE with electric motors is clear. There is great potential for reducing vehicle fuel consumption and emissions with no appreciable loss of vehicle performance or drive-ability. The HEV allows the use of smaller engines, regenerative braking, electric boost, and even operating the vehicle with the engine shutdown. Nevertheless, new ways must be developed to optimize the HEV's potential benefits.
One such area of HEV development is in the area of methods and systems for controlling the charging and/or discharging of the HEV battery used to store electricity. As explained above, one advantage of the HEV is the ability to limit ICE usage by operating for periods of time using partially or primarily electric power. Quite obviously, if the ICE is to be substantially or totally shutdown, there must be some mechanism for storing electricity to permit the vehicle to operate under electric power during such periods. A rechargeable battery is a conventional mechanism for charge storage that has attained widespread use.
Typically, the HEV battery is constructed from cells or modules that are coupled together to provide the desired voltage. For example, the common 9-volt household battery is in fact a combination of six 1.5-volt cells or modules coupled together in series. HEV batteries are constructed in a similar manner, and may include upwards of 200 modules.
While HEV batteries may be rechargeable so as to extend their operational life, such rechargeable batteries do not have an unlimited life. Moreover, the life of the rechargeable HEV battery may be foreshortened if proper care is not taken in its use and maintenance.
For example, variations may arise between the performance characteristics of the cells or modules in the HEV battery as a consequence of manufacturing or material tolerances, or flaws that may develop with the passage of time. Such variations can cause the effected module to accept less charge, to store less charge, and to provide less charge. Such variations may also lead to the failure of the module if the module's diminished capacity is exceeded. Consequently, it is known in the art to monitor the charge of the modules and to balance the charge on the modules automatically to prevent overcharging. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,969,624 and 4,313,080.
Maintaining proper charge balance, while helpful to prolong battery life, is not a complete answer to all of the problems, which may cause performance degradation. For example, rechargeable batteries are susceptible to a phenomenon commonly referred to as memory effect. Memory effect occurs when a module or cell is discharged and recharged only partially (shallowly) over several cycles. Eventually, the module will not accept the same charge it did initially.
While memory effect may be detected by the on-board electronics responsible for charge balancing, the onus is commonly put on the user to perform the deep discharge necessary to limit or reverse the memory effect on the effected module. The user may have to connect a separate discharge device to the affected module, or couple a separate on-board discharging circuit to the affected module. However, user intervention may be intentionally or unintentionally delayed such that remedial measures come too late to optimally limit the memory effect.
Moreover, there are other disadvantageous events that may affect battery performance and life that conventionally are not even detected.
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a battery control method and apparatus for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) that detects battery life and/or performance degrading events and takes appropriate remedial measures without requiring user intervention.
A further object of the present invention is to provide an HEV battery control method and apparatus that detects battery life and/or performance degrading events and takes appropriate remedial measures while limiting the effects of such remedial measures on vehicle performance.
An additional object of the present invention is to provide specific strategies for controlling charging and/or discharging of an HEV battery in response to battery life and/or performance degrading events while limiting effects on vehicle performance, thereby rendering the battery control method and apparatus transparent to the user. an embodiment of the present invention of a method for controlling charging and/or discharging of an HEV battery in response to battery life and/or performance degrading events.
FIG. 3 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention of a method for charging a battery to limit battery deactivation.
FIG. 4 illustrates an embodiment of the present invention of a method for discharging a battery to limit memory effect.
The present invention relates to electric vehicles and, more particularly, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). FIG. 1 demonstrates just one possible configuration, specifically a parallel/series hybrid electric vehicle (powersplit) configuration using an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)..
A vehicle system controller (VSC) 46 controls many components in this HEV configuration by connecting to each component's controller. An engine control unit (ECU) 48 connects to the engine 24 via a hardwire interface. The ECU 48 and VSC 46 can be based in the same unit, but are actually separate controllers. 56. The TMU 52 controls the generator motor 30 and traction motor 38 via a hardwire interface.
FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of a method, implemented by the BCU 50, for controlling charging and/or discharging of an HEV battery, such as the battery 36, in response to battery life and/or performance degrading events, or battery maintenance conditions. According the method illustrated in FIG. 2, the BCU 50 monitors for four battery life and/or performance degrading events.
First, the BCU 50 determines if the battery 36 needs to be charged to reverse deactivation. Deactivation is caused by prolonged duration of idle time at low state of charge (SOC). Deactivation results in reduced ability to accept charge.
Second, the BCU 50 determines if the battery 36 needs to be refreshed to reverse memory effect. Memory effect is caused by repeated shallow discharging and recharging, or cycling, of the battery 36. Memory effect causes a loss of storage capacity.
Third, the BCU 50 determines if the battery 36 needs rebalancing. The typical HEV battery, like the battery 36, is constructed from cells or modules that are coupled together to provide the desired voltage. A typical HEV battery may have as many as 240 modules. The modules of the battery 36 will have different performance characteristics based on manufacturing differences, module age and module temperature, for example. If a module that has diminished charge capacity is overcharged, this can lead to module failure.
Fourth, the BCU 50 determines if the battery 36 needs state of charge reset. A module can be so deeply discharged that the battery reverses. This reversal can adversely affects battery performance, and can cause long-term damage to the module and the circuitry coupled thereto.
While the BCU 50 monitors the battery 36 for these four battery maintenance conditions in implementing the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in FIG. 2, the present invention is not so limited. The BCU 50 implementing an embodiment of the present invention may monitor the battery 36 for other battery life and/or performance degrading events other than those listed above.
Having determined that one of these four conditions exists, the BCU 50 communicates with the VSC 46 via the CAN 54 to determine if the necessary remedial activity can be conducted immediately, or if the activity needs to be delayed to avoid interference with vehicle operations. For example, to refresh the battery 36 to remove memory effect, it may be desirable to deeply discharge and then charge the affected module. It may also be the case that the vehicle is operating in a state or mode where the battery is already in a state of discharge, or the capacity is not available to charge the module. Alternatively, it may be the case that the BCU 50, to determine the state of the battery 36, needs to perform a diagnostic discharge or charge of the module of the battery 36, which diagnostic discharge or charge may affect vehicle performance. Consequently, the BCU 50 preferably first determines if the diagnostic or remedial action would compromise the vehicle's performance by communicating with the VSC 46 and determining a vehicle condition.
In response to the vehicle condition detected by the BCU 50, the BCU 50 performs the actions without the necessity of user interaction according to a schedule that will avoid interference with vehicle operations, delaying the actions if needs be. Moreover, the BCU 50 preferably performs the steps of determining if one of the four conditions exists, determining if the vehicle operational characteristics permits the appropriate diagnostic or remedial actions to be carried out, and taking the appropriate diagnostic and/or remedial actions without requiring the user to provide direction or instruction. In this fashion, battery maintenance becomes a transparent vehicle activity relative to the user, and the user does not have to be concerned about keeping track of scheduled maintenance deadlines.
Turning to the method illustrated in FIG. 2 in greater detail, it will be recognized that the diagram represents the states of the BCU 50 during implementation of the method according an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, the BCU 50 has a standby state 60. The BCU 50 operates in the standby state 60 when the user has not indicated his or her desire to initiate vehicle operation (i.e., the vehicle is non-operational). Typically, the user indicates his or her desire to initiate vehicle operation by activating an input device coupled to the VSC 46, such as by flipping a switch or by placing a key into a cylinder and turning the key in a first direction (simulating the actions typically taken when initiating operation of a vehicle powered by an ICE), also referred to as “key-on”. The key-on activity is represented by the arrow 62, leading from the standby state 60 to a normal operational state 64. Conversely, the user can indicate his or her desire to terminate operation of the vehicle by performing a second action, for example turning the key in a second direction. This activity (also referred to as “key-off”) is represented by the arrow 66 leading from the normal operational state 64 back to the standby state 60.
As shown in FIG. 2, the BCU 50 may monitor the battery 36 even during the standby state 60. That is, even when the vehicle is non-operational, the BCU 50 may monitor the battery 36 for conditions that are detrimental to battery life and/or performance. Specifically, in a preferred embodiment of the method according to the present invention shown, even during the standby state 60, the BCU 50 may monitor the battery 36 for deactivation requiring remedial charging. Alternatively, this activity could take place at key-on, or during the normal operational state 64.
The BCU 50 may detect that the battery 36 should be charged to reverse deactivation (as represented by the arrow 68), for example, by detecting that the state of charge of the modules is lower than a threshold amount or, preferably, by detecting that the vehicle has remained non-operational for a predetermined time period. In response, the BCU 50 enters a remedial charge state 70 wherein the BCU 50 may initiate operation of the engine 24 or, if the vehicle has been connected to a separate source of electricity, may enable charging of the battery 36 from such separate source. Alternatively, the BCU 50 may delay the remedial charging of the battery 36 until such time as the key-on activity 62 is performed. After remedially charging the battery 36, the BCU 50 returns, as represented by an arrow 72, to the standby state 60.
As indicated in greater detail in FIG. 3, during the remedial charge state 70, the BCU 50 preferably communicates with the VSC 46 via the CAN 54 to ensure that the remedial charge of the battery 36 will not adversely impact vehicle operation. In particular, as illustrated in FIG. 3, at a block 74, the BCU 50 determines that a trigger event, such as the vehicle being non-operational for a predetermined number of hours, has occurred. The BCU 50 sends “request start” message to the VSC 46 at a block 76 requesting initiation of the remedial charge necessary to counter deactivation. The VSC 46 receives the “request start” message at a block 78, and determines at a block 80 if the BCU 50 may begin the remedial charge, or if the operation state of the vehicle requires the initiation of the remedial charge to be delayed. For example, if the vehicle is designed to perform the remedial charge only when coupled to a separate source of electricity, the VSC 46 may check to see if the vehicle is so coupled and delay the initiation of the remedial charge until such coupling is made. If the VSC 46 determines that the BCU 50 may initiate the remedial charge, the VSC 46 sends a “report start” message at a block 82, which message the BCU 50 receives at a block 84.
The BCU 50 then performs a remedial charge at a block 86. Concurrently, the VSC 46 controls the vehicle operation at a block 88 to provide the charge necessary to permit the BCU 50 to perform the remedial charge at the block 86.
When the remedial charge is complete, the BCU 50 sends a “request end” message to the VSC 46 at a block 90. The VSC 46 receives the “request end” message from the BCU 50 at a block 92, and replies with a “report end” message at a block 94 that the BCU 50 receives at a block 96. The BCU 50 then rests the trigger at a block 98 and returns to standby state 60 at a block 99, while the VSC 46 returns to its standby state at a block 100.
Returning to FIG. 2, it will be recognized that several battery life and/or performance degrading events are monitored during the normal operational state 64. For example, when the BCU 50 determines or detects that the battery 36 should be refreshed to remove memory effect, as represented by the arrow 102, the BCU 50 passes to a remedial strategy state 104 from the normal operational state 64. When the remedial strategy is completed, the BCU 50 returns, as represented by an arrow 106, to the normal operational state 64.
The remedial vehicle strategy state 104 is shown in greater detail in FIG. 4. Specifically, it will be recognized that the BCU 50 determines at a block 108 that a trigger event has occurred such that refreshing of the battery 36 or of a module of the battery 36 is desirable. For example, the trigger event may preferably be that the module or battery 36 has discharged a predetermined number of Ampere-hours. For example, a module or battery refresh may be scheduled for a discharge period of every 420 Ah. Alternatively, the BCU 50 may use frequency pulses to determine a change in resistance of the cathode, which change may be compared to a threshold level to determine whether the trigger event has occurred. When the trigger event occurs, the BCU 50 sends a “request start” message to the VSC 46 at a block 110, and the VSC 46 receives the message at a block 112.
The VSC 46 may not immediately return authorization to the BCU 50 to begin the remedial activity. Instead, the VSC 46 determines at a block 114 whether the operational state of the vehicle will permit the desired remedial action to occur. For example, because the remedial strategy employed by the BCU 50 will involve a deep discharge of the module or battery 36 followed by a complete recharge, the VSC 46 may delay the implementation of the strategy until such time as the operational state of the vehicle permits discharging and recharging. When the VSC 46 determines that the remedial strategy may be implemented, the VSC 46 sends a “report start” message at a block 116, which the BCU 50 receives at a block 118.
The BCU 50 then implements the remedial strategy at a block 120. As indicated above, in the case where the BCU 50 determines that a condition has occurred where refresh would be appropriate, the BCU 50 performs a deep discharge of the module or battery 36, followed by a charging of the module or battery 36. Concurrently, the VSC 46 operates the vehicle to permit the BCU 50 to deeply discharge and recharge the module or battery 36 at a block 122.
After the remedial strategy has been implemented, the BCU 50 and the VSC 46 exchange “request end” and “report end” messages at blocks 124, 126, 128, 130. Upon transmittal of the “report end” message at the block 128, the VSC 46 returns to normal operational state at a block 132. Upon receipt of the “report end” message at the block 130, the BCU 50 resets the trigger (or counter) at a block 134 and returns to the normal operational state 64 at a block 136.
During normal operational mode 64, the modules of the battery 34 may also need to be rebalanced or have their state of charge (SOC) reset. Returning to the FIG. 2, it will be recognized that preferably the BCU 50 determines whether these activities need be performed according to a combined or unified strategy. Alternatively, the BCU 50 may separately determine if the modules of the battery 36 need rebalancing or if a module needs its charge reset.
Again, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the combined or unified rebalance/reset strategy utilizes a two level or tier approach. As a first level of inquiry, a determination is made whether the SOC of a module, as represented by a module voltage under normal operating conditions, is within a predetermined range. If the SOC thus determined is within the predetermined range, the BCU 50 remains in the normal operational state 64. If, however, the SOC is below a lower limit or threshold of the predetermined range (as represented by an arrow 140) or above an upper limit or threshold of the predetermined range (as represented by an arrow 142), then the BCU 50 makes a further inquiry.
Taking first the condition wherein the SOC is lower than the predetermined lower threshold, the BCU 50 passes to a state 144 wherein the BCU 50 communicates with the VSC 46 for authorization to begin a constant current discharge under which conditions the BCU 50 can make a more refined determination of the SOC of the module. The VSC 46 may authorize the constant current discharge, as represented by an arrow 146, or prevent the constant current discharge, as represented by an arrow 148. If the VSC 46 prevents the constant current discharge, the BCU 50 returns to state 64.
If the VSC 46 authorizes a constant current discharge, the BCU 50 passes to a state 150 wherein a constant current discharge is performed and a SOC determined for the module at issue. The BCU 50 then passes, as represented by an arrow 152, to a state 154 wherein the SOC of the module is compared to a predetermined SOC and a difference, or Δ (“delta”) value, is calculated. If the Δ value for the module exceeds a predetermined threshold Δ (Δ th or “deltath”) value, then the BCU 50 passes, as represented by an arrow 156, to a rebalancing state 158. Alternatively, if A value of the module is less than the Δ th value, then the BCU 50 passes, as represented by an arrow 160, to the normal operational state 64.
In the rebalancing state 158, the BCU 50 communicates with the VSC 46 to determine if the rebalancing activity can be performed, or if the activity needs to be delayed to avoid interference with desired vehicle operations. With appropriate authorization from the VSC 46, the BCU preferably uses a current shuttle method to charge the module. That is, the module at a lower SOC is charged while the modules at a higher SOC are not charged, or bypassed. When the rebalancing is completed, the BCU passes, as represented by an arrow 162, to the normal operational state 64.
Returning to a situation wherein the SOC based on voltage under normal conditions indicates a possible high SOC condition, the BCU 50 passes, as represented by an arrow 142, from the normal operational mode 64 to a state 164. In the state 164, the BCU 50 performs a constant current charge of the module and the SOC of the module is measured. The BCU 50 then passes, as represented by an arrow 166 to the state 154 discussed above, from which the BCU 50 passes directly back to the normal operational state 64 or via the rebalancing state 158 to the normal operation state 64. If a Δ value greater than the Δ th value is detected, then a controlled discharge is performed in the rebalancing state 158 in accordance with authorization received from the VSC 46 to decrease the SOC of the module.
As noted above, the BCU 50 implementing the method according to an embodiment of the present invention controls the charging and discharging of the battery 36, and more particularly the modules of the battery 36, to address battery life and/or performance degrading events. Moreover, the BCU 50 operating according to the embodiment of the present invention controls the charging and discharging of the battery 36 without user intervention and in accordance with the vehicle operational state, such that the control is transparent to the user.
While the BCU 50 implementing the method according to an embodiment of the present invention has been discussed as incorporated into an HEV with an ICE, the BCU 50 may be modified using ordinary skill so as to be incorporated into an HEV using a fuel cell. Consequently, the BCU 50 implementing the method according to the present invention is not limited to a particular type of HEV.
In summary, the above-described embodiment(s) of the invention is/are provided purely for purposes of example. Many other variations, modifications, and applications of the invention may be made.1. The Return of Original Sin
Every day she must search her conscience. Every day she must confront her flaws—discern the dark that dwells within her, seek the grace to turn toward the light. Oh, she is a moral person, she believes: good willed and determined to do good deeds, instructing us all about the heart’s deep iniquity. But even she, Kim Radersma, a former schoolteacher now preaching our bondage to sin—even she still feels the fault inside her. Even she must struggle to be saved. And if someone like Kim Radersma has to fight the legacy of inner evil, think of all that you must do. Think how far you are from grace, when you do not even yet know that you are lost and blind.
In another age, Radersma might have been a revivalist out on the sawdust circuit, playing the old forthright hymns on a wheezy harmonium as the tent begins to fill. In a different time, she might have been a temperance lecturer, inveighing in her passion-raw voice against the evils of the Demon Rum. In days gone by, she might have been a missionary to heathen China, or an author of Bible Society tracts, or the Scripture-quoting scourge of civic indifference—railing to the city-council members that they are like the Laodiceans in Revelation 3:16, neither hot nor cold, and God will spew them from his mouth..
So profound is the sin, in fact, that not even its proponents escape. The more they are aware of white privilege, the more they see it everywhere, even in themselves. “There is not space here to list all the ways in which white privilege plays out, but it is clear that I will carry this privilege with me until the day white supremacy is erased,” admitted University of Texas professor Robert Jensen in an essay assigned to Wisconsin high-school students in 2013. At the Daily Beast website, columnist Sally Kohn added that “racial bias is baked” into American history. “It’s just something we all learn to do.” She did note the nearly universal condemnation that met explicitly racist comments from the likes of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and California billionaire Donald Sterling this year. But all that, she insisted, actually distracts from awareness of the real racism that dwells in every white American heart.

I'm sure this letter will be criticised, but it's one letter more than the 'management' at ITP have managed to cobble together.
I'll bet my bottom dirham he didnt write it
Clearly you do not know what directors do? They don’t sit around writing letters all day! They employ morons like you to do it. PRAT!
I would also bet my bottom dollar, but ITP haven't paid my final salary yet the fuckos.
Panic ensued. Management have been having problem paying basic stuff like salaries and bills to suppliers. 200 people sacked at AMG today. And 100 more next week. Many good brains are gone. New young Emiraty bosses seen in their offices with big smiles on their face, thinking they can actually run a company without expats. People seen crying across hallways and some fainted while being told the news.
from the finances of that company, the whole operation might shut down in a month or two. The problem is they don't know what they don't know.
Sirfreelancealot...
Anyone who writes PRAT! in caps with an exclamation mark has to be in the running for cunt of the year.
Business 24-7 going to be put out of its misery and shut down next week. Good track record for AMG ... it failed in both incarnations, first as Emirates Today, then Business 24-7.
it's no longer Abdullatif Al Sayegh speaking. this is a new guy brought in from Tecom. is it over for Abdullatif and his empire?
I heard that Ben Whyte and Zahra were both finished as well from Dubai 92.
That is a shame Ben along with Nathalie was the only presenter left who had anything good to offer the station certainly the strongest member in the team and Zahra was building a good following with a unique style and finding her way in the radio world.
Sarah I luuuuuurve the sound of my own voice K will continue to do drive alone, Steve Pulley what are u playing at man, well I guess it will push more listeners to Virgin.
I wish them both the best of luck as a former colleague.
Won’t take long to figure out who I am, so I’ll leave my initial too and hide.
CF
P.S. I have nothing to lose anymore in radio in this city I already lost my job
Thank you so much for helping us know that the paper will be shut down too.
Now since you still have a job, go to Irish Village and have another drink when we pack to leave.
and till you are next on the list someday though your paper or magazine was so much more brilliant and the last frontier in journalism and could not do without you so far.
But you would not know that till it happens to you - so good luck till then.
It is disgusting how some of you are having fun running down other organisations during such a grim time while others have to face loan payments, kids and life.
and those sitting in UK or elsewhere commenting on the Dubai Media scene, pls clean up your house first.
Before commenting on how we soaked up the sun all these years.
(funny PR press release on Zawya. "Consolidation will have a limited effect on staffing". 300 people out of 1900 is limited? or do they mean "limited" minded people have been laid off?)
Dubai, February 26, 2009: In response to the current global economic downturn and its impact on the media industry in the region, Arab Media Group has moved to implement a restructuring programme across its businesses, aimed at increasing the organisation's operational efficiency through the consolidation of some of its support services.
Sad to see AMG go out of business & I really feel sorry AMG staff.
like they has shut down one of its radio stations, Pulse 95.3 FM,hindi station and laid off its staff.
Now you see the official line is indeed true, it is a problem of revenue per impact of there frequency:)
SO Abdullatif Al Sayegh’s journey ends??? who hired on AMG very poorly served and corrupt staff n advisors and didn’t stop the loyal talented staff on leaving.
12:36 - do you write for Arabian Business?
they fired the wrong people. I hear Vikas Jain is still around and picked up the staff layoffs himself. He moved from Abdullatif minion to Al Mulla minion. Him and Abdullatif built this monster into what it is. Mr. V's resume has his hands on the deals that sank the ship (the $30M Viacom deal, link.net internet fiasco)
they fired hard working people. while a lot of the crooks and inept management are still around.
oh well. this company story just keeps getting worse.
This is very true but what does the letter actually say, not much by the looks of it and I'm sure the majority of their staff will be left wondering if they have a job or not. This letter shouldn't have been sent out as it’s extremely unclear what they are planning on doing and does more harm than good.
in the letter they say they're making it "quality over quantity". i wonder if that means emiraties (high quality) stay and expats (low quality) leave. very arrogant. welcome to dubai.
Malcolm....er, Malcolm? MALCOLM????!!!!
not sure AMG ever knew what quality was?
Good point re the Jwin press release. Malcolm the account director who has been boasting about how great Jwin are has been humiliated. Jwin have been shown to be the pathetic poodles they are. Malcolm - I know of six journalists who have rang Tarek today and he has refused to answer. It was true all along - Jwin are crap. If you have dignity you should resign, given the pompous postings you made on DMO.
I've been following a few of the entries on this blog and the comments on the entries.
I thank DMO for laboring to maintain a blog where people can share opinions even anonymously.
I think it's good to pull back and view recent developments in UAE media in context.
The UAE as a country is maybe 40 years old?
In Europe where the printing press was invented by Gutenberg in the 1400s, you still get stuff like the controversial Prophet cartoons that one would think a mature media market would be a lot more intelligent about.
Before year 2000, how many publications, TV stations, radio stations, etc. were in the UAE? The explosion in the number of titles, channels, etc. is what employed and maybe still employ many of those who comment on this blog.
What is happening at City7, AMG, Jiwin, ITP, etc. are all part of an industry development lifecycle of consolidation which tend to follow a period of rapid growth.
This idea of industry correction is not new either. Check out creative destruction from the writings of Nietzsche and Schumpeter.
This period of painful change is necessary to bring about the next phase of growth.
The UAE and all its industries are trying to find its place in the global economy. I am impressed by what it has achieved in just 3-4 decades.
What is happening now has many similarities to sport. Those who can't play the game just jeer and complain. Those who can play shut up and work for the win.
Malcolm dear, shouldn't it be Jiwin Public Relations (note the 's' at the end)?
This is a very sad time and horrible to see ex-colleagues and friends from a couple of radio stations lose their jobs this week. I wish them all well and hope they get sorted as soon as. As regards AMG, there are people who seem to be untouchable and it would appear that the hard workers who actually care are the ones who are sacked first. You wonder... if you have talent and intelligence and a work ethic then obviously you are not the right type to work there. Cue the 'yes' men and the idiots and see how it falls further. A great, great shame for something that had so much potential.
I left AMG on my own terms, as soon as I could do so without the company fucking me over. Best career move I ever made. The worst, of course, was ever coming to work for them in the first place. An utterly grim and unpleasant company with zero understanding or respect for editorial independence, pathetic management and a truly incomprehensible belief that everything it did was brilliant. Good fucking riddance if it goes - but my heart goes out to the poor bastards who stayed and are now about to be hung out to dry.
Can anyone tally up the number of people who have been made redundant?
ITP admitted 60 last week - but there have been people sacked before and after.
AMG - 300
Motivate?
ENG?
Media Factory?
Gulf News?
And have people been made redundant, with three months salary as per I think UAE labour law, or just told to go?
It's so funny. People who have worked in established media markets have dealt with layoffs for decades. It's sort of a tradition in media.
Finally, Dubai has to tighten the belt a bit, and the Chicken Littles come from out of the woodwork to tell us when and where the sky will fall.
This is how it works, people. Survival of the fittest, and all that. If your product doesn't make money, or if it could make more money in a different way, why would an employer keep you around? Because they feel sorry for you? Hah. Welcome to the 20th century. Perhaps in a few years you'll join the rest of the world in this era, and hear that there is a recession going on. Redundancies happen. It sucks. But life will go on.
I would imagine people like ITP will be looking for ANY excuse to sack people right now.
The best solution for people is to get out NOW. If the landlord won't give you the rent back take stuff from the flat.
If you're planning your exit from a company take as much stuff as you can with you that can't be tied to you.
As for anon @ 0039's pathetic comments regarding sports - you are clearly either an utter cunt or a manager at ITP. Not much difference, I know.
sir freelancealot is probably Sir freelancealittle really.
Radio 2 needs the biggest shake up.Starting with Steve Johnston,this has to be the worst broadcasting in Dubai, if anyone loves the sound of their own voice he is your man its painful to listen to him stumble over his words,of which there are too many.If there needs to be job cuts get rid of the shit first.
AMG is a pack of cards just waiting to collapse. Very poor over-paid staff, awful management, terrible products - Emirates Business still insists the UAE is not suffering from the world recession and all is well in Dubai - its demise will be welcomed.
A propoganda machine that has failed spectacularly.
I love Emirates Business. Its 'fiddling whilst Rome burns' editorial policy, laugh out loud interviews with senior 'Gulf businessmen' and Hans Christian Andersen headlines never fail to raise a smile en route to the office.
Sorry but I'm new to this blog - who is Andy Petch, what does he do at ENG and is he really such a cunt? I thought they all worked at ITP.
As a former Middle East media guy, now in Australia, it's sad to hear about AMG. They had some good guys over there. Aren't we all good guys anyway?
28 feb 13:58 - 3 months salary according to the UAE labour law?? 30 days notice according to most. You're even lucky if you get that plus flights and gratuities owed. The law does not protect expats. In fact, recent articles have quoted the gov warning expats not to take their previous employers to court unneccesarily or face fines or even jail! In a time of recession, Dubai is not the place to live. Time for a country with employee rights.
We need to rework out the alphabets. D is for Depression in Dubai, not Dream on Dubai. Get real guys, it's time for a clarion call to look at the ground reality.
Truth hurts when it's closer home & Dubai has been a dream home for a while. It always hurts hardest when the dream starts to turn into a nightmare.
And what do the benevolent men in power do these days? Media blackouts, gagging orders on expats, threats, where will this end? As the old saying by the Phantom, "The bigger they are, the harder they fall"
i came in from the western world last year. these dubai companies are very ugly and corrupt from the inside.
top executives fraudulant, proof frequently presented to CXOs and no action done. Very obvious transactions: embezzlement of company money to private accounts, good old theft, conflicts of interest, partner companies on the side... you name it.
enough shit that, in the west, would have put the whole executive team in jail in a week.
but here they call it "taking care of business"
What? No sniping about the Ahlan Hot 100 this year? Everyone too depressed and/or worried about the security of their jobs?
anon @16.45
we haven't seen a copy of the Ahlan Top 100, and it hasn't been uploaded on to the website. Fear not, if there is anyone left at ITP to upload it, we will resume normal service shortly after.
Damn you lot are lazy...
Hi Annonymous who has come in from the Western world.
Perhaps you did not hear of Madoff.
Or do you think that is the name of a Californian wine?
haha, the party to end all parties. i wonder how many wages that cost?was a good party to be honest, but with the business division staff being cut the previous day - and with it being common knowledge that the weekly staff were to be chopped the day after the party - i'd suggest everyone was drinking and being merry on ITP's tab rather than having a genuinely great time.
Anonymous comment that we had to edit very slightly:
-------------------------
I am a former AMG person and I know the problem there is that Abdullatif did not properly understand where revenues were going to come from - especially with TV.
Here, there are only FMCGs, govt, cars and telcos advertising on TV. So MTV was never, ever going to work as a stand-alone business.
The radio held it all together (at 250Dhs per spot virtually any UAE business could advertise and reach a huge audience stuck in traffic).
Al Bayan was a great turnaround job because it had heritage and just needed pruning (they had 7 librarians). But the free ET and B24/7 were just not going to cut it while GN had all the property guys tied into exclusive deals with strict penalties for using other print media.
Actually, Abdullatif had given too much power to people who talked big but never had a vision and couldn't deliver on their promises. Gavin Dickinson being the main culprit....ET was pretty much his idea.
[name removed] whatsizzface proved to be just an ambitious wheeler dealer lining his own pockets rather than benefitting the business (with short term deals that really hurt the equity of the brands we were trying to build).
The big issue was internal - horrendously toxic politics. Everyone hated and distrusted eachother. The Arabic sales guys hated the English journos who hated the Arabic journos who hated the Indian back office staff who hated etc etc etc.
It was totally irreparable. I left in a hurry and feel sad that it went that way...it could have worked out well if they were not quite so ambitious and in a hurry. But, Abdullatif did give me a go, which I appreciated. He built something that became uncontrollable and impossible to turn profitable.
wow! 23:06 is fairly accurate. he has missed out some key factors though. without naming names, GD was failed by the senior editor he hired. a strong editor - facing the ill-knowledged and ergo ballsy crew of 7Days - would know that you would have to report real news to prosper. the editor (yes, i worked under him) cut our stories to get an easy life, i felt. i was there from day 1. he hired me. good wages, good job opp and i don't regret a thing in terms of day-to-day work and wage packet, but i did look to him to battle for my scoops and he didn't. we had a talented team, but he was what some would describe as weak. we looked for inspiration and were downtrodden upon. he left, and made out that he left because he was put upon. i know, from attending the senior editor meetings, that when it came to an argument he keeled over. that was a real shame. he did well in putting us together, but at the end of the day he failed all of us in journalistic terms, as staff and as a business model - when it came to unleashing us and letting us beat our rivals. in my job interview, he told me we would be taking on the rest (KT, GT, 7D) on the strength of our content. when it came to confrontation, he didn't support us. A real shame and it has changed, in my opinion, the course of UAE newspaper history to date.
I wouldn't lay the blame on GD. He's a nice guy. But he's a commercial guy. Of course he always demanding fluff from us. but if we'd been allowed to run certain stories (did you hear the one about the rogue gunman in Sharjah, for example?!?!) then I am convinced we would have become the most-read, most talked about, most profitable newspaper in UAE history. and we/they wouldn't be about to fold now - 7D would!
To: 02 March, 2009 20:44
yes i have heard of Madoff. let me explain to you the difference between west corporate environment and middle east - having lived through both.
In the West 10% of the people are corrupt (the top wealthy 10%). In the middle east 90% of the people are corrupt.
anon @ 20.42 - to the twat that suggested we were lazy, when I posted it wasn't online, it wasn't. And yes, we checked that link as well.
So in the West 10% of the people are corrupt and in the Middle East 90% of the people are corrupt?
Little wonder journalism in the UAE is where it is today. Enough said.
Head of AMG talking about the new media law to AP today - and he wonders why his papers are shit and fail...
""It's not to stop bad news," said Abdullatif al-Sayegh, who heads the Arab Media Group, a Dubai-based media conglomerate. It is to prevent journalists "digging for bad news," he said.
Oh Hullo Mr 10 percent corrupt.
Do you know that the havoc that Madoff and Lehman Bros and Freddie Mac and all the rest of the 10 percent corrupt in the West finished off the rest of the 90 percent innocent lives.
Here it is the other way around - only 10 percent got affected.
lol.
and why did you come here? Not for the sunshine I bet.
Let us face it. When Dubai was good, everyone lived life to the fullest, watched movies and did barbecues and partied like there was no tomorrow.
Now when we are hit like everyone else, people talk of corporate governance and bubble burst.
But hey, read Wall Street Journal or plain Yahoo news to get a real insight into what is happening in the Wild West too.
get balanced guys
we came here we made money we blew it
and now we face the nemesis that we wrote about - others lives have become ours
This time next year, will this blog even be here? hahahahahaa. Cunts.
i'm a Western ex-pat lvg shortly, after having been here for a couple years on a contract.
i never had any illusions about what was going on here. i bought as little as I needed to, banked the rest and led a quiet life.
i've met some quality people here and it breaks my heart to abandon them to whoever will follow me.
i think the inevitable result of the corruption, greed, predjudice and unfair treatment of workers in the wake of what has happened here will result in legendary cautionary tales that will make future ex-pat recruitment very, very difficult. And without ex-pats, Dubai media just doesn't exist in any meaningful way.
I'd concur with the poster who advised getting out now. Even if you are stll employed, you need to have a go bag and be ready to be out of town within 48 hours. Don't believe Dubai has hit bottom. I'd predict the media sector to be half the size it is today within six months.
Houseguests and fish... and we're all just teaboys to the guys who really run the show here. They'll be remarkably generous with their own-- with us...not so much.
Good luck.
Can we please start a blog on the new 'programmes' been offered up by City 7 TV? Has anyone seen the new Hydra Executives? Embarassing to say the least. And that Societe show? We have to get a few copies on You Tube so the rest of the world can also have a laugh!
Learn Mandarin and HTML
Play the game. You can debate the failure of the Dubai media scene, or ride the wave to the next big market. Stick or twist. Move on. I got out two years ago. Game on!
Whats it with the journo working for National running over a security guard (in today's Gulf News) ?
This is more like it!
Come on, 'fess up which one of you absolute darlings was it?
Can we have a new thread please?
Ras Al Khaimah: An American journalist working for an English daily from Abu Dhabi has run over an Egyptian security guard at the entrance of a university here because the guard denied him access to the campus
there seem to be lots of allegations of corruption but very little proof. When shaikh Mohammed turned dubai into a media mecca and introduced freedom of expression i thought he did away with corruption.
Or am i being naive.
Corruption is long gone in Dubai, my friend. Like prostituion, dodgy filipino accents that I can't understand for the life of me even after 6 years! and free housing for the locals. Long gone.
05 March, 2009 10:53
you're being extremely naive. it's all about corruption here
23:57, you missed one factor at AMG, since GD has left. Currently the big boss is VJ, who although an indian he has become the best friend of the locals. Unfortunately he has allowed a culture of mafia executives to prosper inside the company. He protects them, nourishes them, and eliminates their enemies. His strength also comes from Tecom who owns AMG where the director of strategy there is also indian. All hail to the king VJ..
AMG was only concerned about showing people that Local Emiraties were able to run a media company. So they put unexperienced people in very experience needing positions, and try to promote brands such as MTV to locals and families and forgot that MTV viewers (EVEN ARABS!) dont wanna see people wearing THOBES on a music channel!
And the channel was called MTV Arabia, not MTV Saudi!
I give it 4 months, and they shut it down.
good overview of media redundancies here
Arab Media Group started off as a radio company and initially it was making huge losses.As an old timer I remember a very sharp guy who was the finance manager who was part of the turn around of ARN.When Dubai Radio was taken over the same guy was part of the strategies and he also was in Al Bayan which turned around in a short time.I used to see him work very hard and smartly .These are the only companies which are making profit now because of the systems set earlier.Seems he had differences with VJ and he left .They have very poor senior managers and lots of inexperience in the company which has resulted in this big mess.The good ones always leave and the company is left with only the useless guys who stick around .
i wonder who that finance manager was. Vikas Jain has been the big thorn in this company. He has little experience or acumen. And he makes up for it by acting like the Godfather and engraining and encouraging a culture of politics in the company. the word is he is so connected to Indian executives in Tecom and DubaiHolding that even the top Emiraties at AMG can not shake him. Lucky for AMG to have him, than other companies in the world. At least we know AMG is going nowhere. Better than breaking other companies.
I think sms/contest winners from radio are not chosen by computer,it is chosen by RJS.Because most of the time winners are western.
93.5fm- alot of buzz about another frequency lost by arn.
AMG..With a CEO like AbdullaTit , The only way is the gutter. Never has there been a better manifestation of 'The Blind Leading The Blind'.What a cocky , ignorant fool. After he believed his own lie about dominating the 'radio and press market' I love how he ventured into television with ZERO knowledge, experience or staff. They rearranged the existing ass kissers or anyone with breasts to run a whole television network. I mean to have Maryam El Falasi run ATN..!!! You must be having a laugh! Paris Hilton running the BBC, anyone?
Then there's MTV and Nickelodeon's 'maverick' channel managers : Samer,A 24 year old who doesnt know his ass from his elbow and Leila, the airhead who cant even read a time code.
Destined to fail from day one, VIACOM conned them into a multi million dollar deal that they have been trying to wrangle themselves out of
desperately to no avail. VIACOM doesnt give a toss what they do with it, which is nothing.They have secured the money. The thing is, AMG obliged to keep the channels running at a absolute minimum. ie. turd for tv. No one watches the channels, virtually no marketing for the channels either (bar a few sad attempts at having some poor sods dress up as Dora the Explorer in Wafi ) and they think they are gonna take over the Middle East! I always thought it would go tits up by this summer...Im usually right but..hey, Im sure AbdullaTit's coming up with some diabolical plan to turn the fortunes of the channels like asking all MTV managers to rap only in meetings so they can 'immerse' themselves in the channel ..He's said wierder things, believe me. They should leave AMG to Spongebob and Dora. At least they make the surreal amusing., my experience:
Everyone I asked loved their Jetta and claimed no problems. I bought a '96 for my wife. The car is a great value, BUT, I did have some problems:
The car has a great engine for this price class. Fairly peppy and really smooth and I have had no problems with the engine at all.
I took the car in for three warranty repairs! It had the climate control fan burn out (and shoot smoke!), a window motor fail, and the sunroof motor fail. Each repair resulted in multiple visits (which really sucked) because they never have these parts in stock. This was a common complaint in Motor Trend's survey (lack of parts). Also Motor Trend reported that almost all of the owners had to go back in for one or more warranty repairs (ridiculous). My two Nissans have never been in for a warranty repair except my first had 8 year old seatbelts that were recalled and replaced.
One niggly complaint I have is that the paint is soft and scratches easily. A plus to this is that minor scratches are more easily polished out.
My wife loves her car and would buy another but I wouldn't because I'm the one who has to take care of all of the repairs while she ust takes my Nissan!
would not take the car back......even to replace with another one. I hope they do go bankrupt. Shotty products do not belong on the road - nobody should have to pay almost 20 grand and get that kind of hassle.
Please tell me that VW's are better!
Would have bought another VW, but they don't make anything that compares to a Corrado. So I bought an Audi A4 2.8 quattro. Excellent car!!
My advise is go for the Jetta with the VR6 engine(GLS) , then replace the springs/struts with Neuspeed & Bilstein for greatly improved handling.
I thought the Jetta was grossly undertired and had too much body roll. I wish VW would make their cars handle like their other division--Audi.
Also, tonewheel & jwolff, please tell me why you think that the VR6 is a better bet than the GLS with manual transmission. I have felt that previous VW's were under-powered: is this the basic reason, or are there other considerations?
I think there is more aftermarket stuff for the VR6 and they are better all around engines. If you live in the SW I would recommend putting an (New Dimensons ?sp)additional oil cooler on the VR6 b/c they tend to run hot and after the first oil change ie at 7500 mi change to a synthetic like Mobil one 15w50 or Castrol Synthetic 5w50.
I drove a Honda for years and have never had such problems. Is this a German car problem?
I read somewhere (I don't remember where) that sometime early in 2000, the Jetta would be available with the 1.8T engine just like the new beetle. Has anyone heard of this and If so would you have an idea of when?
How would you compare this engine to the V6?
thanks,
MO
I also have a 97 Cabrio. The engine is standard 2.0 but we have an automatic transmission - it hasn't impressed me at all. The car doesn't need more engine, it's not all that agile anyway.
One more thing on the VR6. It's got less horsepower than the new Audi 6 going into the Passat but it had more torque at the right speed ranges.
I love the looks of the Golf; My mechanic says don't buy Golf, not good car, made in Mexico, fall apart one year (he is from Korea). So, I want a car to last another 25 years. Yes, I am almost the original owner, minus 10,000 miles. It has 126,000.
I like the looks of the Jetta next and am disappointed to see it too is made in Mexcio...meaning shoddy workmanship?
I don't have tons of money. After I paid $3300 in 1975, how can I adjust to $15,000 plus? (well, yes, my salary is no longer $5100 a year.
So, I have read Conumer Report which suggests Corolla (I have seen them but I really do not like the jelly bean-generic shapes. Everything else about it sounds great. I have yet to look at the Civic, Mazda Protege, and maybe the Subaru Impreza (all CR recommended). I have even considered the RAV4 but really am anti-SUV's.
So, what do you say, gentlemen? I have read your comments w/ interest and truly am interested in beauty, longevity, style, and cost. Sounds like a good way to look for other things in my life, too.
Please help this damsel not yet in distress in DC.
About the Peublo plant in Mexico. I doubt VW would spend millions $$$ to have quality control problems. The new Jettas are probably the tightest cars in their class. Let your butt decide. Drive as many cars in your price range as possible.
Does anyone have any opinions?
so if someone has heard anything else about it, i would like to know!!!!!!
Thanks for the brief read of everyone elses' problems with the Jetta.
1. Fuel pumps (both of them!)replaced at around 100k
2. "Black box" choke (fifth injector) controller at around 120k
3. Leaking windshield seal at around 180k
Later in it's life it developed a hot start problem that was identical to what I encountered in my '77 Rabbit. The car started great when cold, but would have a problem when it was hot. There was a period of about 5 minutes after I would shut it off that it would start fine, or after about a half hour. But in between, it would start and immediately kill when put under load. If you could get the car to move, it would recover and operate normally. I learned to live with it and did not try to have it serviced for this problem.
Fuel mileage was extremely predictable over the life of the vehicle, with 35 mpg in the peak of summer and 27 mpg in the dead of winter (in Minnesota). The car had the 1.8 liter gasoline engine.
Overall, I was very happy with that Jetta.
I am thinking about getting a new Jetta GLS. I have not been able to get much of a price here in the Minneapolis area. VW dealers are riding high right now and are not discounting very far from list price. I may have to wait a while until the frenzy dies down.
Any comments on pricing and discounting?
Consumer reports indicates that reliability of VW's have improved substantially.
If you're from DC, suggest you check Autohaus Tischer on Rt. 198 in Laurel. It was an excellent dealer, and always stood behind the cars, even when vw was having lots of reliability problems. My repair guy (also Korean)in DC gave me the same warning. Maybe its a cultural thing.
Anyway,VW has changed. Don't be scared off by a reputation it no longer deserves. The cars are terrific to drive. Just too expensive.
Previous comment regarding shaking and whining noises......never happened here.
PROBLEMS: 1) The liner under the power sunroof: the clips installed in the factory were defective and broke. Had to have them replaced a few weeks after buying the car. Service said they've had this complaint numerous times and that an updated part that they installed should fix the problem.
2) Factory-installed sunroof air deflector (automatic mechanism) "sticks" and then lets go after going over a bump. Having that fixed in a couple weeks. Didn't start happening until after I had a air deflector put on.
Other than that, our experience has been outstanding. For the price, this car has many, MANY features that undoubtedly would cost several thousand more dollars if placed inside a Honda or Audi. Great machine. Very happy.
Three Toyota's later I've had NO problems - only std maint. I traded cars as family changed, not due to problems. Granted VWs handle & look better, but that's little consolation when you are stranded or spending many frustrating hours arguing with service depts.
I WANT a 99 or 2K Passat, but after reading that post and the Jetta post, think I'll buy a Mazda!
Will start looking for a new Jetta or Passet next year for wife/long trip car and keep the 94 for ME/around town car. NO car is perfect but this VW is _darned_ close! Glad I bought the GE extended warrentee to cover all the power features NOT covered by VW after 24K miles.
I haven't had this much enjoyment
in twenty years of driving.
Great car, resposive and handles great!
Looking forward to the next 200K miles.
The charcoal velour seats pick up TONS of lint though!!!
Shopped around for a year, GLS VR6 automatic...whoo hoooo!!! Had a 95 Cavalier...BLEH...I hated it, it hated me!Cranbury en

The annual announcement provides a window into the financial health of the NFL. It's safe to say things look very healthy.
Profit jumped 26.4 percent to a record $54.3 million, with total revenue rising 2 percent to $308.1 million. Both numbers are franchise records.
"Another strong year on the field," president Mark Murphy said, via The Associated Press. "Fourth year in a row to be in the playoffs, won two straight NFC North (Division) championships. That helps our finances."
Also helping out finances, according to Murphy: The new collective bargaining agreement.
"We are seeing the benefit of that in a number of ways," Murphy said, via the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "Just having the stability of a long-term labor agreement has allowed the league to enter into long-term contracts with our TV partners and long-term agreements with sponsors. Same thing for us."
Murphy notes that profits were a little higher because of the timing of contract extensions for linebacker Clay Matthews and quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
"If those had fallen in our fiscal year, our expenses would have been different. They will be in the next fiscal year," Murphy said. "Because of the timing issue, our profits are a little higher than they would be otherwise."
Then again, the Packers can expect a big new influx of revenue next season from their scheduled 7,000-seat addition to Lambeau Field. Capacity now will be more than 80,000.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (KTHV) - The summer is winding down and high school football season is right around the corner. To prepare for kickoff, THV 11 is hosted a Coaches Day at War Memorial Stadium for high schools in central Arkansas.
Those in attendance heard from THV's Mark Edwards and Craig O'Neill about upcoming plans for this season. They learned how to report scores to THV on Friday nights and got a sneak peek of the new and improved High School Sports website, which will feature team practice video and weekly polls.
THV 11 conducted interviews with coaches and players at the event, which took place on Thursday.
Athletic Directors, coaches, assistant coaches, top players, booster club members, and school journalism students were invited to attend.Wear Your Seat

15 always enjoy this cast. I wish the film looked less ordinary. The trailer is doing nothing to help it stand out as something special. (“they have one shot…” and then they show a gun being shot. Oh I get it, the juxtaposition of….ugh…)
Refreshing to see a good old fashioned action movie this summer! Why haven’t these two gotten together before?
I’m glad they are adding some R Rated edge to this campaign . . makes it feel like the good ol’ days of LETHAL WEAPON. Attitude, guns, and smart alec lines in the heat of the summer.
Wow. The first trailer looked like a light-hearted buddy-action-comedy. This looks like it’s from a practically different film, darker, more hard-edged. Wonder which one’s more accurate.
They should have introduced the film with this trailer 3 months ago; the first one was horrible.
I’m going to love watching this movie.
Yeah, this one misses by a mile. Lame trailer that drips with flop sweat. All of it so obvious and lacking anything subtle. Feels like this movie sounded great on paper and in reality it’s simply generic. I would have thought the Uni Marketing group could have pulled this one off.
Terrible explosive effect when he tosses the grenade into the car it explodes too early and it blows up from underneath the car it’s silly and the way it blows up cut in half from beneath. That’s some crazy powerful grenade or dynamite or whatever he threw but it’s poorly done.
Check the trailer again. It looks like he’s tossing a key fob after sending a signal that blows up the car.
Hate to be the drippy cloud in this sunshine-y Deadline post, but “Two Guns”, given what I know and love from the comic strip, looks like one lame movie starring two terrific actors. I could be wrong but this flick looks like another hiccup in a summer full of them. On a side note, why does Denzel every three or four years feel compelled to tap back into his “Training Day” mean mug phase?
Because the Academy like it does all the time gave Denzel(along with too many actors to name) the Oscar for the WRONG performance.
Well, I am sure glad that after all the outrage over gun violence not too long ago actors are taking roles that don’t use weapons to ….oh, wait – never mind. Do as I say, not as I do to get a BIG FAT PAYCHECK…
Yes, Feet_of_clay, because this movie was written, produced, shot and edited in the last two months. It’s not just your feet that are made of clay, I think your brain is also.
Big ups. Big BO. Finally a Summer action movie with some real action.
This looks terrible. Denzel doing the same old shit.Kitchin, Rob and Perkins, Chris and Dodge, Martin (2009) Thinking about maps. In: Rethinking Maps. Routledge Studies in Human Geography (28). Routledge, London, pp. 1-25. ISBN 9780415461528
Abstract
Given the long history of map-making and its scientific and scholarly traditions one might expect the study of cartography and mapping theory to be relatively moribund pursuits with long established and static ways of thinking about and creating maps. This, however, could not be further from the truth. As historians of cartography have amply demonstrated, cartographic theory and praxis has varied enormously across time and space, and especially in recent years. As conceptions and philosophies of space and scientific endeavour have shifted so has how people come to know and map the world. Philosophical thought concerning the nature of maps is of importance because it dictates how we think about, produce and use maps; it shapes our assumptions about how we can know and measure the world, how maps work, their techniques, aesthetics, ethics, ideology, what they tell us about the world, the work they do in the world, and our capacity as humans to engage in mapping. Mapping is epistemological but also deeply ontological – it is both a way of thinking about the world, offering a framework for knowledge, and a set of assertions about the world itself. This philosophical distinction between the nature of the knowledge claims that mapping is able to make, and the status of the practice and artefact itself, is intellectually fundamental to any thinking about mapping. In this opening chapter we explore the philosophical terrain of contemporary cartography, setting out some of the reasons as to why there are a diverse constellation of map theories vying for attention and charting some significant ways in which maps have been recently theorized. It is certainly the case that maps are enjoying something of a renaissance in terms of their popularity, particularly given the various new means of production and distribution. New mapping technologies have gained the attention of industry, government and to some extent the general public keen to capitalize on the growing power, richness and flexibility of maps as organizational tools, modes of analysis and, above all, compelling visual images with rhetorical power. It is also the case that maps have become the centre of attention for a diverse range of scholars from across the humanities and social sciences interested in maps in-and-of-themselves and how maps can ontologically and epistemologically inform other visual and representational modes of knowing and praxis. From a scientific perspective, a growing number of researchers in computer science and engineering are considering aspects of automation of design, algorithmic efficiency, visualization technology and human interaction in map production and consumption. These initiatives have ensured that mapping theory over the past twenty years has enjoyed a productive period of philosophical and practical development and reflection. Rather than be exhaustive, our aim is to demonstrate the vitality of present thinking and practice, drawing widely from the literature and signposting relevant contributions among the essays that follow. We start the chapter by first considering the dimensions across which philosophical differences are constituted. We then detail how maps have been theorized from within a representational approach, followed by an examination of the ontological and epistemological challenges of postrepresentational conceptions of mapping.Nature and Nurture: The Complex Interplay of Genetic and Environmental Influences on Human Behavior and Development

When Shena betrayed Keern, he swore revenge. Now she is his slave…
Shena is a pawn to her father’s desire to extend his holdings. She’s known neither kindness nor love, until one fateful day when she meets Keern. In a few passionate hours together, he teaches her what it means to feel loved and protected. She would do anything to protect him from her father’s greed, but in a moment of weakness, she reveals Keern’s identity and sets in motion a series of events that lead to his brother’s death and her sale as a slave.
Keern believes Shena betrayed him. When she plays the venomous shrew to push him away and keep him safe, he falls for the act and grows to hate her. When his brother dies, he swears his revenge and tracks her all the way to the auction blocks. He purchases her for his slave, but will he find satisfaction for his rage or will the overwhelming sexual attraction they share make him her slave instead?
Although this is set in the future, on another planet, it has the timelessness of a fairy tale.
Caution: This is primarily a love story, with explicit love scenes. There is mild violence and events that are highly traumatic for Shena when she is taken into slavery.

As a lead-up to an online kids’ vote, which will go live after the special airs, John McCain and Barack Obama took questions from interested kids on issues including immigration, health care and climate change.
The striking thing was that their answers, while aimed at kids, were not appreciably dumbed down compared with what they would give an audience of adult voters in a debate. But they were calm, positive, focused on their own policies and what benefits the candidates believed they would have. There were no ad hominem attacks, rehearsed stump jokes or zingers. No drumbeat of coded hits like “erratic” or “doesn’t understand.”
Why? Because if you did any of that before an audience of kids, you would look like a complete tool.
But in front of audiences of adults, McCain and Palin this week are feeding their base sufficient hostile red meat that their crowds are calling Obama a “terrorist”, swearing at the campaign press and using a racial epithet for a black cameraman while telling him “sit down, boy.” (I’m sure these examples sound unbalanced, but I have not been seeing equivalents from Obama and Biden rallies.)
People consider it an insult to say that candidates talk to us like we’re children. But maybe the problem is that they don’t do that enough.
Of course, a kid did also ask the candidates what their favorite Halloween costumes were. Curiously, both of them, no lie, answered “pirate.” See, they do have common ground!Structural Analysis of Competitive Behavior: New Empirical Industrial Organization Methods in Marketing
The impact of a firm's strategic marketing mix choices on profitability can be evaluated by understanding the impact of those choices on consumer demand for the firm's products and on the firm's costs. Additionally, a firm's strategic marketing mix choices, and its demand and costs can be affected by rival firms' strategic choices. Therefore, to understand the effects of choice of marketing mix on profitability, we have to understand its effects on demand, cost and competitor reactions. The effects of choices of marketing mix on consumer demand have been analyzed in great depth in marketing, but research on the strategic reactions of competitors to such choices have been far more limited. The New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) framework provides us with a source of methods that has potential to substantially add to our insights about competitive interactions among firms. In this paper, we first discuss a simple NEIO model to illustrate the basic methodology. We then discuss the contributions of this literature to our knowledge of competitive marketing strategy. In the process, we discuss methodological extensions of the basic model that are needed to model the institutional realities of specific markets. We also summarize how the existing literature has evolved, and provide our view of where the literature might profitably proceed from here. In particular, we discuss how future methodological innovations in the dynamics of competition, discrete strategy choice, and asymmetric information estimation will enable wider application of this methodology to competitive marketing strategy issues. The main advantage of NEIO studies is that they provide greater understanding of the competitive behavior in specific markets or industries compared to cross-sectional studies across industries. Bountiful opportunities exist for additional studies that focus on similar phenomena in different markets to draw generalizable conclusions from this line.- Stock Vector Illustration:

Post new commentI take it on trust that Hawking knew everything about the complexities of the universe and black holes. But I cannot take it on trust that the purveyors of the scrambled-egg league which has been proposed are fully aware of the conundrums they are heaping on the public, and clubs whose future and very existence following a three-way split after 22 games could have as much relationship to ability and achievement as a gambler playing a one-armed bandit in Vegas.
If, as they say, the devil is in the detail then old Mephistopheles has had a field day with this one. I do not intend to go into the infinite possibilities of how a split of 8-8-8 could be achieved, nor what the consequences could be for any individual club falling on the wrong side of the split by virtue of an outbreak of norovirus or a crass refereeing decision, and then having to go back to start all over again, the slate wiped clean, as if they hadn't existed for a few months.
If it comes to pass, and such outcomes produce anger and incomprehension, then the acrimony we have experienced in the past few months in Scottish football will seem like a golden age of ecumenism. Of course it could all work, they say. All the bits and pieces could fall into place, all the different parts working for opposing purposes of relegation and promotion would synchronise, as if it was the handicraft of a Swiss horologist. Why am I finding that difficult to swallow?
My lack of trust in the winding of the watch from the top stems, wearily, from recalling a track record of inconsistency, and ultimately hypocrisy, through the years. You find yourself desperately seeking a figure among the suits who brings a sense of overall command to the most trenchant of tasks, the way Ernie Walker did at the Scottish Football Association. Instead the supposed central figures offer portraits of men on the fringe of action rather than central to it. Stewart Regan of the SFA and the Scottish Premier League's Neil Doncaster seem to have a sense of direction more akin to that of Hansel and Gretel than to Scott and Amundsen.
Roger Mitchell, yesterday, offering some astonishment and indirect praise to them for what emerged, misses the point about these figures. It was events, dear boy, events. The proposals for a unitary body which will preside over a new league and the greatly welcome redistribution of some revenue came about because of the elephant in the room during talks: Rangers.
Celtic's welcome largesse in this matter was because of where Rangers have now ended up. It was Peter Lawwell who realised that, if he did not relent on this, there would have been no deal at all. Celtic, free of the twinning encumbrance with Rangers, could act independently. They could not afford to be seen as an isolated stumbling block and at the same time could act to cement his club's great rivals even more securely to where they now are. Methinks Roger has forgotten something about the DNA of the Old Firm.
And we cannot overlook the fact that essentially nothing is changing. It's about money, about the number of home games they can count on, especially against Celtic. It's an old refrain that not even David Bowie could make sound fresh. The 12-club league – which was for so long considered an anachronism and led to the familiarity, which bred contempt, that moved on to boredom and staleness among the public, and was considered dead and buried in any historic evaluation – has been exhumed, even before it became deceased. It is an awesome feat that reduces the Lazarus story to insignificance.
But if they really are so desperate to be able to have the top clubs finance themselves to offer the best talent they can afford, then, by that notion, the logical step would be to invite that new cash-cow of the under-privileged called Rangers back into the fold again at the top. You can take it that idea would be lower down the agenda than inviting a transvestite team to become one of the 12.
So let us not be too carried away by the pleading of why they have to inflict this rigmarole on the public in their intent to ring-fence talent. They have opted for self-limiting solutions and have to live by them. In any case, since the start of this present season the clubs – Celtic excepted – were supposed to be entering a new era of modest self-sufficiency, and even without a platinum television deal. They would all struggle through, using as much of indigenous and youthful talent as passed muster. That seemed an invigorating challenge to everybody.
Perhaps it was that mood of "bliss was it in that dawn to be alive" which aroused the terracing surge for a top league of 16. Radicalism was in the air. Here was the great chance to renew our marriage vows with the game. Instead of a new ring we are being handed a wee poke for a Lucky Dip.
Equally, that very uncertainty is being lauded as something valuable, worthy of a try, since there are no options, especially not a revenue-weak league of 16. It's a format I have supported since the days of Muffin the Mule, though, and I am not giving up on it now. Perhaps Scottish football could stand up to television and deliver a message that the vast majority of supporters, who also pay subscriptions for viewing, are demanding a specific format and that, aided and abetted by sponsorship, any shortfalls in revenue would be made up by them.
The odds might be stacked against such an initiative but surely it is worth a try if the new unitary controlling body of football wish to develop trust with their public. Other than that, we will see the new format unveiled to us with all the incandescence of a shooting star. And you don't need to read Hawking to know that these phenomena burn out very quickly.Lester pitched 248 innings last year in the regular- and postseason combined, and the Red Sox wanted to bring him along slowly this spring training.

I have been using LR 2 and upgraded to LR 3.2. After I am running for
a while memory usage increases drastically. I have 2GB mem
ory on a XEON 4 Processor System and have never had memory problems up until now.
I am in the develop module and I get a message from Norton that LR is using 1.5GB memory and I have to restart LR 3.2.
I have seen some chatter on the Internet about a memory leak problem but cannot seem to find information about it being fixed.
I could add another GB of memory but XP SP3 max is 3GB anyway.
Can anyone tell me if there is a fix and where I might find it.

.. my 2 cents ..
Do you feel any issues in using LR when the message appears? If not, forget the message from Norton and just let use LR the available memory. What's the memory good for if not letting the apps just using it as long as no issues appear with the app itself or any other app running concurrently.

I AGREE! I am so frustrated with Lightroom 3.2! It works fine for a while, then all the sudden SLOWS DOWN and it happens every time I edit a shoot! Adobe has got to FIX THIS! It's not a computer problem.... it's a software problem and it happens every time! I'm thinking about switching to Aperture because this ONE problem is soooo frustrating. PLEASE FIX THIS, because I like the product, but hate the memory lag!
3. Re: LR 3.2 Memory Problemhhansard Nov 7, 2010 8:11 AM (in response to photojoe648)
Memory issues have been around for a while. Basically, some operations (mostly in Develop) allocate of large blocks of memory from the OS. LR tends to keep the allocated blocks when not required. On my x64 environments, LR can allocate (and keep) up to about 4GB additional blocks after the base app is loaded prior to editing a single image. In some cases this is OK if your workflow is just LR.
But if LR is part of a larger workflow then all the apps are completing for memory and this is where the real issues begin. PS also does the same thing. So you can consume 6 or 8 Gig of RAM just having LR and PS open, but working in another app entirely...
Adobe is aware of this behavior (a high percentage of threads are about performance) – in some cases this is intentional design (you can also refer to endless threads on Moore’s Law accommodating mediocre software), but there are cases when memory was not correctly allocated and unintentionally held, and this is a bug.
Working with Adobe development is the only way of correcting this. The development team needs specifics to assist them. Help/System Info is a good place to start...
4. Re: LR 3.2 Memory Problemjgregson Nov 7, 2010 8:55 AM (in response to grandpahenry)
What's the page file size? Page file size + real memory = total memory available. So the fact that you have 2GB of real memory doesn't tell the whole story. If your page file size is 3GB, then you have 5GB of memory available to Lightroom and other apps (actually less because of OS requirements). In this case, Lightroom and other apps have plenty of memory available.
F. McLion's post is on the mark, ignore the message.

Well you can believe that, but it doesn't automatically make it true.
As has been explained on here umpteen times, there are so many interdependencies between the software and hardware on a computer that it's simply impossible to claim that "it's not a computer problem" until you've done some serious analysis of the problem at a local level. It could easily be down to your machine, and it doesn't matter that other software - or even previous versions of Lr - have behaved, that still doesn't prove a fault per se with the current version.
As to your "it happens every time!", and to underline that your assertion that the software is flawed is not necessarily true: it never, ever, ever happens to me.
I have a relatively modest machine ("only" 6gb of RAM on a Win 7/64 bit box that gets used for everything, not just imaging work) and I've frequently worked non-stop for an entire day/several hundreds of full-sized Canon 7D RAW files, without Lr so much as hiccuping once.
If it was an inherent Lr fault, why don't I have the same problems you have?
Most likely because I don't use your machine...

Henry,
I'm running LR under XP, SP3, just like you are. When I go to Help/System Info..., I see (among other stuff) Real memory available to Lightroom: 716.8 MB. Evidently, LR under XP limits itself to less than a gigabyte of real memory, and I've never seen it use more than that for more than a couple of seconds. Actually, I'd like LR to use more than that artificially low amount, but I can't find a way to induce it to do that.
So, either Norton is lying to you, or LR is lying to me. As some previous poster asked, does Lightroom actually act badly when Norton complains?At that point, what is Help/System Info telling you?
As to getting another gigabyte of memory goes, more generally helps and is the first hardware change one generally tries when tryiing to speed up one's system.

Not sure who is passionate?
When your system gets slow, try sys info and post.
SP3 x32 or x64? Different animals. There is a known memory leak issue around large DNGs, Develop and the x64 code base.

Are you writing or caching XMP to the files?
Pre-built previews or on-the fly?
Longer term, more physical ram is much better. All the machines in this shop are now 8GB or over.
Good luck.

Adding 1GB of RAM may help perk up your system some by reducing the paging that needs to be done, but Lightroom 32 bit is limited to something less than
1GB of physical/system RAM to reduce the "out of memory" problems that plagued 32 bit versions of Windows in particular beginning with Lightroom 2.1 I believe.
Technically, 32 bit versions of Windows can use 4GB minus the graphics card RAM.
Also, you can try increasing the max size of your page file or letting Windows manage it.

Keith, I apologize if I have surfaced an issue that caused you to think that this is the same old "crap". To me I looked at the forum as a place to seek knowledge and to seek a solution to a problem that locked up my system. The issue I questioned has never happened to me before and only seemed to begin with LR 3.2.
So if I am the source of your angst over this, please forgive as I meant no harm.

John, grandpahenry,
you both need to make careful note of who - and what - I was responding to.
God knows, it's not hard - the person being replied to is indicated clearly enough at the top of each post (surely you've been on the board long enough to have figured this out, John?), but - for clarity - I was responding (helpfully and absolutely civilly at first, then more in keeping with his smartarsed, "flip-off" reply) to photojoe648.
I invite you both to have another look at his first post and my response, and what came subsequently, rather than simply assuming that I was having a go at grandpahenry...

I'll take that as an apology, then...First, Nicolas Ghesquière, the man who, in fewer than eight years, has resurrected the Balenciaga label from ignominy, making it one of the most critically acclaimed in the fashion world. And since the Gucci Group bought the label in 2001, giving Ghesquière access to more money and publicity, he has only improved. His trick of combining the label's history of beautiful tailoring with futuristic tweaks - a kind of Logan's Run chic - appeals to true cool-obsessed fashionistas (Kate Moss once reportedly ordered an entire collection). But it also, surprisingly, has proved to have mass appeal. If you have been wondering why puffballs and egg-shaped skirts have returned this season, from couture designers to Topshop, blame Ghesquière, who has been promoting the look for several years.
There have been complaints, however, that Balenciaga's cooler-than-thou image is a little too carefully cultivated. Rumours abound in the industry about the company refusing to lend clothes to magazines for shoots if they don't feel the titles would suit their image, and the PRs are infamously stringent about whom they invite to their show, banning anyone who has been less than adulatory.
Of course, such tactics only work if the clothes are worth it; fortunately, yesterday's showing was remarkable.
Ghesquière makes clothes unlike anybody else's. The collection opened with an egg-shaped satin dress in cream that nipped around the lower thighs, referencing the original Balenciaga shape from the 1950s, then morphed into something entirely Ghesquière's own. After a section of sleekly fitted trouser suits with punk T-shirts there was a series of complex lace dresses and then some tightly fitted lace and chiffon jackets, heavily trimmed with lace layers around the cuffs, making the models look like punk courtiers.
If Balenciaga is the little mouse that roars, Dior is the real lion of a label.
The jewel in fashion conglomerate LVMH'S crown, the company announced last month that sales were up 16% in July and August.
And this, Dior chief executive Sidney Toledano puffed to WWD, the fashion trade newspaper, last month, is due to their young Turk, John Galliano. Whereas Ghesquière resurrected an old label with tricky couture, Galliano uses bright splashiness.
Last night's collection was more subdued than usual, and better for it: delicate new dresses with black lace forms the main part, similar to the couture one Kate Moss was recently photographed wearing.Environmental Capacity of a Small Island State: Planning for Sustainable Development in Malta
Academic journal article
By Camilleri, Marguerite
The Town Planning Review , Vol. 75, No. 1 , March 2004
Article excerpt
The concept of environmental capacity seems intuitively attractive for implementing sustainability in small island states, and this paper examines its usefulness in the island state of Malta. The concept suggests that there may be limits or thresholds to the total amount of development that an area can contain without losing its critical environmental features or capital. The research uncovers serious tensions in the theory and practice of environmental capacity assessment, surrounding the determination of critical environmental capital, and the reconciliation of scale, expertise and environmental justice. It concludes that for the concept and its associated planning tool to have transformative potential in Malta, it will need to throw off reformist versions that are technocratic, expert based and dominated by metaphors of instrumentality, and that the political context in which it is implemented will need to support open, informed debate and a genuine search for alternative models of environmental governance.
If sustainability means anything, it is the setting of limits on activity, development and change. But whose limits, and how to define them? (Minter and Bowers, 1995, 1)
Sustainable development has become a central goal for environmental planning1 across the world and island sustainability has been recognised as a policy area offering particular challenges (UN, 1994; 2000; WSSD, 2002). One policy tool that has been developed in the UK to implement sustainability in land use planning is environmental capacity assessment (WSSC, 1996; Arup/BDP, 1995). It has been claimed that such assessment, with its focus on setting environmental and social thresholds for development and change based on the identification of critical environments, has the potential to facilitate integration of sustainable development concerns into environmental planning systems (EA, 2000; Counsell, 1999; Murdoch, 2000; Jacobs, 1997b; DETR, 1997; RCEP, 2002; Owens, 1994; Owens and Cowell, 2002; CPRE, 1993).
It would seem, at least in theory, that the concept of environmental capacity would be particularly useful to island states wishing to integrate sustainability into their planning systems, because the thresholds it emphasises are often more obvious in such cases. Small islands are also temptingly (albeit somewhat deceptively) akin to 'closed-systems' laboratories, in which the testing of a concept such as environmental capacity could be particularly revealing. In this paper, the usefulness of environmental capacity assessment in this context has been investigated by means of a case study in the island state of Malta. The research indicates that the practice of capacity assessment raises a nexus of complex social and political issues that reflect the contested nature of implementing sustainable development in other contexts. This paper begins by providing a brief outline of Malta and the methodology used in the research; it then outlines the five central tensions associated with the concept and practice of environmental capacity before moving on to review the principal findings of the research for each. The paper then discusses the research findings related to Malta's cultural politics, before concluding with a response to the central question posited in this study by providing some practical policy recommendations for Malta and proposals for further research.
Examining environmental capacities
Malta
The Maltese Archipelago is located roughly in the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, 93 kilometres south of Italy and 230 kilometres north of Libya, on a submarine ridge that divides the Sea into its two main hydrographic basins (Fig. 1). Malta, the largest and most heavily populated island, is 27 kilometres long by 14 kilometres wide, shaped like a fish, along the back of which are found the remarkable harbours that have contributed to Malta's military and commercial history and given rise to its urban core.
The islands, which are home to some 380,000 people, are already approximately 25 per cent urbanised (MHAE, 2002), while demand for new housing, tourism and commercial development is steadily increasing. …Re-Discover Reginald Mars, a set of newly restored original paintings by Midwest artist Reginald Mars (1901-1973), will be on display in Oak Park Public Library's Main Library Art Gallery, 834 Lake St., Oak Park, Aug. 2 through Aug. 31. Mars' work has been part of the fabric of the Oak Park community since being installed in Park District of Oak Park's Ridgeland Common in 1963. Recently restored by local art conservation expert Timothy Lennon, this series by Mars will be celebrated at a reception, open to everyone, in the Main Library Art Gallery, Sunday, Aug. 3 from 3 to 5 pm.
In 1962, when local architect Jack Barclay designed the building at Ridgeland Common, Reginald Mars was commissioned to create a series of paintings depicting the activities of Oak Park and of the Park District's programs. Among the activities featured in the colorful paintings, which lined the walls of the Comstock Room, are swimming, diving, basketball, baseball, ice skating, hockey and curling. As time passed and the facilities were remodeled, the paintings were eventually put in storage.
In March 2011, the Park District of Oak Park's Art Advisory Committee began to raise funds to restore the paintings. The kick-off fundraising event at Pleasant Home brought together architect Jack Barclay and Oak Park art conservator Timothy Lennon, retired from the Art Institute of Chicago and later commissioned by the Park District to restore the paintings.
The Main Library Art Gallery is open seven days a week during regular hours. More information about Re-Discovering Reginald Mars, and art in the Library, can be found at oppl.org/art
About Reginald Mars.ACCESSION NUMBER:00000 FILE ID:97031801.TXT DATE:03/18/97 TITLE:18-03-97 WHITE HOUSE REPORT, TUESDAY, MARCH 18, 1997 TEXT: (Clinton withdraws Lake nomination) (350) President Clinton has withdrawn the nomination of Tony Lake to be Director of Central Intelligence, at Lake's request, and will move quickly "to try to find a candidate that would bring the same integrity, experience and expertise to the job as Tony would have had," White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry told reporters March 18. Lake hand-delivered an anguished letter to the President in the White House residence March 17 asking that his nomination be withdrawn. McCurry said Clinton hopes people read carefully Lake's letter to him stating why he was asking to have his nomination withdrawn. It says a lot about the times we live in and the way we do business, McCurry said. McCurry said Clinton strongly supported his choice of Lake to head the intelligence community, and would have continued to back him, but understood why Lake asked to have his nomination withdrawn. Lake would have been confirmed, McCurry said, "but it would have been at an enormous price to him personally, for reasons he describes in his letter. It would have done damage to the spirit and morale at the agency, it would have put into question the ability of the White House to work effectively with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence." "The confirmation process" that Tony Lake went through was "inexcusably flawed," McCurry said and members of the United States Senate must ask themselves today "whether the Senate today still retains the capacity for effective bipartisan oversight of the intelligence community." The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, under the chairmanship of Senator Richard Shelby (Republican-Alabama), has lost its traditional bipartisan approach, McCurry said. Asked if allegations of improper campaign fundraising had something to do with the problems Lake encountered on Capitol Hill, McCurry said "Not much. The only things I am aware of demonstrate that the NSC staff acted professionally and responsibly and kept separate the nation's foreign policy and national security from domestic politics." Lake was the National Security Council Adviser to Clinton in Clinton's first term in office. NNNNWhy did you choose this product?

Career options in pharmacy range from filling prescriptions at neighborhood stores to conducting research, engaging in clinical practice, and teaching. Pharmacists also consult with and counsel patients and other health care professionals. Many are involved in medication therapy management, providing drug therapy to improve patients’ lives.
Along with their science training and expertise in drug selection and preparation, pharmacists must have the business and communication skills necessary for multifaceted careers.
Iowa offers a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree that is a professional degree and not offered as an undergraduate major. However, first-year students planning to apply to the PharmD program can elect to receive specialized advising and course work to help them prepare for applying to the PharmD program. Typically, the PharmD curriculum includes two years of preprofessional college-level course work followed by four years of pharmacy study.
Why Study at Iowa?
Iowa’s College of Pharmacy has a superb national reputation. Its PharmD program is ranked 17th in the nation by U.S.News & World Report.
The college is the fourth-oldest pharmacy college at a state-supported university and has been educating pharmacists since 1885. In that time, it has developed nationally and internationally recognized research programs in pharmaceutics, medicinal and natural products chemistry, clinical pharmaceutical sciences, pharmaceutical socioeconomics, and pharmacy practice. Its faculty is recognized worldwide.
The PharmD program is widely known for its personalized atmosphere and emphasis on individual attention—a result of its low student-to-faculty ratio—and its location on a world-class health sciences campus. It is adjacent to University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, one of the nation’s largest public university teaching hospitals. Its research facilities include a unique university-affiliated, full-service, FDA-licensed drug development and production lab.
Course Work
First-year students with a declared pharmacy interest typically take prerequisite course work in physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and rhetoric during their first year at Iowa, then courses including organic chemistry, human anatomy, microbiology, and microeconomics during their second year.
Course work is designed to teach critical skills needed to practice as a pharmacist: problem solving, critical thinking, and use of technology-based information retrieval sources.
The prerequisite course work (which needs to be completed before applying to the PharmD program) can be completed in two years, although many students choose to complete it over three years, or over four years while completing a bachelor’s degree in another area.
Visit the College of Pharmacy website to review more details about the Prerequisite Course Work required for admission to the PharmD program. You may also review Pharmacy in the UI General Catalog.
Admission Requirements
Admission to the PharmD program requires completion of about two years of college-level course work. Students who have not yet completed the prerequisites need to meet requirements for admission to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
Admission to the PharmD Program
Admission to the PharmD program is highly competitive and satisfying the admission requirements does not guarantee acceptance to the program. Minimum admission requirements include:
- Satisfactory completion of the prerequisite college course work and a cumulative grade-point average (GPA) of at least 2.50
- Completion of the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT) by September in order to be considered for admission the following fall semester.
Applications for admission to the PharmD program are accepted online through PharmCAS, the national pharmacy application service. You'll also submit some application materials directly to the College of Pharmacy, and may be invited to a personal interview. Review the College of Pharmacy website for more details about the admission requirements and application process.
Admission Requirements Tabs
Student Opportunities
In addition to having nearly 500 Student Organizations, Iowa students choose from multiple Living-Learning Communities, Study Abroad Programs, and Undergraduate Research Opportunities.
Pharmacy students have multiple opportunities to become involved in the profession locally, statewide, and nationally through the college’s eight pharmacy student organizations. Students attend national conferences, participate in community service, educate children, assist with immunizations, and organize social events.
Pharmacy students also have opportunities to become involved in the college through serving on committees and attending meetings with the dean, advisory councils, and alumni boards.
First-year students interested in pharmacy may enjoy the Health Sciences Living-Learning Community in the residence halls.
Faculty, Facilities, and Resources
The College of Pharmacy operates small and large classrooms with state-of-the-art technology. The student practice lab is a technologically advanced, licensed pharmacy that provides real and simulated practice experiences. The Banker Student Activity Center features quiet environments for individual and small-group study and houses student organization offices.
Other facilities in the college include the Division of Drug Information Service, a computerized database with information about the clinical use of drugs, and University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals, an FDA-registered pharmaceutical manufacturing facility.
Careers
The College of Pharmacy has had a 100 percent placement rate for many years.
Pharmacists often choose to practice in a community pharmacy or a hospital setting. They hold positions in government, independent businesses, home health care, consulting, clinical pharmacy, managed care facilities, higher education, or the pharmaceutical industry. This broad range of career choices gives graduates considerable flexibility in their personal and professional lives.
Scholarships
Scholarship opportunities for incoming pharmacy students include the College of Pharmacy Tuition Scholarship, which is awarded based on GPA, and the College of Pharmacy Opportunity Scholarship. Criteria for the Opportunity Scholarship include unique personal abilities, perseverance in overcoming obstacles to academic success, previous experience in the health care environment, and the extent to which the student may contribute to racial, ethnic, geographic, and intellectual diversity.
The Office of Admissions and the Office of Student Financial Aid also are great resources for students seeking scholarships.
Application Process
Only students who have completed the PharmD Prerequisite College Course Work can apply directly to the College of Pharmacy's PharmD program. All other students should apply to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Designate your "pre-pharmacy" interest on your application for admission to receive specialized advising and assistance selecting course work in preparation for the PharmD program.Quarterback is the most important position in all of sports.

The first exhibition devoted to Piet Mondrian’s early career, from his student years in Holland, working as a painter of romantic landscapes, to his emergence as an artist of international renown in cosmopolitan pre-World War I Paris, was on view at the Kimbell Art Museum from August 18 through December 8, 2002. With over 100 paintings and drawings of quietly breathtaking beauty, Mondrian, 1892–1914: The Path to Abstraction revealed how one of the greatest painters of the 20th century evolved towards abstraction while drawing upon pictorial traditions long established in the Netherlands.
The Kimbell Art Museum was the only North American venue for this exhibition, which was organized by the Réunion des Musées Nationaux, the Musée d’Orsay, and the Kimbell Art Museum of Fort Worth and was made possible thanks to an exceptional loan from the collection of the Gemeentemuseum, The Hague. The guest curators were Hans Janssen, chief curator of the Gemeentemuseum, and Mondrian specialist Joop Joosten.
“Mondrian’s work from the first half of his career, though less well known than his ‘grid paintings,’ has a distinctiveness and unity that is essential to understanding his fully abstract style,” said Dr. Timothy Potts, director of the Kimbell Art Museum. “In works of quiet but compelling beauty, we see Mondrian emerging from a wholly Dutch tradition of landscape painting, absorbing the revolutionary new approaches of Fauvism and Cubism, and then striking out on an equally revolutionary path of his own. This is one of those rare exhibitions that provide an important new perspective on a major figure of modern art, which will be of great interest to scholars while also offering a beautiful experience to art lovers and the general public. It promises to change the way early Mondrian is understood.”
Piet Mondrian is today considered one of the greatest painters of the 20th century, the creator of a new language built on abstraction. Near the end of his life, Mondrian looked back over the works of his early career and remarked: “For me, there is no difference between these early ones and the last ones—they are all a part of the same thing. I do not feel the difference between the old and the new in art as really different, but as a continuity.” This exhibition takes the artist at his word, showing the “pure” abstraction of his well-known grid compositions, with their squares and rectangles of primary color, as a progressive refinement of imagery contained in his early, representational paintings—which in turn developed out of older and particularly Dutch traditions of realism.
Mondrian has always been considered as a stylistic pioneer whose abstract paintings mark a clear and decisive break with the past. Descriptions of his artistic evolution are couched in terms of the “modern,” and certainly he was among the first of those revolutionary 20th-century European painters who challenged the idea that art must imitate nature. However, the severely beautiful works he created as a result, along with his own highly original artistic theories, have tended to obscure all that tied him to the past. Looking at Mondrian’s career as a whole, his work actually shows a strong degree of unity. Its “logic” can be divided into several periods that follow one another with perfect coherence, from the figurative beginnings in the Dutch countryside to the abstract climax in the heart of New York, passing through two long, decisive sojourns in Paris.
The first Parisian period, from 1912 to 1914, allowed Mondrian to make his transition from figurative to abstract Cubism, the outcome of a long process, begun in the 19th century, in which he progressively transformed realistic motifs. As a counterbalance to the narrowly modernist view of Mondrian, in which his abstraction is seen as a complete break with the past, this exhibition presented paintings and drawings that reveal his deep roots in the pictorial traditions of the 19th century and his native Netherlands. It took the reexamination of the early works inspired by the Mondrian retrospective held in The Hague, Washington, and New York in 1994–96 several steps further, drawing upon discoveries published in the late Robert Welsh’s catalogue raisonné of 1998.
When the 20-year-old Mondrian arrived in Amsterdam in 1892, he found himself in a highly conservative artistic environment. Unlike other Dutch cities, especially The Hague and Rotterdam, Amsterdam was still living artistically in the past, in a golden age of realism—a realism that had long been considered the defining feature of Dutch art as a whole. Mondrian spent his formative years in this nationalistic climate and in some ways continued throughout his career to create and think about art within the Dutch realist tradition. Significantly, he was to entitle a retrospective essay about his work “Toward the True Vision of Reality” (1942), affirming “I never painted these things romantically; but from the very beginning, I was always a realist.”
In Amsterdam, Mondrian undertook an exploration of shape, light, and space by means of series representing canals or riverbanks, buildings such as farms, churches, and lighthouses, dune landscapes, trees, and a few images of flowers and figures. He explored different techniques and styles interpreted in his own manner, including Pointillism, Fauvism, and Expressionism. Having discovered Cubism in Amsterdam at the exhibition he organized with the “artistic circle,” he decided to leave his own country to settle in Paris during the winter of 1911–12.
In the French capital, he immediately became part of the circle of Cubist painters. He continued to explore previously worked themes, especially trees and façades of buildings. Looking for structure, rhythm, and balance, he quickly abandoned so-called realistic representation, and composed images with complex patterns of horizontal and vertical lines set in a two-dimensional space, using few colors. He was mostly interested in the relationships between elements. Within two years, following this path, Mondrian reached what we call “abstract art.”
The argument of Mondrian, 1892–1914: The Path to Abstraction was that this new awareness by no means displaced the artist’s concern with realism—as critics have often claimed. His increasing abstraction was not a matter of transcending his experience of the world around him in pursuit of a higher, more spiritual state. It was a matter of rendering reality in purer, simpler form, of finding what he called “a more concise form of expression and an economy of means.” This exhibition traced Mondrian’s journey from naturalistic realism to what might be called abstract realism, to his own “True Vision of Reality.”
A fully illustrated catalogue by Hans Janssen and Joop Joosten was published by Waanders Publishers (Zwolle), the Dutch art book publisher, in association with the Kimbell Art Museum and the Réunion des Musées Nationaux, Paris.
A symposium of the exhibition featuring distinguished scholars took place on Saturday, September 28, 2002. The day of lectures will include talks by Hans Janssen, curator of the Gemeentemuseum, Mondrian specialist Joop Joosten, John Elderfield, chief curator at large, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and Yve-Alain Bois, Joseph Pulitzer Jr. Professor of Modern Art, Harvard University.
Promotional support for this exhibition was provided by American Airlines, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, NBC 5, and La Estrella.Note: To protect the privacy of our members, e-mail addresses have been removed from the archived messages. As a result, some links may be broken.

Is this the WWE or the NFL? The line is starting to get a little blurred. Between Antonio Cromartie’s explicit message to Tom Brady and now Terrell Suggs’ explicit t-shirt flipping off Steelers fans, I’m starting to wonder if this is the Wednesday before the Divisional Round of the playoffs or the Wednesday before Wrestlemania. These two loud mouths will probably be embraced by Vince McMahon when they decide to give up football. Check out this picture from Suggs’ Twitter that Pro Football Talk pointed out to us:
Not only is the message unoriginal, but we’ve seen this type of delivery from Suggs before when it comes to the Steelers. Remember this t-shirt? Whether it involves a microphone in his face or an article of clothing, Suggs has to stir up controversy and capture the spotlight any way he can. It will be interesting to see who backs up their trash talk come this weekend — if anyone.Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased 2.5 percent in the second quarter of 2013 after increasing 1.1 percent in the first quarter, according to the “second” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The second-quarter growth rate was revised up 0.8 percentage point from the advance estimate released in July.
GDP growth highlights
The second-quarter acceleration reflected the following:
• An upturn in goods exports; nonautomotive consumer goods accelerated, and civilian aircraft and parts turned up.
• An upturn in business investment, mainly in power and communication structures.
These contributions to the acceleration in economic growth were offset in part by an acceleration in imports; autos, engines, and parts turned up. In addition, inventory investment and consumer spending slowed.
Revisions
The revision to second-quarter GDP growth reflected:
• An upward revision to exports of goods, mainly nonautomotive capital goods, industrial supplies and materials, and nonautomotive consumer goods.
• A downward revision to imports; nonautomotive consumer goods and petroleum products were the top contributors.
• An upward revision to inventory investment, reflecting upward revisions to inventory investment at auto dealerships and general merchandise stores.
Offsetting these upward revisions to GDP growth, state and local government spending was revised down. For more information about the second-quarter revisions, see the technical note.
Corporate profits
BEA’s featured measure of corporate profits rebounded in the second quarter, increasing 3.9 percent after decreasing 1.3 percent in the first quarter.
• Profits of nonfinancial corporations rose 4.2 percent after falling 0.3 percent.
• Profits of financial corporations increased 3.3 percent after decreasing 0.9 percent.
• Profits from the “rest of the world” rose 3.4 percent after falling 4.7 percent.
Compared with second quarter of 2012, second-quarter corporate profits rose 5.0 percent.

Every team except the New York Mets, St. Louis, Arizona, Florida, and Tampa Bay has hosted an All-Star Game since then.
Eight teams have hosted two in that span, and Houston will join that club next year when the event comes to Minute Maid Park.
"Detroit was really a natural," said Commissioner Bud Selig. "It's been a long time. It's really been too long, but once we got the details worked out, it was easy. From what anybody in Detroit remembers about the All Star Game and the experience, this will be a tremendous event. This is one of the great baseball cities in America, and it's a privilege to bring it back here."MONTGOMERY – Cornerstone Christian defeated Crenshaw Christian 46-38 Thursday to win the Class A AISA boys basketball championship in Catherine Dixon Roland Arena at Huntingdon University.
The Chargers led 21-16 at the half and fell behind twice in the third quarter, the latter on a shot by Crenshaw’s Austin Brown. Cornerstone retook the lead for good with 4:48 left in the game as Hagan Joiner scored a layup on a pass from B.J. Smith.
Cornerstone used a half-court trap to force a turnover on Crenshaw’s next possession. Senior forward Kendall Moore made an aggressive dribble into the lane and then hit a twisting shot to extend the advantage.
Smith added a bank shot in the lane and then dished to Joiner for another two.
Down the stretch, the Chargers made 9-of-13 free-throw attempts to seal the win.
“We worked hard and hit our free throws at the end of the game,” Smith said. “Defense. All year we’ve been working on defense.”
The championship victory capped Cornerstone’s seven-game winning streak to end the season. It followed a two-game losing streak that began with a humbling 32-point loss to rival Kingwood Christian.
“We knew we had to work hard ever since then,” Smith said. “After that big loss against our rival, we knew we had to step it up. We stepped it up ever since then.”
Moore led the Chargers with 17 points.
“He is who the team builds off of,” Chase Payne said. “When he can score, all of us can score. He just builds a fire in all of us. He is the captain of this team. No doubt about it.”
Crenshaw relied on its Serbian duo of Djordje Lukic and Petar Milivojevic. Each scored 17 points, but the Chargers countered with an aggressive defense that forced several turnovers.
“We played incredible defense tonight,” said Moore, who was tabbed the tournament’s most valuable player. “Coach (Tim) Smith’s been saying it to us as long as I can remember. Defense will win you championships. That’s what we did tonight; we played defense as hard as we could for 32 minutes.”] perennial herb, aquatic to terrestrial.

February beef plus beef variety meat exports increased 4% in volume (66,155 metric tons or 145.8 million lbs.) and showed a slight increase in value ($220.5 million) over February 2008. Contrary to the trend in pork exports, both volume and value over the same period last year, while variety meat exports have declined 11% in volume and 20% in value.
Beef exports to Korea slumped near the end of 2008, with December results totaling 3,335 metric tons (7.4 million lbs.) valued at $15.2 million. But the new year has seen a rebound in exports to Korea, with the January-February monthly average now standing at 6,550 metric tons (14.4 million lbs.) 10,972 metric tons or 24.2 million lbs.) and increasing 174% in value to $36.2 million.
Japan continues its steady rise in U.S. beef exports, with 2009 totals through February increasing by 19% in volume (to 8,056 metric tons or 17.8 million lbs.) and 17% in value (to $43.3 million).
The strong performance of these markets helped offset a slowdown in exports to Mexico, Canada and Taiwan. Though Mexico and Canada held their position as the top two destinations for U.S. beef, year-to-date exports to Mexico have declined 22% in volume (to 51,238 metric tons or 113 million lbs.) and 17% in value (to $179.1 million). Export volume to Canada declined 14% (to 18,116 metric tons or 39.9 million lbs.) and by 22% in value (to $73.1 million). Beef exports to Taiwan have dropped even more sharply, declining by 29% in volume (to 2,750 metric tons or 6.1 million lbs.) and 28% in value (to $13.3 million).
While consumers in some global markets are “trading down” in terms of the U.S. beef cuts they are purchasing, customers in Taiwan are not as well-positioned to do that because of market-access limitations.
“We’re still restricted in Taiwan to boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age,” says Phil Seng, USMEF president and CEO. “If we’re able to expand our market access there, I feel we can reverse any further declines in that market by exporting a strong volume of short ribs and other bone-in beef cuts.”
Despite continued economic uncertainty in key markets, Seng reiterates USMEF’s commitment to recapturing U.S. beef market share and growing the reach of high-quality U.S. middle meats.
“Certainly it’s a tough marketing environment for beef right now, both globally and domestically,” he says. “But we currently have some high-end cuts to offer at very competitive prices, and USMEF is having notable success with those cuts in certain markets. We’re also encouraged to see the currencies of some of our key trading partners beginning to stabilize. That will also help make U.S. beef more affordable overseas.”

Not quite sure what “A Corporate Wife” is? Is “A Corporate Wife” a wife that works with her husband to make them both successful? If so, Juan, we old people used to call that a marriage.
dirtseller on August 29, 2012 at 10:45 AM
I used to respect Juan to a certain extent. Never again….the man is a despicable progressive PIG!

Great speech by Ann, she came off as a loving wife and mother. If anyone is a “corporate wife” it is Michelle. I’m sick of his nonsensical partisan agenda, now we see why he was dumped by NPR. Unfortunately, he is the weak link at Fox.
bhawknine on August 29, 2012 at 10:48 AM
Once again, a liberal shows that THEY are the racist, misogynist bigots.

Juan needs to apologize if he’s ever to be taken seriously again.
rbj on August 29, 2012 at 10:48 AM
Well, well. Seems like Williams has sunk to a new low. What’s wrong with a woman being married to a business man, staying home to raise children, and getting involved in life on a community level? Gee, I wonder if Moochelle has the same background? Oh, that’s right, she was hired at a staggering salary for a special job that disappeared when she left. Maybe Obama is a corporate husband then???
chai on August 29, 2012 at 10:48 AM
Wjat? Is it now a Sin according to Juan Williams for a woman to marry a Man that works in the private sector?
Isn’t Juan Williams wife a Corporate wife herself then?
Varchild on August 29, 2012 at 10:49 AM
Double facepalm, Juan. Bad show of liberal bile spewing. Jealous much? Ann has already been a first lady and you know shes going to be the next first lady of the US. I love it when liberal heads explode.
Philly on August 29, 2012 at 10:49 AM
I’m not trying to turn this into a Sarah Palin thread, I swear it, but I’d say Sarah also seemed to be having a lot of “obvious fun on stage” during her 2008 convention speech.
(And she wasn’t afraid to mention Teh One’s name, which seems to be an overriding fear of the politician speakers so far at this year’s convention.)
Right Mover on August 29, 2012 at 10:49 AM
I thought it was charming when she described their humble beginnings. Sure, he had an upper-middle-class (or higher) upbringing. But it sounds as if Romney’s parents and her parents required them to start at Square One.
Juan’s seething resentment is unbelievable. He’s become Obama II as far as my TV remote goes.
Is Juan so envious that he can’t see how much Romney has accomplished? And, something else, doesn’t Romney embody that expression to whom much is given, much is required? Romney has been extraordinarily blessed, but I don’t see where he’s squandered his blessings.
BuckeyeSam on August 29, 2012 at 10:50 AM
Like a bad case of indigestion, I used to tolerate Juan Williams–key words–“used to”. Done, and Fox should be too.

Now now, Juan, you wouldn’t be a bigoted racist, would you?

Juan Williams — Stereotype peddler and bigot.
Tell us, Juan, what would Ann have to do to not look like your stereotypical “corporate wife”?
farsighted on August 29, 2012 at 10:50 AM
Juan tried to play the class warfare card, but picked the worst terminology imaginable. And Megyn Kelly brilliantly lured him into a trap by asking him to define “corporate wife”. Juan’s response was just more fuel on the fire.
I like Juan(most of the time), but he stepped in it here. He needs to apologize and shut the hell up about Ann Romney for the rest of the campaign. This was Hilary Rosen territory he waded into.

I wonder how Juan refers to his wife?
d1carter on August 29, 2012 at 10:51 AM
Ignoring the obvious racist code for “undeserving rich white lady”, I can only figure Juanita missed the part in Ann’s speech about the desk on the sawhorses, the basement apartment and eating off a frickin’ ironing board.
If you CAN’T look like a halfway successful CORPORATE ANYTHING (like corporate suit wearing JUAN HIMSELF) by the time you’re in your late 50’s and mid-60’s, WHEN DO YOU?

Good ol’ Juan, looking at the most superficial aspects of a person’s appearance and drawing a judgement perfectly in line with his own prejudices. I though that liberals were the “thoughtful” set of society. They’re doing it wrong.
dkmonroe on August 29, 2012 at 10:52 AM
The left is totally bankrupt. Not only their ideas, but even their insults have become nonsensical and vapid.
Thomas More on August 29, 2012 at 10:53 AM
The successful format of “The Five” is to turn the usual table of network TV around, and have 4 conservative pundits ganging up on 1 lefty. They need those lefties around to continue to be foils.

Juan meant to say she looked like a “wealthy white woman so she should be ignored”. What a pathetic turd.
David in ATL on August 29, 2012 at 10:55 AM
Juan’s offensive comment only elevates Ann Romney’s speech even more. Ann connected with alot of women last night and this was a lame attempt by Juan Williams to push the fake war on women meme. Unfortunately for the left I think this disrespectful remark will backfire.
Ellis on August 29, 2012 at 10:55 AM
Here’s the core problem. Envy is a tough nut to crack, and the left knows it.
stldave on August 29, 2012 at 10:55 AM
I think it’s intentional rather than fear. The purpose is to look forward (to borrow the phrase) with good leadership. It’s a very good strategic move to elevate the urgency of this election to one of seriousness and convictions.
The onslaught of ads that will start any day now will certainly bring up his name, his record, his dereliction of duty and the need to shove his tush out of the Oval Office.
sherry on August 29, 2012 at 10:56 AM

Slightly O/T: I was on jury duty yesterday, and during jury selection each person was asked what movies and tv shows they watch. About 90% mentioned that they watch Fox News.

weaselyone on August 29, 2012 at 10:56 AM
Corporate wife? Is that a racist and misogynist dog whistle, Juan? I wont go there because it’s so desperate, immature and sleazy. But those are the rules the left has established.
RadClown on August 29, 2012 at 10:56 AM
George Romney died in the mid-90’s, long after Mitt had become a millionaire in his own right, using his father’s connections along the way. I believe a father should help his son and I don’t begrudge Mitt for using whatever connections he could. My point is that the claim that Mitt “donated his inheritance” is a bit hollow. While factually true, it’s a meaningless statement.
There is also a good chance Mitt’s father’s estate went to charity as part of an estate tax plan. If that’s the case, George Romney’s children were taken care in another way, likely well in advance.
I once heard Ross Perot say he wasn’t going to leave his children anything so they would have to make their own way in the world. At the moment he said it his son owned the Dallas Mavericks.
Stayright on August 29, 2012 at 10:57 AM

We can play this “looks like a” game all day. Juan Williams looks like a field hand. Michelle Obama looks like Aunt Jemima. Barack Obama looks like Dumbo.
How stupid can Juan Williams be? Has he been asleep for 50 years of the civil rights movement, whose singular message has been to see the person behind the surface appearance? Not judged by their appearance, but “by the content of their character”?
Paul-Cincy on August 29, 2012 at 10:57 AM
And presumably, the PI lawyers or the criminal defense counsel didn’t have nearly enough peremptory challenges to get rid of them all. I wonder whether they tried to argue for dismissal based on cause.
BuckeyeSam on August 29, 2012 at 10:59 AM
Hey Juan! I’ll take a million CORPORATE WIVES over your pathetic ideology of government welfare and the perpetual ineptness of fiscal responsibility.
Because of this “rudderless” administration, (no economic growth, record deficits, and the inability to even produce or pass a budget), President Obama will have plenty of time next year to fill out his basketball bracket, and improve on his golfing skills. And a grateful nation will thank him for his service as a “one-term proposition”.

Can’t say I’ve ever agreed with much Juan Williams had to say but I used to respect him. In the last couple of months he has become a shrill moron without credibility. Whenever I am watching something on TV and Williams comes on I either mute him or change the channel.

I heard an implied “boy” several times in her speech.
Dr. Carlo Lombardi on August 29, 2012 at 11:07 AM
A pathetic attempt to marginalize Ann. She gave a very resonate, effective speech. They were afraid of that. She delivered, so they now must destroy the image she created as a wonderful, caring, wife & mother. She also effectively told Mitt’s story. And the line about Mitt not wanting to talk about how much he does for others b/c it is a privilege not a political talking point was brilliant!!
Juan was channeling the fear the left now has about Ann Romney.

When Juan Williams was first “canned” by NPR and FOX picked him up, he expressed how grateful he was that it was his “conservative” friends that stood by him. How quickly people forget.

Romney = BAD!, obambi = “wets his pants”
Thats about it for these morons.

KOOLAID2 on August 29, 2012 at 11:10 AM
That was hands-down the best speech ever given
By a candidates spouse. And just like MSNBC, Juan is terrified of he world seeing that we have wonderful women, like Ann and Mia Love, and men like Artur Davis devoted to republican principles.
Rusty Allen on August 29, 2012 at 11:10 AM
If someone said the same thing about Michelle Obama they would be called racist. I usually respect Juan’s opinion but what a stupid remark. He should remember that when the NPR issues went down the Right were the only ones that had his back.
jrfromdallas on August 29, 2012 at 11:10 AM
Juan really stepped in it.
I have seen Ann many times and I think I’ve seen her better. But apparently for those who haven’t seen her much she made a huge impression.
So I think it only gets better for her from here.
The Romney’s get better with time. The exact opposite of the Obama’s. I cringe when Michelle speaks now, I used to be okay with her.

Referring to them as “morons” is being much too kind, my friend.

Whenever Juan comes on, I hit the remote. Dish soap commercials on another channel are more interesting.
tnarch on August 29, 2012 at 11:12 AM
OK Juan, so you’re a hack and a tool.
Your mother must be so proud.
Kenosha Kid on August 29, 2012 at 11:12 AM
How should she have dressed, Juan? In a vagina outfit? In a baggy denim dress with hairy legs and Birkenstockers?
I do think her speech would have been better without the girl power stuff because it feeds into tiresome gender wars but other than that it was superb.
Buy Danish on August 29, 2012 at 11:13 AM
To Williams, “corporate wife” = Miss Daisy.
TXUS on August 29, 2012 at 11:13 AM
Juan slipped into his BET mode.He knew it was a knockout speech but couldn’t resist his little degrade comment.
docflash on August 29, 2012 at 11:13 AM
The point is always something nonsensical…
If wealthy parents use their money, influence, and connections to help their own children, that’s bad.
However, if wealthy people use their money, influence, and connections to help the children of complete strangers, that’s good.
That more or less randomly picked children of strangers are more worthy of the help wealthy people can provide than their own children actually makes sense to some people.
Of course, the real point of this line of socialist “reasoning” is that personal “wealth” is unfairly distributed and a symptom of socially injustice, and that using it for the benefit of friends and family is even more socially unjust.
farsighted on August 29, 2012 at 11:14 AM
Juan senses that Dear Leader is in trouble. He seemed to blurt this out almost in retaliation. Take a deep breath Juan, it is going to be a rough ride for you through November.
d1carter on August 29, 2012 at 11:14 AM
Juan Williams is just one of many many black American racists. He tries not to show his hatred of whites, but it consumes him so that he cannot. Probably went to Rev. Wright’s School of Pure Hatred…
Karmi on August 29, 2012 at 11:14 AM
What resonates most from Williams’ comment is that it’s obvious he decided that this would be his takeaway from her speech before she even began to deliver it.
Nothing she could have said would have swayed him from his preconceived notion about this rich white woman.
Right Mover on August 29, 2012 at 11:15 AM
He and the fat man on The Five are why I watch less Fox News. I don’t need balance.

An Interview with Bookseller Morris Venables
For almost a quarter of a century one of the highlights of the stained glass
calendar has been the annual publication of Morris Venables’ sales list: Books on Stained Glass. Often including over six hundred items, each list has been a treasure house of antiquarian rarities, hard-to-find titles, offprints from obscure journals and new publications from around the world. Inevitably, however all good things come to an end and earlier this year Morris and his wife Juliet, announced that the 2010/2011 list would be their last. As a tribute to their contribution to stained glass studies, Roger Rosewell, Vidimus News Editor, visited Morris in his Bristol home.
Morris Venables is warm, funny and knowledgeable. He works from a converted stable with shelves bumping the ceilings and precariously balanced stacks of books reaching almost as high. But despite what to my eye seems like disorder bordering on chaos, he knows exactly where to look for any book he wants [Fig.1].
“I started cataloguing books about stained glass in 1988. In the early ’90s my brother-in-law, George Wigley, the well-known collector and dealer in medieval glass, gave my name to the late William Cole (1909–1997), an expert on sixteenth-century Netherlandish roundels and the author of an important volume about them for the British CVMA. William’s surplus books provided me with the first large quantity of stained glass books to come my way. Fortunately other collections followed.
I published my first dedicated list about stained glass in 1988. It had 159 items for sale. Since then I’ve produced a list every year with the exception of 2007. My latest list has nearly 700 entries. Since 1989 the cover design has featured King Ezechias from the fifteenth-century Tree of Jesse window at the parish church of St Dyfnog at Llanrhaeadr, (Denbighshire) [Fig. 2].
As the business grew I became increasingly interested in the subject. I used to take a selection of my books to the annual conferences of the British Society of Master Glass Painters and sometimes to those of Stained Glass Museum. I also set my stall up at the Corpus Vitrearum Conference when the International Colloquium was held in Bristol in 2000. I listened to lectures, joined trips to churches and met an ever-widening circle of artists, historians, conservators and collectors.
What I didn’t know, I was forced to learn as customers asked me for books I had never heard of. Many used me as a resource on the phone – ringing to ask if I knew if there were books or articles about particular aspects of stained glass. At times I felt like one of the family. I cannot say that I am an expert on stained glass, but after twenty-five years in the business I think I know a fair amount about books on stained glass! Discovering new fields of interest are part of the joys of being a professional bookseller.
I was born in north London. At the beginning of the war our family was on holiday in north Wales and my parents, apprehensive of the probable dangers of living in the capital, decided that my mother, sister and I should stay in Wales while my father returned to his job in Southgate. After a year of this arrangement the whole family returned to Enfield. The following morning I woke up under the dining room table. It was the first raid of the blitz. In May 1941 we moved to Evesham.
I fell in love with books in my late teens after finding a second-hand shop in the town tucked away down a dark passage. The woman who owned the shop was, in those days, a strange creature. She wore layer after layer of dresses, jumpers and cloaks and smoked so much I was convinced her hair was stained with nicotine. But I didn’t care about her appearance or the smell. I remember sitting on the floor of her shop for the afternoon fascinated by one book in particular, John Earle’s Miscrocosmographie, issued by Cambridge University Press. It was the first book I’d seen that was wonderfully attractive not only in its content but also in its presentation.
After leaving school I spent eighteen months national service in the navy before going up to Oxford University to read English at Pembroke College. Thereafter most of my working life was spent as a specialist English tutor in teacher training colleges. I was a principal lecturer in English and Academic Registrar at Redland College in Bristol, before it was merged with Bristol Polytechnic, which is now the University of the West of England.
I started selling books in 1969. At this stage, and for a further 13 years, it was a hobby and an agreeably convenient of raising a little extra cash, but I was still teaching full-time. I dealt largely in English literature, especially poetry. I produced my first list of books for sale in 1970, and from 1973 onwards exhibited at Provincial Booksellers Fairs Association fairs during vacations and at occasional weekends. The contacts made in this way, and through further lists, proved very useful when I started to specialise in selling books on stained glass. Other dealers would ring me up if they bought interesting titles and sometimes people tipped me off when they saw rare books for sale.
Bookselling is a patient profession. Sometimes sales can be slack; on other occasions it can take days to fulfil a large order, ensuring that the books are packed properly and unlikely to be damaged in transit. I have duplicates of many items – one can never tell what demand will be like. Some years I might not sell a single copy of a particular book, the next year I have received half a dozen orders for it in the same number of weeks. On one occasion I bought a large number of copies of a splendid book about the early sixteenth-century windows of a particular church. This helped to ensure its publication after a previous commitment to purchase had collapsed and put the whole project in jeopardy. It seemed risky, but I’m glad I did it. The book was a success and I sold all of the copies I had bought. Encouraged by such experience, I started to think about publishing my own reprints of some important out-of-print titles.
My first venture, in 1999, was a reprint of Christopher Whall’s much sought after 1924 book Stained Glass Work. The idea came from Peter Cormack, the art historian and expert on Arts & Crafts glass. He wanted to produce a new edition to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Whall’s birth. He contributed a superb introductory essay about Whall and I added fourteen colour plates to update its appeal [Fig. 3].
Then, in 2000, I produced a single volume reprint of two works: Dr A. M. Gessert’s Rudimentary Treatise on the Art of Painting on Glass or Glass Staining and Emanuel Fromberg’s essay on the Art of Painting on Glass. In 2001, came Marta Galicki’s commendable booklet on Victorian and Edwardian Stained Glass: the work of five London studios 1855 – 1910, which had originally been published by English Heritage to complement an exhibition of the same title at the RIBA Heinz gallery in 1987.
Our most ambitious project followed in 2002. A title I always hoped to find was Nathaniel Westlake’s four volume masterpiece A History of Design in Painted Glass originally published by James Parker & Co between 1881 and 1894. But whenever I found a copy I was nearly always disappointed. The bindings were often in poor condition. Now, with the help of a grant from the Glaziers Trust, the charitable arm of the Glaziers Company, I was able to reprint a limited edition of 150 copies of these books in a smaller two volume format, properly bound and at an affordable price. 2003 saw the production of Stained Glass Windows and Master Glass Painters, all nine issues of the directories issued by the B.S.M.G.P in one volume. Finally, in 2004, we published two books by Tom Honey, Stained Glass Windows of Gordon Webster, and Sadie McLellan, Artist in Glass.
Although I enjoy handling early books like J.G. Joyce’s elephant size folio monograph on the Fairford windows (1872), William Warrington’s History of Stained Glass (1848), Haudiquer de Blancourt’s The Art of Glass (1699) and Henry Holiday’s Reminiscences of my Life, I do not have a favourite title. I am always astounded by the hard work, dedication and scholarship which informs the British CVMA volumes. Other books I remember fondly because I knew and liked the authors: the late Hilary Wayment (1912 -2005) instantly springs to mind, a man whose smile could light up any room. Sadly many otherwise excellent older books suffer from what can best be called gloopy pictures, indistinct black and white plates which are pretty much next to useless. This was not the fault of the photographers. Over the years I have seen many excellent monochrome images of stained glass where every brushstroke is discernible. But reproducing those images at affordable prices seems to have been beyond most printers. The contrast between some of these old books and the best of the new publications is staggering. I have recently sold my last set of the five volumes of the stained glass in the canton of Aaugau produced by the Swiss CVMA: Glasmalerei im Kanton Aargau (2002). The colour plates were wonderful. It was a pleasure to turn the pages.
What now? Juliet and I are slowing down. I stumbled into stained glass through my wife and my brother-in-law. It has been a lovely and memorable experience. But although we will no longer produce annual lists we are still open for business!

Name That Roundel Solution
This month’s puzzle shows a story from the early life of Joseph (Old Testament, Book of Genesis, Chapter 37).
Joseph was the eleventh son of Jacob and Rachael. He was also his father’s favourite. After his father gave him a ‘coat of many colours’, his brother’s became resentful as this preferential treatment. Their envy grew when he told them about his dreams: in the first, the brothers were binding sheaves of wheat in a field when his stood upright and the other sheaves bowed and made obeisance to him; in the second, the sun and moon and eleven stars also bowed down and made obeisance to him. When he told his family about his dreams, his father rebuked him for suggesting that they bow down to him.
After his brothers left to tend their father’s flock in Shechem, Joseph was sent to join them. A ‘a certain man’ found him wandering in a field and told him how to find them. When Joseph’s brothers saw him approaching they initially decided to kill him until Reuben suggested that they cast him into a pit alive. When he reached his brothers, they seized him, stripped him of his precious coat and lowered him into a pit without water.
As they sat around afterwards, they saw a party of Ishmaelite merchants carrying spices to Egypt. One of the brothers suggested selling Joseph to them. The others agreed and Joseph was sold into slavery for twenty pieces of silver. Thereafter the brothers retrieved his coat, dipped it in the blood of a young goat and carried it back to their distraught father who assumed that his son had been devoured by an evil beast.
The roundel shows Joseph asleep with his dreams depicted in the roundels above ( the sheaves are particularly visible); Joseph telling his father about the dreams while his brothers listen; the man telling Joseph where to find his brothers; and his brothers lowering Joseph into the pit and staining his coat with blood.
Joseph’s story was seen as a metaphor for the just and the unjust, the story of a righteous man protected by God. The subject was often shown in roundels of this period. The design of this month’s roundel seems to be based on an earlier design by the Flemish artist, Hugo van der Goes.

- Briefly describe a specific question, or set of related questions, about a health care test or treatment that this program should consider.
- For Rehab patients, what is the comparative effectiveness of a coordinated primary health care team following the patient with the usual care of hospitalization to home health>
- Does your question include a comparison of different health care approaches? (If no, your topic will still be considered.)
- yes
- If yes, explain the specific technologies, devices, drugs, or interventions you would like to see compared:
- I would like to compare a team consisting of a primary care physician, nurse practitioner and social work (continuum of care team) that follows the patient through an episode of care that involves rehab with the typical method used today of hospitalization transferred to rehab and transferred to home with home health.
- What patients or group(s) of patients does your question apply to? (Please include specific details such as age range, gender, coexisting diagnoses, and indications for therapy.)
- Although this study does apply to patients that are younger that 65, I would like a special focus on those 65 and older with a hip or knee surgery.
- Are there subgroups of patients that your question might apply to? (For example, an ethnic group, stage or severity of a disease.)
- We could have two subgroups - younger than 65 and 65 and older. I would also cohort the hips and knees.
The control group would be the ones receiving the continuum of care service.
- Describe the health-related benefits you are interested in. (For example, improvements in patient symptoms or problems from treatment or diagnosis.)
- Re-admissions and/or visits to the ED would be diminished therefore saving money.
We would also like to see if rehab is completed faster since there would be not delay in service and a stronger support system.
- Describe any health-related risks, side effects, or harms that you are concerned about.
- The main concern would be that the "team" would follow-up in the home, most likely one at a time, however, the patient would have to agreed to be followed like this. So far, our experience with this model has been good.
- Functional limitations and disability
- AHRQ Priority Populations
- Elderly
- Individuals with special health care needs, including individuals with disabilities or who need chronic care or end-of-life health care
- Federal Health Care Program
- Medicare
Importance
- Describe why this topic is important.
- The care received by patients lacks continuity across the continuum. We are able to fill this gap however, it needs further research.
- have a Continuum of Care team that provides this level of support with great success but have found funding to be limited. We would like an opportunity to prove that our outcomes are substantial. We also need more data about patients who do not receive this type of care to make the comparison truly effective.
- Does your question represent uncertainty for clinicians and/or policy-makers? (For example, variations in clinical care, controversy in what constitutes appropriate clinical care, or a policy decision.)
- no
- If yes, please explain:
- I don't think so because the aim to to design a model that moves the patient back to their home with little or no health care problems for their rehab episode.
Potential Impact
- How will an answer to your research question be used or help inform decisions for you or your group?
- We hope to be able to design a model that is sustainable and replicatable in most areas. The reason I say "most" is because we are in a high volume city, so we do have staff to support the model.
- Describe the timeframe in which an answer to your question is needed.
- We would like an answer by the end of the year however, funding will govern our abilities to do so.
- Describe any health disparities, inequities, or impact on vulnerable populations your question applies to.
- Based on our experience, the frail, vulnerable elderly are frequently unable to follow directions and ask for clarification due to the feeling of medicine being the authority. With support and having an extra set of eyes and ears, advocating for this type of patient, we can help them navigate the healthcare system with good results.

- I receive AHRQ emailsI've written in the past a little bit about my home made wines, but I realized that I've never written up a tutorial, and since I have a friend who is embarking on her own journey of grapes and fermentation, I figured it was about time.
- and no, my process does not involve feet and stomping. Sorry to disappoint you.
(If you make wine yourself and have any tips you'd like to share, I'd love to hear them!)
Let's break out the brew, shall we?
First of all, you need your grapes/fruit/juice. For purposes of this tutorial I'm going to stick with my personal recipe for Concord Grape wine, but a lot of the steps are the same for any other brew. I've made Apple, Rhubarb, and even Lilac wines, and there's nothing really that's much different except for perhaps the ingredients needed. Also, my amounts are enough to make 5 gallons of wine, so make sure your bucket has that capacity if you're using my exact recipe.
Get a nice sturdy mesh laundry bag, and fill it with enough plucked/washed grapes to almost fill your primary fermenter. This should be approximately 30 pounds.
Did I mention what a primary fermenter was? Whoops, sorry! This is what mine looks like, which I purchased several years ago from E. C. Kraus. I really like their website for their fast and free shipping.
Notice that my handy-dandy little 6 gallon bucket has a spigot on the bottom and an opening on top for the air release valve. Sometimes if you purchase a kit, yours might come with a plain bucket (still called the primary fermenter) and a pretty glass carboy called a secondary fermenter. I like mine because it functions as both primary and secondary fermenters (which equals less storage space used up, which equals more room for more wine, hee hee!).
Into your empty primary fermenter, dump 16 1/4 cups of sugar.
Let me assure you that the sugar is necessary, not for sweetening the wine, but for giving the yeast something with which to party. Sugar is an essential component in the process of alcoholic fermentation, in which yeast metabolizes sugar into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. Basically that's a nice way of stating that the yeast eats the sugar, and then (ahem) poops out the alcohol and carbon dioxide.
I'll give you a moment for the shock to wear off.
Shall we continue?
Next add 2 1/2 teaspoons of pectic enzyme. Please note that this must be kept refrigerated, so as soon as you purchase this stuff, put it in the refrigerator right away, or your purchase will be useless. You probably won't need the whole bottle, but it stores for a long time anyway, so hang on to it.
Then you'll need 5 Campden tablets. Just take out the necessary amount and chuck 'em into the primary with careless and wild abandon.
At this point you will also add 5 teaspoons of yeast nutrient, for which I embarrasingly forgot to take a photo, so I'm just stealing a stock photo from E. C. Kraus.
Okay, so now that you have your sugar, pectic enzyme, campden tablets, and yeast nutrient in the primary, add about a gallon of water and stir it all up. Get your hips moving as you stir to make this more exciting. Something along the lines of the Nessun Dorma might help. My wine prefers opera, but yours might be less discerning, so I might suggest the Beegees.
Place your laundry bag of grapes into the primary, and then fill the bucket to about two inches from the top with water. Cover with your handy-dandy lid, and let it sit for a day.
(A day passes).
Good morning! Here we are again with our friend Wine-to-Be. Wine-to-Be is lonely and needs a friend named Yeast.
Remember what I said earlier about the sugar partying with the yeast? Keep that in mind when you choose your yeasts. If you were on vacation and had a basement full of alcohol (in this case, the sugar), who would you rather have over to your house, the football squad yeast or the chess team yeast?
I thought so.
Add your yeast (just one package of wine yeast is enough for 5 gallons), mix it in well with the sugar/water solution, and give the bag of grapes a mighty and affectionate squeeze. Place the entire primary into a black plastic trash bag, and stand back until the next morning.
(If you rather unwisely chose to ignore my warnings about Football Squad Yeast, you had better make VERY sure your primary is in a good plastic trash bag, because no matter how tightly your lid is screwed on, the party going on in the primary will seep out all. over. the. place. for. several. days.)
Again mix the sugar/water solution and squeeze the grapes. Don't worry, grapes are gregarious fruits and don't mind close contact.
Keep up the mixing and squeezing for 5 -6 days. At this point, your huge bag of grapes should have shrunken to about the size of a basketball, since the juices have been extracted. If your grapes still have a lot of juice in them, you have a few options. Option 1: lift weights so that you don't have puny biceps or Option 2: just keep squeezing every day until they're completely smooshed. Yes, that's a real word. Trust me.
(Said with smug look) Handyman does the smooshing for me, so it only takes a few days. What can I say, he's Handy!
Once the grapes are completely smooshed, remove the bag and fill the primary the rest of the way with water so that you have a nearly full 5 gallon bucket. Firmly place the lid back on, and double check that your air lock valve is correctly placed. Put your primary into a nice dark location (not too cold because yeast isn't happy if it's too cold) and let it sit for about two months.
(If you have little kids as I do, hide the air lock under something, or they'll be tempted to pull off the air lock valve, reducing your wonderful Wine-to Be into Vinegar-of-Tears).
In two months, siphon the wine into a clean container. (I use my stock or soup pots). On the bottom of your primary will be lots of crusty purple stuff. This is dead yeast, which is not so yummy to drink. Clean all that stuff out of the primary, hold a short funeral, and pour your wine back into the primary. Cover and let it sit for another two months.
Continue doing this two-month stage of siphoning, cleaning, and pouring back into the primary until the wine is nice and clear, and there's no more dead yeast on the bottom of the primary. This can take up to 7 months, depending on your yeast and the sweetness of the grapes. Don't be impatient, because if you bottle your wine too soon, you'll have active yeast in the bottles, which will create mini explosions when you open the wine and dead yeast floating on the bottom. This is not appealing.
Again, the time it takes for the wine to "clear" really depends on the personality of the yeast and grapes along with the temperature of the room the wine is stored in. My wine prefers opera, so it's in no hurry to finish up. Warmer temps make the yeast more active, making the yeast eat the sugar faster, which means that the sugar is eaten up faster, which means that the yeast will soon starve to death and die at the bottom of the primary, leading to the clearing process going faster.
Once your wine is clear, it's time to bottle!
(You will have to wait in horrible suspense to learn what comes next! Meanwhile, grab a bottle of your favorite wine to console you. Then you'll feel much better about life and less impatient in general.)

Great, informative post, Rach. You must have the patience of a saint to go through all that waiting time. Someday, you and Andy will have your own vineyard!! :) I wish I liked drinking wine. This post makes me want some right now...I know I need a few glasses!
Yay! Thanks so much for this. I am nervous about starting it, but your post helped me so much.
Nice tutorial...made me laugh, too.Never let your friends find out you're mechanically inclined - they'll show up on your doorstep with sick Rovers. Having had this take place with an 88 that was bereft of usable bushings (but with an owner who had 2 sets of Polybushes - one for me, as I don't work cheap), I undertook to replace the bushings on this otherwise beautiful Series IIA. I did want to make t his an easy job, so I decided a bit of thought and toolmaking needed to go into this process before I started in with the hammer and hacksaw. A mechanical contrivance to remove and insert the bushings seemed in order here. To this end, I came up with a tool modeled on the concept of tools sold in the U.K. L-R magazines for inserting and removing bushings. It took me about 20 minutes to make, and was cheap - a junkyard jack and $3 worth of hardware-store items. The first item on the list is a junkyard scissor jack. Just about any one will do, with 2 caveats:
The second item on the shopping list is a piece of heavy-wall 1-1/4" iron pipe, about 5" long, preferably unthreaded. To assemble: Using a grinder or other suitable tool, disconnect the screw and its nut and thrust plate from the jack assembly. Once completed, this should leave you with a jack screw with a thrust bar on the working end, and a loose nut bar from the other end of the jack. Remove the nut bar from the jack screw - this is going to have to come on and off to be useful for us. Now, we need to modify the pipe to hold the thrust plate. When I removed the screw from the donor jack, the thrust plate on the screw was left with two round (for lack of a better word) tenons projecting from the sides. These, when the edges of the thrust plate were beveled on the grinder, matched up nicely with the sides of the heavy-wall pipe. To seat the tenons I drilled a matching-size hole through both sides of the pipe at a right angle, then opened up the holes to form U-channels to accept the tenons. Insert the jack screw into the pipe, engaging the tenons into the U-channels, and you're ready to go. To use, insert the screw through the ailing bushing, and put the new bushing on the other end of the screw from the pipe side. Thread on the nut removed from the jack, and crank the screw, either with the old jack handle or a hefty ratchet (I wimped and used my air impact wrench). The old bushing slides out of the spring and the new one in slicker than goose grease on a hot day. I wasn't able to try this on a chassis bushing, as my project 88 is not to that point. I was able to install 2 new bushings in one of the 88's replacement rear springs in less than 10 minutes using this method, however. Slick and cheap - I like it! If you just want to pull a bushing (for welding or whatever), you can do it with no damage by using a thrust collar. I used a 1/2" to 3/8" iron pipe reducer coupling and a length of pipe as a spacer - worked fine, once I ground the OD of the reducer down a bit to fit.
In conclusion, considering the amount of grief inherent in removing and replacing bushings, a bit of time and effort spent on a tool like this can pay off in a big way in reduced effort and frustration. Working on the old beasts should be an enjoyable pastime - put in a little advance effort and make sure it stays that way.Gatlinburg's River Raft Regatta

The deciduous shrub, oakleaf hydrangea, Hydrangea quercifolia, which is native to the southeastern United States, has long been one of my favorites. But upon moving to my husband's family farm in Missouri thirteen years ago, I discovered to my dismay that oakleaf hydrangeas did not thrive on the windy hillock we call home. And so each year I missed seeing their brilliant lantern-like panicles growing in the shady corners of my yard.
Still I attempted to grow them on several occasions. They all died brutal deaths in the icy winds which buffet our abode each winter. Nevertheless, I was determined...
During our landscaping endeavors we created a microclimate on the southeast side of our yard by designing a garden wall made of privacy fence. It was there that I planted yet another oakleaf hydrangea. I hoped the oakleaf would be protected from old man winter's ravaging breath beneath the boughs of a tall bald cypress nearby.
Surprisingly enough our enthusiastic hydrangea survived the winter. I cannot express my consummate relief at seeing those verdant green leaves sprout the following spring. But time would prove there were no blooms upon my hydrangea. The leaves were large and vivacious with life, but it would not bloom. Alas I discovered one day whilst gazing upon my long dreamt of hydrangea that the flower buds had been damaged by Missouri's mulishly cold winter. There was hope, for my oakleaf had been large when I planted it. And I knew in climates akin to northwest Missouri's where the winter temperatures regularly fall below -10 F if your oakleaf successfully reaches a large size then it is more likely to thrive. Even if one does not bloom annually there is pleasure to be derived by simply admiring its multifarious foliage each season.
Here are a few suggestions for growing the oakleaf hydrangea in northwest Missouri or similar zones. Locate a semi-shady site along the southeast or east side of your home. Considering the fact that oakleafs prefer well-drained soul amend your soil if desired. I did not amend mine. Instead I planted in a slightly raised bed for enhanced drainage. Once your oakleaf is happily planted mulch it to help retain moisture at its base. You may fertilize your hydrangea if you like. Mine has not yet required fertilizer.
In the fall as you enjoy the vibrant hues of your oakleaf hydrangea add a thick layer of mulch for winter protection. Check your oakleaf periodically throughout the cold season and apply additional mulch if you feel it is necessary. In the spring you should notice the first sign of grayish-green leaves as the hydrangea wakes from its winter rest. Do not fret if there are no leaves in March, even April. Oakleaf hydrangeas like to wait until the weather is truly warm before they show you their beauty.
If your oakleaf hydrangea survives the coming winters to reach a mature size, it is much more likely to continue to survive and bloom as well. My oakleaf hydrangea, I am thankful to say, has grown into a happy and well-adjusted shrub upon the windy hillock we call home.
~Good gardening~
Oakleaf Hydrangea FactsIt is a broad, rounded deciduous shrub of unique beauty up to 6' tall. I have seen them taller. The leaves are similar to the leaves of the Red Oak tree. The bark is attractive. White panicles open to 12" clusters of creamy flowers in early to late summer in the Midwest, sooner in the south. The flowers slowly age to blushing pink then by fall a delicate brown. The aged flowers make nice dried arrangements.The leaf color ranges from orange to red and even burgundy in Autumn. Oakleaf Hydrangeas prefer rich, well drained soil. But they will wilt readily when thirsty.Oakleaf Hydrangeas perform best in shady areas. Oakleaf Hydrangeas spread by stoloniferous roots, (sucker roots). But it is not invasive.Propagate Oakleaf Hydrangea by seed, woodcuttings or root ball division.
USDA Hardiness Zones of Oakleaf Hydrangea
Oakleaf Hydrangea is hardy in zones 6a-9b
'Snow Queen' is a variety which is hardy to zone 5 and can be grown in the sun.
Note: oakleaf hydrangeas look particularly well under planted with shade loving perennials. Try the spotted deadnettle, Lamium 'Beacon Silver' with its pretty pink flowers or perhaps lily-of-the-valley. The possibilities are endless. You determine the ultimate beautiful end.
As always each garden is filled with variables. Trial and error is the best method in determining that which you can achieve.

First-year U of T engineering students were dispatched to figure out ways to make cycling safer – and improvements included physically separated lanes and waiting areas.

RICHARD CLEMENT / REUTERS
A cyclist waits in a bike box for the light to change in Portland, Oregon. University of Toronto engineering students proposed a similar idea for their study area on Bloor St.
While city hall looks at expanding the bike lane network, University of Toronto engineering students say installing bike boxes — a marked-off area at the front of an intersection — along with bike lanes would ensure greater safety.
As part of a first-year engineering science course, students were dispatched to find problems around the city and figure out solutions, ranging from preventing jaywalking to harnessing wind power. Cycling safety was identified as a key issue on many streets, but the class studied a stretch of Bloor St. between Yonge and Bathurst Sts.
Opal Densmore and teammates Nadine Soliman and Reem Helou decided the best way to protect cyclists was to eliminate parking on both sides of the street and install bike lanes, clearly marked in blue.
In addition, they want to install “bike boxes” at the forefront of intersections. An area marked off for bikes, forcing motorists to wait a little farther back, provides a place where cyclists can wait safely for the light to turn green and get a head start on the cars when it does — a move the students say would reduce bike-car collisions.
“We thought there had to be a sacrifice,” said Densmore, adding that the team believed, after conducting a survey, that eliminating street parking would not really have a huge impact on local businesses. Many shoppers in the area arrive by foot or transit. “With parking on Bloor, cyclists have to go out of the lane to avoid parked cars, raising the risk of getting doored.”
At intersections where there are signalized priority left-turns, cyclists waiting in the bike box would get a head start before cars. To prevent collisions between cyclists and cars turning right, the students would ban right turns at red lights.
The physical separation also helps motorists see where the cyclists are, Densmore added.
Another team — Ahil Ganesh, Jonathan Harris and Mark Sutherland — also recommended removing the parking on Bloor, arguing there are already parking lots available off the main street.
“There is no separation for cyclists, motorists and pedestrians on Bloor,” said Harris. “We saw a lot of cyclists riding on the sidewalk, and parking lanes forced cyclists to go into traffic.”
Their plan calls for reflective plastic posts with flow lights to mark off the bike lanes.
Ganesh said he hopes the focus on safety will have a side benefit. “The safety measures are designed to prevent accidents,” he said. “That shows we are respecting the cyclists, so they should obey the law.”.Web Design Leeds, Graphic Design Leeds, Advertising Leeds & Marketing services in Leeds

About Mongolia
Before 1991 Mongolia was a satellite republic of the former Soviet Union and as such its population fared well. It had a comprehensive welfare system which provided free education, healthcare, housing, job security and welfare benefits for women and children. However after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 Mongolia shifted to a free market economy and became a democracy. The withdrawal of large Soviet subsidies resulted in the collapse of the welfare system and increased hardship. One-third of Mongolian children live in poverty, exacerbated by the country’s harsh winters.
Mongolia has a population of 2.5 million people. Half live in the countryside, as rural nomads and the rest are concentrated in Ulaanbaatar. The wealthy and middle class residents live in apartment buildings in downtown Ulaanbaatar. The rest, almost 300,000, live in sprawling shantytowns known as the "Ger districts", named after Mongolia's traditional round felt tent. These shantytowns are a maze of tents and shacks which do not have central heating, running water or basic hygiene facilities. Hygiene standards in Ger districts are very low due to the lack of running water and pollution.

BACKGROUND
With the rise of automotive entertainment and Telematics systems, U.S. roads and highways are increasingly filled with vehicles that feature in-vehicle systems operated by voice commands.
These voice command systems were created as an alternative to visual manual controls; thus, one of the countermeasures that address driver distraction. Voice controls are intended to help reduce the workload on the driver when performing tasks such as operating a radio, using a media player, making/receiving phones calls or searching for a destination.
But like all driver interfaces, voice interfaces must be well designed so that they help reduce the workload on the driver rather than increasing it. Because the demand may be not be adequately measured by traditional metrics such as lane deviations, there is a need to explore and analyze the physiological effects and workload demand of a voice command system on driver performance.
Toyota’s CSRC and the MIT AgeLab have partnered to study these workload demands and work toward developing tools to assess the development of production voice interface systems.
PROJECT OUTLINE
The CSRC and MIT AgeLab will research the safety impact of in-vehicle voice command technology, exploring numerous factors such as comparisons between driver workload when performing tasks manually and when utilizing a voice command system.
The study will track physiological-based measurements, such as heart rate data, to assess the workload factor on the driver while comparing various production interface systems to analyze how their differences can achieve varying results in reducing workload on the driver.
The study will comprise of 100+ participants, approximately half of whom will be trained on the operation of the voice interface, and the other half, which will not have any training. Both groups will perform tasks with visual-manual controls, and then with the voice interface system.
The study will also utilize both a fixed based driving simulator to collect physiological effects as well as an on-road driving experience to collect driving performance data.
The project will potentially contribute to NHTSA’s ongoing work to develop guidelines for voice interfaces, supporting and informing their studies with NHTSA’s goal of establishing voluntary industry guidelines by 2014.
TIMELINE
This two-year project will compare users trained versus those not trained on voice interface systems. --- Comment #14 from Dmitry Timoshkov <dmitry at codeweavers.com> 2011-01-27 03:12:12 CST --- (In reply to comment #13) > Okay then... the Debug-Flags you told me to use now created an 18 MB log of a > hanging attempt.

Science Museum's Hands-on
Exhibits Let Visitors See Dinos,
Reach for the Stars
by Kelly Melhart
From the Editor: The following article appeared in the June 22, 1997, edition of the Fort Worth Star Telegram. It gives families one more idea about things to do in the Dallas/Fort Worth area before or after the convention this summer. The article is reprinted by courtesy of the Fort Worth Star Telegram
At the edge of the Cultural District a dinosaur has taken up residence at 1501 Montgomery Street, an Acrocanthosaurus to be exact, a meat-eating dinosaur cousin to the Tyrannosaurus Rex. The fourteen-foot-tall, 40-foot-long dinosaur is part of the DinoDig exhibit at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, one of eight permanent exhibits. The outdoor discovery area allows children and adults to get their hands dirty while they dig for imitation dinosaur bones.
Missy Matthews, marketing coordinator for the museum, said all the exhibits are interactive and aid the learning process. "Studies have shown that that's the way people learn," she said. "When they can discover things for themselves, it is a much more meaningful experience than reading a label."
Other hands-on exhibits include KIDSPACE; Hands on Science;
History of Medicine; Your Body; IBM Calculators and Computers;
Rocks and Fossils; and People and Their Possessions, which includes the demonstration and discovery area, Hands on History. The museum combines the mysteries of the past with the technologies of the future to create a learning environment for children and adults, Matthews said.
"We are science and history," she said. "We are an educational institution, and so our overall criterion that the films and exhibits have to meet is to educate. "
The museum is also home to a 390-seat Omni Theater, the Museum School, the Noble Planetarium, the Museum Store, and the Courtyard Cafe.
The Omni shows educational films in a state-of-the-art theater that houses an eighty-foot domed screen and a seventy-two-speaker sound system. The science and nature films are shown for a limited time, but the short footage that gives a stomach-dropping helicopter's-eye view of Fort Worth precedes every show.
The Museum School on the lower level of the museum offers instruction for children from preschool through the sixth grade. Kit Goolsby, the museum's director of education, said the fifty-six-year-old school has such a reputation that parents stand in line every fall and spring to register their children in the unusual program.
"It is truly unique because it is based on the collections in the museum," she said. "The hands-on introduction to natural science, physical science, and history isn't possible anywhere else where you don't have the collections to support the curriculum."
The museum is open seven days a week. Admission to the exhibits is $5 for adults and $4 for children ages three to twelve and seniors. An exhibit pass is good throughout the month in which it is purchased. The exhibit pass does not include admission to the Omni or the planetarium, but discounts are offered for admission to all three.
The Omni Theater is also open seven days a week, and admission is $6 for adults and $3 for children and seniors. The Noble Planetarium offers shows Wednesday through Sunday. Cost is $3. Museum parking is free and is located in the Cultural District parking area on the west side of the Will Rogers Memorial Center.Re: welcome and where do you live? FW: [OutlandsDance] Hello Everyone.

While it’s generally easy for you to change the default opening home page on a Web browser, there are two things working against you here: First, there are also a lot of programs that seem to sneakily change your home page to their site or their own search engine with their adverts, etc, and second you’re also having to deal with the often confusing experience that is Windows 8.
Now that isn’t to say that every application in Windows 8 is confusing, but after years of everyone getting used to the menu bar at the top of app windows with File, Edit, Help, etc, it can be a bit daunting to figure out where things are.
Fortunately, the Chrome development team has your back because everything you need is tucked into the drop-down menu behind a single button on the browser’s window.
To demonstrate the sequence, I’m going to show you how to set the home page of this site, AskDaveTaylor, as your Chrome browser’s home page.
First off, here’s the home page:
Can you see the settings and controls button?
Yeah, neither can most people. Turns out it’s the set of the horizontal lines to the right of the address bar. Let’s look just a bit closer to see:
There it is, immediately under the red “x” button.
Click on it and a menu with lots of interesting options appears:
Got a few minutes? Try “Relaunch Chrome in Windows 8 Mode”. Pretty radical.
Let’s stay on task, however, and to do that you’ll want to choose “Settings”, as shown.
The result:
Here you can see the three options for what Chrome should do when you start it up: open a blank page, open the last page you visited prior to quitting the browser last time, or open a specific page or set of pages.
The latter’s the one you seek, so click on “Set pages”…
Notice the button on the lower left: “Use current pages”. That’s the one (since you’re already on the site you want to use as your new home page, in this instance
Click on “Use current pages” and it’ll confirm:
That’s it. Now if you’d like to add additional pages or tabs that should open automatically, you can do that here too with the “Add a new page” section.
Easy enough once you know where things are hiding.
The only way I found to do this was to use an extension called ‘New Tab Behaviour’. Once installed everything should be self explanatory from then. However, I can’t believe Google developers couldn’t have done this for us – it has been in IE for as long as I can remember.
I’ve got the home page changed – thank you very much.
I’m using Chrome by the way.
Now I want very much to change the new tab page away from Rogoform back to Google.
I’m tried every thing I can think of.

The point of the quote, apocryphal or not, is that business too often suffers from a short-term mentality in which the sale of the rope (bigger profits!) outweighs the longer-term consequences, however grave they might be. It is hard to know how else to explain the bizarre pattern of political giving uncovered by the Post story.
According to the story, a joint effort by the Post and the invaluable Center for Responsive Politics, some of the richest business lobbying groups gave a majority of their Republican donations to lawmakers who voted against lifting the debt ceiling and re-opening the government. Take the American Bankers Association (ABA). From 2009-2012, it gave $2.2 million to Republicans who voted no on the debt ceiling increase, versus $2 million to Republicans who voted in favor. Giving by many other big business groups was nearly as tilted to the 144 House members and 18 senators who voted to default on U.S. debts.
In other words, an association that represents the interests of bankers – whose success depends above all else on financial stability – gave a majority of its GOP donations to members of Congress who were willing to risk a financial conflagration that could have cost ABA member companies billions of dollars in losses. None other than Frank Keating, the ABA president, put it succinctly when asked about the potential consequences of a default: “This is just completely mad, as far as most of the community bank people are concerned, and I’m sure their customers and clients.”
If it’s completely mad, then why are the ABA and many other prominent business associations supporting these members? The reason is that the same Republicans willing to risk a default are also in favor of policies that business believes will reduce expenses and help their bottom line – lower taxes, less government spending and lighter regulation. The short-term gains of supporting these politicians have outweighed the potential longer-term consequences.
The problem is part of a larger one that professors at the Harvard Business School have identified as a failure by American business to protect the “commons” that are vital for its own profitability. Investing in workplace training, nurturing local suppliers, and spending on research are all costly activities, and many companies are loathe to pay the up-front costs on the uncertain promise of future gains. It is easier to search for quick cost savings. But if every company behaves the same way, the United States becomes a less attractive place to invest, to the collective cost of both business and the larger society. A federal government that can be relied on to pay its debts is one of those things that is rather essential to a well-functioning “commons.”
The encouraging news is that business may finally be waking up to the consequences of its own short-sightedness. As one Texas fundraiser told Politico: “Why do I want to fuel a fire that’s going to consume us?“ It’s not just the near default, but also the failure of the GOP to deliver on major business priorities such as immigration reform. Donations appear to be dropping for a number of prominent Tea Party Republicans, and big business donors are scouting around for alternative candidates to support.
Surely such candidates exist, those who favor business and but also understand the need for effective and intelligent government. The two are hardly mutually exclusive. Sadly, business has been behaving for too long as if they were.
Major business organizations don’t spend money out of nowhere; they spend their member corporations’ money. Major business organizations that support political candidates are using their companies’ money to do so. The heads of major business organizations report to Boards of Directors (made up of corporate senior leaders, usually), but they also lead their organizations and often lead their Boards. When a major business association leader pours millions of his members’ dollars down the drain on failed candidacies, as in 2012, or in support of viciously counterproductive candidates, as discussed in this article, the leaders of the associations should be held to account by their Boards for wasting their paying members’ money, and/or the members themselves should end their paying membership in the association whose leaders have thrown their money away on lost, or, worse, misguided and damaging campaigns.or alphabetical business listings for Chemicals--Industrial in Bibra Lake, WA 6163

We usually do, at 3 p.m. I'm there. My boss, Marie Morelli, the business editor, is there. So is the metro editor, Mike Grogan, sometimes with his assistants Jon Hand and Maureen Sieh. The projects editor, John Lammers, attends if his reporters are working on stories related to Destiny. The photo director, Nick Lisi, is there. The art director, Mike Dupras, is there. Don Cazente, the regional editor, whose desk includes our correspondents in Washington and Albany, is there.
We go around the table and talk about what the reporters we supervise are doing. The Destiny story touches on many beats, and the reporters could duplicate efforts if we don't coordinate. A particular story might fall to the City Hall reporter, or the environmental reporter, or the retail reporter, or the county beat reporter, or the Salina town reporter, or the economic development reporter.
And it helps to collect the ideas of the people around the table. Mike Grogan might have some questions about a story Rick Moriarty is reporting that hadn't occurred to Rick or to me. Nick Lisi might have seen something over near Carousel that raises a question that leads to a story we hadn't thought of before.
And with Nick and Mike Dupras there, as we talk about how we'll present the information in the newspaper. We discuss photographs, graphics and maps that will help us tell the story.
We review what we expect to be the news that will break in the short term -- now, for example: resolution to the financing question; a new agency agreement between Destiny and SIDA; resolution of the anchor stores' lease rights issue -- and make sure there's an understanding of who's covering what.
Finally, we ask if there's anything we've forgotten.
And, of course, if something we didn't anticipate happens on, say, a Wednesday, we might have to reinvent the coverage plan.
Monday, though, because some people were off, the meeting was canceled. It seems like a quiet time anyway, leading up to the holidays, with a fair number of the reporters taking time to be with their families, and those who are left covering for those who are off.
We'll see if the stories Rick is working on will pan out this week ....

Meet Escuela’s Chef – Deirdre Lane
Deirdre Lane is an Albuquerque native who has spent 11 years plying her trade as an organic chef in New York City. She moved home the summer of 2013 and opened Deirdre’s Kitchen at Escuela del Sol at the start of the 2013-2014 school year.
Deirdre graduated from the prestigious Johnson and Wales University of Culinary Arts in Charleston, SC in 2000. She moved to Manhattan in 2002 and worked for several high-end, organic-focused catering companies in the city through the spring of 2013.
Over the years Deirdre had an ever-growing dream to move back west. In a recent conversation she said, “New York is a great experience, fun and exciting, but the Land of Enchantment with all of its beauty and outdoor activities is where my heart belongs.” Family is very important to Deirdre. Her mother and one sibling, Mark, live in Albuquerque and another brother, Matthew, lives in Las Vegas. Deirdre moved to Albuquerque with her boyfriend Doug and their cat Butterpaws.
Deirdre is very committed to the use of natural, whole, organic ingredients in her cooking. When asked about her vision for Deirdre’s Kitchen she answered, “To me this is the perfect opportunity, to come home and to work being of service to young children in providing healthy organic meals. I hope that I can help instill an understanding and passion for nutritious, natural, and organic eating in the children of Escuela del >Movie makers are suing thousands of individuals who downloaded and watched Sylvester Stallone’s latest film?

Unfortunately, I have yet to hear back from him. But reading a story in the Tennessean (based in Nashville), I found myself wondering again what's going on with Goro.
According to writer Bryan Mullen, Goro isn't among the quarterbacks rookie coach Robbie Caldwell will be choosing from to start this season. That group includes senior Jared Funk, junior Larry Smith and junior college transfer Jordan Rogers. For those who don't know Caldwell took over the team after Bobby Johnson suddenly resigned this summer.
According to Mullen's report, Smith has the edge, but he will be pushed by the other two in camp, which started last week. While Smith has the experience, Funk, a 2006 St. Viator graduate, has the strongest arm. Funk led the Lions to their best-ever regular season in 2005 as they went 8-1 and then advanced to the second round of the state playoffs.
Mullen said Goro isn't in the mix because he's a redshirt freshman. That's an uphill run against players with significantly more experience. In an e-mail exchange with Mullen, the writer wrote:
"He is the youngest of the group and probably has another year before he's in position to make a push. That's the sense I got from the coaches.
"I know Vanderbilt likes him a lot, it's just that those ahead of him have more time in the system or have experience."
Regardless, Vandy needs all the help it can get finding the end zone playing in the SEC. The Commodores were last in the conference in scoring offense a year ago, averaging 16.3 points a game.Two new comedies added to summer slate
HBO is adding a few laughs to its Friday lineup this summer.The pay cabler will bow the animated skein “The Life and Times of Tim” in June, pairing it with the Australian hit “Summer Heights High.” HBO is still determining exact dates and times for the two shows. But the net plans to run both back-to-back for eight weeks. The channel has 10 episodes of “Tim” in the can and eight segs of “Summer Heights High.” The final two episodes of “Tim” will air the week after “Summer Heights” finishes its run. The previously announced “Tim” revolves around an everyday guy who consistently travels down the wrong path. Steve Dildarian created the show and provides the lead character’s voice. MRC is behind the show; Dildarian exec produces with Tom Werner, Jimmy Miller and Mike Clements. Meanwhile, “Summer Heights” reps a new acquisition for HBO. Show stars creator-writer-exec producer Chris Lilley in three different roles: drama teacher Mr. G, female exchange student Ja’mie and delinquent student Jonah. Laura Waters is the exec producer on “Summer Heights High,” which was directed by Stuart McDonald.NUFORC Home Page

Non-probability sampling focuses on sampling techniques that are based on the judgement of the researcher [see our article Non-probability sampling to learn more about non-probability sampling]. This article explains (a) what quota sampling is, (b) how to create a quota sample, and (c) the advantages and disadvantages (limitations) of quota sampling.
Imagine that a researcher wants to understand more about the career goals of students at the University of Bath. Let's say that the university has roughly 10,000 students. These 10,000 students are our population (N). In order to understand more about this population, we only need to examine a sample (n) of students, not the whole population of 10,000 students. Furthermore, sometimes we are interested in particular strata (groups) within the population. Therefore, the quota sample involves dividing the population into two or more strata (groups). These strata are expressed as H.
For example, imagine we were interested in comparing the differences in career goals between male and female students at the University of Bath. If this was the case, we would want to ensure that the sample we selected had a proportional number of male and female students relative to the population. Therefore, the total number of male and female students included in our quota would only be equal if 5,000 students from the university were male and the other 5,000 students were female. Since this is unlikely to be the case, the number of units that should be selected for each stratum (that is, the number of male and female students selected) will vary. We explain how this is achieved in the next section: Creating a quota sample.
To create a quota sample, there are three steps: (a) choosing the relevant stratification and dividing the population accordingly; (b) calculating a quota for each stratum; and (c) continuing to invite cases until the quota for each stratum is met.
If we wanted to look at the differences in male and female students, this would mean choosing gender as the stratification, but it could similarly involve choosing students from different subjects (e.g., social sciences, medicine, engineering, education, etc.), year groups, or some other variable(s).
The number of cases that should be included in each stratum will vary depending on the make-up of each stratum within the population. If we were to examine the differences in male and female students, for example, the number of students from each group that we would include in the sample would be based on the proportion of male and female students amongst the 10,000 university students. For example, if there were 6,000 male students (60% of the total) and 4,000 female students (40% of the total), our sample would need to be made up of 60% males and 40% females. If our desired sample size was 100 students, this would mean our sample should include 60 male students and 40 female students.
Once you have selected the number of cases you need in each stratum, you simply need to keep inviting participants to take part in your research until each of these quotas are filled.
Quota sampling is particularly useful when you are unable to obtain a probability sample, but you are still trying to create a sample that is as representative as possible of the population being studied. In this respect, it is the non-probability based equivalent of the stratified random sample.
Unlike probability sampling techniques, especially stratified random sampling, quota sampling is much quicker and easier to carry out because it does not require a sampling frame and the strict use of random sampling techniques. This makes it popular in undergraduate and master's level dissertations where there is a need to divide the population being studied into strata (groups).
The quota sample improves the representation of particular strata (groups) within the population, as well as ensuring that these strata are not over-represented. For example, it would ensure that we have sufficient male students taking part in the research (60% of our sample size of 100; hence, 60 male students). It would also make sure we did not have more than 60 male students, which would result in an over-representation of male students in our research.
The use of a quota sample, which leads to the stratification of a sample (e.g., male and female students), allows us to more easily compare these groups (strata).isation.
It must be possible to clearly divide the population into strata; that is, each unit from the population must only belong to one stratum. In our example, this would be fairly simple, since our strata are male and female students. Clearly, a student could only be classified as either male or female. No student could fit into both categories (ignoring transgender issues).
Furthermore, imagine extending the sampling requirements such that we were also interested in how career goals changed depending on whether a student was an undergraduate or graduate. Since the strata must be mutually exclusive, this means that we would need to sample four strata from the population: undergraduate males, undergraduate females, graduate males, and graduate females. This will increase overall sample size required for the research, which can increase costs and time to carry out the research.Known in this film. Whether it’s child abuse or artificial insemination, Onir has dealt with these issues through the short films without enforcing any opinions or giving conclusive end. While some may like this left-to-interpretation approach, those used to typical Bollywood fare may not appreciate it. The film brought together not only some of the finest actors in Hindi cinema it was also a successful experiment in bringing together people from all over the world who contributed time and donations to make I Am become a reality. Let’s take a look at the film.
The first in the series is I Am Afia. Afia (Nandita Das), dejected by her husband’s betrayal and too hurt to trust another man, decides on making her wish of being a mother come true by going it on her own and using artificial insemination. That’s when she meets a medical student (Purab Kohli) a frequent sperm donor. The segment is basically from Afia’s point of view and talks about a pretty unkown topic in Indian society. While initially Afia is hurt and confused, she gets herself together and emerges strong enough to do defy the norms of a man-woman relationship and makes her dream of being a mother come true. Nothing much is said about Purab’s character – why does he become a sperm donor, how did he come to be one – but frankly that is really not much relevant to Afia’s story. Nandita, who has time and again proved herself to be a brilliant actress, shines in the character of an independent woman who isn’t bothered about the archetypal society and its expectations from her while Purab does fine as the young, shy donor. Anurag Basu does a cameo in the role of a doctor. The initial hesitation and awkwardness between the two is beautifully played out and this one is perhaps the lightest of the four stories.
I Am Megha is about a Kashmiri Pandit Megha (Juhi Chawla) who was forced to leave her home as a child and settle in Delhi because of the communal tension. Rubina (Manisha Koirala) on the other hand, is her childhood friend who daily has to go through hatred and humiliation because of being a part of a family with a reformed terrorist. Without taking any sides, Onir talks about the trauma the communalism had not only on the Kashmiri Pandits but also on the Muslims who stayed behind. The best part of the story is that in spite of being based on such a big political and sensitive issue, it focuses on the emotions of the people involved and doesn’t try to drag politics into it. Are the ones who were forced to leave their homes (but ended up at more independent places) better off than the ones left behind to witness the hell everyday? That’s the question Onir puts forth – and smartly doesn’t answer- before the viewer. Supposedly based on Sanjay Suri’s life, Juhi brings out the anger, hurt and betrayal of a person who cannot return to her own home very well. Quite different from the characters which she usually plays her resentment and frustration is beautifully put forth although she does fumble in the parts where she speaks Kashmiri. Koirala is brilliant as the one who has to pay the price for staying back.
The third in the series is I Am Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu (Sanjay Suri), is a victim of child abuse by his stepfather (Anurag Kashyap). Having started using this fact to indirectly blackmail him, Abhimanyu has now turned into a selfish being who doesn’t think twice before using someone for his benefit. But it has also affected his sexuality with Abhimanyu often dreaming of him being a girl instead of a boy. Onir brings out the ugliness of child abuse which can affect a person’s psyche and mar him for life very well. Sanjay is good although we must say that having played a victim earlier in Onir movie, it does give a sense of déjà vu. Watch out though for the touching confrontation between him and his mother in the climax. Radhika Apte and Shernaz Patel do justice to their role but it is Anurag who leaves an impact with his depiction of a pedophile. Done subtly and without any stereotypes, his character manages to scare you enough to double check next time who you leave your kid alone with.
The last story I Am Omar deals with homosexuality, still considered a taboo, and the mentality of the people towards homosexuals. Omar (Rahul Bose), MD of a multinational company, feels that there is enough chemistry when he meets Jai (Arjun Mathur) a struggling actor. What was supposed to be an intimate night out for the two turns out to be a nightmare when they get caught by a cop (Abhimanyu Singh). Rahul Bose as the victim who is humiliated and betrayed is exceptional while Arjun does well too. Abhimanyu as the cop is too good and you just can’t stop yourself from hating him and sympathizing for Omar. The darkest story of the lot, the love making sequence between Omar and Jai is explosive and it may leave a few conservative souls squirming in their seats.
The best part of the movie is that Onir doesn’t overplay any characters or scenes and lays it all out before you without spoon feeding you. Introducing a character in one short film, he continues his story in the next one, although that’s all the connection is between the four stories. Otherwise, on the whole, they are a disconnected bunch of stories. Music is good and the cinematography though not exceptionally brilliant manages to capture the reality of the issues pretty well. Having been funded by 400 odd people (one of our first crowd sourced movie), the movie does hint at being a tad tight in the budget department but Onir makes the best of what is available.
Many might find the treatment of the movie too art-festivalish which may work against it but those who enjoy different kinds of cinema will definitely end up loving it. Our verdict ? Do watch I AM.Moonview Highway is a race track appearing in Mario Kart Wii. It is the second racecourse of the Special Cup within the game. The course takes place in and around a lit up city at night with a full moon overhead.
The course takes place in a city at night. Since it is so dark, a light appears around the player while he or she is driving. The highway first runs through a forested area with several cliffs that the player can drive on and go on top of. After the forested area is a bridge and then a road that leads into a city. After the city area, the track will curve and return into the forested area, thus beginning another lap.
Cars, trucks, and Bob-omb Cars roam around in the city, driving in a set pattern. If the player happens to drive in front of them, he or she will get squashed, as if the player got run over by another player with a Mega Mushroom or crushed by Thwomp and they will lose any items. The only car not to squash the player is the Bob-omb Car; it will simply blow up the player instead. If the player runs into the vehicles that are not Bob-omb cars, the player will simply get knocked over, as if they were hit with a shell, and will not lose any items. Unlike the courses with traffic in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, there are no Mushroom Cars that provide the player mushrooms when hit.
Like in Shroom Ridge, the traffic follows the Japanese, Australian and British systems of driving, in which vehicles drive on the left side of the road. In Mirror Mode, the cars go on the right side of the road, as in most other countries in the world, including the United States, Canada, and Mainland China.
Players who have the Mega Mushroom in effect may smash cars and Bob-ombs with no ill-effect, but cannot move trucks at all. The Mega Mushroom player will simply bump into the truck as if it's a wall. However, a player with a star in effect will knock away any car. Any car caught in the blast of a Bob-omb, including a Bob-omb car, will flip in the air, as if a player ran into the car with a star. If playing as a Mii, the face on Mario (in the moon) and Peach's face in the Mushroom Moon billboard will have Mii faces. The Fire Flower will also have a Mii face. At certain points in the race, if the player drives next to the wall, it will show a pattern of Shy Guy and Bowser Jr. faces.
The track begins in an area where there are cliffs and a few trees. The player can mainly drive on the road of the highway, but may go up cliffs as well and drive on top of the cliffs. If the player decides to go on the road, they will see cars and trucks as obstacles in the way. In the cliff area, there is a ramp that can boost the player and allows him or her to do a stunt and receive item boxes, but the player has a danger of falling into the forest below.
After a wide curve after the ramp and there is a bridge that leads to a city. Past the bridge, there is a toll booth that the player's Miis control and open the gate that leads into the city. The road widens from two to four lanes, and there are a lot of boosts. It is impossible to drive off-road in the city because of the walls on either side of the road. The player can choose to drive on the right side of the road, but due to it being the Japanese system of driving, the player has a danger of running straight into cars going the opposite direction. The cars seemingly try to avoid the boosts and also let the player know when they are changing lanes through orange blinking lights.
After the city area, there is a tunnel that has several more boosts. Cars may be present here, as well. No item boxes are present if one does not count the item boxes that move along with the traffic. The path is relatively straight and the only thing the player needs to watch out for is the pillars that hang in the middle and cars. After the tunnel, there is another toll booth, with another set of Miis opening the gates for the player that lead out of the city. The path merges again and thus begins another cycle around the city at the finish line, which starts another lap.
April 2010's 2nd tournament required players to race through Moonview Highway, with all the vehicles going the opposing direction. Players started the race with a set of Triple Mushrooms. The tournament was later repeated as the first tournament of November 2011, the second tournament of January 2013, and the first tournament of April 2014.

Abstract
For a 3-colourable graph G, the 3-colour graph of G, denoted C_3(G), is the graph with node set the proper vertex 3-colourings of G, and two nodes adjacent whenever the corresponding colourings differ on precisely one vertex of G. We consider the following question: given G, how easily can one decide whether or not C_3(G) is connected? We show that the 3-colour graph of a 3-chromatic graph is never connected, and characterise the bipartite graphs for which View the MathML source is connected. We also show that the problem of deciding the connectedness of the 3-colour graph of a bipartite graph is coNP-complete, but that restricted to planar bipartite graphs, the question is answerable in polynomial time.or Join Now!
I bought an osage orange bowl blank – mostly because I’ve wanted to use this wood in the shop ever since I first heard the name iron wood – and split it into two goblet blanks. The first one, I turned straight through the walls hollowing the cup. After spending an hour yelling at the broken pieces, I tried again, and came up with this. I’d like to think I’m getting a lot better at figuring out a) how thick I want the walls, and b) getting them that thick. But as most of you have said in response to turned projects – the wood decides most of the features.
For this piece, I sanded to 400 grit, but instead of lubricating the 400 with walnut oil, I sanded it dry. Then, I sanded it with 0000 steel wool, before applying a beeswax/orange oil mixture to it. Looks a lot different in the pictures than in person, but this is usually the case when you take pics from your phone. It has a beautiful orange color, a fun wood to turn (despite messing up two blanks to get this ONE goblet). I will definitely be buying more of this species.

What I was referring to was that you need to learn how to properly rotate your pictures prior to posting them on LJ’s. ;-)
I am not being rude, I just know that many people will just bypass any pictures posted sideways.
This is a very pretty turning – It deserves to be presented nicely so people can appreciate it.
Just about any photo editor has a ‘rotate’ option in it – I will gladly send you instructions for whatever operating system you have.
Keep up the great work!

Nice turning. The goblets are getting better with each one that you do. I don’t think I have ever heard of osage orange being called ironwood though. Ironwood usually refers to a wood that has a specific gravity greater than water. I could be wrong though. Again nice work.

Thanks, Nick! I’m glad you like my turnings. Next is that piece of mesquite. I was putting it off because I didn’t know if I wanted to go with the same shape as my other bowls.
Osage is, indeed, more dense than water. When placed in a bucket full of water, it will plummet to the bottom. In fact, when I first heard of it, I had only heard it referred to as ironwood. It was years later I found out ironwood was a category, not a species. But that’s ok, because a quick ironwood google search got me to this beautiful orange. Whether it is officially ironwood or not, this stuff is HARD! I had to sharpen my chisels twice while turning it.

JACKSON – The Republican leadership of the Mississippi Legislature and Gov. Phil Bryant felt good about the accomplishments of the 2013 session, which ended Thursday.
“All in all, I think this is an A session,” Bryant said Thursday outside his Capitol office after seeing the Legislature pass many education proposals he had endorsed, such as charter schools, enhanced teacher standards and a literacy-improvement effort in the early grades.
The Republican governor praised the leadership of Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who presides over the Senate, and House Speaker Philip Gunn for a legislative session he labeled “transformative.”
Then there was Medicaid.
Legislators ended the three-month-long session knowing they will have to return before July 1 in special session to deal with Medicaid. Democrats were able to defeat legislation reauthorizing and funding the federal-state health care program in an attempt to force Gunn to allow a vote before the full chamber on whether to expand coverage to the working poor as part of the federal Affordable Care Act.
Everyone acknowledges Bryant will have to call a special session for the Legislature to deal with Medicaid.
He said Thursday he would call the session when there is an agreement – presumably an agreement where Democrats give up the fight on Medicaid expansion since he has said he is adamantly opposed.
While much of the Republican leadership tried to cast the blame for the inability to agree on Medicaid on the Democrats, House Appropriations Chairman Herb Frierson, R-Poplarville, who made an impassioned speech to try to pass the Medicaid budget earlier in the week, said he fears all members will be blamed.
“We’re going to have the entire Legislature in a septic tank. When we climb out, we’re all going to have the same poo-poo on us,” he said, explaining that each side will be blamed, especially if they cannot come to agreement on Medicaid.
At any rate, legislative leaders preferred to talk Thursday about issues other than Medicaid.
“We have a lot of good things that I believe will make a difference in the lives of Mississippians for years to come,” said Gunn, R-Clinton.
Reeves cited the education proposals that passed, including his plan to provide financial help to districts to put law enforcement in the schools. Plus, he said the Legislature was fiscally responsible in the budget it passed and the bond package it approved to finance long-term construction needs.
Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, explained that he fears much of the education legislation will result in weakening, not strengthening the public school system.
He lamented the numerous tax credits and tax breaks that were handed out during the session.

Theatres are becoming more “risk averse” when commissioning new writing due to cuts to art funding, leading theatre directors have warned.
National Theatre associate director Marianne Elliott said that venues will be less likely to take on new writers in the future if they are seen to be too much of a risk.
Speaking at the Bruntwood Prize for Playwriting launch last week, she said: “The spending cuts will mean that a lot of theatres will be risk averse, and that will also have an impact on taking risks with new writers.”
James Grieve, co-artistic director of touring theatre company Paines Plough, which specialises in new writing, agreed. He has found that many venues would now rather book a more commercially viable show rather than commission new writing.
He said that in recent years it had become increasingly difficult to convince venues to take on his company’s shows if they did not include a well known actor or writer.
“What we’ve found over the past few years is that the national cuts combined with local authority cuts are making it harder and harder for us to book tours,” he told The Stage.
Grieve added: “We’re having to think in greater detail about the way shows are marketed to audiences. We’re having to think more about if there is someone well known associated with the production, and what unique selling point the production has.”
Erica Whyman, the Royal Shakespeare Company’s new deputy artistic director, said that in tough financial times the focus on commercial or critical success becomes “more honed”.
Speaking at a conference organised by Index on Censorship about how arts organisations support artistic freedom, Whyman said that a combination of the current arts cuts and the way funding has become organised over the past 20 years to target “project-by-project working” does not provide long-term support for writers.
She added: “If you drop someone after a project, whether it’s successful or not – because you haven’t got another slot or another pocket of funding – then you make it really difficult for artists to develop a clear sense of what they want to say and how they want to say it.”
Vicky Featherstone, incoming artistic director of London’s Royal Court Theatre, said that because new writing is “high risk” and takes time to develop it is in danger of being “slashed very quickly”.
She added that increasing amounts of private funding could alter the content of new work: “When we are looking for funders that aren’t [providers of] public funding, there is an issue about the content of the play and what the writers want to write about. And there are big questions around the formula that a corporate sponsor would feel comfortable sponsoring.Spent 4 nights here in September 2013.

The Panasonic Total Living Space Solution is a connected home setup concept by the brand. The concept was showcased in CEATEC 2008 Japan on a space that's equivalent to the actual size of a kitchen and living room. The focus of the showcase is the 54-inch Panasonic Viera plasma TV. It comes on a stand with a track going from living room to kitchen so you can move the TV around. When you're in the living room watching TV, the connected lights automatically dim. Alternatively, when you move to the kitchen to dine, the lights will adjust to brightness appropriate for dining.
The "green" aspect of the concept is also centered on the enormous plasma TV. The Viera can actually be used to display and monitor the Living Space Solution's energy consumption so you can optimize your usage. I find that a bit ironic though, since according to study, a 42-inch plasma TV could consume as much energy as a large refrigerator and this one's a lot bigger at 54 inches. Still, for the interested, Panasonic's Total Living Space Solution will probably be ready within three to fiveThe revision, a joint effort of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), was released Monday, although it carries a 2010 date.
USDA and HHS last updated the guidelines in 2005.
Basic recommendations for maximum intake of fats and cholesterol, sodium, potassium, and fiber remain unchanged from the last edition.
Instead, the "Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010" focused mainly on wording tweaks, such as reorganizing how some of the recommendations are presented.
For example, the recommendation to reduce calories from added sugar now gets separate emphasis. In the 2005 edition of the dietary guidelines, added sugar was lumped with other suggestions in a large section on carbohydrates.
The new guidelines also include more suggestions of healthy foods to eat, whereas earlier editions concentrated more on unhealthy foods to avoid.
The revisions "represent a step forward towards better health for all Americans when compared with the 2005 dietary guidelines," Louis J. Aronne, MD, of Weill-Cornell Medical College in New York City, wrote in an e-mail to MedPage Today and ABC News. "I think more of an emphasis has been needed to be specific in our dietary recommendations."
The new edition of the dietary guidelines 50;" -- such as butter and trans-fats -- as fat sources to be avoided or minimized. It also recommends substituting mono- and polyunsaturated oils for solid fats when possible.
The new edition also makes more specific suggestions of alternatives to refined grains and sugars and high-fat meats.
Controversy over Salt
The sodium numbers are likely to be among the most controversial elements in the 2010 edition, since they hardly vary from the 2005 version.
The major difference is that the 1,500-mg/day sodium limit for individuals with hypertension or its risk factors was an "aim" in 2005 -- but has now been promoted to a full-fledged recommendation that the document notes "applies to about half of the U.S. population, including children, and the majority of adults."
Also, the new revision adds diabetes and chronic kidney disease to the list of risk factors that trigger the 1,500 mg a day cap.
But it also appears to raise the age limit for which the lower figure applies. The 2005 guideline merely indicated that it was appropriate for the "middle aged," which was not explicitly defined but is generally understood to mean older than 40.
The American Heart Association slammed the change as "a backwards step."
"For the sodium issue, the guidance misses the fact that most Americans either have high blood pressure or are at risk of developing it during their lifetime. All of these clearly support the need for a national commitment to reduce sodium consumption to less than 1,500 mg a day for all Americans," said AHA President Ralph Sacco, MD, in a statement.
Earlier this month, the AHA had called for an across-the-board, 1,500-mg/day limit for everyone -- including people without risk factors and had recommended a 7% limit on calories from saturated fats, rather than the 10% in the new guidelines.
Other groups and individual researchers have also argued that the government's 2,300-mg/day sodium target for the general population was too high..
Mixed Reviews from Healthcare Community
Contacted by MedPage Today and ABC News for comment, Keith-Thomas Ayoob, EdD, RD, of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, commented that the lower sodium limit was probably impractical, irrespective of its health merits.
"People at risk haven't gotten their sodium intake even to the previously recommended 2,300 mg level. That would have been a more realistic goal," he wrote in an e-mail.
Some other experts were skeptical about other aspects of the guidelines, such as their ability to change the average American's eating habits.
In an e-mail, Goutham Rao, MD, of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, stated his view of the likely impact in a single word: "Negligible."
But others, like Aronne, told MedPage Today and ABC News that the update is a significant improvement.
Eliana Perrin, MD, MPH, of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, added in an e-mail that there are important secondary effects from the guidelines.
"While most Americans don't read the guidelines cover to cover, they become an important source of evidence-based and evidence-informed information and the basis for many federal programs. Their impact is wider because of this," she wrote.
Stephen Cook, MD, MPH, of the University of Rochester, was generally supportive of the 2010 edition's overall direction, but worried that its messages "will get twisted and manipulated by the food and beverage industry."
He added, "I don't know how clear it comes across but [it's important] to get people back to food preparation and eating whole foods and appropriate food patterns -- NOT supplementing with the latest vitamin or the latest diet craze of low carb, or high protein," he wrote in an e-mail.
Even the AHA offered general praise for the 2010 edition. Its statement "agrees with the overarching principles in the new USDA/HHS guidelines [which] focus on total diet and underscore a healthy overall eating pattern, while achieving a healthy weight."
The American Society of Nutrition also lauded the revision.
"The actual [2010] guidelines are not so different than the 2005 guidelines, but there is bigger promise for bringing visibility to these guidelines with the First Lady carrying the message to eat healthy and be physically active to the public," it said in a statement. "The message of enjoy your food, but eat less, is straightforward, effective advice that everyone can understand."
Not Just About Personal Food Choices
The full 112-page guideline.
The guidelines were unveiled at a town hall-style meeting held at George Washington University in Washington. In his introductory remarks, Vilsack -- formerly governor of Iowa, a major farm state -- admitted that he had never read through the USDA's previous dietary guidelines until he became the agency's secretary.
A representative of the American Dietetic Association seized on the remark to suggest that past efforts to disseminate the recommendations had been inadequate.
Vilsack and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who also appeared at the meeting, both responded that their respective agencies have many other programs that effectively advance the recommendations.
For example, said Vilsack, the USDA has several programs that encourage consumers to buy and eat fresh fruits and vegetables, with financial incentives in some cases.
One USDA initiative that Sebelius took pains to applaud was a mapping program on "food deserts" -- geographic areas where it is difficult to find affordable, healthy foods.
In many locations -- including big-city neighborhoods as well as rural areas -- the only sources of food are convenience stores and fast-food franchises that mainly carry high-fat, high-carb foods that the nutrition guidelines seek to discourage.
Sebelius noted that the food-desert phenomenon had been recognized but its full scope was not until the mapping effort began.
She said it was vital that this and other "obstacles to healthy eating" be reckoned with before consumers can be expected to make good choices on their own.

Certainly there are a couple of free solutions available, such as Colloquy, but if you're interested in a single window IRC client that looks absolutely gorgeous, look no further than Linkinus.

Conceited Software's Linkinus isn't short on features, such as smart highlighting, embedding media, chat grouping, AppleScript support, an identity manager, advanced security settings, and even interface themes that make this a Mac IRC lovers dream. It's packed with all kinds of settings you can tweak to your hearts desire, perfect for Mac fanatics. Linkinus is built with new IRC users in mind. From the moment you start the app, you're walked through the process of creating an identify for yourself, connecting to a network, and joining new channels. Although I didn't necessarily care for the hand holding, the interface presented to you is pretty enough where I let it slide. Besides, at least for network and channel options, they don't deny you the ability to manually type your commands into the console.
The initial setup process however, does concern me. For your Realname and Username, Linkinus pre-fills these spaces with your Mac identity, which new IRC users might find convenient. Linkinus should instead leave these spaces blank, if to somewhat dissuade this behavior. It should be made clear that it's not recommended to use your real name online, especially if you're going to venture the unknown world of IRC. You should instead, make an appropriate alias for yourself.
My second issue with the setup process is that while it's obvious you need a Realname and a Username, it's not obvious that you should also input a Nickname. Your nickname (I think) is the most important piece of your online identity, and users will have to click an empty space in the panel to create one. Only through curiosity would a new user touch this. If you're a previous IRC user and you have a registered nickname, you can also enter your password here.
Once you've created your online identity, you're presented with the console. From here, there's a notifier on the bottom left hand corner of the screen that tells you to "click here to get started." Easy enough. Clicking the button will drop down a list of all of the IRC servers available to you. Surprisingly, I wasn't able to locate Moofspeak, which is the IRC network dedicated to anything Macintosh. Seriously? And despite a pretty pane, I felt confined to the default window sizing (even after pulling it down) due to the largeness of the network buttons. Instead of the "icon" view, I wish they provided me with a list view instead, or an option to change it. Anyway, to connect to Moofspeak, I ended up typing /server irc.moofspeak.net to connect. And the console comes through! Using the pane however, I was able to connect to Geekshed, which was pretty easy. Linkinus does pick favorites though, as it seems to lists the most popular IRC networks first in alphabetical order, before listing the remaining networks known.
Once you're in a network, you're acquainted with a beautiful page that tells you you've successful connected to that network, and it gives you some options in the form of buttons where you can join a specific channel, browse the channel listing, or view your console activity. I prefer to view my console activity and use the /join command to connect to my channels, but new users will appreciate the ease of point and click. Because Moofspeak wasn't initially listed, neither where the channels unfortunately, but I could still manually connect to any channel in existence. As for Geekshed, I was able to amass a huge list of channels to choose from (which sometimes took a while to aggregate), though scrolling through all of them quickly can get tiring. The most annoying though is if I typed the /list command in the console, I expected to receive a text list of all the channels on the network in the console. Instead, Linkinus intervened and used the channel pane.
The chat view is welcoming, as there are plenty of features in this particular mode that I love (albeit with some tweaking in the settings). Here is where your themes are applied from the preferences, and here is where you'll spend the majority of your time talking to other fellow IRC members. If you quit Linkinus, then return, the last few conversations are saved, followed by a spacer that defines your new chat session. It's an easy way to recollect what you last talked about, especially if it pertains to the current channel topic.
On the user pane to the right, hovering over a user's name provides some basic information, such as their nickname and hostmask, preventing me from having to /whois an unknown user. You can then control click their name to initiate options like private chat. The status markers aren't my favorite however, and I enabled the ability to see a user's privileges (mode) in the preferences. At the bottom of the pane, the three buttons allow you to control user specific settings. The gear button allows you to invoke filters or view a buddy list, while the information button allows you to create and manage your identities. The last button (the bust) gives you options to assign privileges to highlighted users (if you have the required privileges yourself), add them to an ignore list, send them files, and more.
One of my favorite features was the ability to star messages. Although Linkinus does sport the ability to sort through messages and show you what it considers the most important, being able to manually star messages is pretty cool. If someone posts a link, you can essentially bookmark that message off for later.
Another really (and I mean really) cool chat feature is groups. If you command click multiple channels on the left sidebar, Linkinus divides your console into multiple panes, allowing you to view multiple channels at the same time. Then, you can press command-S to save that group of channels to the top right corner of the Linkinus window for easy access later. If you don't feel like clicking, you can assign and invoke your own custom keyboard shortcut for viewing those channels later. Pretty sweet huh? You don't have to group multiple channels - you could group just one for the sake of a keyboard shortcut - but it's a nifty feature I found plenty of use for.
Concerning the left sidebar, which displays your servers and channels, I did not like the default settings. By default, the sidebar not only shows you channels and servers, it shows you queries as well. I like my queries to be listed in the server's console, and not as a separate entity. It can be easily disabled, and soon after that I was rocking.
One pretty nifty feature I liked quiet a bit was the ability to individually set server & channel settings just by double clicking on the name (or the pencil at the bottom of the pane). Double clicking on the name presents you with a small floating window that is stuffed with options from running custom commands as you join, switching your identities, choosing your user modes, and defining custom "stalk" words that can be highlighted specifically in that server or channel instead of globally.
Linkinus
Linkinus isn't short on preferences, and it's here where you may spend most of your time tweaking the IRC client to your desired needs. All of your preferences are arranged similarly like System Preferences, using the first tab to displays rows of icons prevalent to your needs in their own categories. Using this view, you can navigate the preferences pretty quickly if you're looking for a specific setting, such as applying an AppleScript for example.
If you want to skip right to customizing the interface, you'll want to click on Styles, where you can change Linkinus' chat view. Some themes have "sub-themes" that will alter color schemes, which is a nice touch if you want a particular look, but would rather have black than white. Once you've tackled styling, the colors options will provide you with a way to customize input field and user list font colors. Although those options are available, what might catch your eye is the transparency settings. Foreground transparency allows you to chance Linkinus' opacity, resulting in nothing but the geekiest of giggles. Background transparency allows you to set the opacity for when Linkinus is not the active window.
Linkinus allows you to customize the sounds it makes for most events, and even gives you the ability to point to your own sounds. I later opted to use AIM's classic door opening and closing sounds to notify me when users entered and left a channel for example. You also have the option to set when you'll hear the sounds (you can turn sounds off if you're away for example).
Linkinus Sounds
Other settings include the abilities to rejoin after kick, manage plugins that increase functionality, enable scripts, create your own command aliases, choose how to display alerts, and more. It's pretty incredible how much you can actually alter Linkinus from the preferences pane, so it should make most IRC users happy in knowing that there probably won't be an option that's missing.
Linkinus is a great IRC client that lacks in some areas, but greatly excels in others. While searching for servers and channels can be a pain, chatting is brilliant and packed with plenty of features that allow you to manage content in any way you desire. With its abundance of customizable options and a stunning interface for an IRC client, it's definitely one I'd take a seriously good look at, especially if you'd rather navigate IRC through point and click.
While it isn't cheap at about twenty euros ($30 USD), you can give it a fifteen day trial.

Bookmarked by MrsHippyfreak
13 May 2015I’m feeling bad that my last post was nearly a month ago….bad, very on bad on my part
March has been a busy month for us. We have been working a lot in our garden and have been making plans for some much-needed interior renovations. Also, this Friday we are flying to New Zealand for 3 weeks! Hooray, it’s been 2 years since my last visit home, and I can’t wait to see all of my family and friends again. Not to mention the chance to indulge in some of my favorite foods! Well….within reason that is, since my favorite sugary treats are off limits to me. However I cannot wait to eat New Zealand mussels and other seafood, my favorite fruit (feijoas) and lots of lamb’s fry (lamb’s liver). And perhaps some meat pies and sausage rolls while I’m there
Before I go, I will leave you with my current favorite dinner – lamb curry. Doesn’t sound too exciting I know, but it tastes unbelievably good! So easy to make, too. I have recently come to the conclusion that lamb, more than any other meat, is made for curry, and that curry, more than any other flavor of spice, is made for lamb.
For this dish, I love the tougher cuts of lamb such as lamb shoulder blade chops or lamb shoulder arm chops. These cuts are affordable, and when slow-cooked, yield the most amazingly flavorful, moist and tender meat. I’ve made this recipe both stove top and in the slow cooker, although I generally prefer to make it on the stove. If you choose to use your slow cooker, use less liquid, cook it on low for 8 hours, and don’t add the raisins until the last hour otherwise they become mushy and tasteless.
Curried Lamb
1 tablespoon oil (butter/ghee/coconut oil)
1 ½ – 2 pounds lamb meat on the bone (lamb shoulder blade or arm chops)
1 onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 teaspoon sea salt (or to taste)
2 medium carrots, sliced
Potatoes, diced (optional)
2 cups stock
1/3 – 1/2 cup raisins
1. Heat oil in a large pot.
2. Add onions, garlic and ginger. Cook for 5 minutes or so.
3. Add lamb chops (no need to cut up) and brown on both sides.
4. Add the salt and curry powder and mix it in with the meat.
5. Add the stock, carrots and optional potato.
6. Bring to a simmer, then cover (leaving open a crack).
7. Cook at a low simmer for 2 – 2.5 hours, stirring and turning the meat periodically.
8. Add the raisins with about 30-40 minutes to go.
9. It is ready when the lamb starts to fall apart when you stir it. My family prefers me to pull the meat off the bone before serving it (fussy!) but I personally like it served bone and all so that I can suck all of the juicy goodness off the bone as I’m eating it. Your preference!

That looks delicious, sometimes the simplest dishes are the tastiest! Can’t wait to try, might have to make some without the raisins though, all the family love them apart from me
I totally agree, simple is the best
The raisins add a lovely sweetness to this dish, but I’m sure it will still be tasty without them.
I love lamb curry. Thanks for this great recipe. I have lamb liver in my freezer. Have made a soup with it before but would appreciate your recipe for “lamb’s fry” that you mentioned. Have a great trip.
Hi Nancy, here’s my recipe for lamb’s fry. If you don’t eat bacon you could leave that out, but I love the flavor that the bacon adds:
Have the best time! Safe travels.
Thanks Emily!
This lamb curry looks delicious – and the curry, ginger and garlic sound mouth-watering! Thank you for sharing with the Hearth and Soul hop. Enjoy your visit to New Zealand
Thanks April!
Big lamb lover here so I’m loving this lamb curry! Sounds and looks like a delicious dish! Enjoy your trip home! Have fun and we’ll see you when you get back.
Oooh I’m so happy you love lamb too! You really must visit NZ someday, we are famous for our lamb
Lamb and curry are a perfect match, I am sure the slow cooked method really helps tenderize the meat and bring the flavors together.
Yes, slow cooking the meat is key to this dish, it comes out so meltingly tender!
Thanks for leaving us on foodie friday with such a wonderful recipe. Have a great time with your family and friends… and eat lots and lots of seafood and lamb.
Thank you for your submission on Nourishing Treasures’ Make Your Own! Monday link-up.
Check back tomorrow when the new link-up is running to see if you were one of the top 3 featured posts!
Your recipe is awesome and thank you so much for sharing it at the table with Full Plate Thursday.
Hope to see you again soon!

If you use Simplify rather than FullSimplify you will get the old
behaviour. Of course this will work only if your problem does not
really need FullSimplify. Even if it does, you might be abel to
dispense with it by making use of the TransformationFunctions option in
Simplify.
As for the reason why this happens: if you look at Trace you will see
that Simplify and FullSimplify obtain exactly the same expression
Erf[(-(Log[10000000000]/Log[10]) - Log[10^((deltaL + 20)/10 -
12)]/Log[10])/
(Sqrt[2]*Sqrt[2*(0.6089140226261116 - 0.005294904544574884*(deltaL +
20)) + 0.25302502757884177])]
but then FullSimplify performs one more step which turns out to be
fatal in this case. Namely, if factors our -1. to get:
-1.*Erf[(0.43429448190325176*Log[E^(0.2302585092994046*deltaL)])/
Sqrt[2.518113782096139 - 0.021179618178299536*deltaL]]
This seemingly innocent factoring out of the inexact number -1. forces
the conversion of all numeric quantities to exact numbers, which in
this case has fatal consequents. This might perhaps be a bug.

Mark Mylod (Shameless) is attached to direct and exec produce the pilot, which dissects an affair and its effect on the two marriages it disrupts, with the story told separately from the male and female perspective. Based on an original concept by Treem and Levi, Affair centers on Noah, a married father of four, who becomes involved with Allison, a married woman mourning the loss of her child, after a chance meeting at the beach. Showtime recently greenlighted Paul Attanasio’s pilot Vatican, directed by Ridley Scott, and gave a straight-to-series order to John Logan/Sam Mendes’ Penny Dreadful.

With Ohio State University's Jared Sullinger, Baylor's Perry Jones, University of Texas star Jordan Hamilton and UNC's John Henson and Tyler Zeller already announcing intentions to return to school, an already lackluster draft class could turn ugly without Barnes.
The heralded recruit had an up-and-down freshman season, but really turned it on late in the year to help lead the Tar Heels to an NCAA tournament Elite Eight appearance.
According to Brett Friedlinder of the Starnewsonline.com's ACC Insider,
If—or should that be when—he makes it official, you can go ahead and pencil UNC in as one of the top two teams in the country (along with Kentucky) for 2011-12.
The possibility of going to a Final Four and winning a national championship is a carrot that should not be overlooked in Barnes’ decision process. It was specifically mentioned by his teammates John Henson and Tyler Zeller last week when they decided to delay the pro careers for another year.
That said, here is what the NBA draft currently resembles should Barnes declare to leave school early.2015-2016 COST OF EDUCATION

Of course he went after the catcher. Ever since Capt Sucker Punch planted his mitt in A-Rod’s face Yankees have known that you might as well start with the catcher. it’s part of their rookie league training.
As baseball fights that one pretty intense but that because they are single A players. Once they get a little closer to the majors they mature, .. and see real money in the near future. No point in risking that over something as trivial as getting plunked.

Former model-turned-actress Jazreel Low, 46, is not returning to the scene beyond her supporting role in the new movie Taxi! Taxi!, which she took part in because she identifies with its uplifting message
She says: "Producers have offered me roles, but nothing really interested me. Taxi! Taxi! is the first movie script that made me actually go beyond just reading it. I even called up the director to meet him in person to talk more about the movie, and I'd never done that before."
Directed by Kelvin Sng, the film is about a science professor (played by Gurmit Singh) who starts driving taxis after losing his laboratory job and what he learns from another cabbie, a rowdy Ah Beng character (Mark Lee).
Low, who plays the professor's wife, says: "The story is all about how people learn to adapt to changes. There are some points in everyone's life where you face challenges. I like how the story is about trying to move on and finding success in a different direction." She has had to do the same.Bell’s Own Data Shatters P2P Red Herring
About a week ago, the CRTC demanded that Bell release to the public by June 23rd information that would prove it’s claim that P2P throttling was having a negative impact on it’s network. Some, but not all, of that information has been made public. Many details are being kept from public view for ‘competitive’ reasons. Even the scant evidence released shows exactly how flimsy Bell’s case is.
One would assume that the company would release the most damaging evidence, but their claim is that over a 2 month period, 2-5% of their network links suffered some sort of congestion. They do NOT say whether that was a sustained range of fluctuation, or brief bursts of congestion. They then pull out the old “it’s like a highway” canard.
In revealing the details, Bell explained in an accompanying letter, the company said, because the situation is similar to the road system — where if one major artery is backed up, all connected roads will also have problems.
“Just like a single traffic roadblock can hinder drivers going to multiple destinations that pass through the road that is blocked, a very small amount of congested links can seriously affect a large number of high-speed end-users’ traffic,” Bell said.
…as quoted from a CBC article. On a simplistic level, the ‘highway’ analogy can be helpful to the ‘lay person’, but in this case it’s shorthand for company spin that obfuscates HOW traffic works.
Since Bell has no interest in actually enlightening their customers, I’m going to take a moment to show why the analogy falls apart:
1) Data packets are the cars of the ‘highway’. They travel at 1000s of kilometres per second. If they didn’t, a person in Toronto wouldn’t get an email from his friend in Australia a second after the Australian hit send. It would be impossible for someone in Toronto to play a decent game of Call Of Duty 4 with someone from London England. Somehow people are doing it every day.
2) the ‘internet highway’ can re-route you in an instant if there’s congestion. Imagine if the 401 HWY is blocked up, and magically, a second highway appears before you, with no cars on it, and your car is automatically sent onto the new route. The ‘congestion’ Bell claims is more of a dead seagull at the side of the road than a 15 car pile-up (even if it was sustained congestion over that two month period – which they haven’t made explicit).
3) Bell is claiming that torrent traffic is the equivalent of a convoy of 18-wheelers blocking the poor little guy. As we previously reported the numbers show that gaming, web streaming, and email each hog more lanes than all torrents combined. These numbers come from Ellacoya (now a part of Arbor Networks), a traffic shaping company that Bell is invested in.
All of this, when combined with Bell’s congestion claims, should completely dis-spell the myth that P2P is crushing the internet.
The throttling issue isn’t the only thing we’ve been facing lately, with the Bill C-61 amendments to the Copyright Act having been tabled, and possibly becoming official after the summer recess. At least we have all summer to mount an opposition to said bill (I know I’m assuming everyone is opposed to it – after all I don’t think the RIAA or MPAA are reading this). That’s a whole other article though, and I’d respectfully point you to Michael Geist’s site, as he’s been doing some amazing coverage on the issue.

MRC Analysis Reveals Media's Savaging of Richard Scaife is Unprecedented
ALEXANDRIA, Va. --- Double standard. Guilt by association. Rush to judgment. The national media assault on Richard Mellon Scaife has been relentless and unprecedented according to a just released analysis conducted by the
Media Research Center.
"The national media have become an extension of the White House spin machine when it comes to Richard Scaife, all along reeking with rank hypocrisy. All Scaife did is fund investigative journalism that reflected badly on President Clinton. Investigative journalism was considered by the media to be an essential civic duty during the Reagan and Bush administrations," said MRC Director of Media Analysis
Tim Graham who conducted the analysis.
SCAIFE AND STARR: The connection between Scaife and Independent Counsel Ken Starr was always tenuous. The networks were quick to spread the White House spin that Scaife was the center of Hillary Clinton's "vast right-wing conspiracy" and that he was linked to Starr - ostensibly because of Scaife's funding of Pepperdine University's School of Public Policy and Starr's decision to work there. This was guilt by association. Scaife is on record stating that neither he nor anyone involved in his foundations has ever met or talked with Starr, nor did he or anyone of his staff have any role in Starr's Pepperdine appointment. Scaife has also pointed out that he is only one of several donors to give $1 million to the Pepperdine endowment.
"This was guilt by association, a rush to judgment and a double standard all rolled into one. There has never, ever been a link established between Scaife and Starr. It's all a media perpetuated version of Mrs. Clinton's conspiracy fantasies" Graham said.
RICHARD SCAIFE
Questions An Unbiased, Balanced, And Fair Media Would Have Asked By Now
"Our analysis shows the media have been out of control when it comes to coverage of Richard Scaife. Hillary Clinton understood all too well that Scaife would be an irresistible target for the media elite to aim at. He's rich, he's conservative, and he's funding the investigative journalism that they should be doing," Graham said.

There may have been a few meltdowns when someone lost a game of baseball on the wii, but we worked it out and kept right on having fun! I'll introduce you to three of the five boys. The older two were at school today so it was just me and the three little ones.
Introducing Luke. Or Lukers. He's two and he's loving toddlerhood.
Next up is Cole. Or Coley. He's three.
Here's Cole's professional baseball pitch. You think his leg could get any higher? He did this every single time he pitched. Loved it! I couldn't stop laughing it was so cute.
Don't be fooled by this sweet face though. When he gets into wii mode, his competitiveness comes out. He starts saying things like, "You wanna piece a me?"
I made the mistake of letting Luke color in Cole's notebook. When Cole saw it he gasped and said, "Don't let Luke color in this ok? If you do, I'm gonna...I'm gonna westle (wrestle) you! And my muscles are weawy (really) stwong (strong)!"
And last, but not least is Bo. He's five and very competitive.
His favorite smack talk is, "I'm gonna school you!"
All together now!
I put the camera on a ten second timer to get a photo of me with them. Bo was the only one who understood that the camera was going to take a picture without me behind it. The others were a little confused so we tried it again.
They caught on real quick!
I've made up my mind! It's a done deal. I would be totally fine having all boys in my future!The board at Great Ape Trust Bonobo Hope Sanctuary placed famed scientist and center director Sue Savage-Rumbaugh on administrative leave Tuesday until investigators can look into former employees’ allegations that she is mentally unfit for the job, is endangering the apes in her care and should be replaced.
Savage-Rumbaugh will only be allowed near the apes in the presence of sanctuary veterinarian Julie Gilmore of Avondale Veterinary Healthcare Complex in Des Moines, said board chairman Ken Schweller.
“We believe that the situation at the Trust has degraded to the point that there is an immediate danger to the apes’ health and lives,” the 12 people wrote in a joint letter calling for board action.
Board chairman Kenneth Schweller, a retired Buena Vista University professor, said the organization’s board is investigating the allegations. “We’re taking it very seriously,” Schweller said. “There are some serious statements.”
“If it’s true, it’s a very serious matter,” Schweller said. He declined further comment other than to say the board would address the charges.
Savage-Rumbaugh’s reaction:
Officials discuss Tuesday’s developments:
Savage-Rumbaugh said she regularly sees a clinical psychologist in Des Moines, but is not being treated for mental illness and is fit for the job. (Register Profile: Sue Savage-Rumbaugh)
“The rumors of my mental state are greatly exaggerated and are a disservice to the bonobos,” said Savage-Rumbaugh, executive director of the sanctuary. “This is disgruntled employees.”
Savage-Rumbaugh said most of the caretakers worked at the facility when William Fields was running the program and haven’t had recent contact. A couple were laid off recently.
Savage-Rumbaugh denied the apes are in an danger. None have escaped the campus; one, Nyota, jumped over an interior fence but would not cross the water nearby and never reached the security fence on the property’s perimeter. She denied that she had put any caretakers at risk, saying they only got close to the bonobos when they requested that. No caretakers were bitten by bonobos, she claimed.
Some of the workers were frustrated that they couldn’t move up the career ladder more quickly. She said the bonobos didn’t trust some of the caretakers, making the work difficult. The three current caretakers include Savage-Rumbaugh’s sister, Liz Pugh, and Pugh’s daughter, Heather, both of whom have a long relationship with the apes.
The former workers described as former caretakers and other employees, and friends of Bonobo Hope, a relatively new nonprofit formed to run the campus when it ended its run as a research institution last year. Some have not been on the staff since the conversion to a santuary in January.
Ape trust founder Ted Townsend pulled his funding for the operation at the end of last year, as long planned, and the facility has struggled to raise money to stay open while arranging new homes for the bonobos should they need to be moved.
They called the apes “unwitting victims of human missteps” and added: .
The letter offered no proof of any of the allegations and did not describe individual incidents that led the caretakers to file reports with the board.
Medical advisers’ s investigation earlier into a cut on Teco’s foot – which Savage-Rumbaugh accused staffers of causing – found inconclusive evidence and noted the cut could have been from dry skin, a common problem in captive apes.
Savage-Rumbaugh said the facility passed inspections by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is applying for an exhibitors license that would allow the public to buy tickets for visits beginning perhaps next spring. The apes are under the care of a Des Moines veterinarian, she added.
The former caretakers want Savage-Rumbaugh replaced.
“We believe it is necessary to put another person in charge of the laboratory, effective immediately,” the caretakers wrote..
Savage-Rumbaugh, named to Time Magazine’s list of the world’s most influential people, was a pioneer in ape communication research. Her work with bonobos Kanzi and Panbanisha has drawn attention across the globe from documentary producers and major publications.
But her strengthening view that apes have real language, that they can create representational art and that they make more than simple tools have brought her criticism, Savage-Rumbaugh said.
But Savage-Rumbaugh has been described as a control freak by former ape trust staffers. Other scientists have questioned her claims that the bonobos showed language skills. Years ago, control of the bonobo lab was transferred to William Fields and Savage-Rumbaugh was declared a scientist with special standing at the trust, then a research center.
Here is the text of the letter:
We, the former associates, employees, and friends of the bonobos at Bonobo Hope/Great Ape Trust, write to you today with grave concern. We fear for the immediate health and safety of the apes at Bonobo Hope/Great Ape Trust. In the past, staff and others outside of Bonobo Hope/Great Ape Trust have raised concerns about both ape care and institutional management to no avail. Most recently, this culminated in the resignation of all but a few of the employees in December of 2011. Now, we believe that the situation at the Trust has degraded to the point that there is an immediate danger to the apes’ health and lives.
It is our belief that Sue Savage-Rumbaugh is not in a state fit to safely oversee the laboratory and bonobo care, and that her management poses a legitimate threat to the well-being of the bonobos. Additionally, it is our belief that the Board of the Trust has neglected to act in the bonobos’ best interests in choosing to support Savage-Rumbaugh. Despite the numerous and overwhelming protestations from ape-care staff, the Board has opted to keep Savage-Rumbaugh in power in an attempt to capitalize on her fame for financial reasons. This, despite the fact that care-takers have observed and reported injuries to apes, unsafe working conditions, and unauthorized ape pregnancies. We suspect that Savage-Rumbaugh’s current mental state exponentially increases the likelihood of these kinds of events happening again in the immediate future.
If you care about the bonobos, as we do, we urge you to contact the board to voice your concerns and demand answers. (They can be contacted at MABWings@aol.com, scoxe@bonobo.org, ursula@biology2.wustl.edu, howellnr@spst.edu, plasley@iastate.edu, ramon-lim@uiowa.edu, olisar@sbcglobal.net, schweller@bvu.edu, steklis@email.arizona.edu, ed-wasserman@uiowa.edu, dwildman@wayne.edu, conniewimer@bpcdm.com)
We believe it is necessary to put another person in charge of the laboratory, effective immediately..
In the past, we have brought our concerns directly to the Board. We believe that to now be insufficient given the severity of the present situation. We turn to you, and ask for your support and for your voice, to give the bonobos the safe, happy life they deserve. They are the unwitting victims of human missteps and they need outside help now more than ever.
The bonobos deserve better.

It’s also ground breaking and could save many hours and much heartache if a hard drive crashes. No. it’s not file back up but it does do that. It’s designed to make Lightroom much more useful and make file management a snap. It’s not quite released yet, I will let you know when it is and I will share with you how to get it. But that’s just what made me think about writing this blog post after I came home from dinner last night.
I Used to Suck at File Management
One surprising element of our conversation was the idea that most photographers who use Lightroom don’t really understand the file management aspect of the software and how critical it is to being a digital photographer. I didn’t either when I first bought Lightroom, but I do now and that was no easy journey.
So here’s what I came up with: Now remember, my system is for ME and may not suit you. Besides file management, this article does cover some basics on file structure and Lightroom features.
Before I tell you about my system, I will tell you about how I photograph. I am a Lens Traveler, it’s true. I don’t take out my camera until I am going on a trip. I can’t, I don’t have time while I am working. But many of my trips are spent joyfully romping the world and making photographs. Knowing I will be in remote places, I needed a system that suited my style of usage. I also wanted a system that would expand as I had more time to make more trips. I believe this is the final solution to file management and I am grateful that I have it.
Another element of my work flow is that I have a desktop (MacPro) and a MacBook. The desktop is my repository and main “catalog” while my MacBook is for use in the field. The question I get from others on trips with me is “how do you manage to get your images (with edits) back into your desktop and still preserve your tags, edits and selections?” I will show you how.
Before Lightroom
I used to dump my images in a directory all labeled with the date. That’s it. That was my file management. So in the past, I would think “Now when did I take that photo?” and if I had two minutes to have labeled that directory “Ireland 2006″ that was a bonus. I had not tagged a single image and of course could not have known if an image had been edited or not. So with such a “perfect system,” why would I want to get all complicated and spend hours learning how to use Lightroom? Because now – ALL my editing, filing, tagging, searching and even a direct connection to my LensTraveler18.com web site is automatically handled. I would go as far as saying that without Lightroom I wouldn’t be able to handle the quality and volume of images I come back from a trip with.
The Basics:
Importing Images and Keeping Them Sorted
If you don’t shoot RAW files then you are leaving behind the opportunity to get the most from each photo.
If you need to know what a RAW file is, think of it as the photographic negative. These days, a “finished print” may be a jpg or an actual print. Either way, shooting RAW is the only way to go if you are serious about making great photographs.
I suggest you set up Lightroom up to convert all your newly imported images as .DMG files. This is Adobe’s universal raw image format. It’s universal and it’s timeless. Imagine that 10 year old file from a now-obsolete camera could possibly cause you to loose access to your image, no thanks! As a bonus, there is no “side car” file and the new lossless DMG file is about 40% smaller than the original raw file. So it loads faster and it’s timeless. No brainer, just do it. You can access this setting in the “Preferences” selection under “Lightroom” from the top menu bar (on a mac) and you will see “File Handling” where you will select “dng” and while you are there, make sure your Jpg preview is set to “Medium.” Lightroom does the conversion for you when you import images. And DMG files are readable by every other software product I have ever encountered. Even Picasa reads DMG files. Of course all Adobe products do to.
While in “Preferences” Go to the “general” tab and choose “When starting up use this catalog” now select: “Prompt me when starting Lightroom” which is important later as you will see. Also while in “Preferences” go to the “External Editing” tab up top and select your color space as “ProPhoto RGB.” NEVER use sRGB unless you are interested in limiting your color space severely.
Now we can close “Preferences” and continue.
A Slightly Bigger Picture
So lets review: Shoot only raw files, open Lightroom, create a new catalog, set your import preferences to DNG file format and sit back and watch your computer work. After your images are in Lightroom, you can edit and modify them as needed. From Lightroom, you can do 5 basic functions; Library Management, Development, Slide Shows, Print and Web Site Creation. We won’t deal with the slide shows, print or web sites but library management is the key to all making everything work and if you don’t have your library management perfect, you will only suffer later, I promise. Now where does everything go….
Catalogs & Importing
This next part is the hard part, but it’s worth the trouble. I want to explain this as clearly as I can.
Here’s what took me a long time to finally get right. Remember I mentioned to you that I take my MacBook with me when I photograph? It all starts there.
When I arrive on location on the night of my first day, I create a new catalog on my MacBook named with my location and year: “Ireland 2006″ and then import my images from that day to that catalog. When importing that day’s images, I use custom text and key words. I like using the day number (Day 1, Day 2, etc) and general location for file name, which you specify when starting your import.One other nuance, I like to use the file number that comes from the camera so “day one-4567″ is not the same as “day one-3874″ from an earlier trip. Since tagging is universal with each batch you import, I try to keep it simple. I might have as my tag for that day “County Claire” and then as I scan through the images, I can tag more directly each image as I need.
Now I create a “Collection Set” named with the destination I am in, like “Ireland 2006″ the collection set name perseveres in my main (home) library but the catalog name does not. Ultimately I will erase the MacBook’s catalog and library since I don’t need it anymore.
I then create a sub-collection for “day one” and I drop my picks in there. I do the same thing every day and this starts my sorting process. As I build HDR images from the raw photo imports, I drop those finished HDR’s into the day they were shot. Finally I have another sub-collection called finalists. And yes, I can probably avoid this next step but I create another sub-collection called “gallery” where I sort through the finalists and drop those into my gallery collection.
Meanwhile, as I travel and throughout my trip, I can edit files, tag, modify images to my hearts content and preserve all those changes in my main catalog and not lose one bit of work. I review my images upon downloading, I quickly view them and press “P” for picks as I see the ones I like.
Docking with The Mother Ship
When I get home, I take my MacBook and open Lightroom, then choose “Export as Catalog” which consolidates all my files into one bundle and puts them in a package Lightroom can import, and export those using a small USB drive. Then, on my Mac Pro, I import them using the command “import catalog” as shown below.
That’s exactly how I am set up to move files from my MacBook to my Mac Pro when I travel.
Drive Strategy
Two observations: As my catalog increased in size it slowed down considerably. I found several blog posts referring to this phenomenon. I have about 15,000 which is considered a medium size library, but it was still slow. I found out that previews are what slows down the catalog loading times and affect perceived performance. So putting the catalog/previews on a much faster drive and the image library on a separate drive made a lot of sense.
Some people run their entire image library on external drives. I wasn’t going that route, I decided on splitting my drive resources with an SSD as my boot/applications drive. I found this SSD on sale for $249. Its probably not the fastest possible SSD drive but it’s darn fast and I am so glad I made the decision to upgrade. I will also use two conventional server-grade 1 TB drives each for Photos and Music. I have a large Music collection from idle days spent ripping CD’s and my live recordings of jazz/rock/blues bands but that’s another story.
So you can see logically, this is all simple to understand; 3 drives, each with a dedicated purpose. Yet, it did take some months of part-time tinkering to get it all to work. I started with a clean O/S install on the SSD and it booted so fast I thought it was haunted. Then I started to reload my apps, one at a time. Some were quick and easy, others took a long time to reinstall.
I knew from reading warnings that I couldn’t actually copy my whole library from my old 2 TB drive to the new “Photos” drive so I did some digging and experimentation.
This next point is critical; You can’t move anything on the hard drive without doing it from within Lightroom or you will have difficulty linking the catalog and the library contents together. So with that in mind, I booted from the old 2 tb hard drive and exported catalogs one at a time to the photo drive, then imported them one at a time into the new installation of lightroom after rebooting from the SSD. This was tedious but it preserved all my settings, changes, edits, etc.
Another pain in the rear I hadn’t anticipated was that all my add-on’s had to be re-installed. One at a time, all the presets, all the add-on’s everything I had painstakingly set up had to be redone. Same with all my external links to my facebook page and my SmugMug site. But now it’s done and I am fully operational again.
Backup Strategy
Wow, so all that sounds kind of complicated, right? I mean THREE drives that all must be backed up and a full recovery plan on what to do if one crashes. Let me explain how I back up. And before I do, I hope that someone reading this will tell me what they do so I can compare.
I use a three tier strategy for back up.
Tier One: – SSD – Boot Disk is backed up with Time Machine. My thinking is that if the SSD drive crashed I can have a new one in 24 hours (thank you Amazon.com) and reload the OS, then restore from time machine, down time about one day.
Tier Two: – I use a 2 TB USB drive from IO Safe, which is a fireproof, waterproof vault drive which is partitioned to 3 drives. Each night SuperDuper incrementally duplicates each of those three drives and makes exact duplicates of each.
Tier Three: – And then finally I use to upload all my files to the cloud for $50 a year unlimited storage.
Now there’s one other backup strategy that I employ and it’s free but it’s only for a small amount of data. I use SugarSync to keep all my business files synchronized between my MacBook and Mac Pro. That’s just to make life a little easier and it’s totally free.
My Paranoid Plan for a MacBook Crash
While traveling to Bhutan (a small country between Bangladesh and India) my buddy Ron’s MacBook crashed. It happened on Day One. Wow, that really is a blow. I realized then that I couldn’t risk it happening to me. So here’s what I do. I use CarbonCopyCloner to clone my drive to an identical drive in a small USB case that I carry with me in my briefcase, along with two screwdrivers. Every night before I go to sleep, I set up CCC to clone my MacBook drive.
Those screwdrivers and the USB drive will allow me to swap drives in about 10 minutes. I also carry a OSX Leopard DVD which allows me to use disk utility on my drive if it needs to be repaired by the OS. So far, I haven’t needed this, my MacBook has been solid but none the less, I feel a lot better having it with me. And it works great. Note: With Lion, there’s a hidden boot drive on your hard disk but if you are not near the internet or of your whole drive is fried, that hidden drive won’t be accessible either.
Conclusion
Maybe I should have stuck with 3 trays of chemistry and a print washer…. Not sure. But I DO love Lightroom and I really appreciate what it can do. Now that I know I can totally preserve my photography and never lose anything to a mishap or a drive failure, I wouldn’t ever go back to doing it the old way.
If you have a different/interesting backup strategy of your own, please tell me all about it, and show me your gallery! I love to see how others have solved this problem.

Hey Mitch,
thanks for sharing your thoughts on your lightroom workflow and file management; very much appreciated. What I liked most was the section ‘catalogs & importing’.
My questions, however, is related to the subsequent section ‘docking with The Mother Ship':
1) I’d love to know how you handle tags (and tag structure) you added to your pictures while being on the road during the import process?
2) You wrote that you start off with a new catalog on your MacBook, meaning that you every time establish new tags. What happens when you return home, import everything into the main catalog on MacPro and realise you have a very similar tag already in your main catalog, e.g. car/cars, rain/rainy, English/British?
Any ideas how to avoid this from the very beginning?
Thanks for taking care,
stephan
Edit ad 1) I was talking about the import process on your MacPro. So both questions deal with problems that may come up when transfering your pictures + meta data from MacBook to MacPro.
Thanks, stephan
Hi Stephan,
Glad you enjoyed the article.
Luckily Lightroom is smart enough to know how to handle tags pretty well. Later when searching with tags, LR returns all variations of tags and you can batch change tags if you make a mistake. I enter tags in two stages. Since I travel with my MacBook, I import every day to my MacBook, When I arrive “in country” I create a “collection set” for the trip with the name of the trip like “New Zealand.” I immediately add the following collections called: “All Photos” “Final Selections” and “Gallery Picks”. Then as I shoot, I add all images for that day to a new sub-collection called “Day 1″ and in that collection I place all images from both my Infrared Sony RX100 and my DSLR. Then the next day I do the same for “Day 2″ and as I import my images I use a general tag. The import screen lets you tag as importing and those are generally simple, broad tags like IR or “Auckland” but something that applies to all that import batch.
To more specifically answer your question, I standardize on my tag structure so I have “car/cars” standardized. I never use plurals so car, boat, ship, are always singular. When I get back home and after docking with the Mother Ship, I then get more specific with my images and that’s where I can get more detailed with tags. Cleaning up mistakes is simple should you use England/UK/British, just batch process those images with the incorrect tag to fix.
One other point; file names. As I import, I use the file name to identify the trip I am on. So this last trip to New Zealand I used a file name that started as NZ. So IR images would have an import file name as NZ-IR and then the continuous file number assigned by the camera. I used to extend that to include the day (NZ-IR-Day1) but that became awkward and wasn’t useful so I dropped it.
I wish I could post an image here, I would show you the structure in my Lightroom Collections.
Hope that helps!

And we found that perfect warming trend courtesy of Keira Knightley, who was spotted not once, but twice rocking Burberry's A-line shearling pea coat.
Knightley was first seen bundling up in Burberry outside the Comedy Theatre in London on Saturday (Dec. 5) -- opening night of her new play, "The Misanthrope."
Then, last night upon exiting the theater (left), the actress donned an almost identical outfit: the same boho chic shearling coat, slouchy blue scarf, faded jeans and motorcycle boots.
The $3,995 coat; available at all Burberry stores, has also been snapped up by Cameron Diaz and Blake Lively.
With its perfect fashion-meets-function balance, who can fault Knightley for wearing the shearling style on multiple occasions in just two days?
Um, we'd probably be sleeping in it.

Coachella Announces 2015 Dates
Coachella’s 2015 dates have already been announced. The Coachella festival will take place on two consecutive weekends from April 10th to the 12th and April 17th to the 19th Indio, California at at Empire Polo Grounds. General admission passes are priced at $375, while VIP passes are $799 on the primary market. Of course, we’ll have all secondary market Coachella tickets as well.
….
Since its inception in 1999 Coachella has become one of the the largest and best music festivals to hit North America bolstering a fantastic lineup made up of some of the biggest names in music. This year Coachella once again will be one of hardest tickets to find as it will be headlined by the likes of Arcade Fire, Muse and for the second straight year Outkast on April 11-13 and the following weekend April 18-20 at Indio’s Empire Polo Club.
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of their first album (Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik) Outkast, the legendary hip-hop duo, will be making their much anticipated reunion at Coachella just like Iggy & The Stooges, Portishead and Pixies before them. The two rappers, Andre 3000 and Big Boi split up following the release of Idlewild in 2006 to better concentrate on their solo careers and will close out the festival on Friday following acts the likes of Swedish avant-garde duo The Knife, supergroup Broken Bells and superstar DJ Zedd with Ellie Goulding, Haim, Chromeo, The Replacements, Neko Case, Bryan Ferry, Afghan Whigs, The Glitch Mob, Martin Garrix and AFI just some of the names also confirmed to play the first day.
In what will surely be one of the best festivals of the year and there are still thousands of Coachella tickets are still available on TiqIQ with three-day passes available for the first weekend at a get-in price of $482 and an average price of $918.17 with the second weekend going for $413/$756.41. With Coachella tickets selling out at the box office in less than three hours, the secondary is now your only buying option.
The headlining band on Saturday will the be progressive-rock trio Muse who will be playing fresh off of their 122 show The 2nd Law World Tour which ends the week before. Also playing on day two of the festival will be dubstep pioneer Skrillex, one of the most musically gifted people there is Pharrell, the teenage singer Lorde in addition to Queens Of The Stone Age, Foster The People, Pet Shop Boys, MGMT, Empire Of The Sun, Fatboy Slim, The Naked and Famous, Kid Cudi, Sleigh Bells, Cage The Elephant, Capital Cities and Nas.
On Sunday, the final day of Coachella, Arcade Fire will headline and close out the entire weekend, taking a break from their own Reflektor tour to do so. The variety of acts is what makes Coachella great because while Arcade Fire is an indie-rock band they festival also has legendary metal veterans Motorhead, pop music from Lana Del Rey, and one of the top EDM performers Calvin Harris joining the likes of Beck, Neutral Milk Hotel, Disclosure, Alesso, Duck Sauce, Little Dragon, Beady Eye, The 1975, Chance The Rapper and Rudimental on the same day.
(UPDATE) Coachella has announced artists for a series of. More about these sideshows can be seen below:
(UPDATE) This year, Coachella will be offering live broadcast of the festival on YouTube & AXS TV. This will be the first time they’ve ever done this. The first weekend (4/11-13) will be streamed on YouTube, while the second weekend (4/18-20) will be broadcast on AXS TV. According to reports, viewers will be able to watch behind the scenes footage, interviews with artist, on-demand video playbacks and over 20 hours of live footage.
(UPDATE) There were several huge cameos during the first weekend of Coachella this Saturday. During Pharrell’s headlining set, Nelly, Busta Rhymes, Gwen Stefani and Snoop Dogg. Then, during Nas’ set which included most songs off his 1994 classic, Illmatic, he brought out Jay-Z and Beyonce. Clearly, it was an impressive list of surprise guests. The only question now is who will make an appearance this weekend?
…
This year’s line-up will have to go some way to top Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre bringing Tupac back to life. But with Blur, The Stone Roses, Phoenix and Red Hot Chili Peppers confirmed as headliners, Coachella tickets for 2013 are understandably still the hottest property on the US festival circuit with tickets selling out in just 21 hours. Currently, we have just over 200 weekend passes available for the opening weekend starting at $183, and over 450 for the second weekend starting at $49.
Staged in the remote desert setting of Indio’s Empire Polo Club, the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival first arrived on the live scene in 1999, just three months after the disastrous final ever Woodstock.
Initially a two-day camping-free event, the festival slowly grew in stature over the next decade thanks to performances from world-renowned artists including Beastie Boys, Madonna, Leonard Cohen, Jay-Z, Rage Against The Machine and Prince, and by 2012, had become so popular that organisers decided to extend it to six days over two consecutive weekends.
Alongside the headline-grabbing Tupac hologram, last year also saw acts as varied as Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Florence and The Machine, David Guetta, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and A$AP Rocky take to the five various stages, while Rihanna, Usher, Eminem and 50 Cent also made unscheduled appearances.
But anyone with Coachella tickets for the 2013 spectacle, held over the April 12-14 and 19-21 weekends, can indulge themselves in a similarly eclectic feast of the best contemporary music has to offer.
In addition to headline sets from two of Britain’s most influential guitar bands, Friday artists include the recently reunited Jurassic 5, Trent Reznor’s side-project, How To Destroy Angels, and Mercury Prize winners Alt-J, as well as several bands currently enjoying their biggest commercial success (Foals, Tegan & Sara), veterans Sparks and Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry and long-awaited returns from Modest Mouse and Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
Saturday’s roster is equally intriguing with French synth-rock outfit Phoenix joined by comebacks from The Postal Service and Franz Ferdinand, a DJ set from Moby and performances from soundtrack favourites The xx and Sigur Ros alongside names from the worlds of Latin rock (Café Tacuba), French electronica (Birdy Nam Nam) and Detroit hip-hop (Danny Brown), not to mention the man behind the “Harlem Shake,” Baauer.
Anthony Kiedis and co. will then bring their mammoth I’m With You tour to a close on the two Sundays. But not before the likes of superstar DJs Eric Prydz and Paul Oakenfold, synth-pop outfits both old (OMD) and new (La Roux) and a reformed Wu Tang Clan have taken to the stage, while just two days after appearing with Grinderman, Nick Cave will make his second appearance at the festival with The Bad Seeds.
Those with Coachella tickets that want to stay on site for the whole weekend can also park their tents on various lush beautiful grass fields adjacent from the performance areas with facilities including showers, a general store and internet café with free wi-fi. While just as much a celebration of the visual arts, festival-goers can also enjoy an array of installations and sculptures located throughout the polo grounds.
Friday, April 12th & 19thth and 20thth and 21st

wiil chance the rapper,vic mensa, or mike posner perform?Wallaby winger Drew Mitchell notched twice as the Barbarians claimed an exciting 26-20 victory over South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday afternoon.
The Springboks had been hoping to exact some revenge for their defeat at the hands of the Baa-Baas at the same ground in 2007 but they ultimately left themselves with too much to do after an opening quarter in which they conceded three tries, with Mitchell dotting either side of his compatriot James O'Connor.
Indeed, the Springboks, fielding only three of the side who started last weekend's 21-11 victory over England last weekend, were run off their feet in the first half as the all-star Baa Baas turned on the style. Coach Peter De Villers retained only winger Lwazi Mvovo, scorer of the second Springbok try which sealed England's fate, lock Bakkies Botha and flanker Juan Smith, who led the side in the absence of the injured Victor Matfield.
The Barbarians, fielding six All Blacks and six Australians, including 20-year-old Wallabies winger O'Connor at fullback, brought flair and attacking ambition to Twickenham. Wales flanker Martyn Williams was their only British starter but he was prominent as the Barbarians applied the early pressure which resulted in lively Australian scrum-half Will Genia's neat reverse pass sending countryman Mitchell powering in for the opening try after six minutes.
While the invitation side opted for scrums or tapped their penalties in true Barbarians tradition, South Africa opted to kick theirs to try and stay in touch and 20-year-old fly-half Elton Jantjies opened their account in the 10th minute.
But the Barbarians hit them with two tries in a devastating five-minute spell to stretch their lead to 19-3 after only 21 minutes. Prop Neemia Tialata gratefully accepted a long botched line-out throw from South African hooker Adriaan Strauss to drive to within a yard of the try-line. The Baa Baas whipped the ball along the line and Kiwi powerhouse Ma'a Nonu's gave O'Connor the space to run in unchallenged for a try which the youngster converted from the touchline.
Jantjies missed a rushed penalty attempt, after the ball fell over, but there was no stopping the flamboyant Barbarians and Mitchell struck again in the 21st minute. His Wallabies team-mate Adam Ashley-Cooper was felled as he kicked ahead but Mitchell won the chase to touch down loose ball and O'Connor was again on target from wide out.
A barnstorming run by flanker Willem Alberts, scorer of last weekend's first try against England as a replacement, enabled South Africa to mount their best first-half attack and hooker Strauss drove into the heart of Baa Baas' defence but it all came to nothing when scrum-half Francois Hougaard spilled a straightforward pass.
South Africa finally got a foothold in the game four minutes into the second half, courtesy of a telegraphed pass from Nonu which enabled right-wing Odwa Ndungane to intercept and race half the length of the pitch before touching down between the posts to leave Jantjies an easy conversion. However, Jantjies missed the chance to cut the deficit to six points when he missed another easy penalty shot after 57 minutes.
Giteau passed up the chance to stretch the Barbarians' lead to 12 points when he went for touch instead of kicking a simple penalty and, following a concentrated spell of pressure, the bold approach paid off when Quintin Geldenhayes, their South African-born Italy international replacement prop, bundled over in the left corner with O'Connor again on target.
South Africa rallied with two late tries, from lock Botha in the 71st minute and replacement hooker Bandise Maku in the last attack, to put a respectable slant on the scoreline but it was too little, too late.

The daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith filmed the video in Sylmar, Calif., in September with director Ray Kay – who has also helmed clips for Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and Beyoncé.
In the video, which debuts on BET on Monday (the single hits iTunes Oct. 26), the pint-sized singer – who is signed to Jay-Z's record label – gets playful with her wardrobe and some paint, and joins guest stars ranging in age from 1 to 85 who, you guessed it, whip their hair back and forth for the cameras.

"The search and rescue operations are still going on, as long as there are still people missing," said Relan Asuncion, section chief of the civil defence office.
The death toll was up from 68 but the number of missing was down from Monday's earlier report of 84, authorities said.
Asuncion told AFP that aside from the additional bodies being found, the number of missing was falling as field units removed the names of those who had been listed twice.
Conson slammed into the country on July 13, directly hitting the capital Manila as it cut westward into the South China Sea with a ferocity that caught weather forecasters by surprise.
It caused massive power outages across Luzon, toppled power lines, uprooted trees and destroyed thousands of homes.
Days later, the damage caused by the storm was still being counted with over 2,000 people still sheltered in evacuation centres, the government said.
In China the storm killed at least two people, and left one dead and about a dozen missing in Vietnam.On an average, orders are delivered within 3-5 working days from the date of payment (for orders placed on).

The Anchorage Daily News reports that clerk Steve Cunningham sent a letter to the mayor and city council on Friday seeking to rescind his resignation letter. He resigned amid a controversy over whether he gave improper advice to a group seeking to recall former Mayor Roger Purcell.
Mayor Rosemary Burnett says council members will meet on Monday. If Cunningham still wants to rescind his resignation then, they will discuss his termination. Burnett says she has mixed feelings over the issue and doesn't trust Cunningham anymore.

Whether I would live or die,
was what happened to me when you arrived.
Luckily with love we both surprisingly survived,
so thankful I am for your guardian to arrive.
Although im not with you day to day,
in my heart you will always stay.
Remember now you are no child but now a man,
and in FAITH,LOVE,TRUST and HOPE you will stand.
One day not too far
as my love is unconditional I'll love you for whom you are.
Dont let time apart for us to grow cold,
as we love our God we keep firm hold.
Now I leave you always with regret,
but my love for you I shall not forget.
You are in my prayers every night,
That God and I embrace you tight.
So I bid you well and you will see,
that one day we will establish a family.
Always be here as your mum,
and look forward to catch up on fun.

Agree with the above and can’t think of anything that drives this point home in stark relief more than the problem of Americans allowing or participating in the murder of tens of millions of unborn children.
If we want to restore our honor, and by extension, free our nation from the filth in Congress and the WH, we might start by ending the American reign of terror that started for the unborn in 1973.
Abortion has slaughtered American children and killed America’s soul.
It is literally the blood that the Left feeds off of for their demonic strength, while we “patriots”, we “Christians”, have shockingly allowed it to continue as we lived high on the hog until the rats that we politically empowered to practice and support their diabolical trade started to put the squeeze on us.
Now we rally?? For who?
I find it incredibly disappointing, offensive, really, that 40 MILLION AMERICAN DEAD remained nameless and forgotten at a rally where “restoring honor” and recognizing our American brethren was to be the order of the day.
If we can’t stop the butchering of our innocent posterity; if we don’t have the cajones to amend OUR Constitution, then everything else is just window dressing.
And no one should wonder why we are about to reap the whirlwind.

Other countries that have great-sounding constitutions, but are hellholes because, if you slip the judge $1000, he’ll wipe his behind with the constitution and give you any decision you want. That’s not any problem of constitutional wording. That’s a problem of the soul. That’s a problem that America can have too, if we lose our souls.
RBMN on August 28, 2010 at 10:44 PM
I’ll have to be brutally honest here, though. After arranging the rally, Beck should’ve kept an extremely low profile and should’ve just had a wide variety of other speakers (including Palin) take the podium. It does look uncomfortably egotistical to me (though I do believe Beck is sincere). This is why Limbaugh wisely avoids things like this.

Cindy Munford on August 28, 2010 at 10:46 PM
According to standardized tests, I know more about history than 99.97% of American high school graduates. And I occasionally learn things from the Glen Beck show – not from his blackboard lectures, but from the great historian guests he has on.
Especially the stuff about religion. That stuff has gone down the memory hole in America’s federal school system.
But, as important as that obviously is, the part I found most fascinating was about the lies that are taught about religion in American liberal arts classes – in institutes of so-called “higher education.”
For years I’d heard libtards babble endlessly about how our founding fathers were all atheists. I try to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it’s just the drugs talking, but if they were JUST stupid, they’d say random things. Some would call the founding fathers atheists, sure, but an equal number would say they wore Spam on their heads, or communicated only through interpretive dance, etc…
Then I saw on Glen Beck that all the over-educated morons are actually TAUGHT that kind of crap in “college.” Apparently, some freak wrote a book 70 years ago, based on a line in a letter from Ben Franklin wherein he called himself a “deist,” and then the “scholor” spent 1500 pages jabbering that Franklin really meant to say he and all the other founders are actually atheists.
How screwed up is that?
Now I can’t help but wonder what ELSE don’t I know about the things these morons are being taught.

Yes, why can`t it just be accepted as such! What he did today could well shift this country back in the right direction and at the least he has helped. Even the left understand at a visceral level how dangerous this message is to them. It rips the heart right out of their big government progressive nanny message and their being, in my opinion. Just look at their reactions today! I expect overdrive, out of control reaction 10:49 PM
They’re going to do that anyway. But then this rally wouldn’t have been just about Palin and Beck. I know it wasn’t, really, but the prominent role Beck took in the whole proceedings just makes it too easy to make it ALL about Beck. As I said, this is why you haven’t seen Limbaugh do any Tea Party stuff or join in demonstrations during the health care debate.

Some Christians including me have been trying to explain our concern about Glenn Beck, a non-Christian, leading a rally that resembled a Christian revival, included Beck’s own suggestion that God financially blessed the rally, and concluded with Amazing Grace.

I defer to Alveda King in revising my above statement to include her mention of the unborn. I know she works for Priests for Life and as I was posting above the thought went through my mind that maybe she mentioned something.
However, I fear it’s much too little, much too late. IMHO the rally should have been a call to arms: Amend the Constitution to respect life and RESTORE SANCTITY.
Tragically, as long as we allow abortion, we are the most dishonorable of people.
When will we recognize that abortion is the one thing the Left treasures and visciously protects, above all else? And why? Because abortion is the linchpin, cornerstone and foundation of all their foul deeds. From the blood of innocents they draw their dark power.
Their love of it is beyond grotesque. The “Leader of the Free World” loves it so much that he singlehandedly destroyed a bill that would have prevented infanticide.
Abortion is their “Ring of Power”. Destroy it, and you will destroy them.

Whether you like Glenn Beck and/or Sarah Palin does not matter today. Today is about recognizing that we live in the greatest country on God’s green earth and it is time to reclaim our heritage. As President John Adams said:
It is time for Americans to remember our heritage and to realize the role that God and His Divine Providence played in the establishment of this country as the greatest on Earth. It is time to restore honor.

Somewhere there is someone who does not lack
And he has been calling back
Sounding like thunder and in tune with America’s heartbeat
It’s gonna take a Charles Martel Knight to get America back on it’s feet
Through the wind and the chill
And the storm and the flood
Can’t you feel Allen West’s approach
Like a fire in the blood?

Electrongod on August 28, 2010 at 11:03 PM
Again, why is only Beck up to something here? How did he fool/coerce the other 240 leaders that hold differing faiths and fundementals betwen themselves? I assume they were predominately Christian though. Why does it have to be something other that what his stated goals were? Give it a rest, why try to tear down what I think was good that was done today?
If you have to persist, what exactly about his message today was bad? Please don`t answer with what is bad about Beck or Mormons.

Don’t be.
The biggest take home for me is that we are all brothers and sisters in spirit. We all need to, from time to time, draw comfort that we don’t share our burden alone by ourselves.
Even though we think one person is so small (or helpless), but Beck and Palin (and others) showed us what just a single person can do. Beck has/had his calling, Palin hers. Each one of us has our unique role (yet) to play.

Considering MLK was a man of faith, I think a discussion on faith was apropriate for today.
“”No lie can live forever.” I am convinced of this because I believe William Cullen Bryant is right. “Truth pressed to earth will rise again.” I am convinced of this because I think James Russell Lowell is right. “Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne; Yet that scaffold sways the future, And behind the dim unknown, Standeth God within the shadow, Keeping watch above His own.” Somehow with this faith, we will be able to adjourn the councils of despair and bring new life into the dark chambers of pessimism. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation to a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. This will be a great day. ” – MLK
A great day indeed.

I haven’t the time to read previous comments. I found today’s broadcast from D.C. bizarre, yet moving.
Beck, I believe, felt the calling in his heart and answered.
Not what I was expecting, to be sure.
He could have better served the conservative cause most likely with reason and rhetoric, but he was pulled in another direction from Elsewhere, and I can’t fault that.

That was their name all along, actually.
The lamest thing about sectarians condemning each other is that each and every one of them has the rhetorical “authority” to declare all but their own personal study group to be heretics, and not one issues their bile while contemplating that they are just as easily voted off the island their own selves.
Maquis on August 28, 2010 at 11:11 PM
The liberal propagada hate-o-meter is always pegged. Their rhetoric, likewise, is always precisely as insane as they believe they can get away with.
They can never change the volume or intensity of their propaganda in even the slightest degree; all they can do is change the TARGET of their attacks.
That’s why I find the “conservatives” who pile on in attacking the left’s current targets of choice especially reprehensible.
We are in the trenches, and these people are sticking their heads up and taking all the flak. I have absolutely no patience whatsoever for the cowards who keep their heads buried firmly in the dirt and snipe at the braver soldiers’ backs because “they’re just making the enemy mad at us.”

Most here are not “Beck Kool Aid Drinkers”, just don’t understand your harping on Mormonism. There were members of many different denominations on that stage and the was no “recruitment” of any specific faith. You are missing the forest because of that tree in your eye.

Get rid of the religious message – you still have half a million, mostly Conservative citizens of this nation showing up on a Saturday in August. That sends a message to the Left that they have overstepped.
There’s your critical thinking – there’s no downside here at all.

Boardman Robinson Mural
In 1940, Colorado artist Boardman Robinson created a fabulous 6' x 12' painting for the then-two-year-old Englewood post office, where the mural's been on display ever since. Late last year, though, the U.S. Postal Service suggested that this office might be closed and its operations consolidated with other locations — which meant that the Boardman might go the way of a 43-cent stamp. But after considerable uproar, the Postal Service reversed course, the Boardman was spared, and now Congresswoman Diana DeGette is working to get the building stamped with a seal of approval from the National Register of Historic Places.

-Greetings from Drilling Vessel Chikyu! We are floating precisely at N37o 57' E143o54'. 1..
Within two months, the Japanese journal Earth, Planets, and Space collected the first scientific results and made them available for free to the public: you can download the papers here. These and other rapid reports started to paint a picture of a very unusual earthquake. First, the distance the fault slipped in less than 3 minutes seemed to have been greater than any earthquake ever observed (as much as 60 m) 2. Second, whereas earthquakes usually show a pattern of larger slip distance at depth, decreasing toward the surface, the Tohoku earthquake actually increased to maximum slip near the surface, right to the ocean floor in the Japan Trench3. This bumped the sea floor straight up about 5 m -- pushing the base of the water column in a sudden undercut 4. It was this great bump from below that created the tsunami wave.
So, what was so special about this fault on that particular day, which made it behave differently than faults do in typical very large earthquakes (if there are such things)? That's what D/V Chikyu is here to find out. This expedition was rapidly assembled to capitalize on a rare opportunity, to access a fault that has slipped so much, while the fault is literally still hot from the friction. We know from studying faults on land, like the Chelungpu Fault in Taiwan or the Median Tectonic Line in Japan, that after an earthquake the fault zone rapidly changes. Cracks close up, groundwater flows through and cools things down, new minerals grow to repair the damage. So if we want to see the earthquake source when it's hot and fresh, the only option is to drill into it, as soon as possible after the earthquake. The Tohoku earthquake, with its extreme slip at shallow levels, is offering us a window into the fault processes that usually only occur at greater depths. As our expedition co-chief Jim Mori recently told Nature, we have a rare "opportunity, maybe even a responsibility" to learn what we can from this event, and apply that to other areas where the risks are still unknown5.
Figure 1: Paleomagneticist Toshi Mishima from Osaka City College and legendary subduction geologist Casey Moore from UC Santa Cruz examine the LWD tools with Schlumberger engineer Michael Weng Feng.
We are here 6910 m above the sea floor at the Japan Trench, building drill pipe segments 40 meters at a time, as the drill bit descends almost 7 km below us. Built into the drill pipe are sensitive instruments that will reveal images of the world below the seafloor. Some data, the roughest picture, will be sent by the instruments up to the ship by acoustic signals running up through the down-flowing drilling mud. More detailed data, and higher resolution images, will be recovered from the instruments' memory when they are back aboard ship. This will give us the first view of that rock which slid more than 50 m eastward on March 11, 2011. We'll use the measurements of rock properties and maps of rock layers (and the damage) to try to precisely pinpoint the position of the fault. Then when we return to the seafloor with the coring bit to collect a long, thin, vertical sample of the fault zone, we will use these images and maps of properties to help us find the fault in the core, and extrapolate out of our 56 mm-wide window into the earth.
Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) and Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD)
On this expedition we are using two downhole measurement techniques: Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) and Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD). LWD tools measure properties of the rock in the wall of the borehole, while MWD tools collect information about the condition of the borehole. These data are sent back to the drillers in real time and used to maximize drilling efficiency and borehole stability.
Logging-While-Drilling allows us to get a picture of the subsurface strata before we drill to recover core samples, much in the way that a doctor might X-Ray before operating, and is a commonly used technique in the oil and gas industry. Without LWD, a hole might be drilled and the bit pulled out, then a string of similar tools on a "wireline" would be lowered into the hole to make measurements of the rock properties - assuming that the hole stayed open and stable! With LWD, the measurements are made just behind the bit while the hole is drilled.
The tools are built into pieces of pipe (Figure 1) and fitted between the bit and the drill string, so multiple measurements are taken simultaneously as the bit penetrates the sediment. Some tools carry their own batteries, while others use smallturbines to gain power from the flow of drill mud pumped from the ship above. These also use the flow of mud as a means of communication back to the drillers. By slight constrictions in the flow, they create an acoustic signal that travels up through the down-flowing mud to code for pressure, hole deviation, and temperature. A wire or cable would be problematic due to the rapidly rotating drill pipe. They collect a lot more data than can be sent in this way, which is stored in the instrument memory until they return to the boat.
Figure 2: Electrical resistivity images of a borehole drilled off the coast of southwest Japan on Expedition 314 in the Nankai Trough subduction zone.6
Figure 2 shows two electrical resistivity images of borehole walls taken in a similar subduction zone offshore southwest Japan6. The darker areas are conductive - often because there is more water there - and the bright yellow areas are resistive, solid rock. So the resistivity image allows logging scientists to pick out the details of the rock structure - beds of different types of sediment, or dark lines which are water-filled cracks. The great utility of LWD/MWD data is that they are a continuous, in situ dataset of the physical properties of the formations drilled downhole, and it enables drilling decisions to be made on the fly. In fragile, fractured and potentially unstable formations, this may be the only information which can be recovered. In our case, we will use these data to guide the core recovery. Physical properties will later be measured on pieces of core, in the ship's laboratories, and in the home laboratories of the scientists on board, but these are small samples, and it's impossible to completely avoid disturbance when coring. So the LWD information is a valuable field check on core observations, and offers a view of fractures in the wallrock which might be too widely spaced to be measured in drill core, but might be important for permeability around the fault. In the case that there are gaps in the core we recover (and there usually are a lot of gaps when drilling in damaged rock) we can compare our samples to the LWD logs to try to place them back in the right position.
Figure 3: Drilling crew tighten the logging tools into place in the drill string on the rig floor of Chikyu.

383 HoursThe Melissa virus, a Microsoft Word macro virus, was but a simple Word macro virus in a long line of Word macro viruses. It differed only in "the speed in which it spread," according to Richard Pethia of CERT1.
Ever since the original winword.concept virus came out in 1995, one copycat macro virus after another came out with varying payloads. This concept virus prompted Microsoft to make the Word Document and Template (.DOT) format information available to anti-virus vendors. Unfortunately, no easily searchable Internet sites provide an exact date for when this was done, but it was likely done around 1996 or 1997.
Word macro viruses spread because of Word's ability to interpret a file's type regardless of its filename extension. Word will recognize a Rich Text Format document, a Word Template, a Word Document, and many third-party document types regardless of their filenames. This allowed virus writers to create Templates with macro code which looked like Documents. Even in 2006 this is a desired feature, and was available in every version of Word since Word 6.0 for Windows 3.1.
Since those times, anti-virus vendors included Word documents in their scans for known viruses, even though Word 95's second revision included a "macro virus protection" switch in one of their options panels which prevented macros in documents from launching. Every version of Word since Word 95's second revision included this switch, and older versions could still use the scanprot2 macro developed by Microsoft to parse Templates and remove all macros.
In spite of Scanprot and Word's later inclusion of macro virus protection, anti-virus vendors insisted their products could detect and remove macro viruses from infected templates posing as documents. When Melissa first came along in 1999, every anti-virus scanner failed to detect it. Other products, along with Word itself, could catch it and remove it, but popular scanners could not catch Melissa without an update. By the time updates were available, it was far too late.
Thus ends the first part of Melissa's Ultimate Lesson:
Popular anti-virus software failed to do its job.
Melissa slipped past anti-virus gateways on mail servers. It slipped past anti-virus extensions in e-mail applications. It slipped past desktop virus scanners. Yet Word -- a Microsoft product -- could catch Melissa before Melissa was written at least two years before Melissa's outbreak.
In spite of this, Pethia of CERT, and others, insisted that we should stay with "tried and true" security products, even though they failed us.
Thus ends the second part of Melissa's Ultimate Lesson:
We can catch viruses before the fact. Don't let the 'experts' tell you otherwise.

While last night's premiere in New York looked glamorous on camera, on the scene it was another story entirely. From a controversial remark made by the franchise’s token villainness to fashion mishaps to thousands of ticketless die-hard fans ending up in tears, the scene outside Radio City Music Hall last night was chaotic and Cosmo-drenched. And that was just the crowd! As for the stars of the film, there were signs that sex-despising Sarah Jessica Parker's co-stars weren't entirely pleased to pose in front of the movie's poster (you know, the one that they don't even appear on).

Manual:Hello Kitty comes to the 16th Street Mall at Lollipop Gift (photos)
Do you know why Hello Kitty has no mouth? Because she speaks from the heart...
She also has a hypnotic, straight-up obsessive effect on American consumers that hasn't seemed to flag since her debut in the States in 1976. This ubiquitous, mouthless Sanrio-creation has become a veritable fetish for women, girls -- and more than a few men. For example, Troy Moore and Kenneth Chan really, really love Hello Kitty, and they've taken their happy, pink bow-adorned fee-fees and parlayed them into Lollipop Gift, a modestly-sized, exclusive Hello Kitty store located in the first floor of the Denver Pavilions, next door to Claire's.
"Even one-year-old toddlers recognize Hello Kitty," says Moore.
The store opened the day before Thanksgiving, just in time for the holiday shopping season, and according to Moore and Chan, business has been fantastic so far. "The most popular items are the totes and the dolls," says Chan, also a personal collector of everything HK.
"He has about 300 Hello Kitty things at his house," chuckles Moore.
There appears to be a stockpile of every HK thing imaginable in the store, including a huge robotic Hello Kitty in the front display window -- sadly, it's not for sale, but Moore says they've had plenty of offers for it.
What's the weirdest Hello Kitty item customers have asked for? "The Hello Kitty sewing machine," Chan says. "We don't carry it because I don't think it would sell here." Also absent is any trace of the popular Hello Kitty "personal massagers," another item that Chan thinks wouldn't work in Denver.
And the big question: Do any straight men actually shop there? "Yes," says Chan. "Many businessmen from out-of-town looking for gifts for their daughters -- we usually have to help them."
Moore and Chan are trying to wrangle the official Sanrio mascot to come from Japan for a visit to the Denver store, "hopefully in the spring," muses Moore. If they can secure the Kitty, they plan to set up a photo-opportunity so that customers can have their pictures taken with her.
But in the meantime, customers will have to content themselves with Hello Kitty stationary, pens, pencils, candies, plush toys, air fresheners, pill cases, car accessories, bento boxes, silverware, backpacks, purses, soap dishes, shampoos, lotions, keychains, gift bags, lockboxes, statues, coin banks, and oh so much more.
Here's a small taste of what Lollipop gift has to offer -- try not to go into sugar-shock.

Since then, the party has grown to include some 25,000 attendees. "Some people lament its passing as an underground event, but it never was," said Harvey in a recent phone interview. "It was just obscure."
Harvey denies the sellout charge. He points to the fact that Burning Man doesn't accept sponsorships or license the image for sale, and he draws a firm line between commerce (as in the $125-and-up tickets) and commodification. And in Harvey's experience, those who say the event has gone mainstream usually haven't been there. "If they came, of course, they'd see it couldn't possibly be mainstream," he says. "They'd be really surprised at how much weirdness there is in normal people."

â€œI can think of no better leader to serve Minnesota veterans than the one who led them in many of the challenges of the last several years,â€ Sen. Ted Daley, R-Eagan, said before the unanimous Senate voice vote.
Shellito, 65, was state adjutant general seven years, in charge of the National Guard, before retiring last year. Dayton picked him to lead Veteransâ€™ Affairs soon after the governor took office this year.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pioglitazone-azilsartan, once daily (QD), in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control.
- Change from Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin. [ Time Frame: Baseline and Week 24 ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]The change between the value of Glycosylated Hemoglobin (the concentration of glucose bound to hemoglobin as a percent of the absolute maximum that can be bound) collected at week 24 or including final visit, and Glycosylated Hemoglobin collected at baseline.
- Change from Baseline in Diastolic Blood Pressure [ Time Frame: Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ]The change between Diastolic Blood Pressure measured at each week indicated including final visit and Diastolic Blood Pressure measured at baseline.

Detailed Description:
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease. In the United States, an estimated 21 million people have diabetes, with type 2 diabetes occurring in 90% to 95% of cases. Hypertension (high blood pressure) affects approximately 50 million individuals in the United States. The association of diabetes and hypertension is increased in this population; hypertension is more common in persons with diabetes while individuals with hypertension are 2.5 times more likely to develop diabetes than those who have normal blood pressure. As a result, more than 70% of adults with diabetes have hypertension (defined as having blood pressure greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg or using prescription medication for hypertension).
Patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension are at high risk of other illnesses and death. Diabetes and hypertension are associated with insulin resistance (normal amounts of insulin are no adequate to produce a normal insulin response from fat, muscle and liver cells). and hyperinsulinemia (excess levels of insulin in the blood), which are independent risk factors for cardiovascular (heart vessel) disease. Individuals with type 2 diabetes carry a 2 to 4- time greater risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke compared with the general population. Uncontrolled hypertension also is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke.

It is so heartbreaking. It really is. My heart goes out to the families of all those who were affected. I spent today on the couch nursing a cold.

This was just a sad wknd all the way around....I had to turn off the news on Friday.
Definitely spent much of the weekend hugging my kids. Can't watch the news.I know how green leaves photosynthesise, and The Last Word has explained how red leaves photosynthesise. I have an air plant with long, thin spiky leaves that appear yellow-brown, dry and, to all appearances, dead. How do these photosynthesise? I don't water it, but it is alive because every so often a new leaf shoot appears.
• There are hundreds of species in the genus Tillandsia. I have a few, but unlike that of your correspondent, my plants are mainly green or grey. From the description, I believe that the yellow-brown and dry parts of the plant are in fact dead, and the plant is photosynthesising using the light that percolates through to its deeper and still-living green parts.
I also suspect that the specimen is a maltreated Tillandsia that lingers on in spite of its situation, and is dying faster than it is growing. There is plenty of ...

First up, since this is a post mortem analysis, we need all the logs we can get. Start by collecting the following:
Now that we have all the logs in place, then comes the analysis part. I’ve tried to list down the steps and most common scenarios here:
2012-07-13 06:39:45.22 Server SQL Server is terminating because of a system shutdown. This is an informational message only. No user action is required. 2012-07-13 06:39:48.04 spid14s The Database Mirroring protocol transport has stopped listening for connections. 2012-07-13 06:39:48.43 spid14s Service Broker manager has shut down. 2012-07-13 06:39:55.39 spid7s SQL Trace was stopped due to server shutdown. Trace ID = '1'. This is an informational message only; no user action is required. 2012-07-13 06:39:55.43 Server The SQL Server Network Interface library could not deregister the Service Principal Name (SPN) for the SQL Server service. Error: 0x6d3, state: 4. Administrator should deregister this SPN manually to avoid client authentication errors. You can also use the systeminfo command from a command prompt to check when the node was last rebooted (look for “System Boot Time”), and see if this matches the time of the Failover. If so, then you need to investigate why the node rebooted, because SQL was just a victim in this case.
Information 7/29/2012 12:44:07 AM MSSQLSERVER 680 Server Error [8, 23, 2] occurred while attempting to drop allocation unit ID 423137010909184 belonging to worktable with partition ID 423137010909184.
Error 7/29/2012 12:44:07 AM MSSQLSERVER 823 Server The operating system returned error 2(The system cannot find the file specified.) to SQL Server during a read at offset 0x000001b6d70000 in file 'H:\MSSQL\Data\tempdata4. And then some time later, we see SQL shutting down in reaction to this:
Error 7/29/2012 12:44:17 AM MSSQLSERVER 3449 Server SQL Server must shut down in order to recover a database (database ID 2). The database is either a user database that could not be shut down or a system database. Restart SQL Server. If the database fails to recover after another startup, repair or restore the database.
Error 7/29/2012 12:44:17 AM MSSQLSERVER 3314 Server During undoing of a logged operation in database 'tempdb', an error occurred at log record ID (12411:7236:933). Typically, the specific failure is logged previously as an error in the Windows Event Log service. Restore the database or file from a backup, or repair the database.
Error 7/29/2012 12:44:17 AM MSSQLSERVER 9001 Server The log for database 'tempdb' is not available. Check the event log for related error messages. Resolve any errors and restart the database. Another error that clearly points toward the disks being a culprit is this:
Error 7/29/2012 12:44:15 AM MSSQLSERVER 823 Server The operating system returned error 21(The device is not ready.) to SQL Server during a read at offset 0x00000000196000 in file 'S:\MSSQL\Data\tempdb. The next logical step of course would be to check why the disks became unavailable/inaccessible. I would strongly recommend having your disks checked for consistency, speed and stability by your vendor.
There is no exhaustive guide to finding the root cause for a Cluster Failover, mainly because it is an approach thing. I do, however, want to talk about a few cluster concepts here, which might help you understand the messages from the various logs better.
checkQueryProcessorAlive: Also known as the isAlive check in SQL Server, this executes “SELECT @@servername” against the SQL Server instance. It waits 60 seconds before running the query again, but checks every 5 seconds whether the service is alive by calling sqsrvresCheckServiceAlive. Both these values(60 seconds and 5 seconds) are configured “by default” and can be changed from the properties of the SQL Server resource in Failover Cluster Manager/Cluster Administrator. I understand that for SQL 2012, we’ve included some more comprehensive checks like running sp_server_diagnostics as part of this check to ensure that SQL is in good health.
sqsrvresCheckServiceAlive: Also known as the looksAlive check in SQL Server, this checks to see if the status of the SQL Service and returns “Service is dead” if the status is not one of the following:
So if you see messages related to one of these checks failing in either the event logs or the cluster logs, you know that SQL Server was not exactly “available” at that time, which caused the failover. The next step, of course would be to investigate why SQL Server was not available at that time. It can be due to a resource bottleneck such as high CPU or memory consumption, SQL Server hung/stalled, etc.
The base idea here, as with any post-mortem analysis, is to construct a logical series of events leading up to the failover, based on the data. If we can do that, then we have at least a clear indication on what caused the failover, and more importantly, how to avoid such a situation in the future.
If you’re still unable to determine anything about the cause of the failover, I would strongly recommend contacting Microsoft CSS to review the data once and see if they’re able to spot anything.
Hope this helps. As always, comments, feedback and suggestions are welcome.Book Talk

Since all our today’s testing participants were tested with two types of 120mm fans and their rotation speed is far from being high enough to cause cooler heatsink plates to resonate, our test session turned into checking out the fans noisiness.
Here are the obtained results:
Of course, Scythe Slip Stream 120 fan that comes with Scythe Ninja Copper cooler is extremely quiet. It would be incorrect to call it completely noiseless, but it is actually really close to that. Higher-performance Noctua fan is a little louder, however our tests revealed, that installing this fan or two fans (for intake and exhaust) instead of the Scythe’s own has very little effect on the overall cooler efficiency.The Sidecar is one of those classic drink recipes that you’ve probably heard of, but more than likely have never tried. Maybe it’s because it’s made from cognac or maybe it’s just the name…”sidecar?” In current vernacular, a sidecar is something that rides along side a motorcycle (albeit vary rarely seen these days). However, back in the 1900’s (when this drink was created), this was one of the classic cocktails that was all the rage.
Let’s try making the sidecar into an apple sidecar with Calvados. What? You don’t know about Calvados? Calvados is an apple brandy. Don’t freak out…while it may sound expensive, you can find good Calvados at all price points. And you can find it from Trader Joe’s to Bev Mo. It only seems fitting, in the fall, to introduce an apple cocktail right before the big fall holidays of Halloween and Thanksgiving (oh yeah, Columbus Day is in there too). So I proclaim the Apple Sidecar as one of the premiere Fall holiday cocktails. Would anyone like to second the motion? Oh, you probably want to know a bit more about it. You little skeptic you.
Calvados is a sipping brandy, straight from France. It’s made from apples, so the finish has a nice hint of apple to it (what better libation to indulge in for the Fall). One of the beautiful things about Calvados is that it can be enjoyed both equally straight or mixed into one of many cocktail drink recipes.
I get that holiday cocktail drink recipes are generally considered egg nog or something with sugar and spice and something nice. But a holiday drink recipe doesn’t have to be something that you only have at Christmas. Hell, if you go by the retail calendar…the holidays start on July 31st. Last year I combined Calvados with pomegranate liqueur and created the Adam and Eve (in hopes that it would one day become one of the holidays classic cocktails).
And, as you will no doubt find, this lovely little apple cocktail will help to relieve any of those relative inducing migraines, backaches or stomach aches. Quite frankly, I think that’s what holiday cocktails were created for…to make families more bearable.
Relationship Advice
From the “now I’ve seen everything” file comes this little ditty. Ladies, have you felt left out of the adultery market by those Ashley Madison commercials? Do you feel that no one out there is feeling your needs for getting it on with married men? Well, wallow away no more…here comes a site for you: DiscreetAdultery.com. What, not convinced that their service is discreet, since their name screams “HEY I’M HAVING AN AFFAIR?” Well, according the press release, the site is run by the cheating experts over at Ashley Madison.
According to the president of Discreet Adultery, who happens to be a guy – and who knows more about a woman wants than a man, “Women, particularly married women, tend to be very cautious. However, once they decide they want to have an affair, the only thing holding them back are concerns over the quality of men, and concerns about getting caught.” Yeah, that’s all we think about. Because we’re women, we don’t think about getting pregnant, getting and STD or that the guy might be some kind of a douchebag that turns into a stalker…nah we don’t think of those kinds of things. Although, Discreet Adultery has taken our interests to heart when creating their site and claim that they ” improve security and matching based on anonymous ratings of men by other women.” So if Mary Sue says that Ken isn’t a douche…then by all means he must be a quality guy (remember ladies…every guy you’ve ever dated has been with someone else…how many of them have you thought were complete morons – and have you ever been on a blind date that was set up by someone you know really well?)
And just in case you thought Santa was going to be taking the year off, due to the economy, he’s got a new elf helping him out with all of the married ladies. “We expect even greater growth over the holidays, when women typically re-evaluate their relationships. In the current economic climate, we expect a record number of women to look for an affair. We will be there to help them.” Since they want to be so helpful to married women, I wonder if I could get them to help me clean the house, do the grocery shopping, and pick up the dry cleaning.
Just in case you think I made this up, here’s their press release.

Hi, I came across this looking for some info on Calvados. Looks good and I just happen to have a bottle of Cointreau on the go at home. I might have to have some midweek cocktails.
Sounds like you have the makings for a fine mid-week Dominic.
Calvados is a wonderful drink for this time of year. CHEERS!
I love sidecars and this is a great variation.
I’d love for you to submit one of your beautiful photos, and a link to your post, to my new baking photo gallery showcasing the beautiful baking, sweets and desserts and of course cocktails.
I would have to admit, I have yet to try and make these drinks at home! I guess name “side car” seems like a side drink but image proves to be like a main drink!
My fiancee loves the Chelsea Sidecar – with gin – and I am going to surprise her with this one! I’ll report back …
Thanks for stopping by BraveTart! Let us know if you try the Sapphire con Diablo, it’s such a classy, intriguing beverage and you definitely seem more than able to tackle it. I have everything I need to make an apple sidecar, so I think I know how I’ll be celebrating Halloween!
Pam, you have been coming up with the most beautiful cocktails lately. It makes me want to hit BevMo and mix up something that will make me silly. And taste really good!
I have always LIKED the name sidecar (I like all old fashioned cocktail names – like The Old Fashioned!!)

[ds-gps via Maxconsole]I feel decidedly so-so about this book, Marisha Pessl’s Special Topics in Calamity Physics. For one thing, I thought it was too long at over 500 pages; I have no problem with 500-page novels generally speaking, but the pacing of this particular long novel struck me as odd. It meandered along for 300 pages or so, with some interesting events and character interactions but without a strong sense of forward motion, and then at page 300, something really exciting happened and the book took off in a new direction. I won’t even hint at what the exciting event or the new direction is, so don’t worry about continuing to read this post if you plan on reading the novel in the future. But before this exciting event I found myself putting the book down without too much trouble, and after, it was much harder. I suppose the good news is that the book does eventually take off, but the bad news is that it does so so late.
The story is about Blue Van Meer, a teenager, and her father Gareth, a Political Science professor; Gareth is constantly taking on new Visiting Professor positions and so the two of them move just about every semester. Blue has learned very well how to make her way in strange new schools and new towns and talks about the dynamics of the High School social scene in jaded, cynical terms. But during her senior year, her father finally takes a year-long appointment, and Blue settles into the St. Gallway School, an elite private school known for sending its students to the Ivies.
Here Blue meets a beautiful, mysterious film studies teacher, Hannah Schneider. Blue notices that Hannah spends a good bit of her free time with a clique of five students whom Blue calls the blue-bloods; they have a meal together every Sunday, and soon Hannah invites Blue along. From this point on, the story is about the agonizingly slow way Blue befriends the blue-bloods, although her status in this group is always tenuous, and about the fascination the students have with Hannah’s personality and her past. Hannah seems suspiciously careful not to give away any details of her life before she began teaching at St. Gallway.
But none of this tells you much about how the book is written, and here I come to some of my other doubts about the novel. First of all, Pessl uses a syllabus format to organize the story; “Special Topics in Calamity Physics” is the name of the course and the course readings become the titles of individual chapters. Every chapter is named after some work of literature; we begin with Othello and end with The Metamorphoses. The novel’s introduction explains that Blue couldn’t figure out how to tell her story (the novel is in first-person from Blue’s perspective) until she hit on the syllabus idea, which gives her an organizing structure. The novel ends with a final exam. This format is original and amusing, but I found it only incidental to the unfolding of the story; sometimes I’d notice parallels between the chapter title and the chapter’s content, but often I’d forget I was supposedly reading through a syllabus, and I don’t think I missed anything by it. The structure struck me as more clever than useful.
As part of the “academic” format of the book, there are citations sprinkled throughout the book. Sometimes these take the form of documenting books mentioned in the narrative; for example, Pessl will give us something like this:
One Sunday, I watched in awe while Hannah fixed her own recessed doorbell with electrician gloves, screwdriver and voltmeter — not the easiest of processes, if one reads Mr. Fix-It’s Guide to Rewiring the Home (Thurber, 2002).
Often, these citations are of books not mentioned in the narrative, but provided as “documentation” of whatever point Blue is making. Usually these citations are an ironic counterpoint to the story’s details, for example:
It was the first Friday of November and Jade had gone to considerable lengths to pick out my outfit: four-inch malevolent gold sandals two sizes too big and a gold lame dress that rippled all over me like a Shar-pei (see “Traditional Wife’s Bound Feet,” History of China, Ming, 1961, p. 214; “Darcel,” Remembering “Solid Gold,” LaVitte, 1989, p. 29).
All this means the book has a very odd narrative voice. There are really two voices at work in this book, the knowledgeable, hyper-educated, fledging academic voice, and, hiding behind it, the voice of a lonely and scared teen. Blue comes across as incredibly well-educated, as old and experienced and world-weary, although, of course, she’s very young. But she also comes across as extremely vulnerable, and the novel’s rather bizarre ending bears this out. The academic trappings of the story come to seem like a coping mechanism, a way of finding order and meaning in a very chaotic life.
I feel like I can appreciate some of the things Pessl is doing here, especially with the narrative voice, but ultimately all the playfulness and experimentation didn’t come together for me. I just didn’t feel engaged, or at least consistently engaged, with the story.
I am curious to hear about other people’s experiences with the book, however, because I can see how other people might have enjoyed it very much. It just didn’t work that well for this particular reader.

I can understand the points you made about the book. It was pretty slow and takes a strange twist a little late, but I also liked the slow build-up. I guess I liked Blue so much that I didn’t mind the slow pacing. Like you, I found it easy to put the book down, and there were some parts where I didn’t feel like reading any more–I’d usually wonder, “Where is this going?”–but I thought Blue was engaging enough so that, instead of focusing on the oddball nature of the story, I always found myself looking forward to her observations. I didn’t think Hannah Schneider was very interesting, and I didn’t care what happened to her, so her scenes were where I put the book down. It’s kind of interesting to read other takes on books you’ve read, to compare what readers get out of a book, what they remember.
This sonds like it could be an interesting/fun read. I like the idea of the format, but you would think it would relate well to the story or what was the purpose otherwise. It wasn’t a book that I had on my list to read, but I might take a look at it when it comes out in paper. 300 pages is quite a lot to read before the book really takes off, but as Brandon mentions if the narrator is engaging sometimes it is worth the wait to see when the action picks up. Some books are like this–maybe only so-so–it would be great if they were all completely engaging, but that’s rare for all the books you read to be like that.
I don’t really have an intelligent comment to make. But I’m intrigued by the violent difference between the cover for the UK market – – and US cover. I’m at a loss to explain the UK cover (Romance saga much?) – what are they trying to say about the novel; who are they trying to attract?
I also have to ask whether Marisha Pessl shares any of the teen narrative tics of Curtis Sittenfield?
I’ve been looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this book, as I’ve been thinking of buying it since I saw it in a bookshop several weeks ago. After reading your post, I now think “life’s too short” – thank you!
I’ve been holding off reading this one because I feared it would be as crashing a disappointment as the equally lauded Thirteenth Tale (ugh). Now, I think I’ll give it a go as it seems to have passed your hype-detector without setting off too many alarms. And I confess a certain weakness for those tricksy sort of book-citation effects…
I wasn’t at all sure about this book when I read the reviews because I feared it might be all cleverness and emotional superficiality. I think I can see that it is not superficial, but I’m also underwhelmed by the thought of the experimental devices. You could do a lot with chapters named after iconic texts, and it sounds like a missed opportunity to me. Probably not one for my TBR shelf – thank you so much, Dorothy, for clearing that up for me!
Humph, well, I still plan to read the book because it sounds like it was enjoyable, I will just lower my expectations of how enjoyable because it does not seem I will be “blown away.” And thanks for the warning of sorts about the first 300 pages.
I agree Brandon, that Blue is a great character. I really liked the combination of her vulnerability and her toughness and experience. And yeah, Hannah wasn’t as fascinating as the students thought she was.
Danielle, absolutely, not every book can be super engaging, and I’m glad I read this, even though there were things about it I liked. I wouldn’t have stuck with it if I’d hated it, after all.
Thanks for pointing that out Victoria — what a HUGE difference! There’s some teen romance in the novel, but it’s really not the point. As for comparisons with Sittenfeld, the ending pretty much blows them away — it’s so NOT typical. The two main characters are both isolated kids, outsiders, there’s some icky romance (icky in the sense that the female characters get treated pretty badly), but the endings are very different.
Del, well, some people have liked this (actually a lot), but if you’re looking for an excuse not to read it, I’m happy to provide one!
Sandra, I hope you like it better than I did (which you very well might); I usually like tricksy sorts of effects too, but not here …
Litlove, I don’t think it’s superficial at all, so that’s not a problem, but still, there were enough problems, I thought, and I’m happy to help you make a decision!
Stefanie, I will eagerly await your thoughts on it, which may be very different from mine…
I found it a hard book to review – there were aspects I liked about it (the characterisations) but then I hated the irritating citations. I am still not sure what I truly think..
If it’s not integral to the book, I suspect that the framing device will put me off, but the prospect of Blue’s double voice makes me want to pick it up all the same. Are there any “Prime of Miss Jean Brodie” parallels at work (mysterious charismatic teacher, the blue-bloods and the creme de la creme, and so on)?
Oh my gosh, I can’t believe that didn’t occur to me — definitely, Kate S., there are “Prime” parallels at work. It’s very much a cult of personality that Hannah has going with the students and they must grow up by defining themselves against her. Reflecting a different age, perhaps, the students are both more intimate with and less worshipful of Hannah than the students in “Prime” are of Brodie.
During those first 300 or so pages when you possibly felt less engaged with the book what was it that kept you going?
I found those same pages filled with delight, difference and humor. The long unfolding plot not-withstanding, i found her voice refreshingly engaging and i ripped through those earlier pages with an eagerness usually reserved for a box of bon bons.
Too long? Yes. And the end, and the l o n g unfolding plot? Really not all that exciting to me…but the voice, ah the voice what a gem of a talent.
I would say it’s a really good, important, read and i hope she grows the talent using less space to do what she is so obviously capable of doing.
Good question, Chris — it was her voice that kept me going. I agree with you completely about that, and I’d be willing to read another novel of hers, when she’s written another one.My picks:

Kentucky Coalition Takes Down AT&T Bill to Remove Consumer Phone Protections - Community Broadband Bits #44
Episode #44 of our Community Broadband Bits podcast expands on our story exploring a major victory over bad AT&T-driven legislation in Kentucky. We welcome Mimi Pickering of Appalshop and Tom FitzGerald of the Kentucky Resources Council.
We discuss why the AT&T-authored bill to gut consumer protections was bad for Kentucky and how a terrific coalition of public interest groups, unions, and others were able to protect the public interest. This was the second time they have defeated a similar bill, offering important lessons to those of us in different states that have not yet abandoned basic consumer protections for the telephone just because AT&T told our legislature they were unnecessary.

Half a million strong
In just six months, half a million riders have crossed by the Capital City Trail bike barometer in North Carlton.
The barometer has proved to a skeptical public that huge numbers of Melburnians are riding bikes and that investment in facilities for them is more than justified.
The counting instrument, at the corner of the Trail and Nicholson Street, is on a busy route, but by no means the busiest.
The $30,000 Eco-Totem counter was installed by Moreland City and the bike shop next door, Velocycles, in a public-spirited move to highlight the popularity of cycling.
The 500,000th rider was captured at 8.55am this morning. She was one of several riders crossing at that moment who scored gifts from the bike store.
The large figure has focused attention on the nearby road crossings on the Capital City Trail where bikes are forced to wait at traffic lights for inordinately long periods because motor traffic has been given priority.
The counter will be re-set to zero on 1 January 2015.Results:

How to OrderGuest Post: Hunter Pence’s Value
What Was Hunter Pence Worth To The 2011 Phillies?
by John Ricco (@john_ricco) of Turn Two Baseball and Jared Gold (@jgold6393)
After being traded to the Phillies at the deadline in 2011, Hunter Pence took no time in becoming a fan favorite in Philadelphia. He was quick to contribute on-field production and lovable enthusiasm to a team that seemed to struggle offensively in the first half. Both of these traits had the mainstream media often raving that he “balanced the lineup” or “protected Ryan Howard” among other narratives. Pence performed perhaps even better than initially expected. In 50 games as Phillie, he hit for a slash line of .324/.394/.560, good for a wOBA of .405. While these numbers are rather remarkable, they must be looked at in context of the 2011 season.
Around the trade deadline, the Phillies had little doubt whether or not the club would make the postseason. But typical for any strong club, they wanted that blockbuster deal that would really solidify their chances at staying afloat come October. They did just this when acquiring Hunter Pence; he was looked at as a player that could not only help them get there, but make a run at winning a World Series. But just how much did Pence improve the already-great Phillies?
In attempting to answer this question, we built our framework around postseason probability added. The main point of this concept is such: not all wins are created equally. For instance, a team that wins 80 games instead of 79 increases their chances of making the postseason only by a fraction of a percent (roughly 0.4%), yet a team that wins 90 instead of 89 games increases their chances by over 11%. Therefore, when evaluating how a given player has affected his team’s likelihood of making it to October, it is not enough to just look at how many wins he has provided. Rather, we must look at the importance of each additional win.
According to FanGraphs, Hunter Pence was worth 2.6 WAR with the Phillies. The team won 102 games, so theoretically without Pence the Phillies would have won 99.4 games (generously assuming, of course, that Pence’s likely opportunity cost, Domonic Brown, would have performed at replacement level for the remainder of the season). Winning 99.4 games results in a 98.87% chance of making the postseason, while the mark at 102 wins is 99.66%. The difference between these two values is 0.0078. In other words, Hunter Pence added 0.78% – a fraction of a percent – to this team’s probability of making the postseason. Graphically, we can view this as the area under the marginal probability curve. The tiny shaded area represents the additional probability provided by Pence.
(click to enlarge)
However, the argument will be made that the objective of bringing Pence to Philadelphia was to win a World Series. That being said, it is fairly common knowledge that the postseason is a crapshoot and the best team doesn’t always win. If we average his contributions over the last three years, we can assume his true talent level is roughly 4 wins per year. Pence averaged 156.3 games a season, putting his worth at .0256 wins per game, or .128 wins over a full 5 game series. This is equivalent to just a shade over 1 run during the course of a full NLDS series, making the substantial assumption that it goes to 5 games. Over the past 10 years, the average World Series winner played 15 games, with no team playing more than 17. Even in the highly unlikely scenario of a team that played every possible game in each series (a full 19 games), Pence would have added fewer than 5 runs to the team.
This analysis, of course, treats Pence as a half year rental and disregards his benefits beyond 2011. Right now a number of question marks surround next year’s club and Pence’s future contributions certainly have the potential to be significant in the hunt for the postseason next year. Additionally, we have ignored the intangible qualities for which Pence is so well-known. We love high socks, goofy swings, and funny catchphrases as much as the next fans. Regardless, if we believe Victor Wang’s prospect research to be even somewhat accurate, Jonathan Singleton’s expected value is around $25 million and Jarred Cosart is projected to be worth $15 million. In evaluating his ultimate value, we must ask ourselves: is one meaningful season out of Pence truly worth the cost of dealing $40+ million dollars of top prospects?

One aspect that WAR doesn’t consider is the effect a player has on team attitude. Who’d you rather have on your team, Hanley Ramirez or Chutley? Pence may help a lot “in the clubhouse”.

@Lee,
Because after one year, Pence is a free agent, at which point we could just sign him to a contract in 2012 without giving up any prospects, and we would have to do that anyway in 2012 even after this trade. So essentially, we traded those prospects for 1 1/2 years of Pence.

Impossible to tell now if it was worth it. We won’t know until we see how Cosart and Singleton’s career plays out. I personally think that prospect value system is ludicrous. Sabermetrics seem to be much bettter at analysing what happened already then predicting what will happen imo.

Instead of discrediting it based on the “smell test”, do the research and contradict it. That would be good science and beneficial to us all.

Calm down. Predictions of future performance, whether in horse racing or the stock market or baseball have to be flawed because you can’t see the future based on the past. You just can’t. If you could I’d be rich.
In baseball, stats are certainly better predictors than “the good face” but they can’t be expected to pan out exactly.
When I have time for a serious look I’ll see what Wang did and comment.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure the Phillies have Pence’s rights through 2013. He came up in late April 2007, making him a Super-2 player with 4 years of arbitration eligibility (2010-2013).
Re: prospect valuations, Victor Wang’s work is terrific and useful, but his numbers are just average, or expected, values. Singleton could turn out to be Ryan Howard (or better) or Casey Kotchman (or worse). The difficulty for outsiders in placing an accurate and fair value on him is that we do not have as much information about him as the Phillies (or, likely, the Astros) do. Obviously the Phillies did their own math and determined that 2 1/2 years of Pence (including 2 at expensive arbitration prices) was worth the future value of Singleton and Cosart. Wang’s research gives us a baseline to help our own predictions, but of course if it was that simple then trades would never happen (unless calculators became a market inefficiency).

We get two more FULL YEARS of this guy. Sure, he’ll crush it in arbitration, but Pence is a terrific addition both for his production and attitude, the latter of which was sorely needed on a team that seemed at times to have that ho-hum approach (while on it’s way to winning 102 games – yes, they’re that talented). To me, him being in pinstripes the next two years will even go towards him making up for Rollins imminent departure and Howard’s late start. For a team that’s built to win now, do this deal 10 out of 10 times, even if we don’t actually win it all.

I’m sorry, this post is full of fail. Everyone knew that the Phils didn’t make the trade to make the playoffs this season. The 2011 regular is a strawman and the BIG fancy chart doesn’t change that.
The trade was for 2.x years of Pence’s services at a discounted rate along with improving the 2011 post-season chances. Would we be seeing this article if Pence had a big hit in game 5? I think not.

I don’t completely buy the attitude argument, because you can have as good of an attitude as you want, but if it doesn’t show up on the field, who gives a rat’s ass? It’s a fallacy that great attitude or great chemistry automatically translates into better performance. It certainly CAN, but it’s not a given. All that great attitude certainly didn’t help us score even ONE lousy run in Game 5 of the NLDS, did it, and isn’t that what this guy is suppose to do? Because quite frankly with that pitching staff, we can make it to the postseason in 2012 and 2013 playing both Dom and Mayberry.
That said, I’m not saying we shouldn’t have done the trade. I still think it’s a 50/50 proposition. But again, as it was hotly discussed during the time of the trade itself, it’s not as slam dunk as Pence supporters make it out to be.

“However, the argument will be made that the objective of bringing Pence to Philadelphia was to win a World Series. That being said, it is fairly common knowledge that the postseason is a crapshoot…This is equivalent to just a shade over 1 run during the course of a full NLDS series, making the substantial assumption that it goes to 5 games.”
While the postseason is a crapshoot and the best team doesn’t always win, I don’t see how that is an argument against improving your team in an effort to at least improve your odds in crapshoot. And, that 1 run sure would have helped in Game 5.

“but Pence is a terrific addition both for his production and attitude, the latter of which was sorely needed on a team that seemed at times to have that ho-hum approach (while on it’s way to winning 102 games – yes, they’re that talented).”
How can you support this claim? It’s so subjective and cliche that it makes me sick. Just because the rest of the team can hold their heads still while running doesn’t mean they’re ho-hum. Due to the fact that Pence is probably one of the strangest/least coordinated players in the league, people love him. Oh yea, he was hungry after a game, too. Let’s make a t-shirt about it!

October 13, 2011 10:19 AM
This whole concept is ridiculous. Using the same math, Albert Pujols is worth .232 wins over the course of the NLDS, and under 9 runs over the course of a 19 game playoff. That is almost double what Pence is “worth”, but its still less than 4 runs more.
You’re using these numbers to make it seem like Pence is not worth anything, when in reality the best player in the game also appears to have a minuscule value.
Furthermore, the idea of projected prospect value is fun, but ultimately not very helpful. There are too may things that can happen to a prospect on the way to the majors. Its hard enough to predict what prospects will have a legit major league career, let alone put a monetary value on them.

October 13, 2011 12:01 PM
I’ve finally read Wang’s prospect value paper. Interesting stuff, but probably best applied by a team for budget planning purposes and not to calculate specific player worth or predict value. As many preceding have said, there are too many variables that cannot be considered regarding individuals.
Re: making subjective judgements about players. Sometimes that’s all we have and it isn’t invalid . What metric is there for attitude or the ability to inspire?

@guywebster,

Who said I was banking on anything? I just said that some important things are not quantifiable yet must be considered. You want Nyger Morgan on the team even if he hits .300?
Phillie697
October 13, 2011 01:03 PM
Funny you brought up Morgan, because guess what, he’s still playing in the postseason (and put up a 4.0 WAR season), while you and I are doing typical armchair GMing of our favorite team because we ain’t got nothing else to do, and the team who let him go because of his “attitude” didn’t even sniff the playoffs, let alone playing in it. How’s that for your “intangibles?”

What’s fascinating is the other prospects traded aren’t valued at all. Zied could be a perfectly serviceable middle reliever and Santana could be absolutely superb. If either or both of them pans out this trade morphs from merely “Disastrous” to “Worst Trade in Phillies History”.

October 18, 2011 02:50 PM
Yet if Hunter Pence somehow saved the NLDS and then went on to be MVP of the NLCS and/or WS, then it would have been hailed as the best trade of the year. Statistically, we know that’s overdoing it, but the whole point of acquiring Pence was never statistical. Yes, long term and statistically it’s probably a (very) bad trade, but the point of the trade was for short term benefit – which the Phillies got. The 2.5 WAR over 54 games is a Pujols/MVP level of production if extended to the course of an entire season.
Phillie697
October 19, 2011 12:56 PM
@David,
I think what we wanted was a WS title. By your logic his 2.5 WAR in the regular season as a Phillie don’t matter, since we were going to make it to the playoffs with or without him. His .496 OPS in the playoffs, however, doesn’t paint such a rosy picture.
Funny how you said “but the whole point of acquiring Pence was never statistical” then proceeded to quote his 2.5 WAR over 54 games. I forgot, WAR isn’t a statistic anymore. It’s now a religion!!!VIDEO: Students for An Idiocratic Society)5 Reasons to Try Bamboo Paper

I cover the business of sports for Forbes.
Though sports-themed TV and magazine ads seem to be dominated by the same old crowd–LeBron James, Peyton Manning, Derek Jeter and (despite recent hiccups) Tiger Woods–the truth is that marketers are always looking for fresh faces. Talent, likability and charisma never go out of style.
So who’s got the momentum to make it big in 2010? It’ll only take a month to find out if 26-year-old boxer Andre Berto will join the hit parade. On Jan. 30, the undefeated (26-0; 19 knockouts) but still relatively anonymous welterweight takes on veteran Shane Mosley in Las Vegas. A victory would push him into the limelight, where the likes of Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather could await.
“The welterweight division is talent rich,” says longtime boxing maven Bert Sugar. “If he beats Mosley, he sets himself up for some big fights.”
In Pictures: 10 Athletes To Watch In 2010
In the pro basketball arena, the biggest threat to LeBron and Kobe Bryant’s dominance could well be Milwaukee rookie Brandon Jennings, an eye-popping point guard who’s already exploded for a 55-point game. “He’s fantastic, the quickest guard in the league,” says ESPN basketball guru Bill Simmons. Off to an 11-12 start, the Bucks have a shot at their first winning season since 2002-03. A playoff run would give Jennings the exposure he needs to overcome his small-market base.
Also worth keeping an eye on: New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez, who’s had an inconsistent rookie year but whose talent and classic good looks figure to be a big-market bonanza should he and the team succeed in 2010. Then there’s Indy racecar driver Danica Patrick, already among the world’s highest-paid female athletes. Her foray into Nascar could propel her to new endorsement heights.
“She will be reaching a broader audience, Nascar has a substantial female fan base,” says Courtney Leddy, a vice president with Ketchum Sports Network. Already a master at blending her talent and sex appeal to charm male fans, Patrick, who will also continue with IndyCar, could soon be looking at perfume or other beauty products targeted to women, Leddy thinks.
The upcoming year also features the Olympics, always a potential springboard for endorsement success. Waiting in the wings this time is downhill skier Steven Nyman, who marketers hope will emerge as the next Bode Miller with a strong performance at the Vancouver Winter Games. There’s also Katherine Reutter, a 21-year-old speed skater who showed self-promotional moxie by having Stephen Colbert autograph her thigh during a recent appearance on his show.
And something the public can rarely resist, in or out of sports: a comeback. That’s good news for Tiger Woods who, most sports pundits believe, will be back winning tournaments and raking in mega endorsement dollars by the spring. The comeback trail could also be kind to Tennessee Titans quarterback Vince Young, who reclaimed his starting job in the team’s seventh game of 2009 and proceeded to engineer a turnaround (the Titans are 6-7 after an 0-6 start). During a disappointing three-year professional run that followed his stellar college career at the University of Texas, Young reportedly considered quitting the game as he battled through injury and depression. But things have a way of changing quickly.
“He’s overcome a lot, and he has been coming out of his shell,” says Leddy. If he or Sanchez wins a Super Bowl, the old standbys like Manning and Tom Brady will have company quickly.
In Pictures: 10 Athletes To Watch In 2010Five Ashes Village Hall committee has won a Big Lottery Grant of £455,000 to pay for improvements and extensions.
Geoff Gregory, chairman said: “Under the Reaching Communities programme the grant will enable significantly better facilities to be made available which in turn will attract a wider range of user groups to help sustain the provision in the village.
“This is the culmination of two years of writing, editing and proof reading, sharing disappointment and ultimately success.”
The move towards replacing the hall - built in the 1960s - started in 1999 when the then committee agreed significant investment was needed.
In 2004 a bid was submitted to the National Lottery for money to build a new hall next to the existing one on the sports field.
In spite of energy and fundraising, this was unsuccessful but Geoff said a significant legacy for subsequent committees to assess how to preserve the ailing hall.
In 2008 the committee decided that the funds would be partly committed improve the main hall. Competitive prices were obtained and doubled glazed units installed. In 2010 a further Lottery bid was submitted in three stages – at stage two an award of £9,000 was made towards preparing the business plan, finalising design, getting approvals, pricing and getting ready to build. The final application needed a capital project delivery plan to show the project would be ready to start within six months of a final award.
A business plan with financial forecast, risk analysis plus accounts and organisational policies was submitted.
The project aims to provide new general purpose space extension to the hall. An substandard structure will be demolished, a new single storey built and layout, facilities and thermal efficiency of the existing building improved. The new hall area enables lots of activities to take place and improved access to the playing field provides space for separate changing areas for teams.

by Gunman
Disclaimer: I do not own Eva or Bleach
Summary: Shinji is teleported to the Soul Society 12th Division where he meets, and activates, Nemu Kurotsuchi, gaining not only a loyal ally, but a friend and lover as well.
Author's Notes: Originally I was going to title this 'Shinji's Doll', since Nemu was basically created using gigai and mod-soul technology. However, I didn't like the title too much so I rewrote it so that it made a bit more sense. Pretty much another response to Invincible Shinji's Romance Fanfic Challenge.
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Death is not something the living can ever truly understand.
This is especially true of how the dead live.
In the afterworld nexus known as Soul Society, there exists two worlds. The outer eighty districts are known as the Rukongai, the wandering spirit towns. The inner walled city is known as the Seireitei, home and military base of the Soul Reapers.
For thousands of years the Soul Reapers purpose has been to defend the innocent from the monsters known as the Hollows, monstrous creatures who were once human beings who lost their way and never fully passed on into Soul Society. The Soul Reaper ranks were comprised of 13 divisions, each with a fairly unique or special function.
The Second Division was the ninja-like special operations unit. The Fourth Division was the medical response unit. The Eleventh Division was the elite combat unit.
But the Twelfth Division was the research and development unit.
It was in this dark and secretive place, that a strange energy portal opened up and expelled a young human figure into the lab.
CRASH!
"Ouch!" Shinji Ikari groaned as he rolled himself off of the now broken pieces of lab equipment, test tubes, machine parts, and experimental weapons.
Not that he could see anything.
"Oh... what happened? Where am I?" he wondered aloud as he looked around, only to see nothing.
His eyes were barely adjusting to the few blinking lights in the room, which implied that there were several electronic devices of some kind. There were also a couple of dimly lit computer monitors, which he figured were over by the wall, so he started moved towards them in the hopes of finding a light switch or something.
"Where is that light switch?" he asked.
Just then, his vision was flooded with a bright, blinding light as the was suddenly illuminated. His eyes shut on reflex while his hands went up to block his eyes as well.
"Ah! What happened?" he gasped.
"I have turned on the lights as you have requested," replied a female voice in a quiet tone.
Shinji's eyes took a few moments to adjust, turning towards the person who had just spoke. Though when he did, he quickly regretted it.
"Oh. Thank you. But who-- GAAACCCKK!!" he gasped as he saw who had spoke.
This first thing Shinji noticed was that he was in a somewhat small room, about the size of the living room in Misato's apartment, littered with dozens of electronic devices and tools. The downside to this was the fact that because the room was so small, it caused Shinji to instantly focus his attention to the only other person in the room.
Only a few feet away from him stood a beautiful young and naked woman in a rather demure stance. She had long violet hair, green eyes and probably the healthiest bosom that Shinji had seen since Misato. In fact it took him several seconds to determine that this wasn't Misato, if for no other reason than the fact this woman wasn't laughing, grinning, or teasing him about her nakedness. He forced himself to avert his eyes from her bare breasts, only to berate said eyes when they drifted downwards towards the pubic hair-free nether regions which were barely covered by her hands, which were in a clasped position.
"Please state your designation." the woman said.
"Uh... Shinji Ikari." he said, shocked at himself that he hadn't stammered out his name like a brain-dead, emotionally distraught introvert he normally was. He was however, frozen and unable to move nor look away from her.
There was a slight flash in the woman's green eyes before she spoke again. "Imprinting procedure complete. Artificial construct Nemu Kurotsuchi… at your command, Shinji Ikari-sama."
"Uh…… at my command?" he gasped.
At hearing that, the more perverted side of him started entertaining all kinds of possibilities as to what he and this beautiful young woman could do. He swore he felt like Toji, Kensuke, and Kaji all rolled into one person.
"Affirmative." she said.
"Okay. Then how about putting on some clothes?! Please!" Shinji said as he looked away to give her some privacy. Off to the side of the small room he saw a small kimono, a pair of tabi socks, a pair of sandals, and a pair of white panties. "Okay, there. Those look like they'll fit you. Please put them on."
However, the woman didn't move, though she looked at the clothes with some interest
"Uh... Nemu... why are you just standing there?" Shinji asked.
"I have not been programmed how to appropriately place attire on myself." she said.
Shinji gasped in disbelief at what she was saying. She had no idea how to get dressed? How could someone not know how to get dressed? It was one of the most basic things in the world.
"You don't know how to dress yourself?" he asked. "Why don't you?"
"My creator, Mayuri Kurotsuchi-sama, has only programmed me with a layout of the Twelfth Division compound, standard laboratory practices and rules along with up-to-date knowledge on physics, chemistry, ecto-biology, and combat."
"Okay... uh... Nemu? This might sound like a strange question, maybe even rude, and you don't have to answer if you don't want to...but..."
"I will answer your questions to the best of my abilities." she said.
"Uh... are you human?" he asked.
"I am not. I am the result of Captain Mayuri-sama's research in gigai and mod-soul technology. My original purpose was to assume the position of vice-captain for the Twelfth Division once I am fully ready as Mayuri-sama has constantly expressed dissatisfaction with the previous vice-captains that have served under him. Now my purpose is to attend to your every need, Shinji-sama."
Shinji blushed as she said that. "Uh... you said a Gigai and a Mod-Soul? What are those?" he asked, trying to steer the conversation towards something less perverted.
"Gigai's are artificial bodies that Soul Reapers utilize in emergency situations. Mod-Soul's are artificial souls originally designed as expendable soldiers for the war against the Hollows."
"Okay. What's a Hollow?"
"A departed human soul that has not been exorcized and sent to Soul Society in time, and becomes corrupted. They are usually animalistic in nature, craving the souls of other people, whether they are living or dead. They most often attack their loved ones first. They are called Hollows due to the empty space in their chests where their hearts once were." she said.
"Alright. And what's a Soul... okay, can you please put on some clothes?" he gasped, realizing she had been naked this entire time.
"I do not know how." she said.
Shinji groaned and began to steal his nerves for what he had to do.
She's like a child almost, no sense of modesty. He thought. In a way, it kinda reminds me of Rei.
"Alright. Here. Let's start with the... panties." he said, his face practically glowing as he picked up the white material, which he noticed were silk. "Uh... here. Stick your legs through the holes and pull them up to your waist."
Nemu did as she was instructed.
"Okay, next we'll put on the kimono." he said moving behind her to put the small kimono over her shoulders. "Stick your arms through the two sleeves, just like that, and wrap the outer flaps over each other. Uh, left one first then the right. Good. Now tie the belt off to secure it, and make sure your whole body is covered." he said.
There wasn't a bra anywhere, which wouldn't have done Shinji any good since he had no idea how to put one on a woman.
"Alright, now... the socks go on your feet and then the sandals." he said, glad that she was now covered. Once the footwear was on Shinji, feeling better, turned to ask Nemu his questions. "So... what is a Soul Reaper and what's a Soul Society?"
"Soul Reapers are departed human souls who possesses special abilities that enable them govern the flow of souls between the human world and the afterlife. Their duties include leading 'Wholes', or good souls, to Soul Society using a practice called konso, or soul burial, as well as the cleansing of Hollows." Nemu said, fitting her sandals securely on her feet.
"Cleansing?"
"Yes. As Hollow's were once whole spirits, they can be cleansed of their Hollow forms and made whole, so as to allow them safe passage into Soul Society."
"And Soul Society is?" he asked.
"It is the afterlife, where the souls of those who have passed on go once their human lives are done." she said.
A lump in Shinji's throat, chest and stomach instantly developed when she said that.
"So... we're in Soul Society?" he asked.
"Yes."
"As in... the world of the dead?"
"Yes."
"Does that mean that... I'm dead?" he asked.
Nemu looked at Shinji and cocked her head to the side.
"If you are not, then you are a Ryoka, a spirit who has entered Soul Society illegally." Nemu said.
"I ... don't think I'm dead... but... I don't know how I got here either." Shinji said. "And that means.. I probably came here illegally. Oh boy!"
Shinji felt his body drain of energy as he suddenly leaned back against the table, his left hand landing on a strange mini-sword that had a crystal lining over the blade and several circuits imbedded into the handle. However, his right hand landed on a red button on a small control panel.
The second he pressed it, the wall next to him opened up... and revealed three sinister individuals.
"Huh?" a young man with pale white hair, closed eyes, and a snake-like grin gasped.
"Who?" a slightly older man with soft brown hair and black-rimmed glasses said.
"What the... NEMU?" a man with a black and white clown-face gasped.
"Uh-oh." Shinji gasped as the clown-faced man advanced towards the girl.
"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING ACTIVATED?" the clown-faced man shouted, grabbing Nemu by the neck and slamming her against the opposite wall.
"Hey! Leave her alone!" Shinji shouted as he tried to go to her aid, only to have a pair of hands grab and pull him back.
"I'm afraid I cannot allow you to interfere with a father-daughter conversation." the man with the snake-like grin said as he held Shinji tightly.
"Answer Me Nemu!" the clown shouted as he squeezed her throat. "Who activated you?"
"He... did." Nemu croaked out weakly, pointing to Shinji.
"And who is he?" the clown asked.
"Shinji... Ikari... my... master."
"What? WHAT? I AM YOUR MASTER! I CREATED YOU! YOU BELONG TO ME! TO SERVE ME! HOW DID THIS PUP GET TO BE YOUR MASTER?" the clown shouted.
"Initialized... activation... imprinting." she said weakly.
"What does that mean?" the man with the glasses asked.
"I programmed Nemu to be completely loyal to whomever activated her. Like parental imprinting. I wanted to upload some more programs into her before I could fully activate her. But this... punk!... beat me to it! She now thinks he's her master!"
"So?" the snake-man said. "Just wipe her memory and start over."
"It's not that simple, you fool! The programming is absolute. As long as he is alive she will see him as her master, and vice-versa." the clown said. "Which means he has to die first, and I would like to experiment on him before that."
"No! You cannot!" Nemu cried out.
"SHUT UP!" the clown shouted, slamming Nemu's head against the wall. "I didn't program you to be defiant!"
"Leave her alone!" Shinji shouted, struggling in the snake-man's grip.
"Aizen, your little project will have to be put on hold for a minute. Do me a favor and stick that loss in a cell somewhere while I take my precious little Nemu apart." the clown said as the man with the glasses moved up to help restrain Shinji.
"NO!!" Shinji shouted as he flayed out his hand, grabbing the mini-sword on the table and waved it wildly, bringing it up to stab the man with the glasses in the stomach.
At that moment, everything changed.
The crystal bladed sword with the advanced circuits activated, glowing and pulsing with unusual energy, then exploding with power that knocked everyone off their feet.
Shinji felt his body nearly rip apart as a strange foreign energy entered his body, reaching into every level of his body, touching every cell from the hair on his head to the toe nails.
The dark force energy wave died down and Shinji managed to regain his vision. The first thing he noticed was that the man with the glasses whom he had stabbed was now lying on the ground, his black robes now pure white, the sword that he had been wearing now gone. The clown-faced man, who Shinji assumed was Mayuri Kurotsuchi from the way he was talking about being Nemu's creator, was now lying across the room imbedded in the wall. Nemu herself was lying on the ground and slowly recovering. The snake-man who had been holding him previously was now by the man in the white robe.
"You... what... Captain Aizen! Your... your powers are... gone." he gasped, then looked up to glare at Shinji. "Why you filthy..." the snake-man gasped as he leaped at Shinji.
Shinji quickly reacted, moving faster than he thought possible, and stabbed the snake-man in the gut.
"I'm sorry!" Shinji said as the mini-sword glowed again. "Uh-oh."
Again, the dark force energies exploded and penetrated Shinji's body. But this time, Shinji could see where the energy was coming from. They were coming from the snake-man he had just stabbed.
The dark energy exploded from the snake-man's body and surged into his own. The second it did, Shinji felt stronger, more energized, more alive.
The energy wave passed as the snake-man, now wearing a pure white robe, dropped to the floor next to his unconscious associate.
Shinji dropped the blade, which had no blood on it, and stared at his shaking hands. It was then that he noticed something else. His plugsuit was gone, replaced by the clothes of a Soul Reaper: a black Shihakuso that was tailor-made for him. It fit perfectly, from the shirt and jacket, to the pants, down to the black boots on his feet. Hanging on his hips were a pair of swords, one long and one short.
"What... what happened? What did I do? Why did... I don't understand any of this!" he said in a frightened tone before taking off in a dead run towards the nearest set of stairs he could find.
He ran hard, up the stairs and through another set of laboratories, until he was outside of the Twelfth Division headquarters.
All around him, the buildings and scenery, which included the bushes and trees, all looked like it had been stylized to mimic the feudal era of Japan. Which would explain why he now looked like a samurai.
Shinji's first impulse was to run far away and find a place to hide in order to sort this out, only to pause as he remembered something he had left back in the lab. To be more precise.. Someone.
Nemu! He gasped as turned around to go back inside.
Within seconds he was back inside the hidden laboratory. The two men in white robes were still lying on the floor. Mayuri was still unconscious and imbedded in the wall. And on the ground right in front of him, in a sit-up position was Nemu Kurotsuchi.
"Nemu! Are you alright?" he asked.
"I am unharmed." she said.
Shinji quickly helped her up and looked at her. Nemu quickly noticed this.
"Ikari-sama? Is something wrong?" she asked.
"I'm so sorry, Nemu!" he said to her.
"For what?" she asked.
"For leaving you behind. For running out on you like that. I promise I won't do that again!"
"You are... concerned for me?" she asked.
Shinji was stunned. "Of course! I mean... well... technically you're my responsibility now, so..."
Nemu just looked at Shinji, a strange feeling of warmth filling her cheeks.
"I promise I won't leave you behind again." he stated firmly.
"I... thank you, captain." she said.
Shinji looked at her strangely. "Captain? Why are you calling me Captain?"
"Because you are now a captain in Soul Society." she stated.
"I'm... WHAT?" he gasped.
Nemu looked down at the crystal-bladed sword Shinji had dropped. "That sword is one of Mayuri-sama's inventions. It was originally designed to transfer the spiritual energy of a Soul Reaper into another Soul Reaper by means of impalement."
"Really? Wait! Originally designed?" Shinji gasped.
"It was never tested. Until now." she said.
"Oh boy!" he gasped, then looked at Mayuri. "Why would anyone design something like that?"
"I have no information as to his intentions."
"Can you... guess?"
Nemu cocked her head to side for a few seconds.
"It is possible that such a device could have been used to increase the power of a Soul Reaper, by stealing the spiritual energy of another Soul Reaper."
"They were trying to make themselves stronger?" Shinji asked in shock. "By stealing from other Soul Reapers? Their own kind?"
"So it would seem. And as you have taken both the power of Captain Aizen and Vice-Captain Ichimaru, you now possess more than adequate power to be a Soul Reaper Captain, the strongest level of Soul Reaper in Soul Society."
"But why would..." Shinji suddenly paused in mid-thought as a small beeping sounded through the air. "What is that?"
Nemu went over to one of the unconscious men in white and pulled a small communicator from their robes.
"It is a distress call. A class of academy students are under attack in the human world. Several casualties have already been reported." Nemu said, holding the device to her ear.
"What?" Shinji gasped. "How many students are left?"
"Unknown. According to the message, not more than a dozen or so." she said, pulling the device away, the call having ended.
"We have to help them!" he said with a sudden burst of confidence. He then paused. "Can we help them?"
"You are now a Captain-level Soul Reaper. You possess the power to save them. If you are willing, there is a way." Nemu said as she went over to the wall and pulled a strange looking sword from a small rack. The sword itself looked like a straight-bladed Chinese fighting sword. The blade was silver, the handle was black and the guard looked like a four-point diamond. "This is a special zanpakuto that will enable us to travel to the human world." she said.
"Okay." Shinji said, having accepted a lot in a short amount of time. "If you're right about these new powers, then... we don't have any time to lose." he stated.
Nemu gripped the sword tightly with her left hand, and pounded the handle with her right. The blade hummed as she thrust it forward, piercing the very air as if it were a giant marshmallow. The hole around the blade twisted and swirled, until it reformed into a small wooden doorway. The door slid to the side, revealing an opening passage through it.
"I'll go first." Shinji said. "If you're right, and I am a Soul Reaper Captain... then I'll be able to handle whatever's out there."
Nemu nodded as Shinji quickly passed through the portal, followed diligently by Nemu.
The portal closed and vanished as Mayuri started coming around.
"Oh... what happened?" Mayuri gasped as he looked around his damaged lab. "Where is the stupid construct and that punk kid who... who are you?" he suddenly ask as a delicate figure emerged from the shadows. "What are you doing with that... wait! Wait! Get away from AHHH!" he shouted as the crystal-bladed spirit energy-stealing sword he had developed was plunged into his chest.
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Shinji and Nemu appeared in the human world and quickly sighted a group of young Soul Reapers who had been cornered by a group of large, vicious Hollows.
"Nemu, how good are your fighting skills?" Shinji asked as he pulled his swords and holding them up.
"Mayuri-sama has not taught me how to handle a zanpakuto." she said.
"Great! So even if I gave you my swords you wouldn't be able to use them." he said. Hmm. Where did these swords come from anyway? He wondered.
"I would not. However, I am knowledgeable of hand-to-hand combat and possess enhanced physical prowess capable of matching a Hollow."
Shinji looked at her incredulously. "You can fight these things hand-to-hand?"
"If it is necessary."
"Alright. Then... protect the students. I'll deal with the Hollows."
"Yes, Captain." she said before Shinji could correct her.
Turning his attention towards the Hollows, Shinji leaped at the giant monsters, instantly gaining their attention as he slashed them from behind with his swords. Having been an Eva-pilot Shinji was not scared of facing a group of giant monsters. Smaller monsters than the Angels, and without his Eva. Regardless, he had often felt like he was fighting the Angels without benefit of Eva. And that was how he felt now as he as he felt his body move faster, jump higher and hit harder than he could ever have imagined.
This Is Incredible! He thought as he leaped into the air to slash another Hollow across his mask. It's like one of Kensuke's video games! He thought as the Hollow vanished.
While Shinji was leaping around like a superhero battling the giant monsters, the academy students and their instructor were just staring at him in shock.
"Who... who is that?" academy student Momo Hinamori asked.
"I don't know. I don't recognize him." instructor Shuhei Hisage said.
"Whoever he is, he's incredible!" academy student Izuru Kira gasped.
Suddenly, a reddish Hollow about ten feet tall appeared behind them and attacked.
"AH!" Momo cried out.
Before the Hollow could attack, a sphere of energy flew in and blasted the Hollow to pieces. The girl gasped as a svelte figure landed in front of her.
A woman? Momo gasped as the woman turned around to face her.
"Are you injured?" Nemu asked.
"N-No." Momo said, staring at the beautiful Soul Reaper before her.
"That is good. Stay behind me until my captain has dispatched the rest of the Hollows." she said as she fired off another Kido-blast at another Hollow.
Shinji pushed himself harder and cut down the last of the Hollows, moving so fast everything around him seemed to stand still.
He landed on the ground next to Nemu and the twelve students who were still alive.
"Is everyone alright?" Shinji asked.
"Uh... yeah. But... who are you?" Shuhei asked the young Soul Reaper.
"I'm Shinji. You've already met Nemu." he said.
"Are you... a Captain?" Momo asked.
Shinji turned to the cute girl with the two buns in her hair. "Uh... you could say that."
Izuru and his friend, Renji Abari, just looked at each other in confusion. To them this guy seemed like a rookie, like them, but his power was incredible. He had defeated nearly a dozen giant Hollows by himself and he hadn't even broken a sweat. He didn't even look tired.
Who is this guy? They thought in unison.
"Nemu, can you open a portal back to Soul Society?" Shinji asked the young woman.
"Yes, Captain." Nemu said as she pulled the sword from her back.
Within seconds, the portal was opened and the 12 academy students were through it and back to Soul Society.
Nemu and Shinji lingered though.
"Shinji-sama?" Nemu asked.
"I don't want to go back, Nemu. If I do... I could be in big trouble." Shinji said.
"Do you wish to stay?"
Shinji paused and thought about that. "No. I don't know what the punishment for stealing the powers of a Soul Reaper is going to be, but... I can't run away from this. I don't want to go back, but... if I don't... no. I have to go back and face the consequences of what I've done."
"Understood, Captain. But you will not face them alone." she said.
"Nemu..." Shinji said with a pleasant smile.
"My purpose is to serve you, my captain. Whatever happens... I will stand with you."
For some reason, that made Shinji feel better.
The pair interlaced their fingers as they walked through the portal.
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"I can't believe this!" Shinji groaned. "Will this paper work never end?" he asked as he stared at the stacks of paper before him on his desk.
"Another set of request papers have just arrived, Captain." Nemu said as she walked into the office.
"Let me guess: application requests to join the Fifth Company?"
"Affirmative."
Shinji looked at the woman. "Nemu, you don't have to say 'affirmative' all the time. You can be casual about it. Just say 'yes' or 'alright' or even 'sure'."
"Affir--yes, Shinji-sama." she corrected herself.
Shinji sighed as he shook his head. It had been three months since their rescue of the academy students from the Hollows and Shinji had slowly been able to break his dear lieutenant of her almost rigid mannerisms.
When the pair returned to Soul Society to face the consequences of their actions, they expected to be taken into custody, questioned, and even examined.
They were naturally shocked to find that not only were they welcomed back as heroes, they were credited with foiling not one, but two conspiracies. The first from Mayuri Kurotsuchi to steal spirit energy from other Soul Reapers, the second from Captain Aizen and Vice-Captain Gin Ichimaru for their attempted coups of Soul Society.
What was more, the person who revealed these plots to the 13 Guard Companies and the Council of 46, turned out to be none other than Yui Ikari.
Having come through a similar portal like Shinji had, Yui was somehow separated from Eva 01 but was only a weak ectoplasmic entity in the shape of her human self. In this weakened state however, she was only able to watch her son interact with Nemu and the others, until the crystal-bladed sword released two different energy waves that caused her to temporarily become solid and visible. Right after Shinji and Nemu had left to go to the living world, Yui picked up the sword and stabbed Mayuri in the chest, causing his Soul Reaper powers to be transferred to her. This made her whole and completely solid, but also made her a Captain-level Soul Reaper like her son.
She tied up the trio and quickly left to find someone who could help her.
She was fortunate that the first person she ran in to was Captain Retsu Unohana of the Fourth Division. Yui was able to convince Retsu of what had happened, and Retsu informed the Captain General of the First Division of the Guard Company's.
Once the other Captains had been assembled, they were naturally skeptical of Yui's claims that one of their own was trying to overthrow Soul Society. Mayuri had been easy to prove, as the crystal-bladed sword he had created bore his signature, but an investigation had to be conducted into Aizen's accusation. Yui was able to find it though, by locating the plans for the experimental Hollows that Gin Ichimaru was supposed to have destroyed.
With this evidence in hand, the other Captains immediately voted to replace Aizen and Mayuri with Yui Ikari and her son, Shinji.
They were able to do this since 1-both Aizen and Mayuri had completely lost their Soul Reaper powers, along with Gin Ichimaru, and 2-the report from Shuhei Hisage stated that both Shinji and Nemu had saved their lives from the Hollow attack.
Shinji literally became the youngest captain in Soul Society history, taking over as Captain of the Fifth Division, while his mother, who smothered the boy with hugs and kisses once he returned to Soul Society, became the new head of the Science and Research Division of Soul Society.
Shinji naturally chose Nemu as his lieutenant, who humbly accepted.
Their reputation spread like wildfire throughout the Seireitei, and even into the Rukongai.
Also, what nobody knew was that because of their actions, Aizen wasn't able to create any more new and powerful Hollows that would kill any other Soul Reapers in the future, such as Miyako Shiba, wife to Kaien Shiba, Vice Captain of the Thirteenth Division, which would have lead to his death as well at the hands of Rukia Kuchiki. Yui was also able to create a vaccine to save the life of Hisana, who was Rukia's older sister who had not seen her for years. This gained her the eternal thanks of Byakuya Kuchiki, Captain of the Sixth Division.
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
(AN: I know that when Rukia and Renji entered the academy together Hisana was already dead, but I couldn't help think how sad that was, so I decided to change that little detail to her simply being sick and bed-ridden)
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Since then the Fifth Division had many academy students clamoring to be admitted to their ranks, which Shinji had crafted as a type of bodyguard unit.
And in that time, Shinji and Nemu had grown considerably closer.
"Is there anything else, Captain?" Nemu asked once the paperwork was completed.
"Actually, there is, Nemu. Rangiku and Isane came by while you were out. They wanted to know if you would join them for drinks later tonight." Shinji said as he dropped the last paper onto the stack.
Nemu bristled at this.
"They came to see you?" she asked.
"Actually, they came to see you." Shinji said. "I told them I'm mention it to you."
"I cannot go. I have work to complete." Nemu said.
Shinji narrowed his eyes. "Nemu, we just finished the paperwork and the new cadets got finished with their training hours ago. You should go out with the other Vice-Captains. Get to know them better."
"I... am not interested." she said.
"Why not? They're good people."
"I see little point in social interactions when I have responsibilities to my captain and my division."
"Social interaction isn't going to kill you, Nemu." he said, then paused when he realized something. "You... don't want to go out, do you?" Shinji suddenly said.
Nemu hung her head. "I do not."
Shinji smiled. "I'm proud of you, Nemu."
"Proud?" the woman asked.
"You made a decision on your own. You didn't need me to tell you what to do. You decided you didn't want to go, so you didn't. I'd call that progress."
Nemu smiled at her captain's praise. She then noticed how tired and exhausted he seemed.
"You have been working too hard these last few days, Captain." Nemu said.
"Yeah. The paper work is boring, and exhausting. I've had to attend a few special meetings with the other Captains. There's been the training to fully master my Bankai. The new recruits are overly eager to prove themselves against the Hollows, which just leads to more paperwork. And yesterday I had to help mom clear out the Twelfth Division of her perverted lunatic science officers. For a bunch of perverts they built some pretty deadly weapons."
He said as Nemu came over and wrapped her arms around him from behind.
"Nemu what are you doing?"
"Comforting my captain." she said.
"Nemu, you don't have to..."
"My purpose is to serve my Captain, the person who activated me. That is you, Shinji-sama." she said as she trailed her hands down to gently rub his chest.
"That doesn't mean you're my... you don't have to do this."
"You once told me that I should make my own choices. And I choose... to comfort my master."
Shinji's face fell as he heard this. He did tell her that she could choose, but this seemed more in line with her programming of loyalty and service to the one who activated her. Still... it was nice that in her own way, she chose to be with him.
"You mean, instead of going out with the other Vice-Captains?"
"My master takes precedence over my social needs."
"Nemu, for the last time, I'm not your master. You are my friend, my partner, my lieutenant." he said. "You should have a life outside of the Fifth Division."
"I... don't want that life."
"You don't?" he asked, turning to face the beautiful young woman directly. "Why? Why would you sacrifice your own happiness, your own life just to stay and take care of me?"
Nemu stared Shinji directly into his deep blue eyes as her hand rose up to caress his cheek.
"Because... I... love you." she said in a quiet tone.
"You... what?" he gasped.
"I... love you, Shinji-kun." she said. "In the short time we have known each other, you have cared for and protected me. You have treated me as an equal and a friend. You have valued my opinions and made strides to see me grow as your lieutenant and as an individual." she said with a kind smile. "How can I not fall in love with a man who puts the well-being of myself before his own?" she said
Shinji felt his own cheeks glow as the beautiful woman leaned in and slowly closed her eyes.
His own actions seemed to mimic her own, feeling both a physical and emotional attraction to the woman he regarded as more than a friend and lieutenant. As their lips met, Shinji reflected on how perfect this woman was.
Her soft green eyes he could get lost in forever. Her long silk-like hair that was like a waterfall he could spend hours running his fingers through. Her skin was as soft and flawless as that of a newborn baby. Her body as sexy as any he had ever seen. And her heart, her soul, pure and untainted despite her origins.
Their lips moved away from each other as they stared into each others eyes.
"I've wanted this for so long, Nemu-chan." he said in a whisper to her. "To be with someone who could love me.. as I love them."
Nemu smiled as she moved from behind Shinji and pulled him up to his feet.
"You need your sleep, captain." she said. "I will ensure that you are not disturbed."
"How are you going to do that?" he asked as she lead him back to his room.
"I will stay with you the entire night." she smiled.
Shinji slept soundly that night, curled up in bed with Nemu as his pillow. The lovely lieutenant gently stroking his hair as he slept.
Outside his room, a certain Twelfth Division captain smiled.
I wonder how many grandchildren they'll give me? Yui wondered before walking back towards her own Division.
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Shinji and Nemu were married a short time later, much to the disappointment of many a female Soul Reaper, including some of the other lieutenants. With Yui's help Nemu was able to give the Twelfth Division Captain nearly a half-dozen grandchildren, who all eventually transferred to other divisions instead of their father's.
Nemu remained by Shinji's side for the rest of her life, loving and caring for him as more than a wife and lieutenant. Shinji remained one of the Soul Society's most powerful captains for more than a millennium, eventually retiring and passing on his title to his youngest son, named Kaworu.
He was remembered for many great accomplishments, including the brokering of a peace between Soul Society and the Quincy Archers.
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Author's Notes:
Hope everyone liked this newest story I've been working to complete and upload as soon as I could. It involves one of the, in my opinion, sexiest and most abused characters in the Bleach world, Nemu Kurotsuchi.
And yes, anyone who reads this story may realize that what happened in this story takes place several decades before the start of the original Bleach storyline. I figured it was the best way to do this story, sort of have Nemu and Shinji get together right from the start and save Nemu from being abused by Mayuri at all. Teleporting Shinji and his mother into the 'past' so to speak, seemed like the best way to do it.
Next Story: Shinji becomes the 'pet' of Yachiru Kusajishi, and helps to save Rukia's life from execution. (Will probably be done mostly for humor, not romance)Inland Empire, CA (PRWEB) February 03, 2014
Businesses and job training organizations from throughout the Inland Empire gathered recently to recognize employers and celebrate the achievements of workers with disabilities employed throughout California at the second annual Inland Empire Caucus Partnership Recognition event.
“The unemployment level among people with disabilities in general is over 20 percent. It’s much higher for people with intellectual disabilities,” said Christopher Rice, executive director of California Disability Services Association in an interview with Labor Today magazine's Jeff Allen. “To have this number of employers doing things with the folks in the Inland Empire is really wonderful.”
“We as service providers – employment training and placement agencies – get to come together and say ‘Thank you’ to these employers, and show our dignitaries and politicians just how important and valuable these programs and services are to our state,” said Wendy Rogina, executive director of Vocational Improvement Program, Inc. (VIP). “VIP is an employment training and placement program. We provide employment service [for] entry-level types of employment to many businesses throughout the Inland Empire.” According to its website, VIP’s mission is to maximize the potential of individuals with disabilities.
“We’ve been existence since 1986, almost 27 years now, and provide services annually to just over 650 individuals with disabilities,” Rogina explained. Employers can find workers for direct hire, contract with VIP similar to a temporary employment agency, or subcontract services from one of VIP’s three manufacturing facilities.
“Across the country, corporations are starting to identify the true value of these types of partnerships,” Rogina explained. “More and more people on a daily basis are making calls to programs like ours to see how they can do this, and asking for our program assistance to get it done. Statewide, our legislators control some of that so we have to make it very clear to them how valuable these programs continue to be.”
“The California Disability Services Association supports the activities of service providers for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities across the state,” said Executive Director Rice. “One of the key activities they all do is to support people in getting employment. This event recognizes employers who have hired or are contracting with service providers for people with developmental disabilities to have jobs.”
“Our service providers make sure that they are matching the right people to every position they place someone in,” Rice continued. “[Employers are] finding folks who are tremendously motivated, who are anxious to prove that they can do the job, and as a result, what employers talk about is how they get better attendance, more involvement, more enthusiasm from the people that are brought by our service providers. This is a new world, where everyone is concerned about the bottom line. The surprising thing for employers is frequently that the bottom line can be improved by the people we bring to them for employment.”
“Our organizations here are working hard to give them [people with disabilities] a full life,” said Assemblyman Mike Morrell, who represents California’s 40th District. “God bless the training centers that work to do that, to make families whole, and keep them busy, give them a purpose and an income, and I tell you what, they’re very productive, so it’s a good thing to see.”
Morrell said, he has toured facilities such as VIPs and “number one, their training is excellent. Number two, they produce a good product, meaning that they train these people with disabilities in an excellent manner and put them out in the work force. From what I’ve seen, talking with many employers, these young people who they’re training are some of the hardest, most dedicated workers, and they rarely take time off. VIP, and organizations like it, does an excellent job on training and putting them out in the workforce and our employers in the Inland Empire are grateful for these young folks.”retail:

Go lithium ion.
Good unit with everything you would need for a home job. I also though recommend L-Ion. This is a great set for the price.
A third vote for LiIon. Just received the DCD717 from HD, very impressed.
If they offer a lithium conversion kit (charger + battery) this might be cheaper than buying the lithium set. Switched my Ryobi stuff to lithium. They work better than new now! Forget about NiCad! Even NiMh is better than NiCad!
Li-Ion is higher power density so the battery is usually smaller and lighter, but in no way does it make a drill work better than new. Same voltage NiCd pack is actually capable of more current than Li-Ion in cell sizes used on drills and will withstand more recharge cycles so it's sort of the opposite.
Guys, that's why there are still so many NiCd powered drills. The industry isn't too stupid to pick the right battery format for the job, both battery types have their merits.just asked my mom i have never heard of that XO

The New Orleans Hornets hadn't had anything to celebrate for so long, they wanted to make sure they didn't forget anything Monday night after holding off the Utah Jazz 76-75. It was the first win of the season for the Hornets, who had opened with eight straight losses.
The loss also spoiled the night for the Utah crowd of 19,911, which sold out the arena to watch John Stockton's No. 12 be retired.
"We persevered. We won," said P.J. Brown, who had nine rebounds. Jamaal Magloire led the Hornets with 20 points and 11 boards.
New Orleans, which led by 19 in the second half, gave Utah several opportunities to win, but the Jazz couldn't convert. Andrei Kirilenko missed two free throws with 4.4 seconds left and Gordan Giricek's jumper at the buzzer bounced off the rim, starting the Hornets' celebration.
"It's like I kept saying. It's gonna come," said Scott, who got his first win as Hornets coach. "We've just got to keep working to get better on the defensive end."
New Orleans was just fine on defense, holding the Jazz to 12 points in the final period and a 26-for-68 night from the floor. Carlos Boozer, a 1999 Juneau-Douglas High School graduate who is Utah's leading scorer on the season, was held to eight points on 2-for-10 shooting and 10 rebounds. Boozer entered Monday's contest averaging 22.2 points a game.
"This team averages over 100 points a game. But we shut them down," said P.J. Brown, who had nine rebounds for the Hornets. "Offensively we were good, but defensively, we was even better."
Lee Nailon scored 16 points in his first start for the Hornets.
The victory left the Chicago Bulls, 100-82 losers to the Phoenix Suns as the only NBA team without a victory. The Bulls are 0-9.
"We leave all that to Chicago now," Magloire said.
Utah rallied from a 19-point deficit in the second half and led briefly down the stretch, but could not sustain it.
Kirilenko led Utah with 18 points, nine rebounds and seven blocks.
Timberwolves 83, Mavericks 82
DALLAS - Kevin Garnett made two free throws with 5.9 seconds left then Trenton Hassell blocked Jerry Stackhouse's long jumper at the buzzer, giving Minnesota a victory over Dallas in the Mavericks' first of several games without Dirk Nowitzki.
Garnett finished with 21 points, 17 rebounds and nine assists, just missing his first triple-double of the season.
Suns 100, Bulls 82.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. - Bonzi Wells had 26 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with less than a minute left, to lead Memphis.

The device’s most impressive specification is probably its profile measurements, coming in at just 6.68mm, or 0.26-inches. Engadget pointed out that the size is even slimmer than Motorola’s 7.1mm Droid RAZR.
As for specifications, the Ascend P1 S packs in a 4.3-inch (540 x 960) qHD Super AMOLED display, 1080p video support, SGX 540 GPU, 1.5GHz TI OMAP 4460 dual-core processor, 8-megapixel main cam, 1.3-megapixel back cam, LED flash, and 1 GB of RAM. There is also a lesser model called simply the “Ascend P1″ that packs in similar features, but it has a wider profile of 7.69 mm and most likely a lower price point.
Both devices will land in the United States, and just about every other market, sometime in the second-quarter of 2012. Pricing has not been announced.

What will going to the dentist be like in the future? Here's a look at research on re-growing tooth enamel.
Dentistry advances in my lifetime have gone from drills that felt like they belonged in a tool shop to relatively painless laser technology. I do wonder what's coming down the pike. But, for now... I have a pretty good idea!
I do hope your day starts out better than mine!
Brush, floss, rinse, repeat!

Do you sometimes think a dentist enjoys seeing a patient flinch?
Oh, I hate the dentist! I need to go, though. And I even have insurance, but I just can't make myself. That's how much I hate the dentist!
That book sounds really interesting, though!
It's amazing how dental equipment improves in time - from the dental pelican and dental keys of the past to the smaller hand pieces we have today. Hmmm, I wonder if lasers could be used as dental tools in the future. Maybe they could also make a stronger anesthesia that could render dental operations virtually painless.
Diana DickertStore with Best Champagne Selection Boston Area or Metrowest?!
I find the selection and customer service at Cambridge Wine and Spirits at Fresh Pond next to Whole Foods to be top notch, as well as the Martignetti location on Soldiers Field Road (go directly to the wine department, NOT the front service desk, for the most informed help. I am pretty sure either will discount a case by at 10% of the per bottle price, and I believe Cambridge Wine and Spiritis told me they were having a 20% off special during July for any 12 non-sale bottles of wine, which I assume extends to bubbly - just not sure when it happens.

Gordon's carries a couple of grower champagnes, whereas I haven't seen any at Cambridge Wine and Spirits which does sometimes have good discounts on NV champagnes from large houses (example VC yellow label) but wouldn't otherwise suggest for this. Another place West of Boston is Berman's which doesn't have a huge selection, but might have something unusual and one or two vintage champagnes. Julio's in Westborough is a Metrowest option, but you mentioned rt 2 so don't think its in your immediate surrounds. If you are willing to go out of your region, Federal Wine and Spirits would probably have a wider selection than all of these and you can phone/online order and just drive there to pickup. They also will deliver, but not certain if that is available or advisable in Summer.

Alejandra Zamora, a student at CSUCI, walks by the historic Roman museum in Malaga, Spain, during a three-week study abroad trip to Spain.
Alejandra Zamora, a student at CSUCI, rides a camel in Morocco during a three-week study abroad trip to Spain.
Colleges are expanding their study abroad programs beyond Western Europe, adding countries such as India and China that offer valuable international experience but cost less.
Some also are trying to make study abroad more accessible to low-income and minority students, who are less likely than white students to go overseas, by providing shorter trips and giving financial help.
"The number of new programs in new areas continues to soar," said Peggy Blumenthal, chief operating officer for the Institute of International Education. "Students are realizing their careers are going to be global. Some of these are places they need to understand before they start their careers."
Britain remained the most popular destination for students studying abroad in the 2007-08 school year, but India, China and South Africa showed some of the greatest growth, according to a survey released this week by the institute. India was up by 19.8 percent over the previous year, and China was up by 19 percent.
Nationally, the number of students studying abroad continued to rise, increasing by 8.5 percent in 2007-08, according to the institute. About 82 percent of those students were white, and only 6 percent were Latino.
Colleges are offering more short-term programs or going to less expensive countries, hoping to draw students who believe they can't afford the time or money for a longer program, Blumenthal said.
"The students are there," Blumenthal said. "You can reach them, but it may take additional money or additional outreach. They may need to be persuaded that this is possible for them."
These days, more than half of students who study abroad go for less than a quarter — usually over the summer, during a January term or for a few weeks during the school year. About 40 percent go for a full quarter or two, or a semester, according to the institute. Only 4 percent go for an entire year.
Colleges have different ways of funding study-abroad programs. Some charge students the actual cost. Others charge the same amount for tuition, room and board as a semester at home, so the only extra cost for students is airfare and field trips.
At CSU Channel Islands in Camarillo, a political science professor will lead a short trip to South Africa in spring 2011 as part of a class studying the country's society and politics, including apartheid. Students will stay with local families, giving them a more direct connection than they would get as tourists.
"Our students need to understand that most of the world not only doesn't look like them, it doesn't live like them," said Andrea Grove, who is taking CSUCI students to South Africa for the third time. "By going to other parts of the world, they get exposed to that in a way that's much more effective than telling them that in a classroom."
CSUCI subsidizes short trips abroad led by faculty, making those trips more accessible for low-income and minority students who otherwise would not be able to go.
The subsidies, funded by a $50 annual student fee, pay for about two-thirds of a typical trip, said Antonio Jimenez-Jimenez, director of the university's Center for International Affairs. Last summer, Jimenez-Jimenez took students to Spain for three weeks, a trip that normally would cost $3,800. With the subsidy, students paid $1,000.
That subsidy allowed Alejandra Zamora, 20, the first person in her family to attend college, to make the trip. She recommends study abroad for everyone, even if they can't go for a whole semester or year, noting that financial help is available.
"Three weeks gave me enough time to get out of my comfort zone and experience a different culture," said Zamora, a junior at CSUCI. "I did have feelings about not going, about financial issues. I didn't think it would be possible during my college years, but there is help out there."
That's why CSUCI is trying to make study abroad more accessible, Jimenez-Jimenez said. Students who study abroad see other ways of doing things and experience other ways of thinking, he said. Then they bring that experience back to CSUCI, broadening their classmates' horizons, too.
"This is a program that changes lives, and that's why we do it," he said. "I can't think of an educational experience that has a bigger impact on students than studying abroad."
At California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, the alumni association is planning to raise funds to help students study overseas, said Lisa Loberg, director of its study abroad program. The university already offers a few scholarships from $500 to $1,000, Loberg said.
"Study abroad adds so much to the CLU campus and culture," she said. "It's a small investment if you think about what you get in return."
CLU also is offering shorter trips, with faculty taking students to Costa Rica in January and Japan in May.
Pepperdine University in Malibu, which sends more than 80 percent of its students abroad, added Shanghai to its program two years ago. The Shanghai trip has filled up both years and has a waiting list for next year, said Charles Hall, dean of international programs.
"The word on the street was that more and more students are interested in the East," Hall said. "We're heavy in Europe and said, ‘We need to have a program in China, because that's where the future is.' "
Africa will probably be the next study abroad site for Pepperdine, but that's down the road because of the economy, Hall said.
Last year, Pepperdine also launched two scholarships that help low-income students study abroad. The scholarships provide up to $2,000 a semester, on top of financial aid. So far, the school has given out $84,500, Hall said.
"We simply don't want these opportunities to be available only to those who are wealthy," he said. "Economics should not matter."

- In 1983, Pryor signed a three-year promotional agreement with Sylvester Stallone's promotional company, Tiger Eye. [3]
- Pryor was offered $750,000 to fight Roberto Duran in 1981, but Pryor's new attorney told him not to sign anything until he worked out a new contract with his manager. By the time a new agreement had been worked out, the chance to fight Duran was gone. Pryor also turned down $500,000 to fight Sugar Ray Leonard. [4]
- Pryor signed to fight Sugar Ray Leonard in the fall of 1982 for $750,000, but Leonard first had to defend his title against Roger Stafford in Buffalo, New York on May 14, 1982. Pryor was driving to Buffalo to taunt Leonard to help hype their fight when he heard on the radio that Leonard had suffered a detached retina and the fight was off. Pryor said, "I pulled off to the side of the road and I cried." [5]
- Pryor had trouble getting a boxing license late in his career because of eye problems. In 1988, Pryor underwent surgery to remove a cataract and repair a detached retina. He was declared legally blind in his left eye. The vision in his left eye was 20/400. With corrective lenses, his vision improved to 20/70. He was denied a license in California, New York and Nevada.

Dr Norman Rosenthal is used to looking outside the box for answers to conditions including seasonal affective disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. His work has sometimes put him at odds with a largely conservative medical establishment who forget that many of today’s procedures were themselves questioned in the past.
Light therapy and transcendental meditation are not something your average doctor prescribes but then Norman Rosenthal is no ordinary doctor. The world renowned psychiatrist and best-selling author is one of the leading experts on seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and pioneered the use of light therapy in its treatment.
The condition, commonly known as the ‘winter blues,’ affects around one in fifty people in the UK with symptoms including prolonged bouts of depression, lethargy, loss of libido and over-eating. SAD is commonly thought to be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain when a lack of natural light makes it produce more melatonin, a sleep hormone, and less serotonin, which enhances mood, leading to low mood.
Dr Rosenthal is all too familiar with the condition. “I wasn’t aware that I had SAD until I emigrated to the US from South Africa and noticed how apathetic and down I felt during the winter months.”
“It always makes me smile when medical experts assume their expertise in a certain field precludes the possibility of them falling ill with a condition themselves. I could set my calendar by the effects which would last up to five months before the days began to lengthen and the sun came out.”
Dr Rosenthal began experimenting with the use of light boxes at home, he discovered an hour or two of exposure to concentrated light each day led to a noticeable improvement in his mood and energy alongside established treatments. However, he admits he has his share of detractors.
Light therapy is a recognised form of treatment in the US but isn’t recognised by UK NICE guidelines, despite more than 20 years research and two meta-analysis on both sides of the Atlantic. He said: ‘I’ll be long gone before the last cynic is convinced. What these people have forgotten is that many of today’s medical treatments and procedures where once questioned and frowned upon”.
If light therapy faces an uphill struggle to meet the approval of a traditionally conservative medical establishment then Rosenthal says no-one should hold their breath over the use of transcendental meditation (TM). It is rare for a psychiatrist to take a patient’s advice but Dr Rosenthal believes wisdom is where you find it so when a patient told him about the positive effects of practising TM he decided to have a go himself with surprising results. “I’d dabbled with meditation as a student in the 70s because it was the cool thing to do but didn’t take it too seriously.”
His initial efforts met with little success until he realised that practising once every couple of weeks was as delusionary as expecting to lose weight by eating healthily once a fortnight. He refocused his efforts setting aside 20 minutes a day to meditate and was so surprised by the results that he now uses TM to treat patients with post-traumatic stress disorder including soldiers.
Dr Rosenthal said: “I knew there had been some previous studies of TM being used on Vietnam veterans with PTSD which showed positive results and I subsequently began using it as a complementary therapy on modern-day veterans,” and soldiers have reported a noticeable improvement in their sense of well-being and moods after being taught TM.
He added: “People do have a very stereotypical view of meditation. However, it is an easy, practical tool to use once you have received the appropriate training and has a great calming effect on the mind and body. It provides a great source of relaxation and insight and puts your day-to-day worries into perspective”.
It’s not without its critics and opinion about its validity is divided despite more than 500 research papers and the backing of practicing clinicians. Dr Rosenthal agrees more research is needed but remains sanguine about the challenge of convincing the medical profession about his marriage of conventional and complementary medical practices.
He says a willingness to remain curious and open minded is essential and one he says his ‘fossilised’ critics would do well to adopt, “old age isn’t about numbers so much as a loss of curiosity and willingness to be open to new possibilities”.
“There is a lot of deep seated antagonism within the medical establishment about anything that doesn’t neatly fit neatly into the box of conventional medical practice. That box and its attendant checks, measures and clinical standards are there with good reason but when a condition doesn’t fit inside it we have a problem.”
“I’m a psychiatrist so am well aware that drugs have their use but we should be actively looking for alternatives where possible. After all, who wants to prescribe a 10-year-old with Prozac?”

Hi, all...
I have a 5 year old Dimension 4700 that uses integrated graphics with a Radeon X300 SE graphics card (I assume the video card is a separate card in a slot??). I have 2Gb of RAM installed, and a Pentium 4 2.80 CPU, and the power supply is 305W. I do not do gaming at this point, but might like to try it in the future. I would like to get a few more years out of my 4700 before diving into a new purchase. I have a couple of questions: 1) Do I need more capability than what the X300 SE provides, and 2) if so, what graphics card is recommended? I have done the analysis via Dell scan on my 4700, and there are any number of graphics cards that will allegedly fit the bill... the best rated one that floats to the top of the list is the HD 4670 512Mb.
If a video upgrade is suggested by someone... I can follow that advice. As a favor to me, as I have not done an upgrade like this before... what are the detailed steps that I would have to follow to upgrade the video card?
Finally... is more RAM than 2Gb suggested? I am running Win XP SP 3. Thanks for all suggestions/advice. Have a blessed day!
Tony
The X300 is a very limited video card. The 4670 is a much better choice.
If you're using XP, it's unlikely you need more RAM.
You do not have integrated graphics if you have a Radeon x300 card. Installing a new card is not very difficult. Follow the safety instructions in your manual HERE. Then follow the directions for installing a new card under Removing Parts.
Thanks, Mary...
As a part of the new graphics card install, do you have to go to Device Manager and turn off (disable??) the Radeon X300 and X300 Secondary drivers? If so... is this done before the removal of the old card and the install of the new card, or after the removal of the old card and the install of the new card? I guess what I am asking is whether or not there is a defined sequence of steps... the manual link didn't talk a lot about disabling the old graphics drivers. Thanks!
You do not disable it. You uninstall it from your Add/Remove Programs. Uninstall the ATI driver and any ATI software such as the Catalyst Control Center before removing the X300 from your Add/Remove Programs. Once you have uninstalled the driver and software, you will then shutdown your computer and remove the X300 card and replace it with your new one. Connect your monitor cable to the new card and restart your computer. When the computer has booted back to your desktop, this is when you will want to install the new driver and software.
Hi...
One last question. The HD4670 supports DirectX 10. I am running Win XP SP 3 with 2Gb of RAM, and the version of DirectX that I have is DirectX 9.0c 4.09.0000.0904. If I install the HD4670 to replace the Radeon X300, will I run into trouble because of the version of DirectX I am using? From what I can see from Internet research, it seems as though DirectX version 10 will not run on a WIN XP system. Advice in this deeply appreciated! Thanks...
DirectX 10 is only available on Vista or Windows 7. However, running the HD 4670 on XP with DirectX 9 is a non issue. The card supports it if you have a game that happens to run DirectX 10, but it will run on DirectX 9 also with no problems whatsoever.
I also have the Radeon X300 SE 128M.B. hyper memorey graphics card a PCI-E interface card ! Like yopu I do not use my XPS400 for gaming and I find the RADEON handles everything I throw at it easily . If you go a read some of the reviews on this card you will be pleasantly surprised on how high of marks it recieves as a budget graphics card . I after recieveing my PC also installed an ATI TV Wonder Elite PCI TV tuner card ! These two cards work together well wthin the WindowsXP MCE 2005 ! Even I would like to upgrade my graphics card just to see how much differance it would make in the performance of my PC ! However at this time with the state of the economy Iam not in a hurry to spend money on a piece of hardware that does not nedd replacement due to failure of the exsisting one installed ! For a review on this card try CNET web site >
Good Luck, Gumba
Hi...
Just purchased the following graphics card... his ati radeon hd 4670 1 gb h467qs1gh.
I have been reading a lot of SCARY stuff regarding the tricky drivers for this card... HDMI sound drivers that should not be installed because they will mess up audio settings and disable the speakers (in fairness, it was said that if the speakers are on the monitor itself, then the sound would not be affected), the Catalyst Driver at Ver. 9.8 not recognizing the card (Catalyst HotFix for Radeon 4000-series cards has to be installed to prevent this?).
What is best to do here so that my system doesn't get messed up?
Also, it seems to be best to not use the drivers packaged with the card because they might not be up-to-date... to use applicable drivers from the ATI site instead. Can you please provide the URL to where the very most up-to-date drivers, hotfixes, etc., for this card can be acquired?
Thanks for the assistance!! Have a blessed day...
The AGP versions of the ATI cards require special "hotfix" drivers, but not the PCIe ones.
It's OK to install the HDMI drivers. You can choose (via the Control Panel Sound applet) which device you want to use. To run the Sound applet, enter the following from Start->Run: control.exe mmsys.cpl sounds .
The most up-to-date drivers are had directly from the ATI site.
Whether or not drivers are installed from a disk included with a graphics card, or from the card manufacturer's website... where (meaning what directory) are the drivers supposed to be installed to? Does this happen automatically? I am assuming that you must point to where the drivers are supposed to be installed. Does anyone have a suggestion on where graphics card drivers must be installed? Thanks, and have a blessed day!
Save the file you download from the ATI to your desktop. When it is fully downloaded, double-click on the icon.
This will lead to an installation screen. Use the defaults to install the video drivers and you should be good to go.
Hi... I received the HIS HD4670 graphics card, and installed it.
I had a problem with the installation of drivers/software for the High Definition Audio Bus... through some unfortunate combination of circumstances, I wound up trashing my PC (I could not access my D:\, E:\ and F:\ (Mass Storage) drives, my SoundMAX audio would not work). I could not use Win XP's Restore Points to get my PC back to a working state. Fortunately for me, I had an Acronis C:\ backup image that I was able to restore, after I re-enabled my drive images.
Whew!
I have a question. The graphics card video driver alone is installed now (acquired from the AMD/ATI site), and working fine. In my Device Manager, under Other Devices, there is an entry called Audio Device on High Definition Audio Bus. It was initially enabled, and was causing the PC to display a 'new hardware found' (and another associated message) every time the PC was booted up. I disabled the device, and the messages have disappeared. Everything seems to work fine now... drive images are OK, sound is enabled, etc. My PC has SoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio (that is what displays in my Sevice Manager under Sound, video and game controllers.
Should I leave well enough alone, and not try to enable the currently disabled Audio Device on High Definition Audio Bus? If that is the recommended approach... would it be OK to uninstall the Audio Device on High Definition Audio Bus? Or did I just screw up somewhere along the line and do the wrong things when installing the High Definition Audio Bus? Any ideas and advice deeply appreciated. Thanks!!
The 4670 has an onboard eight-channel HDMI audio device for which there is a special driver available from the Realtek site.
Once the driver is installed, you can set the default audio output device in the Sound control panel applet.
My concern would be whether or not downloading and installing the Realtek driver for the 8-channel audio device on the HD4670 graphics card would mess up the existing SoundMAX integrated audio that my PC currently has. Thoughts?
No, it would not.Q:

Individual and family counseling are offered for personal, academic, family and substance abuse problems. Counselors are trained to provide assessments, crisis intervention and brief treatment. Fees are established on a sliding scale and based on the number of people in a family and yearly income for those families who do not have health insurance coverage.
Students in grades nine through twelve are referred by their guidance counselors. AYFS staff and interns provide counseling services at the Auburn High School. Counseling issues cover such areas as substance abuse, depression, divorce, academic failure, domestic violence, sexuality issues, dating relationships and other family related issues.
Graphics: 7/10
Unlike a majority of browser-based games, Nadirim employs a realistic graphics style which works in the game’s favor very well. Humans and monsters in battle look more photographic than animated, there is no particular cartoon-y stylization to the world objects, and equipment aims to look as authentic as possible.
Most importantly, though, the world just looks pretty.
Big cities are green and lush and captivating, with majestic buildings that catch the eye and inspire awe. Lakes and the rare oasis have such peaceful blue waters with a gentle flow and ebb. Old towns and slums are sandy and bleak, with rotting and dilapidated homes, and vast deserts are nothing but bleak wastelands, unmoving, bright, but punishing. The use of colors is absolutely fantastic in this game, as is the use of world objects (or lack thereof, in many cases).
There are two things about the graphics in Nadirim that are disappointing, however, and the first factor is the game’s icons. In the grand scheme of things, this isn’t particularly important; but items in the inventory are very boring and static, and the equipment icons just look slap-dash. The skill icons are far worse, containing simple and sometimes random pictures that don’t always make sense.
The second disappoint factor can be found in battles, and the problem is that battles look lazy. The player character is the same static image from the creation screen, which can also be found in the inventory menu, and they never do anything in battle. They move in and out of the foreground during turns, and maybe shake a little when attacking or being attacked, but that’s it. Monsters are the same: there’s no change in motion, nor is there even a new picture appropriate for battle at any time.
Attack graphics are just as lazy, and they range from a curved clash to a descending circle, with the occasional puff of smoke or claw rake. Now, to be fair, these graphical limitations are in place to keep the game’s overall framerate both high and stable. This is completely fair -- but it doesn’t change the fact that battles can be boring.
And there is a good indication that these complaints will be addressed in the near future, which may make an already visually-appealing game even more so.
Sound: 9/10
If gameplay is Nadirim’s most appealing feature, then its music is the most charming. Nadirim is an fantasy Arabian world rich with magic and mystery among the tales of shady dealers and desert assassins; and while the selection of songs and ambient sounds are limited, they suck the player right into the world and keep them gripped in tightly. The battle music is epic and makes the player feel like they’re in a monumental struggle for survival, but returning to the world map is just as much a treat when the sounds of low horns and bells float from the speakers.
Sound effects in battle are a little uninspired and, in some cases, perhaps even lower in quality, but the game’s music is so mesmerizing that a few generic-sounding slashes go unnoticed to anyone but those listening for them.
Controls: 10/10
The controls in Nadirim are so simple, a toddler can pick it up with no problem. Everything about the game is point-and-click: click on a destination to go there, click on a target to attack, click on the attack to use, etc. The interface still needs a little work as updates come, but most hotkeys are exactly what they should be. As a point of intrigue, they almost mirror Neverwinter Nights perfectly, but the hotkeys in that game were also, by and large, exactly what they should be. It should be believed, given the browser format, that if any new features are added to the game, their controls will be just as streamlined and user-friendly.

Gloom and doom down in Salem -- the governor's going to force every state agency to take a 4.6% budget cut. Teachers will get laid off. Prisoners will be set free. The sick will be left to die.
But look on the bright side: We've got hundreds of millions of state dollars to build a light rail line down to Milwaukie. The teachers, the prisoners, and the sick can all take a lovely ride to Bob's Red Mill, where they can beg for some gruel.
Actually, given the amount of crime that the trains attract, it's probably good to add a few if we're going to be locking fewer people up.
"I can't hear you -- c'mon!"

Today the Clackamas County Sheriff testified against light rail because of increased crime. Good to know the teachers and prisoners will have a lot of "company" on the ride to Milwaukie.

"...each state agency’s budget would be cut by 4.6 percent across the board, which represents a 9 percent cut for the last 12 months of the biennium."
The O reported 9% cut. Not sure I get how that works.
Anyway, time for govt on all levels to rip off the band-aid. Let's see how bad the wound is instead of pretending it's not there.

No need to pay me a consulting fee for the idea, Governor Klug.
Posted by Mike (the other one) | June 23, 2010 3:39 PM
The O reported a 9% budget cut which is for a biennium. Since this is just for the one year remaining in the biennium, the cut is slightly half as that, 4.6%.
What a crock of journalistic integrity O.
Posted by the other Steve | June 23, 2010 3:45 PM
Other Steve: I may be wrong, but I think it's the other way around. The state needs to cut 4.6% for the biennium, but since it is halfway over, that amounts to about 9% for the remainder.
I really wish our mainstream media cleared this up for for us hoi polloi ...
Posted by Garage Wine | June 23, 2010 4:11 PM
Maybe Ted Wheeler will just drop by Spirit Mountain and lay the 4.6% on red.

"Teachers will get laid off. Prisoners will be set free. The sick will be left to die."
PERS employer contributions will increase, STEP raises will remain in place, raises will continue to be given,BETC grants will continue.
Don't worry folks, things are just like normal.
Posted by Steve | June 23, 2010 6:34 PM
This simple mathematics, folks. The need to cut 4.6 percent of a biennial budget, enacted halfway into that period, equates to roughly a 9 percent cut at the delayed beginning point to the end of the biennium. What's complicated about that? So, to summarize: It's really a 9 percent cut for right now, and until the end of the current biennium. It would or will be a 4.6 percent cut if everything were to remain the same in the next biennium (which it won't, most likely).
Is math a lost science?
Posted by Paul | June 23, 2010 9:59 PM
But what is most surprising about Ted's budget cuts,(ha), is that his chief of staff said the 9% cut will result in 200 job losses per the O.
Wow, that is too much! That's out of almost 600,000 state government employees. This extraordinary cut is 3/1000 of one percent!!
One of my local business friends has cut 11 employees out of 52. I guess he should take a lesson from the state and raise revenue by raising his prices to keep his employees.
Posted by Lee | June 23, 2010 10:15 PM
Not just any teachers, as if they were a ubiquitous bunch. The younger more enthusiastic and cheaper ones will get tossed over first. But the payment that is carved off and redirected to PERF, measured relative to all wages regardless of pension "tier" at about 26 percent of current wage payout (this number might be stale), will surely remain untouched. An astute parent could dare to insist that this other payment is unlawful, though they would have to invest a year or two just to figure it out and then maybe longer to present the holy grail of an argument to our top court. I had speculated in 2003 that the replacement peer group of non-tier-one PERS teachers would have a voting majority within the OEA itself perhaps within ten years. We are almost there. All hope is not lost.

Bluecollar - I have a bit of news for you... the kids of the upper class generally don't attend public universities (unless there is a familial tie). In general, they get to go to spendy, private schools with small claaes, lovely campuses, more prestige, and more engaged faculty.

Latest revision as of 04:55, 27 May 2013
1907-11-18 (146lbs) Curley Watson w pts 15 Andrew Jeptha, NSC, Covent Garden, London, England. Referee: J. H. Douglas. Made at 146lbs, Watson (144), who was looking to regain his Imperial British Empire title claim, was the first to make some headway when using the left heavily before Jeptha (144½) started to cross his right over the top. With both men inclined to clinch the referee had his hands full, while Watson was forced to use the ring to avoid the body blows. In the sixth Watson added considerably to his score, and in the seventh he also had the best of the exchanges, but failed to take advantage of openings, as did Jeptha. Although the tenth saw Jeptha almost getting even when the two men came together, from there on in Watson, using clever headwork to avoid punishment, went on to secure the required points.
Watson was soon fighting at 148lbs.Characteristics

Identifying Oldsmobile 330-455 CID Rocket Cylinder Heads
In 1964 Oldsmobile introduced its newly designed 330 C.I. engine. The 330 was much lighter than the 394 and more powerful than the 215 F-85 V-6 power plant it replaced.For over 25 years we witnessed the 330 evolve into many other cubic inch engines. The 400 and 425 big blocks were introduced in 1965 to power the 442 and full size Oldsmobiles respectively. In 1968 the 330 grew to 350 cubic inches and the 425 became the 455 when Olds changed the crankshaft stroke. The 400 changed bore and stroke also that year to share the 455's crank.
In 1975, the 260 V8 joined the Olds lineup as the new small block, and a year later the 455 was dropped forever. The 403 small block was to replace the 455 in its duty of powering the bigger bodied Olds and Cutlass series cars so optioned in 1977. It was not a Cutlass option in '78 and lived only through 1979. The long lived 350 was also dropped when the 307 arrived which became the sole surviving Oldsmobile designed V8 engine.
As the 330 grew, so did the list of cylinder heads used on its upgraded cousins. Although the basic design stayed pretty much the same, valve size, port shapes and combustion chamber volumes changed to meet the demands for more horsepower at first and cleaner air as smog restrictions tightened.
In the late '60s Toronado, marine and 442 heads were given larger intake valves (2.077 vs. 2.00) than the other big block cars of that period. In 1970 this trend continued on the G.T. version of the Toronado, the 442s and marine engines. In '72 the only big valve heads were found only on 442s with manual transmissions and all W-30 and marine motors. An interesting twist developed in 1972. Some 455s were fitted with 1.688 diameter exhaust valves instead of the 1.625 diameter valves that were normally used. These oversize exhaust valves were not used after '72 but can be used in other big intake valve heads.
The last big valve head was the KA which was listed as a marine, W-30 replacement and standard manual transmission head up to 1975 in the '83 Olds parts book.
When the W-30 first arrived in 1966 it had its own special heads, part No. 387174. The '67 W-30 also had a special head (pt# 389213 or 230369). I believe these heads were also used on big block cars destined for California. These heads had the exhaust port "bumps" drilled and tapped for air pump fittings. Non-California cars had plugs installed in these tapped holes. The '68-'69 W-30s, non-air '68 Hursts and all '69 Hursts utilized special heads, too. These heads, commonly called "D" heads, carried the casting #400-370. The 1968-'69 D, the '70 F and the '71 H heads received two slight but important modifications.
Due to the firing order of Olds V8s, number 3 and 6 spark plugs fire in succession. This caused interference at the intake manifold crossover passage, disturbing the exhaust pulses for these cylinders. So Olds engineers had a small horizontal wall cast between the center exhaust port divider and the #3 or #6 port wall (depending on what side of the engine you face),closing off the passage to the intake manifold. Number 5 & 4 ports still fed heat to the passage for fast warm ups and these heads showed improved horsepower ratings; especially when exhaust headers were used. The second modification was the port shape just below the intake valves. Olds actually decreased the diameter of the opening just below the valve head. This created a venturi effect increasing flow with these heads.
The small block Ram Rod and W-31 s ('68-'70) utilized special head castings featuring 2" intake and 1.625" exhaust valves. Even though they were small port heads, Olds engineers found these heads to work better on the 350s than the big block heads. Quarter mile test results from magazines of the era show ETs to be very close to the W-30s. These #5 heads carried the casting # 397-742 for '68-'69, and the #6 heads had the 403-859 casting number for '70.
When looking for big valve #5 and #6 heads, be careful. The '68-'69 #5 small valve heads have the same 397-742 casting number and the '70 small valve #6 heads carry the 403- 859 number just like the bigger valve heads.
How can you tell which heads you have on your Rocket? Two ways. All big block heads have a large (5/8" tall) letter cast next to #1 spark plug hole, A, B, C, etc. All small blocks have a large number in the same location, 1, 2, 3, etc. Olds heads also have a six digit casting number cast in one of two locations. Early heads had this number cast near the rocker arm assemblies which would require you to remove the valve cover to see it. Heads produced after 1969, including A, B, C and D heads, have the casting number on either side of the center bolt just below where the valve cover sits. This casting number location is visible with the valve cover in place. When buying D, F, or H heads look for the cast wall I described earlier and the second half of the casting number is also found on the combustion chamber side of the head. So be careful when purchasing these high priced heads by looking them over thoroughly.
Based on what I have learned, I've listed all the '64 -'90 heads. Thisï¿½may not beï¿½a complete list, so I need your help to finish it. If you have or see any other heads you can call or write me so I can add this information to the list and share it with all of you.
Contact me at: karlskorner@msn.comï¿½
PS - The only casting numbers I believe I am missing are for the 1965 Irrigation heads.

Friends from a TOPS weight loss support group. Welcome all TOPS and KOPS!...Digital to Analogue convertors, usually known as DACs, have played a vital role in high-quality music reproduction since the introduction of the Compact Disc. But as the CD dies out, DACs have grown in importance, as we all strive to get the best possible performance from our digitally stored music collections. Bowers & Wilkins Product Marketing Manager Mat Taylor gives his definitive guide.
From the nostalgia of the first LP bought to the latest download purchase, the flat pack CD towers to the portable hardrive backup, the smoothest eject mechanism to the cover flow finger swipe. All aspects of music consumption have drastically changed over the past decade.
With the rapid evolution of digital audio technology it is sometimes difficult to keep up, and sometimes even harder to leave behind the love of old formats and hardware. There is no doubt that a high quality music collection accessible anywhere is the holy grail of music convenience, but how can you ensure the ultimate listening experience, especially, when the music library is stored on a computer?
For many digital music users the computer’s output is routed to active speakers or a separate amplifier using an analogue connection. In this case, the process of changing the digitally stored data to an audible analogue signal is processed by the computer’s internal components and therefore performance limited. These components are known as Digital to Analogue Convertors (DACs).
Separate DAC systems are not new; it’s more than two decades ago that separate DAC components became available to the mass market. This allowed the audiophile consumer to tap into the digital audio signal path and achieve superior digital to analogue conversion compared to the source’s internal DAC components. Recently, we have seen an influx of dedicated DAC equipment to operate on the reproduction routine for digitally stored music libraries. Increasingly, USB plays a major roll here. Having a standard connection makes it possible to perform keyhole surgery, extracting 1s and 0’s from the heart of the computer. Once extracted it is possible to upscale and convert to analogue with less jitter and errors than ever before.
Clocking is very important with digital audio, to get the most accurate sound a master clock should be used for all digital components. Initially, a vast majority of DACs were ‘adaptive’ USB mode, which means that the clock is variable, typically changing the master clock frequency to match the average sampling frequency of the data it receives. As computer clocks may not perform consistently for a variety of reasons there is a risk of jitter with adaptive USB mode. USB standards allow for an “asynchronous” USB mode, here the DAC’s master clock isn’t synchronized to the clock in the computer. Instead, the DAC is controlled by a precise fixed clock and the frequency of data is managed using a buffer. Originally, these devices were less common as manufacturers would be required to development bespoke software for the available chipsets. Over time several companies have invested in this coding and are now licensing solutions to brands, hence we now see more affordable asynchronous DAC products available. Of benefit to asynchronous USB modes is the two-way communication between the computer and DAC. This allows the computer to follow instructions from the DAC after the audio has been sent. For example if the computer’s clock has become less accurate over time and as a result quickly fills up the buffer with too much information, an asynchronous DAC would tell the computer to slow down stabilizing the buffer and avoiding audio artifacts and dropouts.
Sampling rates have increased with newer DACs, we now see the availability of 384kHz (eight times 48kHz!), sampling previously restricted to rare ultra-high end equipment. The point here is that although CDs were sufficient to reproduce frequencies above the hearing range, we can now reproduce sound closer to nature providing the magic that contributes to the most realistic listening experience. The ability to support 32-bit resolution sees a theoretical signal to noise ratio (SNR) of about 194dB, CD players at 16-bit resolution would see a SNR of just short of 100dB. Noise in a 32-bit system is down to that of traditional analogue sources. However, we have to consider here the availability and capacity requirements of such a 32 bit/384kHz recording format. For the time we will have to be content with 24 bit/192KHz format.
Another important technicality of the DAC is the filter window; this is the component that shapes the audio. Advances in technology have now made it affordable for consumers to replicate the precision of a flawless system.
At a time of convergence the thought of a dedicated DAC separate will not appeal to all audiences. The market has responded to this in several ways: with a range of media servers implementing asynchronous DAC components; but also with the very special take on the asynchronous DAC found in the new Classé CP-800 pre-amplifier.
So, while the way we experience music may have changed over the years, for many people the goal of attaining the best possible sound has not. And new DAC technology is one of the most powerful weapons in the audiophile’s armory.
This is not a guide to anything, just some technical walk through of digital music. And what’s with the advertisement of Classé gear in the end?Posted: Friday, 26 August 2011
That’s Marketing.Posted: Wednesday, 28 September 2011
What about the DSD files that are coming up for sale as downloads nowadays?Posted: Saturday, 28 January 2012
Less unwieldy than 32bit/384kHz downloads which will need a huge amount of storage space plus download bandwith and propably will still sound worse than native DSD files anyway, due to their need of brickwall filtering.
CP-800 looks great but I agree with DSD fan.Posted: Friday, 24 February 2012
DSD is a “must” and should be implemented in a such product.
On an other hand I cannot understand the use of a digital fader in a DAC / Preamp machine.
Digital faders are introducing errors. Analog fader would be so easy to achieve.Can anyone here give me a COMPLETE list of ALL the patented things that are

Minister of Tourism and Entertainment Wykeham McNeill will travel to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation's (UNWTO) 95th session of the executive council in Belgrade, Serbia, from May 24 to 30.
"The meeting will allow Jamaica to strengthen relations with other countries, promote tourism in the global agenda and focus on the strategic objectives of sustainability and competitiveness," Minister With Responsibility for Information Sandrea Falconer told the post-Cabinet press briefing at Jamaica House yesterday.
Pre-council seminar
Tourism authorities, experts and practitioners from different parts of the world will participate in a pre-council seminar on 'Sustainable Tourism at Inland Water Destinations', discussing and reviewing opportunities and challenges of sustainable tourism at inland water destinations, such as rivers, lakes, canals, estuaries, deltas and marshes.
It is the view that inland water destinations, as an important component of the global tourism experience, are likely to expand as tourists and visitors are attracted by their aesthetic appeal.
Accompanying McNeill on the trip, which will cost $3.38 million, will be Permanent Secretary Jennifer Griffith.
Jamaica is vice-chair of the UNWTO.Missouri News - Page 12

do not go to bed alone. Bed bugs are invading the apartments of
college students across the nation, and BYU could be next.
Over the past five years, numbers of bed bug infestations have
increased dramatically nationwide, and college apartments are a key
target for the bugs because of frequent moving and sometimes
less-than-immaculate apartments. Derrick Turner, a junior in civil
engineering, from Akron, Ohio, dealt with bed bugs while living at
a local complex and said an apartment complex with bed bugs can
create havoc with its residents.
"I lived in an a complex that had [bed bug] problems and my
friends were covered in bites," Turner said. "They had to get the
apartment sprayed three or four times before the bugs
disappeared."
Bed bugs' size can range from as small as a sharpened pencil tip
to as big as an eraser head. The bugs numb the skin when they bite
so those bitten don't wake up and it can take days for red itchy
spots to appear on the skin of those bitten. Michael Colongione,
owner of Gotcha Bed Bug Inspectors, said although bed bugs are not
known to carry disease, they can become a major inconvenience in a
short period of time.
"Even one bug or one egg can be a problem because they procreate
rapidly and food is plentiful," Colongione said.
Colongione said infestations can spread quickly at colleges
because the bugs are easily transferred from clothing to furniture
as students move from apartment to apartment.
A recent study by the National Pest Management Association
showed that college apartments were second only to hotels in
bed bug infestations. The study also showed major universities such
as the University of Illinois, the Ohio State University and the
University of Florida have already gone to great means to rid dorms
of massive infestations.
Although Utah's climate does not provide the most ideal
environment for bed bugs, the state is not immune to the increase.
Salt Lake City has seen a 94 percent increase in bed bug
infestations in recent years. According to BYU's Off-Campus Housing
Office, cases at BYU are few compared to other universities
but the problem still exists. Gary Briggs, manager of BYU
Off-Campus Housing, said the problem needs to be taken care of
swiftly so the bugs don't spread.
"Report it immediately to your landlord," Briggs said. "If the
landlord doesn't do anything, contact our office and we'll deal
with the landlord."
A variety of over-the-counter remedies are available to treat
small problems and prevent bed bugs from transferring from
place to place, but once infested, professional-strength pesticides
are usually the only way to completely get rid of an
infestation.
"You need to do your research and be educated [about bed bugs],"
Colongione said. "That's the best defense."Perfect for a rainy day,

I love just about any film or book about England and English history and most of these I'm familiar with or own, but there are a few I haven't seen yet and will be eager to put on the to-see list. Thanks -- this is a great post! Have a wonderful weekend!
The Titanic is the only one of these I've seen. Can you tell we spend little time in front of a screen???
So many favorites for me! My son's favorite movie of ALL TIME is Braveheart. There was a time when he watched it a couple of times each week. (No I am not kidding.) Now he has a standing date with his best buddy watch it every New Year's Day. Let's just say that I will not be surprised if some day I have a grandchild named William or Wallace.
I love this! I happened to watch The Tudors at the end of our time in Germany, having absolutely no idea that I would end up moving to England a few months later. That was how I learned everything I know about that period of English history-- super educational!
I'm sharing this on my facebook page.
Great list! Now how about a similar list of books (maybe historical fiction) for those of us lucky enough to live where the sun always shines? I'm always looking for a good beach read. Cheers!
what an awesome list, thanks for putting it together! England's history is so fascinating. i've seen several of these movies, but now i've got some new suggestions of what to watch next! thanks!
For me, it's a tie between The King's Speech and The Queen. They both have brilliant performances and a peek behind the monarchy.
Calendar Girls is a hoot. King's Speech and Iron Lady were fantastic. The Queen was an eye opener.
Calendar Girls, The King's Speech, Made in Dagenham.
I loved Made in Dagenham, because it brings to light a little-known piece of really important history. I had no idea what had finally prompted the Equal Pay Act.
If you like fictionalised history, have you discovered Blackadder - for a totally irreverent take on it all?
What a great list. I have seen some of the films. I have not seen Anonymous because it would probably just irrigate me. Of course Shakespeare wrote his own stuff. That he did not has long been a popular theory, though. When it really heats up over the summer and I retreat to the basement, you have given me good list of movies.
Oooh! Great list--I've added some of these to my list of must-sees!
What a brilliant selection of films you've put together for us! I haven't seen a few of these. x
Iota - I looked up Blackadder - looks really interesting - and I've yet to hear Hugh Laurie with his native accent :)
Young Victoria was interesting due to the historical context but only Calendar Girls was deemed entertaining Laura for us!
I might just have to check a few of these out. I know my all time favorite movie is Last of the Mohican's with Daniel Day Lewis but it's actually based in the U.S. but had british citizens in it :) So not sure if that applies to your post.
I love most of these...but my favorite is Pride and Prejudice..could watch it a thousand times

Tess Loo, head stylist of Well Suited—part of the My Sister’s Closet family of stores—says shoppers can find a great selection of designer suits and ties at this hip men’s consignment store, as well as great gifts like wallets, briefcases, belts, sunglasses, cufflinks, designer-brand resort wear, and more (photo courtesy of My Sister’s Closet).
According to The History Channel, the campaign to celebrate the nation’s fathers did not meet with the same enthusiasm—perhaps because, as one florist explained, “fathers haven’t the same sentimental appeal that mothers have.”
And yet, today economists estimate that Americans spend more than $1 billion each year on Father’s Day gifts. Still, there’s no question that men can be a little more difficult to shop for then women. And finding something fun, unique, different, cool … or just plain “perfect” can be quite the challenge.
To help you in your shopping endeavors for Father’s Day, which is June 15, we’ve compiled a list of unique businesses geared toward men that will help you complete that just-right gift quest.
Well Suited
4859 N. 20th St.,
Town & Country Shopping Center
602-840-5605
The store is part of the family of “My Sister’s Closet” businesses, but catering to, and for, men specifically. From Armani and Versace to True Religion and Rock & Republic, the store carries a wide variety of designers at nicely discounted prices, since the inventory is nearly all consignment. Each item is closely inspected to make sure it is suitably “gently used.”
This is not “thrift” shopping, says head stylist Tess Loo. “Well Suited is the crème de la crème of designer recycled boutiques and we have customers from Alaska to Hawaii who tell us the same.”
Well Suited isn’t just suits and ties. You can find better clothing and accessories ranging from Tommy Bahama shorts to tuxedos, cowboy hats, belts, wallets, watches, sunglasses, briefcases, shoes, cufflinks and more. There are more than 100,000 consigners in Well Suited’s database.
Hours are 9 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturdays and 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Sundays.
Heritage Hats
13602 N. Cave Creek Road
Phoenix, AZ 85022
602-867-3323
Owner Rich Glisson has been in business more than 30 years, starting out by selling handmade cowboy hats out of the back of his pickup truck while following the rodeo circuit around the country. “After many conversations with cowboys I found that most sent their cowboy hats to Texas to be cleaned and re-blocked,” he recalls.
Glisson learned how to craft hats from swaths of felt made from steamed and pressed animal fur. He also learned the cleaning and blocking techniques that can restore a hat. Today, his store carries a little over $1 million in inventory and approximately 10,000 hats—Australian, Western, fedora, Panama, straw, golf caps and more.
“I get younger customers coming in looking for a hat to wear out on a Saturday night, but my standard customers are still the ranchers and cattleman that wear them every single day,” he says.
Glisson can customize at hat to any head, so the fit is just right. He has customers from all over the country, since “hatmaking is a dying art,” he explains. “There are only a handful of us left in the United States. We are now the largest shop in the southwest.”
In addition to the handcrafted hats, the store also offers a large selection of brand-name hats, including: Akubra, Bailey, Dobbs, Resistol, Serratelli, Stetson, Scala, Dorfman Pacific and Head’n Home.
“ The most popular hat style we have right now is the Fedora,” Glisson says. “That’s the style that people remember their fathers or grandfathers wore.” The hats are from the ’20s and ’30s, but have recently come back into style, he adds.
Also a hot seller is the Pork Pie, which saw a huge resurgence in popularity thanks to the controversial TV show, “Breaking Bad.”
“A lot of it just depends on the age group and the purpose you are going to use the hat for, your own style and attitude.”
Store hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Closed Sundays.
Dapper + Dash
Various Retail Locations
602-644-1836
Stylish. Classic. You wouldn’t think people would use these words today to describe the bow tie. And yet, “the bow tie is a striking accessory that hints at old-fashioned sensibilities but couldn’t be more modern,” says Aaron Kimberlin, co-owner of this unique downtown Phoenix business.
Dapper + Dash celebrates this vintage men’s accessory by adaptively reusing vintage clothing and other vintage materials to create a product as unique as the man who will wear it. The skilled crafters begin with the essentials; only the best vintage ties and materials are considered. Once they pass the test, these materials, often found buried in closets and long forgotten, find new life. The materials are repurposed, cut by hand and stitched into one of three patterns to create dapper bow ties for a dashing man.
The packaging also is produced locally with an eye to sustainability: each bow tie is distributed in repurposed sturdy, lightweight handcrafted tube, stamped by hand with the Dapper + Dash logo then sent to its final destination.
Bowtie styles include the Gatsby, Churchill, Dagwood and Huckleberry. Prices range from $48 to $52. The company also offers kerchiefs ($20), limited collection neckties ($62) and will do custom work.
The products can be found locally at Frances, 10 W. Camelback Road (602-279-5467), and Cleo & Clementine, 704 W. Montecito Ave. in the Melrose District (602-264-4848).
Keep It Cut
2824 E. Indian School Road
623-396-5337
Let’s face it—some men need a haircut and a facial trim more than just once a month. But frequent visits to the salon can put an unhappy dent in the wallet. Keep It Cut was opened in September 2013 by Jacob Meltzer and Joshua Thorsvik, young entrepreneurs who wondered how they could make getting a haircut more affordable. The answer is a unique subscription-based payment concept.
Keep It Cut is celebrating dads this Father’s Day by offering them free haircuts … for a year. From June 9-15, any dad who walks in to Keep It Cut and buys a haircut is entered into a drawing for a free yearlong membership.
Monthly memberships start at just $23, which gives the well-groomed man an unlimited number of haircuts for the month. Other packages include additional services, such as unlimited grooming and unlimited washing. All members get 20-percent off hair products. There also are a la carte prices, which are $15 for a haircut, $6 for grooming and $4 for a wash.
Hours are 9 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturdays and 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Sundays.

The National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) has released a new bioenergy mapping portal, BioEnergy Atlas, that identifies biomass feedstocks, then overlays that information with the ethanol and biodiesel facilities both on and off-line. You can also see map information for transportation infrastructure, power plants, fueling stations, and more. The tools are coined BioPower Atlas and BioFuels Atlas.
The portal was created with funding help from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Blue Skyways Collaborative and the Department of Energy’s Biomass Program. Not only is the map able to identify current biorefinery locations, but can also show where copious amounts of biomass are available for harvest without plants located in the region. Perfect for those looking for areas of untapped energy potential.
According to NREL, BioEnergy Atlas is targeted to a multitude of users including government and state agencies, universities, the petroleum and pipeline industries, research institutions, vehicle manufacturers, investment firms, GIS companies, private citizens, and media.<<

The former Strikeforce middleweight champion dominated the contest from beginning to end, submitting his opponent at 2:43 of the final round.
Souza won the opening round after landing an overhand right that dropped his opponent. He controlled Marunde on the ground, having his back for a majority of the opening frame.
Round two had Jacare landing more strikes on the feet, wobbling Marunde in the process. A spinning back-kick highlighted Souza’s striking as it backed his opponent against the cage. A takedown late in the round solidified the 10-9 score for Souza in the second five-minute period.
Souza got the early takedown and continued controlling Marunde in the third round. He worked up to the arm triangle, forcing his opponent to submit.
“(I) deserve another chance for the belt,” Souza said following the win. “(I) want it… bad.”
With the win, Souza improves his record to 15-3, 1 N.C., and gets back on the winning track after losing the middleweight title to Luke Rockhold. Marunde drops his record to 15-6, losing his Strikeforce debut.

It ended up being one hour later. If GUIs are to be largely metaphors of common objects, then the way the time is set is crooked. Usually with anything, alarm clocks, cell phones, thermostats, whatever, the setting of the time and minutes are independent. You set the time and then the minutes and you don't expect the time to change. Not so in MythTV. For instance, if you access Manual scheduling and the default time is 9:30 and you want it to be 10:00 and if you first start to change the time to 10 and the the minutes to 00, it can very well be that the time will automatically change to 11, depending if you've chosen the 00 at the top or the bottom of the drop down list. Trying doing that on an alarm clock. 0 is 0 and that's it. if you hold a button and the minutes are changing by themselves, the hour will not change if you go from 59 to 00. Some devices might be doing that, but I've never seen any like this before. Moreover, the GUI in Myth is not a spin button but a drop down list. So, it'd be nice if both zeroes offered in the Myth drop down list in manual scheduling would actually mean plain 00 and would not, in one instance, increment the hour. Cheers, AlVariety recently took a snapshot of the top new shows that have debuted in the US Fall season and how they have fared.
TEN has an extraordinary 6 of its top 7 choices, but 2 of which haven’t generated much buzz in Australia.
Here’s an analytical ranking of the 2009-10 season’s most impressive newcomers:
10. Community (NBC) and The Middle (ABC)
The most critically acclaimed new half-hours found a core aud despite no lead-in help (Community kicked off Thursday and The Middle followed the quickly yanked Hank or repeats on Wednesday). Community fared better in DVR playback, so its seasonal 18-49 average (2.5 rating) is higher than The Middle (2.2), although the latter — which is providing ABC with year-to-year growth in its time period — appeared to be gaining more steam down the stretch.
9. Cougar Town (ABC)
The Courteney Cox laffer with a provocative name opened very strong before settling into a pretty good ratings range in the fall. It then fell off down the stretch, but it’s unclear how much of that was due to facing the envelope-opening portion of Fox’s American Idol results show. For the season, it averages a 3.1 rating in adults 18-49, retaining more than 80% of its Modern Family demo lead-in and also performing well among upscale auds.
8. Parenthood (NBC)
This comedic family drama has held up well following its post-Olympics launch in early March. Its total viewer numbers aren’t great, but the aud is mostly made up of the kind of upscale 18-49ers that NBC had traditionally attracted with its 10 p.m. dramas. Show averages a 3.3 rating in 18-49 and has been a strong gainer in same-week DVR playback.
7. The Good Wife (CBS)
The best-reviewed drama of the season helped CBS become more competitive in an hour where it had typically struggled. Though not a great fit with the NCIS shows that precede it on Tuesday, Good Wife performed well enough to warrant a second season. It has averaged a 2.7 in 18-49 (and a 3.8 in 25-54), but cooled late opposite stronger competition from Parenthood.
5. and 6. The Cleveland Show (Fox) and NCIS: Los Angeles (CBS)
These are paired because they performed comparably and did just what their nets had hoped: extend the brand. Both spinoffs were scheduled alongside their progenitors, with the Fox entry preceding Family Guy on Sunday the Eye show following NCIS on Tuesday.
NCIS: Los Angeles is the only crime hour from last year to make the list but it’s more of a buddy-cop drama with comical elements. In one of TV’s toughest timeslots, it averages a 3.5 rating in 18-49 (holding 85% of its lead-in) and is the season’s top scripted newbie in adults 25-54.
Cleveland has provided Fox with growth in the half-hour between The Simpsons and Family Guy, ranking as the season’s top new scripted show in teens and men 18-34.
Both shows are expected to stay put in the fall.
4. The Vampire Diaries (CW)
Just when you thought auds had enough of vampires, the CW tapped into the vein with its hottest original series to date. Vampire‘s mix of teen angst and the supernatural struck a chord with young auds: While it averages a 1.5 rating in adults 18-49, it pulls a 1.7 in adults 18-34 and a 2.6 in female teens — and has recently led its Thursday 8 p.m. hour among femmes under 35.
3. Undercover Boss (CBS)
It came and went quickly, but the Eye’s strongest reality newcomer in about a decade certainly made an impact. After bowing to the largest aud on record for a premiere following the Super Bowl, Boss — smartly paired with The Amazing Race on Sunday — averaged a 6.2 rating in 18-49 for its nine episodes (including its preem), a score topped only by American Idol and Sunday Night Football. Some have doubted whether Boss can be a long-term player, but it would be a surprise if it didn’t land on the net’s fall sked — and perform well.
1. and 2. Glee (Fox) and Modern Family (ABC)
You can toss a coin here as these shows will finish as the top scripted rookies in 18-49, despite opposing each other during the first half of the season. Both skewed young and very upscale, two great selling points for advertisers.
Glee (3.8 average in 18-49) should finish with the slightly higher average due to its plum post-American Idol spring timeslot and fewer repeats, but Modern Family (3.7 rating) will be close behind — impressive since it has opposed Idol since mid-January.
Both of these shows also made a big winner out of critics, who back in August labeled Modern Family and Glee as the season’s best newcomers. Sometimes, the cream really does rise to the top.
You can use the term “fall” quite literally for some of those shows. After a strong premiere, The Good Wife is looking particularly bad now, almost axing territory. Cougar Town does not hold 80% of its Modern Family lead in (atleast not anymore) seeing huge declines from its lead in.
i wonder how they figure the good wife higher than parenthood. parenthood rates much better in the same slot. TGW’s US ratings have been pretty bad lately definitely renewed too soon.
ten got very lucky this season getting glee and modern family. from memory everyone was saying 9 had the best last may, and quantity wise they had the most by far, but it doesn’t seem any of them have been able to be put to good use. the only one 7 really has is parenthood but they only had a handful to start with.
Yay for Modern Family, although it looks like Channel Ten is putting it on Tuesdays up against AGT, which is a pretty bad idea, seeing how strongly AGT is rating. They have promoed MF to death but will that help it in the long run? I hope so as it’s so genuinely relatable and LOL funny.
Good to Parenthood on the list although it’s more of a drama than comedy but great viewing. Love most of the shows on the list, especially the new crop of sitcoms. Community is good, as is Cougar Town (even if the 7 boss doesn’t like it) and 2 of the best are Modern Family and Middle Town but I can almost bet my life they won’t do well here. For TENs sake I hope I’m wrong with Modern Family.Ultimate Nylon Shock Cord Clip, for a secure and corrosion free fastening solution. Stayput canvas fasteners have no springs to corrode or jam.

Wendy Williams loves herself some Amber Rose. She invited the blonde bombshell on her show earlier today as a ‘Hot Topic’ to discuss everything from her relationship to Kanye to her current relationship with Wiz Khalifa. Amber also cleared up what exactly happened with her reality show and she spilled the tea on rebounding with Reggie Bush.
On Kanye West shouting her out at the Watch The Throne Concert in Philly
He said that he was an ass hole and he was mean to me. He did not treat me the way he was suppose to and I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me. I’m just going to keep it moving. It was a nice gesture.
Do you think Kanye West wants you back?
I don’t care.
Will you ever get back with Kanye?
I will never get back with Kanye, there’s no way. I want to be with Wiz [Khalifa] for the rest of my life.
Are you and Wiz married?
No, we’re not married.
Do you believe in marriage?
I never did until I met Wiz. I really didn’t. Every relationship that I ever had, especially being a stripper since I was 15 years-old I never thought it would happen for me.
What happened to your reality show?
When you do a pilot for a reality show you present it to the network then their like either ‘we love it or we don’t’. They loved my pilot but they wanted me to be somebody that I’m not. In this business you could either sell your soul for money or you can do what they tell you to do. I just decided to take another route and just be myself. I have to do what makes me happy and I have to sleep at night, so I can’t sell out.
Were you paid off not to speak when you and Kanye’s relationship dissolved?
No. I can say whatever I want about Kanye. I can say whatever I want about our relationship. I’m not into that; I always like to take the high road. I’m a very positive, very spiritual person and I believe in Karma. Whatever happened in our relationship, I don’t feel the need to write a book or dog him out or anything like that. I just want to keep it moving.
On writing books.

I dont believe Amber is taking the same role as Kim K. She is with a guy that everybody dogs more than Kanye. If she wanted the attention she would have stayed with Reggie or some top celebrity. She took her loss with Kanye and she started a fresh relationship with Wiz, who she is in love with now. All the extra drama (naked pictures and rumors) are all because of jealousy and betrayal. I don’t think she is the person that the media portrays, and with her bestfriend being a stalker I can believe she released the photos. If you are going to judge what she did at 15 years old, then you’re never going to like Amber. I’m giving her a chance because she has found love, and I’m not judging her by her past. If you cant do the same,why even read articles about her and comment. Let her live without being called a groupie or gold digger. She’s trying leave her past behind too, and I think everyone else should. Thanks!

She would not have spoken of Kanye if Kanye didn’t go on stage
crying last week about being in love with her. The only time you heard
of Amber Rose lately was when you see a pic of her & Wiz. Interviewers were
asking her about Wiz. She has not spoken on Kanye in awhile. So Kanye is keeping
her name in the media causing interviewers to ask her “how do you feel about what Kanye said…?”
I’m starting to believe Kanye wants her to succeed b/c he mentions her a lot which brings
more work to her name

@ Ms. or Mr. 6893, when you are not a big celebrity, you cannot make diva demands. At Amber’s stage, being that she’s just now making a name for herself and coming out of Kanye’s shadow, her publicist is probably thrilled that she’s even booked on the show to begin with…babysteps. She is in no position to be telling people what questions she’s not gonna
answer.

They have to keep asking about Kanye. Cuz really what else is there to ask? “I saw your leaked pics, do you shave or wax?” Lol Not trying to be mean, she SEEMS to be a sweet girl, but my grandmother is sweet, who cares? I saw she had some show coming out on BET (doesn’t look like something I will be watching) good for her. Really do hope she finds something to do that people can talk about. But until then Kanye it is.

Amber seems like a cool chick but other than Kanye,there is nothing else
interesting enough to ask her about.When you become famous for dating
one of the most famous artist in the world,all people are going to want
to know is what happen your relationship with that person.I know she has
other stuff going on but what are you more likely to click on: a story about
Amber Rose and one of her upcoming projects or Amber Rose talks about
her relationship with Kanye? 9×10 you’re going to click on the story
about her and Kanye.

That was a good interview. Amber Rose is beautiful, although I am a bit disappointed about her outfit choice. I mean, one of the reasons I was drawn to her was for her style and this is a complete fail IMO. I’m sure she wanted to go conservative but I nice fitted suit to accent her curves would have been just as good. *shrugs.

OH THE HUMANITY!Organizing the Paper Problem
If you have papers that have turned yellow with age or there is a stack of newspapers that crumble when you lift them, you are not alone. The abundance of papers coming into the home makes keeping on top of the accumulation an ongoing task. And unless you have a plan to remove them, you become like many others who simple have allowed papers to take over spaces in their homes. Of all the organizing situations I see, papers are a one of the most frequent problems.
A few weeks ago I posted strategies on tackling papers as they come in the door in order to eliminate saving unnecessary papers and avoiding stacks of unrelated paper items. But there are papers we need to keep and placing those where we can find them when we need them is important. The problem arises when we are not sure which we should keep, where we should keep them and for how long. And then there are the differences in personal preferences that make some systems good for one family member but not another.
While there is no system that will be perfect for everyone, there are some guidelines that everyone can use. All legal papers such as birth, death and marriage certificates, passports, adoption papers, divorce settlements, car titles, insurance policies, property deeds and deeds of trust, etc. should be kept forever. Most financial documents are now kept on computers so paper copies are not as important as in the past. Banks have copies of your checks, your monthly statements and other financial information and history on their computer files. Now it is not necessary to keep paper copies of those after you have verified their information.
For those who get nervous in letting those go, I recommend keeping the closing statement on loans and the end of the year statements. These can be kept with tax records for that year. Keeping the original and selling costs of investments you manage yourself is important, but only the year end statement of brokerage houses is needed for taxes. Once you verify the monthly or quarterly reports, you no longer need to keep them. Monthly credit card statements are no longer needed after they are verified. Even department stores can find sales tickets for purchases you made a year ago. If you are still fearful, keep items for a year or two but not for 10 or 20 years. I have even seen files with cancelled checks from 40 years back! At this time IRS states they do not audit tax returns more than 3 years back unless you have missed a year in filing, a return was challenged, you owed back taxes, you had employees, you have incorrectly filed, or there are other unusual situations. For any questions or more information check out the retention guidelines at their web site:
As difficult as it may be letting go of financial papers, those with emotional ties are even harder. Love letters, school work, cards from special occasions, etc. can become an organizational nightmare if not sorted and contained in an alloted space. The general rule here is to save as much as you want and have the space to store in an organized manner. It is a good idea to set aside a container for such items and when it is full, no more can be added unless something is removed. Getting bigger or more containers defeats the purpose of maintaining order. And remember when everything becomes special, then nothing is really special. Pieces of paper are not necessary to remember those that we love or are special to us.
Finally, learn to be ruthless in dealing with outdated magazines, newspapers, catalogues, sales flyers, coupons, etc. If you haven't had time to go through them while they are current, there will not be more time later to do it. Most information in them is online should you need it and it will be more up to date. Set up a schedule to recycle them so they do not create piles in your home or office. Diligence is the name of the paper control game. You must deal with them in a consistent manner or they will win.

If this season.
The rain-out leaves the Yankees at 47-47 heading into this All-Star Break, and puts them five games back from the top spot in the division.
Mother Nature took the Yankees chance away to be to three games behind, which in turn means they would not be a mediocre, .500 team but two games over.
Putting words like average, ordinary, run-of-the-mill in the same sentence with the Yankees is considered sac-religious in some circles.
Speaking as a Yankees fan, having high expectations comes with the territory; and I see nothing wrong with being frustrated for settling for anything else.
Injures have been abundant, but under-performing offense has been the Achilles heel of this 2014 team. But not all hope for a postseason berth has vanished even in the wake of this past Sunday night’s easily preventable loss.
“You know what luck is? Luck is believing your lucky…to hold front position in this rat-race you’ve got to believe you’re lucky.” – Stanley Kowalski quote from ‘A Streetcar Named Desire.’
Looking at this season’s bigger picture, the Yankees fortunately play in the now inadequate AL East, which leaves them ample time to right this ship.
As how many times has an AL East team sitting at .500 at the All-Star Break make the postseason in the last 2 decades?
The bottom line is there is one question left that only the Yankees can give an answer too in the second half of the 2014 season.
Can the Bronx Bombers defeat Father Time?
The Yankees and their fans will never know how the game would of gone if it had not been rained out but the way the Yankees were playing the should be glad it was rained out so they did not have to play 9 innings to get the same out come. Plus the Yankees can always say, "If we had not got rained out we would have come back." Hello Yankees time to wake up and to get back to playing baseball like you enjoy playing.
hahaha nice.. baseball i like it too..

Feature Photo: stuart_spivack Photo: ldhny
NEW ORLEANS’ INTERNATIONALLY famous cuisine is decadent and indulgent, mixing the best flavors from its many ethnic influences with the soul of the city.
But in New Orleans, you should leave room for dessert. These seven are among the city’s most famous and most widely available treats.
1. Bread pudding
While not unique to New Orleans, many of the city’s restaurants have perfected their own version of this delicious use for stale bread. At its most basic, the dish involves drizzling melted butter over leftover bread chunks and baking it with sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, beaten eggs and raisins. It’s usually served hot and soaked with rum or whiskey sauce.
2. Pralines
You can credit the French for introducing this candy, now ubiquitous in New Orleans. Pecans are suspended in a creamy mixture of sugar and butter that is so rich you probably can’t eat more than one. They’re available, usually wrapped individually, at many gift shops in the city and come in a few varieties like chocolate and rum. If you don’t want to sound like an outsider, say it “praw-leen.”
3. King Cake
While king cake is eaten mostly during the Mardi Gras season, you can find it any time of year if you look hard enough. There are many variations with different fillings, but a king cake is essentially a huge cinnamon roll with sprinkles and generally iced in Mardi Gras colors—purple, green and gold.
Most king cakes have a small plastic baby inside, said to represent the baby Jesus, as Mardi Gras is actually rooted in Catholicism.
4. Beignets
It’s pronounced “ben-yay,” which is French for fried dough. This dessert’s charm is in its simplicity, as it’s nothing more than deep-fried dough covered in a mound of powdered sugar. Buy an “order” of three donuts with a cup of café au lait or chocolate milk.
It’s famously available at the bustling French Quarter tent of Café du Monde near the Mississippi River, but there are a few other spots where you can indulge on what many locals call “coffee and donuts.” Just don’t inhale when you take a bite.
5. Doberge cake
No New Orleans birthday is complete without a doberge cake. A New Orleans baker adapted the Hungarian dobos torta and gave it a French-sounding name, and doberge was born. The cake consists of multiple layers of cake and pudding—usually chocolate or lemon—topped with rich icing. Oh, and it’s pronounced “dough-bash.”
6. Snowballs
Snowballs—or snoballs—are definitely not the same as snow cones. Snowballs are like fresh powder, and the juice doesn’t sink to the bottom of the cup like with crunchy snow cones. The New Orleans-invented SnoWizard machines shave down blocks of ice for the perfect consistency.
Around New Orleans in the summer, snowballs stands are packed. Each offers dozens of flavors, from wedding cake to superman to margarita and more. You can get them “stuffed” with soft-serve ice cream or drizzled with condensed milk. Yum.
7. Roman Candy
Roman Candy, a chewy taffy sold in vanilla, chocolate and strawberry, has been made and sold by the same family since 1915. You can find the original mule-drawn wagon in random places across the city, but your best bet is the Audubon Zoo. Long, thin sticks of the candy sell for 75c and come wrapped in wax paper.

When a valuable organization commits a misstep, you chalk it up to the inevitable vagaries of producing opera. But when one stumbles as badly as Gotham Chamber Opera did Friday night with Francesco Cavalli’s 1668 Eliogabalo at The Box, it was hard to know whether to feel sad or angry—or both.
Having attended really first-rate performances by GCO of operas by Handel, Mozart and Haydn, I was pleased the company had chosen to present this rare work by one of Italian opera’s first masters.
But after it was over, I asked myself, “Would anyone who had never seen a Cavalli opera before want to see another one after this?” Except for several outstanding performers, the entire enterprise was about as unfortunate as any I can recall.
A crucial mistake was the choice of a venue decidedly unfriendly to opera and whose ethos cast an unfortunate spell over the production. The Box presents rather lewd contemporary burlesque shows, and unfortunately director James Marvel and assistant director-choreographer Austin McCormick embraced that spirit which overwhelmed the production.
Confused audience members were greeted by black-and-white silent porn loops projected onto a screen on the tiny stage, after which four topless “Baroque Burlesque Performers” (three female and one male) sauntered across the stage, eventually engaging in an extended sequence of ostensibly erotic gymnastics, presumably intended to evoke the decadent court of Eliogabalo. Unfortunately these BBPs kept reappearing, proving particularly distracting during Flavia’s two monologues and Alessandro’s aching first act lament.
That food and drink were served continuously during the performance proved intensely distracting despite the genuinely heroic efforts of the waitstaff to be as unobtrusive as possible. An audience as preoccupied with throwing back wine and scarfing down sliders as paying attention to the opera might recall behavior common in many 17th and 18th century theaters, but the 21st century audience for this Cavalli suffered.
Another bad judgment call was conceiving the production as if it were about the historical Elagabalus rather than the figure Cavalli and his librettist Aurelio Aureli created. For example, while the Roman emperor was believed to have been bisexual and a committed transvestite–if not transsexual–the opera’s title character is instead a malevolent heterosexual Don Giovanni figure who uses his power (aided by not one, but two servants) to manipulate both the females he covets and their lovers. Like the Mozart-da Ponte character, he is singularly unsuccessful during the course of the opera and ends up paying the ultimate price for his anarchic behavior.
By having a heavily made-up, aggressively androgynous Eliogabalo grope a male guard within moments of his entrance, the opera’s focus on the emperor’s obsessive twin-pursuit of Flavia Gemmira and Eritea was clouded, and his donning women’s clothing in the Senate scene ended up looking like everyday behavior rather than a crafty ruse to get close to Flavia.
Eliogabalo’s servants, the old nurse Lenia and his steward Zotico, provide a dark spin on these usually comic archetypes, particularly Lenia whose manipulation of Flavia nearly results in her estrangement from Giuliano. While a few laughs do arise from Lenia and her much younger lover, the none-too-bright Nerbulone, the pair’s primary dramatic function is far from amusing. As their master grows increasingly desperate, they put into motion his (ultimately unsuccessful) plot to rufie Flavia and poison Giuliano.
However, tenor John Easterlin as Lenia and mezzo Daryl Freedman as Zotico were directed to behave so grossly, so obscenely that the crudest humor must have been the goal. While Easterlin had the vocal measure of his role, Freedman bawled grotesquely throughout in a losing attempt to cope with music far too low for her.
However, the production’s nadir was the absolutely inexplicable decision to stage Flavia’s attempted rape and Eliogabalo’s resulting murder, actions meant to occur off-stage. Not only was the scene enacted in lurid slow-motion, it was accompanied by oddly cobbled-together “music”—mostly percussion and nothing at all like Cavalli. Flavia then entered describing the very acts we had just seen making a potentially riveting narrative completely redundant.
Musical matters were somewhat happier though the arrangement of instruments on stage (behind the singers) told a tale. To the far left were the superb theorbists, Grant Herreid (the evening’s musical director) and Daniel Swenberg. On the right were four string players and the harpsichordist (GCO artistic director Neal Goren).
Since the club was far too dark to scan my program, on my way home I was astonished to read that the band consisted of “Baroque Violins/Viola/Cello” since from my faraway vantage point it appeared no one bowed in the baroque style nor did their pallid string sound resemble that of original instruments. Beyond the theorbists, none of the instrumentalists sounded like they had much familiarity with period performance.
The cast seemed well coached in the demanding recitative style in which the score abounds, although diction and pronunciation could be variable. The two most satisfying singers were Emily Grace Righter and Brandon Cedel. As the anguished, morally upright Alessandro, Righter nobly used her shining mezzo to rise above the shenanigans that sometimes surrounded her, although her moving “Misero, cosi và,” the score’s best known piece, was nearly ruined by the risible undulations of the BBPs in the background.
Cedel, who won last Sunday’s National Council Auditions and joins the MET’s Lindeman Young Artist Development Program next season, cavorted winningly as the goofy Nerbulone while singing beautifully with a robust bass-baritone.
Unfortunately, South African countertenor Christopher Ainslie gave a one-note performance of the title role, his bland voice struggling to embody Eliogabalo’s erotic compulsions. Only the suspense of what outrageous get-up he’d be wearing next—from fishnet stockings to a spike-studded black leather jockstrap—made one anticipate each appearance. Although he started off weakly, the other countertenor, Randall Scotting as the ineffectual Giuliano, exhibited a more pleasing voice, as well as a surer grasp of an often elusive style.
If one closed one’s eyes, it might have been difficult to tell which of the three sopranos–Micaëla Oeste as Flavia Gemmira, Susannah Biller as Eritea or Maeve Höglund as Atilia—was singing at any given moment. All offered wan, monochromatic voices that struggled to sharply delineate the noble victim, the wily (if conflicted) opportunist or the shunned second-choice each was playing. Occasionally, their prominent vibratos jarred, particularly Biller’s, most noticeably in the ravishing final quartet which sadly fell flat.
Presumably four mirrored panels and two Lucite boxes constituted the “set design by Carol Bailey” as there was otherwise no set. The distracting costumes by Mattie Ulrich might have served the 1958 Zsa Zsa Gabor vehicle Queen of Outer Space or possibly some lost episode of Star Trek from the 1960s. One very obvious misstep was Atilia’s rather masculine outfit, which made her initial advances on Alessandro unnecessarily confusing.
Normally I would kvetch about the slashing cuts made, but since I started checking my watch at 8:25, I was sadly grateful that nearly an additional hour of music had been excised.
All in all, a very disheartening evening, particularly since New York City gets few chances to experience the riches of Venetian opera. One can only pray that GCO will return to its usual high standard with a planned Monteverdi cycle by choosing a director who more confidently trusts his material and audience and by procuring a musical crew better versed in 17th century performance practice.
For those with a yen for more Cavalli, the Yale Baroque Opera Project presents La Calisto (led by Herreid) on May 4 and 5 at 5:00 PM and both performances are free!
Anyone doing the European festival circuit this summer will want to drop by the south of France in July where the Aix-en-Provence Festival presents Elena from 1659 conducted by Leonardo Garcia Alarcón with a pair of Eastern European leads: the Hungarian soprano Emöke Barath in the title role and Romanian countertenor Valer Barna-Sabadus as Menelao.
If travel isn’t an option, Youtube provides some choice Cavalli options: although it was already posted on this site albeit without any information attached, an audio recording of a splendid 2004 Eliogabalo from Brussels with René Jacobs conducting a very fine cast is available.
After I reviewed a 2011 production of Giasone, La Cieca was kind enough to host my recording (I didn’t record it—I just own it) of a live performance of the lush Raymond Leppard version of L’Ormindo starring The Vicar’s favorite tenor in the title role is still available for downloading.

If you’d rather watch rather than just listen to Cavalli, a complete Giasone, his most popular opera during his lifetime, conducted by Jacobs comes from the 1988 Innsbruck Festival.
I also recommend the operas of Antonio Cesti, a particular favorite of mine and Cavalli’s contemporary, whose spin on Semiramide was filmed at the 1987 Innsbruck Festival.
But the absolutely indispensible Cavalli on video is a miracle; long unavailable, a complete Glyndebourne La Calisto has recently turned up. I got a copy several years ago and it’s a gem, particularly for documenting the great Janet Baker at her absolute prime in one (or actually two) of her best roles—and a delightful Ileana Cotrubas in the title role ain’t bad either. Historical authenticity be damned, this is a sublime two hours.

May I assume the director and assistant are on Piotr Beczala’s list of people not to work with in the future?
For example, while the Roman emperor was believed to have been bisexual and a committed transvestite--if not transsexual
Ah, the passive voice. Believed by whom? It’s been a while since modern historians took the stories of ancient historians at face value. As Mary Beard put it in a recent review “But, of course, hard-headed modern historians have also chosen to “forget”
Elagabalus simply because his reported misdeeds seem so unbelievable… The most interesting academic studies of the Elagabalan tradition in recent
years have steered clear of questions of truth or falsehood in the ancient
accounts of this eccentric emperor… [E]mbracing rather than rejecting the exuberant
fictionality of the narratives of his reign, modern commentators have
concentrated instead on the ways that “Elagabalus” (as an imaginative
construct, rather than a real emperor) exposed the anxieties of Roman culture,
imperial power and politics.”
I don’t think that the historical accuracy of the libretto is really the point of the review. But yeah, Elagabalus’ rep seems just a tad doubtful to me. Sometime in my youth, someone repeated this story to me: “Wasn’t Heliogabalus the emperor who enjoyed having elephants pushed off his balcony onto the crowd below because he liked the crunching sound it made when the elephant landed?” When I pointed out that this sounded screwy, I was dismissed as a would-be know-it-all.
The stories of Elagabalus adventures as a transvestite prostitute may or may not be historical. It’s interesting that promiscuity seems to have been very popular among the Roman aristocracy, but also deplored as “feminine” whether the promiscuity involved women or men. Elagabalus’ scandalous (apocryphal?) promiscuity was compounded by additional details about how it was not “masculine”. “Not only was he promiscuous, he actually [fill in the blank with something effeminate and perverted]“
Yeah, they’re the sort of stories you spread about predecessors you’ve ousted.
I did a little reading on medieval Scotland a few years ago, and the lesson that was drilled into me (by writers such as James Fraser and Alex Woolf) was that you don’t read ancient historians to know what happened in the period they described, but to learn about the time in which the historians themselves were writing. In a different field, Stephen Owen applied the same principle to Chinese poetry in “The Making of Early Chinese Poetry” -- pointing out the fictive natures of early (4th- to 7th-century) literary histories of Chinese poetry but underscoring what practical and ideological purposes those fictions served.
The main biographical sources for Elagabalus’ life show up, if I recall correctly, about a century after his brief existence. It is in this context that Mary Beard’s remarks about present-day Elagabalus studies makes sense.
For the latest relevant musings on the subject, the new edition of the classic, Roman Homosexuality by Craig Williams is a good place to start…whatever the “truth” of the excesses of the upper classes during the Roman Empire, the “no-no” was always considered to be the position taken….and, of course, in au courant academic conversation, the idea of gay, straight, bi-sexual, etc. does not really define relations in the ancient world, as we have learned from many scholars, and well articulated by Foucault, these are all post-Christian definitions…
and that post-Christian definition is expanded to include the christian idea that the “depravity” sexual behavior of ancient nobles all points in the direction of chaos, that what is needed is carefully prescribed sexual continence etc. Finally, in the thinking of the last few centuries, you get to the point where anything outside the tiny scope of permissible sexual interaction is total depravity, proof of the end of the world. All very christian.
“you don’t read ancient historians to know what happened in the period they described, but to learn about the time in which the historians themselves were writing”
I believe Jonathan Miller said something very similar, but I can only paraphrase: That you could look at photographs of Shakespeare productions that claimed to offer authentic Elizabethan or Jacobean performance practice, and you could name the year they were done by whatever was considered “authentic” at that time.
Many thanks for the review and for the great links. I bought the L’Ormindo when it was first released on Argo and loved it from the first groove to the last. In moves, downsizing and divesting the discs disappeared (not that I have the equipment to play them on as that has long disappeared) many thanks for making a performance available.
And as for the Calisto -- well I rank the performance I saw of it at Glyndebourne, the first year they presented it, as one of those great, and unexpected, nights at the opera. Baker, Cotrobas, Hugues Cuenod, James Bowman -- and that miraculous production by Peter Hall and John Bury . I know its fashionable to belittle Leppard’s work on these early piece but his orchestrations and arrangements are remarkable and it is possible to see that this was very much a collaborative work between arranger-producer-singers. I knew it had been televised but was never able to get my hands on a copy. Many thanks for uploading it. You are allowing to relive one of those unforgettable evenings.
I want to say that, overall, I agree with this review. For example, I really didn’t understand what the idea of the preshow dancing was. Two-thirds of it could have been cut, and you’d more than get the point. And what truly didn’t work for me, except in bits and pieces, was what I consider the most wonderful thing about Cavalli, the mercurial scene to scene changes of mood, from serious, to raucously funny, to tragic, to heart rending. Often it would take two or three lines, before I would get the “idea” of a scene.
There is one thing I would really like to “correct”, however. The baroque string players are, actually, highly distinguished and well-known players in their field (except for the violist). The two violinists and the cellist specialize in baroque performance practice. Did it not occur to the reviewer that the Music Director, Grant Herreid, who gets a fine mention, actually hired the strings? And I know he hired them for the very reason that he thinks they know what they are doing. So I don’t know if the reviewer is a violinist, but I think he or she is just dead wrong about them.
And, however it came across, all should be aware that the string players are playing from the very back of an acoustically unflattering and noisy space, in a formation that does not allow good ensemble, and everyone is amplified with pickups on the strings, which does not help the players sound good.
I bought tickets for Friday’s performance from classictic, but apparently they sold me a ticket they didn’t have. If anyone is looking to get rid of a ticket, please let me know. THANKS!!!Microsoft founder Bill Gates has joined the fight in support of proposed U.S. rules that would require certain oil, gas and mining companies to disclose what they pay to nations whose resources they develop, in the face of strong lobbying from the energy industry.
The Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed rules would require companies listed with the agency to disclose what they pay to the U.S. and foreign governments where they mine and drill commercially.
The oil and gas industry, including its main trade group the American Petroleum Institute, have fought for exemptions to the rules, saying they could put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. Gates told the SEC to finalize rules that don’t bow to industry pressure to include certain disclosure exemptions.
“The Commission has a mandate to implement final rules reflecting the clear intent and reporting requirements established by Congress,” Gates wrote in a letter. “Such rules would be consistent with emerging international norms and practice, and help reinforce a competitive and level playing field for U.S. corporations and foreign companies. It would produce real benefits for the citizens of the countries where the investments take place.”
Human rights and anti-poverty groups say disclosing the payments would encourage corrupt governments that rely heavily on oil and gas revenues to spend the money more wisely. The rules, which are required under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, were supposed to be finalized in April 2011.
Activists with Oxfam America and other human rights and anti-poverty groups have launched a campaign to push back on the industry’s lobbying efforts against the long-delayed rules. Additionally, 14 Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to the SEC yesterday pressing their case for rules with no exemptions.
“We urge you to resist this pressure and promptly release a strong and effective final rule,” said the lawmakers, among them Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
If Barney Frank is for it then I am against it. Mr. Frank’s ideas have been a problem.Monday, December 17, 2007
On The Seventeenth Day of Christmas: [DANSK] Hvid Glögg
Ah yes. Yesterday was all about the Julestue - our Christmas Open House for family and friends. It's third year in a row we're doing it and I love it. There's something about gathering the people you love around you, treating them well and stuff them with goodies of the drinkable and edible kind.
I try to be organized when I throw these things. Even more so this year, 'cause Martin was working. The two last years, my Bonus-Mom C's also been around before the guests arrived - it is usually our Christmas Cookie Baking Day - but this year, she had to be somewhere else (it was her godson's birthday. Pshs! ;)). So she wasn't there either - I was all by myself. Not that I mind. But as I said, I try to be organized. I didn't say I always manage...
Drinks - those I managed. Coffee, tea, lots of cold water, dad-in-law brought cold beers and then I made white glögg. One of the good things about glögg is that you can make the extract well in advance, and then all you have to do is heat it up before you serve it. That does mean you need to make sure you have a heat-source of some kind available, and not, say, occupied by æbleskive-pander... But one can only be so well-planned.
Glögg made from red wine is the traditional thing, but we've made this white glögg for the last two years, and I think we're going to keep it up. I find the red version to become a little sickly sweet fast, while this white one is a little fresher. I haven't tried it with cider yet, but can only imagine it to be good. Oh yes, and don't splurge on a fancy bottle of wine - you're going to load it with spices, rum and sugar anyways, so it would be a shame to use that lovely Chablis you got from work. Something cheap-ish, but okay, and fresh, not something that's been open for four weeks. You get it, right?
White Glögg - from Camilla Plum, again
makes about 12 glasses (depending on the size, of course!) - I serve it in small glasses and probably get about 16. Glögg is a thing you love and want more of, or have one glass of because 'tis the season and all, but really, you don't appreciate it all that much. With small glasses, it's possible to have just that obligatory glass and then the people that love it can go get themselves a refill in the kitchen. You could choose to put a couple pitchers or thermos with glögg on the table too, just make sure it's warm when it's served. Pitchers will lose heat fast, and thermos will take up the taste of the warm wine, so for me, the "refill's are in the kitchen!" works best. Plus it's a great way to lure people into the kitchen, and maybe have them lend a hand with the dishes at the same time :)
2 bottles white wine/real cider (1,5 liter total)
200 ml. dark rum (maybe more?)
4 star anise
4 thick slices ginger
half nutmeg
20 black peppercorns
2 cinammon sticks
4 all spice berries
4 juniper berries
1 teaspoon coriander seeds
Piece of one bay leaf
Zest of 1 lemon
cane sugar
Crush the spices lightly in a mortar - put them, together with the lemon zest and 500 ml. water, in a pot and let it simmer for half an hour. Leave to infuse for at least a day - I've left mine for up to 14 days with no problems.
When ready to drink, sieve the extract into a pot, and mix it with the wine/cider. Heat it till just below boiling - do not let it boil, ever, you'll boil away the alcohol ;) - and add sugar and rum to taste. Serve straight away. If you wish, you can also add yellow or green raisins, soaked in rum, to the glasses. Sometimes, people put in slivered almonds as well, but I personally think it's overkill. It's good in the red version though.

Beautiful! I'm going to make the cider version for New Year!
[And this time without the apparent typo effects of a glass of wine.] Perfect! I was just wondering what to do for my sister for Christmas Eve since she doesn't drink red wine. Now I'll do two, red AND white gloggi.
I made the gloggi last week from the same recipe and it's grrreaat - so do try it people!

Comments On Mar 27, 2015:I bought my wife a 250z quadsport for Christmas & wanted to tune it up a bit for her. So after looking online at alot of reviews, the quad kids were saying that the DynoJet kit was a must. They werent lying! First I cleaned the carb & installed a Moose rebuild kit w/ the oem size pilot jet to freshen things up. Then I installed the DynoJet kit (which was super easy) to our sea level & mod specs which was under 3000' w/ the airbox lid & baffle removed. I then had to order an adjustale air/fuel screw for a DRZ400 from Keintech to dial it in. After all that, this little 250 rips for what it is & was. I was very surpised at how much more rev she had. Its actually a fun little quad now & great for my wife. The only issue I have is that it doesnt come w/ a new pilot jet. Its just 1 more small jet that would complete the kit I think. They come w/ carb rebuild kits, so for the price they could throw it in.

RIP Zelda Part 1
The elderly woman pushed the front door of her house open and came in lagging a large suitcase. She had just started up the stairs to her room with the grace of a woman years younger when she heard sobbing coming from the living room.
"Willard?" she called as she put the suitcase down and slowly walked back down the stairs. "Willard, is that you?"
"She's dead," Willard Kraft whispered as his grandmother came into the living room. He was sitting on the couch in a dark brown suit with all of the lights in the room out and the curtains closed. As she sat down beside him, his grandmother could see that his eyes were red and swollen as if he had been crying non-stop for several days.
"Willard, what happened?" she asked as she wrapped her arms around her grandson. She had never seen him like this before.
"It's Zelda," Willard whispered. He couldn't believe that something this awful had happened to him. He wanted to die. "She died."
"What?" Willard's grandmother was totally shocked by this news. She had to get the facts from Willard fast. "Willard, dear, calm down and tell me exactly what happened!"Here we go again.
More NHL trade rumors have come about regarding the Toronto Maple Leafs and goaltending.
It seems like no matter how well James Reimer plays, the Toronto media and a portion of the fanbase still don't trust the 25-year-old Manitoba native.
Yet, according to Nick Kypreos of Sportsnet, the Leafs may still be in the hunt for Los Angeles Kings backup netminder Jonathan Bernier (via twitter):
Keep hearing #Kings Bernier will b traded sooner than later. With poss' Breeze buyout and Leiweke LA link, #Leafs #Flyers front-runners— Nick Kypreos (@RealKyper) June 18, 2013
Why Dave Nonis would want to give up assets like draft picks or young prospects (the reported asking price) for a backup goaltender who is about to hit restricted free agency is beyond me.
Sure, James Reimer has been hurt in each of his last two seasons, but Ben Scrivens has proven to be more than capable in the backup role.
This season, Scrivens played 20 games for the Leafs and had a respectable 2.69 GAA and .915 save percentage.
His numbers may not have been as stellar as Jonathan Bernier's in a backup role, but keep in mind the Leafs are a far worse possession team and aren't nearly as good defensively.
Is it really worth the price to upgrade your backup goaltender spot and bury Ben Scrivens in the minors?
Secondly, for those who believe in bringing in Bernier to potentially start or give James Reimer a run for his money as the Leafs' starting goalie, you must remember just how good James Reimer was this season, both during the shortened regular campaign and in the playoffs.
Do you think the Leafs should look into dealing for Jonathan Bernier?
At the age of 24 (though he turned 25 in March), Reimer was able to post a 2.46 GAA and .924 save percentage. In the 2013 postseason, his GAA spiked a little bit, but he was still stopping over 92 percent of the shots he faced, registering a .923 save percentage and helping Toronto steal Game 5 against the Boston Bruins.
For starters, that gives him the best save percentage for a single season in Toronto Maple Leafs' history (with at least 25 games played), just ahead of Ed Belfour.
Speaking of Ed Belfour, who is widely regarded as a great NHL goaltender, just how good was he at James Reimer's age?
Well in the 1990-91 NHL season, Belfour posted a GAA of 2.47 and save percentage of just .910.
Compare Reimer to another favorite among Leafs fans, Curtis Joseph, and you'll get the same result: CuJo didn't register a sub-3.00 GAA until he was nearly 30 years old.
James Reimer probably hasn't even hit his prime yet, and he's already putting up Ed Belfour and Curtis Joseph-like numbers. Trading for Bernier right now looks to be a complete waste of assets to make a lateral move, at best.
The final reason Dave Nonis should put the Bernier rumors on the back-burner, is because finding another goaltender is so far down the Leafs' priority list right now, it may as well be in fine print.
At this juncture, Toronto has to make big decisions on who they want to buyout, their unrestricted free agents (mainly Clarke MacArthur and Tyler Bozak), who should fill the No. 1 center role, locking up Phil Kessel (who's contract ends following the 2013-14 campaign), ensuring they keep all of their talented restricted free agents (who compose a significant part of Toronto's team) and preparing for the 2013 NHL Draft.
All of those things have the potential to make a far greater impact in Toronto than dealing for a restricted free agent backup goaltender.
Trading for Jonathan Bernier just doesn't make sense.Facebook is in talks to buy Titan Aerospace, a maker of solar-powered drones, to step up its efforts to provide Internet access to remote parts of the world, according to reports from technology blog TechCrunch and financial news outlet CNBC.

Recent ActivityCow Town. So far I was with Leviticus, but he had a lot more to say on the topic of thou-shalt-not-eat:
Nevertheless these you shall not eat of those that chew the cud, or of those who part the hoof: the camel, because he chews the cud but doesn't have a parted hoof, he is unclean to you.
The pig, because he has a split hoof, and is cloven-footed, but doesn't chew the cud, he is unclean to you.
All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.
All other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination.
I ran the list in my head. Fowls that creep, going upon all four? I couldn't think of any four-legged fowls, save those from mythology, but if someone (most likely in West Texas or Montana) starts ranching sphinxes or gryffons, damn straight I'll eat 'em. Flying creeping things? That means bugs, and I've eaten plenty. The weasel? Never tried it, although I've had squirrel, and it's nasty. The mouse? Absolutely. Tortoise? Check. Ferret? No. The chameleon and the lizard? Chameleon, no, but I've eaten lizards: They're like chewing on a belt spread with rancid bacon grease. The snail? Yes, whenever possible. The mole? Again, I'm game.
Lucky for me, I am not one of the Children of Israel. My wife is half a one, but from what I hear, the condition is not contagious, no matter how hard I try. What I am is one of the Children of Mike and Cindy Sheehan of Rochester, New York. A German-Irish family of mixed Catholic and Protestant descent, we had few formal rules regarding food that weren't in some way related to thrift and fierce portion control. Two cookies from a box of roughly 10,000 stale and off-brand sandwich cookies for dessert; cheap cheddar that became aged cheddar in my mother's perpetually overstuffed refrigerator.
Still, when my brother and I were young, my parents subscribed to a nearly Levitican theory of menu planning. Like Moses, Aaron and the Children of Israel, we Children of Belcoda Drive ate regularly of the parteth of hoof, the cloven of foot, the chewers of cud, disdaining in our beef (and occasional venison) fixation all those creatures that crept or flew. Cindy did not boil tortoises for supper. Mike did not grill lizards. None of us ate of the snail. We do now. But back then, we were all abstemious in accidental, partial accord with Leviticus, devoted eaters of many God-pleasing ruminants — most often ground up and served in the form of cheeseburgers.
Had we, the tribe of Rochester, pushed farther west rather than settling on the alternately frozen or chokingly humid shore of Lake Ontario, Culver's Butterburgers & Frozen Custard would've been one of our temples. We had plenty of our own (Schaller's and Bill Gray's and the LDR and Abbott's Frozen Custard), but Culver's — a 350-outlet staple of the American middle west, with a handful of locations up and down I-25 — is something special. You can't cook a cheeseburger at home the way Culver's does. Part of the reason is lack of equipment: Unless you are very rich and very dedicated, you do not have a gleaming, forty-inch expanse of searing steel flat-top in your kitchen. Another part is expertise: Culver's has been flipping cheeseburgers since 1984, when Craig and Lea and George and Ruth Culver started out in a former A&W location in Sauk City, Wisconsin, expanding from there at wildfire speed. Still another part is commitment: Each Culver's makes its own burgers, to order, every day. Nothing is frozen. Nothing is purchased pre-prep.
And the last part is pure craziness, because the best of the burgers at Culver's — a burger pulled from cultish burger pre-history and raised by the Culvers to a trademarked specialité de la maison — is the butterburger, which is exactly what it sounds like: a burger slathered with, glazed by and cooked in butter.
Without the flat-top, the practice, a gigantic tub of dairyland prime butter close at hand and the mad willingness to use it in such an unnatural fashion, you're never going to make a burger like the butterburger at Culver's. Which is probably a good thing, because once you develop a taste for a butterburger, you'll be tempted to eat them all the time. And while God's law allows me to eat of the cow all I want, even a cow ground into hamburger and coated in butter, simple biology will eventually limit my intake. By killing me. A butterburger is the antithesis of health food, weighting the end of the scale opposite a small green salad, nuts, berries, sprouts. A butterburger is the gustatory equivalent of swallowing a live hand grenade.. Here the burgers are truly smashed — thrown and mashed onto the flat-top grill with a press that I at first thought was for show, then realized played an important role. When — the traditional cooking surface for burgers smashed by hand..

From Studio ADTRW:
After suffering numerous interstellar wars, mankind has finally formed an interstellar union. However there are still many disputes and wars occurring amongst the members of the union itself. In order to resolve these problems, a secret organization, known as GOTT, is formed. They employ agents with special powers to fight for the organization. Agents Eclair and Lumiere are two girls with outstanding abilities, and they are assigned as partners. Together, they fight, and slowly uncover more and more about the secret of the organization that they work for.

As we age, we begin to develop a world view that is our own. In our twenties we have little experience with the world and we have to rely upon idealism, imagination and principle: we lack any great depth or breadth of experience with which to set our own valuations, and to make accurate predictions for our decisions.
As we get older we build from our myriad experiences and successes and failures the structure of our world view, right or wrong. And after a certain point all our experiences are little more than tapestries on the walls of the houses we’ve built of our lives. We may add on an addition here and there. But we rarely tear the whole house down and start over. We may be wrong, but we are not without our reasons. This is why we can become so cock-sure, blunt and even cantankerous in our old age. We really have been there and done that.

Thanks for the tip, Bmore. I’ll have to look them up — your experience sounded great. I’d love to be able to see more music live; I’d even go by myself, as that is one thing my hubby and I don’t share in common, but it would take some real schedule-rearranging at present.

Still though, I’m surprised that that a Harvard professor would have to take the time to understand this. Perhaps I have more to learn from his example.
The streets are strewn with jigsaw puzzle pieces. We know the pictures our parents gave us. But now we pick up the pieces of our experiences and try to fit them into a picture. Sometimes they fit and sometimes they don’t. And often the picture that takes form is not what we expected or even like. By the time we are old, the picture is set, and the pieces that fit are fewer and farther between. We may even have to force a few.
But how many of us ever throw out our picture and start over?

But seriously though, I don’t think I’ve ever met a grown man (or woman) who has seriously questioned everything he’s always believed, and has thrown it all out, and started over.
I’ve known a lot of people who never learned much and have been more or less stagnant for most of their lives. But I’ve never to my recollection known a guy who slapped his head and said, “Wow, I’ve been so wrong all these years! I’ve got to rethink everything I’ve ever thought I knew.”
Can anyone out there think of someone and relate the story?

My temperament has remained the same.
My personality hasn’t changed very much.
Once you see that bleeding hearts lead to bleeding bodies, you really do realize that no matter how good Leftist blather sounds, it always ends in blood. It can take time to get there, but that is the destination. See that play out a number of times in history and you wise up pretty quickly unless you love to delude yourself about the ultimate ends of imposing power over your fellow man.
If anything I’ve become more set in who I am, but then temperament tends to guide personality, not the other way around. You gots real problems if your personality is guiding your temperament and may believe that humans are perfectable via the use of power. Real big problems if you go that direction.

; ) personal growth and Conservatism are not adversaries in the least. Quite the contrary. Broadening ones width of understanding of all these things is a very Conservative position. If not a core belief imperative to its very existence. I find that many times Liberalism is confused with progressivism and leftism. My feeling is that Liberalism is more at home within Conservative thinking. The hybrid of which may in fact be considered the Libertarian view. For me there are many aspects to Conservatism which make it more or less compelling for people to embrace. Social Conservatism for example has a dual guide in the course it takes. Scripture. The hardest role Conservative thought has at the same time, its greatest liability, one must come to it of their own accord. Proselytizing for it does not seem to work. Where as with leftism/progressivism, its easy. Lazy like water as I say. At any rate, found it funny the Heads were in your head. Lol! Hope this brief thought makes sense. At least a little. I am warn out. ; )

I don’t understand how people listen to to the same music all their lives. There’s so much interesting music in the world and with the Internet there’s no reason not to expand the playlist. But some people are happy listening to the same thing over and over. I wonder if they eat the same food day in and day out too.
I think some people vote in such a way as to rebel against their parents whatever way that may be. If they ever grow up maybe they take a look at what’s going on and vote based on what they see.

Interesting piece, Jazz. Thanks for posting it.
I have actually had the experience of “throwing everything out” and starting over … multiple times. I actually think I’m a bit crazy. Indoctrinated in college, I was a diehard liberal until age 35 … I hated McDonalds, Wal-Mart, all the big corporations. Then I had an epiphany during the 2004 GOP convention … I realized everything the liberal media had told me about George W. Bush and Republicans was a lie … and I wanted to know for myself.
It was like discovering the Matrix.
I’ve also had several religious transformations … but those seem to be continually changing … going from faith to doubt … back to faith.
As to what the future holds … Please God, do NOT let me go back to being a liberal … but I do hope that I will regain some of my earlier idealism and optimism.
These last four years have been tough …

Nicole Coulter on January 28, 2013 at 1:51 AM
haha no.
I was raised in an upper middle class, suburban, Protestant family. If I ever had a “crisis,” it was when I was 19 and brought a girl home from college, of whom my family vehemently disapproved. Their reaction made me realize just how much I didn’t fit in with them – overall, I’m laid back and very open-minded, but the rest of the family’s members were (and still are) repressed/shackled in fear to varying degrees, and resistant to change.
When I said “30%” before, I meant it’s my observation that only 30% of people out there are willing to question everything they’ve been taught, not that they’ve actually gone and done it, often because the need to do so has never arisen for them.
Anti-Control on January 28, 2013 at 7:26 AM
I’m in my early 30’s, I was a freshman in college during Bush/Gore in 2000. I was more liberal-leaning them, but I look back now and I attribute some of that to my ultra-liberal high school teachers (Republicans were consistently characterized as the bad guys, Democrats the good guys), and some of that to my laser-like focus on social issues, and buying into the idea that, as a Jew, the right-wing “Party of Christianity” was out to create a theocracy in this country and only the Democrats were going to fight it. I didn’t research much, and I was on the Gore bandwagon in 2000. I remember all the craziness of election night being passed back and forth on white-boards on people’s dorm doors.
I think the Iraq War was among the first things to really kind of change my thinking (since I didn’t yet have a job, so taxes & the economy weren’t on my mind aside from the fact that the job market wasn’t that great, but I didn’t really know enough to figure out who to “blame”). The war started Spring of my senior year of college. When it started coming out a few years later that WMD’s were never found, etc, and the quickness that people were willing to just backtrack and potentially do more damage than ever before, it became clear to me that the attitude of Democrats was very short-sighted and potentially dangerous. Being Jewish and a proponent of Israel, I started to look into the politics of that situation, and before I knew it, I was voting Bush in 2004 for pretty much foreign policy reasons (I was still pretty uneducated in fiscal, but it didn’t seem as important at the time)
The defining change for me came around the primary season for 2008. I’d been working for about 4-5 years now, with flat paychecks. I was now married, buying my first house. Doing everything responsibly and living within my means. I started paying attention more to politics. When I’d express my opinions which were turning more conservative (and partly libertarian-leaning in terms of the constitution), my bleeding-heart-liberal sister would say “Oh, that’s just what the right-wing-radio-talk-show-hosts want you to think”, as if I was too stupid to come to my own conclusions. The disagreements became person, and I was often attacked as a bad, uncaring person for having non-liberal thoughts. Ironically, she got me curious about talk-radio and I started listening to a bit of Sean Hannity & Mark Levin on the way home from work. Mark Levin, who originally seemed WAY too angry for me to listen to on a daily basis, became less angry-sounding to me once I guess I became MORE angry about things.
The ironic part of the whole thing is that when Obama first came on the scene, I was thinking “Hey, this is a personable guy, maybe he’ll be a democrat that I can be OK with”. Boy was I wrong. Of course, little did I know that having an open mind, and forming my opinion based on his words & actions would turn me into a racist.
So I’m still libertarian-leaning on social issues (Yes, you can say I’m not a “true conservative”, I really don’t care anymore), but I definitely had a conservative evolution. I’ve always been a responsible person, I’ve never been terribly impulsive or done anything stupid in my youth. So I’d attribute most of my “evolution” to paying attention & educating myself on the issues, something I think will be harder and harder for future generations facing such a biased media & education system. It’s shocking how many young people AND adults are blissfully unaware of the damage that liberals and Democrats have systematically caused to the very people they claim to help.

Oh, yeah, I know about Pandora; tried it a few times, but I’m not all that keen on it for the same reason I stopped listening to Live365 stations on iTunes — hate being pestered to subscribe to their service every five minutes.
Instead, I’ve found some interesting stations just by Googling, one of which is Rocket 88, which as far as I can tell is one person with a bunch of iPods filled with tons of rare, eclectic music, mostly blues, but sometimes obscure 60s psychedelia and the like. Every so often, it goes offline, presumably to replenish its stores. Best of all, there are no commercials. Zip, zero, nada, and the music is only very briefly interrupted by a quick station break, which tells you that it’s “the best station out there.”

That’s funny but true since there is nothing in any way substantive about any of the alleged gods invented by man. There is no reason we even need to defend not believing in something there is zero evidence for. Do I also need to defend not believing in the tooth fairy?

Drugs warning after man dies
Dated: 22 Jul 2014
Police are warning people about the dangers of taking illegal drugs after a man died in Gateshead.
At just before 8am on Monday, July 21, police received a report that a man had been found deceased inside a house at Longhirst in Leam Lane Estate.
At this stage it's believed the man, aged in his 30s, had taken a drug suspected to be heroin.
Enquiries are being carried out to establish exactly what has happened, and further tests will be carried out. A report will be prepared for the coroner to establish a cause of death.
Police are warning people about the dangers of taking any illegal drugs.
DI Sharon Chatterton, Gateshead CID, said: "We're carrying out extensive enquiries to establish whether there has been drug involvement, if there has been an overdose or if there is a bad batch of drugs in circulation.
"Taking any illegal drug is dangerous and potentially life threatening and I'd urge anyone who feels unwell to seek medical treatment immediately."
The investigation is ongoing and anyone with any information which could help police is asked to contact officers on 101.
Anyone who needs emergency medical attention should call 999. For further information visit or.

Its closest rival is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (MW3), but a week-long poll run by gaming community IGN has put Battlefield 3 (BF3) ahead of its rival. The poll had more than 45,000 respondents from all over the world, conducted by IGN and published on their website found 51.01% of those votes went to BF3 and MW3 claiming only 19.57% – making it the best first person shooter of the year for 2011.
Respondents chose from 20 different titles within the genre of First Person Shooters including Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Crysis 2, and Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary – all top five contenders for the top spot. BF# not only won the Shooter of the Year but also won the Best Weapon category with 30.61% of the votes; Best Competitive Multiplayer, 54.32%; and Most Graphically Impressive FPS, 63.94%.
MW3 did win one category over BF3 – the Best Co-Op category with 30.95% of the votes.
There has been a lot of media concerning which of these two titles would be grab the lion's share of gamer support and IGN seems to be the winner in terms of popularity and sales. One such reason perhaps is that gamers have commented that with COD: Black Ops only released last year they may have played too much COD and looking for something different.

From the April 12 edition of Fox News' Fox & Friends:
President Obama sat down with ABC's Good Morning America co-host George Stephanopoulos in Prague for an interview in which the pair discussed his efforts at nuclear arms reduction.
Asked by Stephanopoulos to respond to Palin's ummm enlightening criticism that his policy is "kind of like getting out there on the playground...a bunch of kids ready to fight and one of the kids saying 'go ahead, punch me in the face and I'm not going to retaliate,'" the President said the Fox News contributor is "not much of an expert on nuclear issues."
Of course, it was only a matter of time before the former half-term Alaska Governor's Fox News colleagues sprang to her defense saying Obama wasn't acting "presidential." I guess we should just leave the hard hitting analysis to a trio of right-wing media hacks that act nothing like journalists:
Imagine what they would have said if Obama avoided the question and refused to discuss Palin entirely.
Palin really is like catnip to the media. Perhaps we can get someone in the White House press corps to lodge daily requests for comment with press secretary Robert Gibbs on the President's opinion of Palin's Facebook status updates.
Sigh.
Fox & Friends again baselessly suggested that Muslim scholar Tariq Ramadan was "banned from entering the United States" because of "ties to terrorists." However, Ramadan -- who was never charged with any crime -- denied knowing that a charity to which he donated was alleged to have ties to Hamas, and media reports noted that he was "denied admittance" during the Bush administration "after making statements counter to U.S. foreign policy."
In advance of the April 15 tax deadline, the conservative media have complained that, according to a Tax Policy Center report, 47 percent of households pay no federal income taxes. These complaints come despite the fact that the vast majority of these households pay other taxes.."

Fox & Friends this morning played host to Kurt Zimmermann, a Tennessee man who is on a crusade to get his local school board to ban a high school science text book, Asking About Life, for its so-called "bias against Christianity." As I've written before, Fox News -- their morning show hosts in particular -- will unashamedly rally to the defense of Christians and Christianity, often to the exclusion of other faiths and journalistic propriety. In this case, the Fox & Friends crew bestowed kudos on Mr. Zimmermann, who is upset that this particular text book describes creationism as a "biblical myth." Brian Kilmeade called him a "good example of somebody who saw something and you're taking action, and that's a great example for your kid."
It's not at all appropriate for a news organization to endorse the banning of educational materials based on two words that a local activist disagrees with. What's more, describing creationism as a "myth" is exactly in line with the viewpoint of the majority of scientists, who tend to prefer geological and physical evidence for the earth's creation over the biblical account, so why shouldn't that viewpoint find expression in a scientific text?

View Photo GalleryPrior (and probably some other things we haven't thought of). So we are renaming it the ‘GEMSTONE STATE’.
Prior to 1975, a few people knew the state had a few agates and some of the highest quality jade in the world. Jade was even named the state gemstone. Most people figured no other gemstones would be found.
Over the next few years, more than 40 diamond pipes and dikes were discovered – half in Wyoming and half in Colorado. Several properties were mined for diamonds including George Creek, Sloan, and Kelsey Lake. Over 130,000 diamonds were mined including gemstones larger than 28 carats. A 6.5 carat diamond was found in Wyoming and diamonds of 14 and 28 carats were mined from Colorado.
In 1981, Wyoming was unknown for gold even though all of the surrounding states had considerable gold. Gold had been discovered in Wyoming in 1842, but nothing much was ever done. Significant gold was found in the Seminoe Mountains in 1981 by a geologist from Laramie named Dan Hausel. The Rawlins Times reported a gold rush filled all of the motels in Rawlins, Saratoga, Sinclair and even Laramie with people wanting a piece of the pie. It was Timberline Minerals from Dubois who tied up the property. The company president, John Wells indicated they drilled the discovery site at Bradley Peak and picked up samples of quartz and iron formation with visible gold.
Another gold discovery made by Hausel will likely result in one or more major gold mines in central Wyoming: gold in the Rattlesnake Hills .
Hausel identified targets associated with breccias, stockworks and veins. Years later Newmont Gold, Canyon Resources and Evolving Gold found a giant gold deposit sitting under a breccia adjacent to an alkalic intrusive named Sandy Mountain. Evolving Gold, started exploring this property and it is now thought to be equivalent to Cripple Creek gold deposits in Colorado. Hausel went on to discover another major gold deposit in Alaska with 6 other geologists – a deposit that has $60 billion in gold and is one of the largest in North America.
For most people, discoveries would have ended here. In 2005, Professor Hausel sat on the cover of ICMJ’s Prospecting and Mining Journal. He had just found and mapped some of the largest gemstones and gemstone deposits in the world.
He found some onyx deposits - onyx was unknown in the state at this time. While mapping South Pass – a known gold district from the 1800s, he expanded our knowledge of the deposits while mapping major gold anomalies at the Carissa, Wolf, Duncan, Tabor Grand and other mines and identifying more than 200 gold anomalies. Then there was significant gold veins found at Mineral Hill and at Purgatory Gulch. He identified a large gold anomaly at the Kurtz-Chatterton deposit along Copper Creek in the Sierra Madre.
Then he started looking for colored gemstones, it was incredible. Other than jade, the state was not known for gemstones prior to 1977. Hausel found some diamond deposits after McCallum made his mark, discovered at least six ruby and sapphire deposits including two of the largest rubies in the world. Billions of carats of gem-quality kyanite - this gemstone was everywhere and no one had even recognized it although we were all walking on these deposits in the field.
Hausel found at least four iolite deposits including the two largest in the world (one with possibly more than two trillion carats of the gem). He found the two largest iolites in the world – one weighed more than 24,000 carats. Here were fabulous gemstone deposits including the largest gemstones in the world, the largest deposits in the world, completely new discoveries, and this gemstone looked just like sapphire or similar to Tanzanite. Estimates suggested the combined worth of these deposits could be more than our national debt.
Before he was done, the Professor discovered gem-quality apatite, specularite, peridot, pyrope, spessartine, chrome diopside, chrome enstatite, ruby, sapphire, amethyst, Mexican opal, precious opal, common opal, the largest opals in the world (some weighing more than 75,000 carats), aquamarine, helidor, zoisite, epidote, Mexican onyx, onyx, hematite, diamonds, platinum, palladium, hundreds of gold deposits and anomalies, nickel, rare jade pseudomorphs after quartz, and identified the first reported ilsemannite and berthierite in Wyoming. And these discoveries sparked discoveries made by others of jade, tourmaline, labradorite, minyulite and varisite.
The opal was fascinating. One of the largest opal and agate deposits in the world was exposed in the Cedar Rim oil field south of Riverton. Boulders of the opal sat in cuts of service roads to the field, and the deposit was scattered over 16 square miles and even had some opal exposed in the US Highway south of Riverton. You would think someone would have gotten out of their car and looked to see what these boulders were made of - some boulders of opal, weighing more than 100,000 carats were recently found in this deposit. The Bureau of Land Management was so upset by this discovery, they wanted to withdraw the property before they knew where in Wyoming it was located!
The peridot discovery was also interesting. Peridot is gem-quality olivine. For more than 100 years, olivine was known in the Leucite Hills of Wyoming. Some very famous geologists looked at the peridot, briefly mentioned it in passing, but not one realized that it was gem-quality. Then in 1997, the professor was in the Leucite Hills looking for diamonds when he spotted two anthills that were green in color. He collected these anthills: no diamonds, but instead 13,000 carats of cuttable peridot were collected by these ants adjacent to an access road! By the way, he found minerals in nearby rocks that indicated some of the Leucite Hills were similar to the diamond rich deposits at Ellendale and Argyle in Australia and predicted diamonds would be found here. Yet, no one has looked for diamonds in this area. But, if all goes the way of his other discoveries, you can bet that diamonds will be found there in the future.

Businesswomen extend networking to China
Seattle Times business reporter
A computer presentation is ready to be shown at an event before the delegation of businesswomen leaves for China.
KEN LAMBERT / THE SEATTLE TIMES
Laurie McDonald Jonsson, left, president of Stellar International Networks, makes a toast for a successful trip at a gathering before a high-level delegation of 58 women head to China to exchange ideas with female business leaders.
When Laurie McDonald Jonsson first visited China in 1976, a phrase she heard there stayed with her: "Women hold up half the sky."
The Seattle businesswoman thought of those words, first said by Chairman Mao, before departing on another journey to China this week.
This time Jonsson is taking one of the largest high-level delegations of women to visit the country in recent years.
The 58 women, including many business leaders from local companies, will meet women entrepreneurs and others in China in an exchange meant to go beyond the usual business deals.
"We would like to make a statement to the world about what women can achieve," she said.
Jonsson, president of Seattle-based networking organization Stellar International Networks, said her mission is to "link women leaders around the world so we can share and learn from each other and so we can have more women sitting at the table with men around the world."
Jonsson has led previous women's delegations to Poland, Cuba, Sweden, the Baltics and South Africa. The group heading to China includes lawyers, doctors, professors, investors and a prominent politician — U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell.
They will spend eight days in Beijing and Shanghai hosted by the All China Women's Federation and the Chinese Association of Women Entrepreneurs. Harvard University's Women's Leadership Board and the Women President's Organization are also participating in the trip.
They plan to hold a series of discussions on topics such as energy, health, education and expanding opportunities for girls under the theme "commerce with a conscience."
Unlike a one-time trade delegation, the trip is the first step toward building lifelong ties with women in China, Jonsson said. Some of the women she met on previous trips — a banker from Sweden and a wine producer from South Africa — are joining the group in China.
"I think it is another instance of the power of the global perspective that we increasingly take toward social issues," said Pepper Schwartz, a University of Washington sociology professor who is on the trip. "It's significant that women with power in their own societies are open to exchanging knowledge and perspectives with each other in the hopes of inspiring new business, new scholarship and new collaboration."
Schwartz will give a talk on the impact of women's success on their relationships and learn about how Chinese women are dealing with that issue.
The visit will also focus on women's health. Doctors from UW and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center are going along to look for ways to cooperate with institutions in China, said Julie Gralow, professor of medicine at UW. They plan to visit two major cancer-care centers in China and the Chinese Center for Disease Control offices, hear from Chinese patients and learn about the role Chinese medicine plays in women's health.
"We are really excited," she said. "Our goal is to promote dialogue, awareness and education between our countries that will improve breast-cancer prevention, screening, treatment and survivorship."
Some members of the group will focus on education, including a project to bring young Chinese women to study at Harvard. Jonsson, who is bringing her 16-year-old daughter along, said she is interested in learning how girls in China have little trouble mastering math and science, while girls here have had not fared as well.
Sandra Taylor, senior vice president for corporate social responsibility at Starbucks Coffee, said she is looking forward to talking with Chinese businesswomen about the growing interest in China in contributing to local communities.
Starbucks began a project this year to train teachers and provide materials in five rural Chinese provinces. The idea of responsible business resonates in China because of the growing income gap and the realization that many have been left out of the country's economic boom, she said.
In China's political buzzwords, the concept is known as "building a harmonious society."
"We describe what we're doing as contributing to a harmonious society," Taylor said. In Beijing, she will discuss corporate social responsibility on a panel that includes Microsoft Vice President Pamela Passman and Yang Mianmian, president of one of China's largest manufacturers, the Haier Group.
On the same day, Cantwell will speak to the group about positive engagement with China and the potential for new renewable fuel technologies developed in the Pacific Northwest to find a market there.
Another participant, Kimberly Harris, who heads regulatory policy and energy efficiency at Puget Sound Energy, will share the company's experience with energy-efficiency programs and new technology such as wind farms, solar power, dairy digesters and automated meter-reading technology from Spokane-based Itron.
"If you really look at who is going to be focused on the future for our children and the future for our planet, the women's delegation is key," she said. "If you have a booming economy like China, like the Puget Sound area, you need renewable energy choices."
While the Puget Sound region is building on top of existing infrastructure, China is building new energy systems from the ground up, she said. "In both countries there's a lot of lessons learned that we can share."
Joseph Borich, director of the Washington State China Relations Council and former U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, helped Jonsson plan the trip and will accompany the group to China.
"I feel very strongly and positively about this delegation, about what it's trying to do," he said. The U.S.-China relationship is "too important to leave to the hands of politicians and diplomats. If the relationship is going to strive and do well, a lot of it is going to have to come at the grass-roots level."

Troy wrote to me yesterday to tell me:
All these "Christian" blogs seem do is talk down about other Christians. Who would want to be a part of this (Christianity) if the people who are supposed to love and accept one another just bring each other down? Let's remember above everything else we're called to LOVE Jesus and LOVE others. And let's not forget John 13:35.
Well Troy, there was unfinished business in my previous series - particularly in regard to Hillsong's disgraceful practice of removing a part of a Bible verse (the repentance part). Can you honestly tell me that you don't have a problem with that? My correspondence with Joel A'Bell brings more light to this story.
Secondly, this blog is just one area of the sum of my labor. It is in this forum alone that I venture into polemic critiques and discussions. Furthermore, I like to think that this blog contains a good blend of a wide variety of subjects with both positive and negative stories.
Thirdly, there you go trying to play the love card. Scripture defines God's love in Romans 5:8 . . .
God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
So if you want to criticize about love then criticize Hillsong for their failure to preach God's love by never talking about sin or the cross (as is ably demonstrated in their CD gospel presentation and the video from my Sep 20 2010 post). Also Troy, if you love God and treasure His word then where is your outrage over Hillsong's willingness to mess with Scripture? I would contend that I am doing this out of love for the truth, a love for God's people who are being deceived, and a love for the true Gospel that God delivered.)
Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. (Romans 16:17)
Troy wrote again after these comments:
I really do care about all those things you're talking about. And I can assure you that I've been to Hillsong quite a few times and have heard the gospel accurately preached. Yes, including the mention of sin and the cross.
I think that you are right to question the "tampering" or scripture. But at the same time, I think you keep harping on something that could very well have been an accident that was overlooked, as Robert Fergusson stated in your post. But for some reason you have chosen to believe that this was intentional. I believe that this was not intentional. Unless you have seen them consistently changing scripture, then I see no reason to believe that they do not preach "the true gospel". Especially when like I said above, I have heard it for myself.
Hillsong Church is doing many incredible things around the world in the name of Jesus and many lives are being changed. This is a fact.
Troy, for months now I have been waiting for one solitary example of a faithful Gospel presentation from anything at Hillsong (video, audio, or written). Nothing has been forthcoming - except for several people trying to reassure me that they do preach the Gospel. I do however have an abundance of examples of them preaching a false gospel so bad even their doctrine statement defines it as heretical. So Troy send me the one example of a faithful Gospel presentation that talks about God's holiness, man's sin, judgment, atonement and resurrection, repentance and faith. I am eagerly awaiting . . .
I welcome anyone willing to send me one example they can find and i promise I will give it a fair hearing. I'm waiting . . .
I did go looking for one of these Gospel presentations (of Joel A'Bell) myself in the last few days but did not find anything. But I did find this video featuring Joel A'Bell (and some other guy later on) which was interesting. Joel may not be responsible for the editing but the video excerpt follows the disturbing trend of deleting unsavory parts of the biblical text. Pay particular attention to the portion of video depicting the story of Jesus and the woman at the well (John 4). Watch that part and see if you can spot which part of the dialogue between Jesus and the woman ended up on the "cutting room floor" . . .

The Briefing 05-22-15
55 minutes ago(Kora's POV)
Anuli and I weaved our way through the jungles of Piñata Island. We'd been at it for a while, fear driving us on. I didn't feel like we were getting anywhere which really bugged me. I just wanted to go to the village and not feel like a hunted rabbit.
"Hey, look at that." Anuli said, slowing down.
I came to a stop next to him and looked too. Through the leaves, I could see light illuminating the edges of a large town. The light came from a fence that wound around the entire settlement. I walked forward a little. Upon closer inspection, the fence seemed to spark a little with blue light. I reached out a tentative hand to touch it.
"Kora, no!" Anuli hissed. "Don't touch it! It's electric!"
I quickly withdrew my hand and went back to join him. "How can you tell?"
"Can't you hear that noise?" He asked.
I wasn't one to stop and smell the flowers, so to speak. I certainly wasn't going to pay attention to any little noise. Sighing inwardly, I listened. Anuli was right. There was a small electric humming sound coming off the fence.
"Great," I snorted impatiently. "Just what we need. Now how do we get inside?"
Anuli's eyes widened a little in surprise. "You still want to go?"
I looked at him incredulously. "Of course I do! They took Captain. I'm going to make sure we didn't lose him for nothing by getting behind that fence." A look of concern spread over my face. "But what about you, Anuli? Will you stay? Captain's gone; can you get home by yourself?"
"I'm not staying," Anuli said sullenly. "I can steer the boat by myself, I'll be fine."
"As long as the lights haven't found the boat yet…" I muttered to myself. My voice rose, "So how are we going to get past it?"
Anuli thought for a moment. "The electricity has to be generated from somewhere. I say we skirt the fence and find the source."
I smiled. "I like the way you think, Anuli. I got this side," I said, pointing to the right. "You go the other way and meet up in the middle."
Without waiting for a reply I dashed off around the right side of the fence then slowed to a jog once Anuli was out of earshot, there was no point wasting my energy on a full sprint. I know, that was totally unlike me, yes. But I wanted to get inside ASAP ant there was no point doing two laps. Technically, this is faster. I watched the fence as I moved, scanning it for anything that might be the source of the electricity. Come on, anytime now. The sun was beginning to rise on the horizon, turning the sky a light shade of purple which matched my clothes. I bit my lip. We'd better speed things up, I thought frantically. Whoever wants to keep people off the island sure wouldn't like the sight of two mainlanders messing with his fence.
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Fence post, wire, fence post, wire. Jeez this is getting old. I made a quick glance at the Village beyond the fence. The first thing I noticed was the back of a tall building that had a sign with milk and cookies on it. Odd for a prison-like island, I thought. I shook my head vigorously. Focus! Fence post, wire, fence post with little black box on it, wire, fence post. I skidded to a stop and smacked my forehead.
My first impulse was to head back to it and figure out how to switch the electricity off but I knew I had to meet up with Anuli. Running as fast as I could, I skirted the fence, making sure to stay to the shadows in case anyone was an early riser. Eventually, I spotted him in the distance and motioned him to follow me. Anuli caught my drift and soon we were both in front of the box again.
"Okay," Anuli began quietly, flipping open the lid of the black box. "There are a lot of switches here and I'm no electrician, unless you…?" I shook my head. "Okay, neither of us are electricians but I think once we stop hearing the humming, it means we did it." He looked at the fence. "Cutting the power isn't going to magically get you behind that fence though. It's got barbed wire at the top so that rules out climbing."
I looked around, searching for anything that could help. My eyes came to rest on a sturdy oak tree. The branches closest to the fence had been cut so the people inside couldn't use it to escape. However, it was long and high enough for someone on this side to use if they jumped far enough.
"That branch might be useful." I said, pointing to it.
Anuli nodded. "It's worth a shot."
I started to climb the oak tree. It had plenty of footholds making my life a whole lot easier. Carefully, I shimmied along the branch closest to the fence.
"Come on, Anuli, give it a whirl!" I said eagerly.
He frowned at the box and flicked a switch. The humming of the fence got louder. Startled, Anuli flicked the switch again and the usual drone returned. He chose another switch. This time the droning ceased. Right on, Anuli! I gave him a thumbs-up and he looked back uncertainly. He seemed to still be unsure the electricity stopped.
Taking a deep breath, I steadied myself into a sitting position. To be honest, I was freaking out. If I didn't go far enough, I'd skewer myself on the wire. If I was lucky, I'd clear the entire fence completely. What if I just jumped into the fence and all Anuli did was drown out the noise? I'd be fried! I couldn't show fear in front of Anuli. He'd worked so hard to get me here and everything depended on this moment. Sucking up my courage, I jumped.
Twang!
My eyes were screwed shut. It was getting hard to breathe. I didn't want to see what happened. But I had to. I peeked out and saw with surprise I was suspended in the air. Turning my neck, I realised what occurred. I was on the right side of the fence alright, but the top of my shirt was caught by the barbed wire creating pressure on my neck.
"Kora! Are you alright?!" Anuli called as quietly as he could.
"Can't… Breathe!" I gasped.
Instinctively, I twisted my arm and grabbed hold of the fence. No electrocution. I'm alive! But maybe not for long. My lungs were shrivelling. Creating momentum, I swirled around and got a good grip with both hands on the fence. Climbing higher and higher I tried to get close enough to unlatch my shirt from the grasp of the fence. My eyes began to close, I felt weaker and weaker. No, it can't end here. I'm so close…! I reached out to unhook it. Almost… There…
Cling-ing-ing…
I gave a huge intake of air and watched as the barbed wire flicked back and forth, free of its previous strain. After a few breaths, I gave Anuli a weak smile. He seemed relieved. Looking down, I judged it wouldn't hurt to drop from here. So I did. Dust billowed into the air around my feet from the impact. Anuli turned the electricity back on. The fence hummed in its usual taunting way.
"We can't have anyone knowing the power stopped," Anuli explained. "Now it's like you were here the whole time."
I nodded. "Thanks Anuli. For everything."
He smiled. "Good luck, Kora, doing whatever it is you're doing. Just promise me one thing. If you see Captain, tell him I'm sorry for leaving him behind and help him get out of this place."
"I will." I promised.
Suddenly, search lights began to hone in on the Village. A small siren went off. I gasped. Maybe someone noticed the power went out! I looked worriedly at Anuli.
"Go!" He told me. "I'll be fine." He turned and ran into the trees.Female, 29 years old

It took years for Google to figure out how to crank up its money-making machine.
But that hasn’t kept the same question from dogging popular social networking site Facebook for years: When would it get its moolah mojo?
Just Tuesday Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz, on CNBC to celebrate her company’s 15th birthday, took a dig at Facebook: “What’s their revenue?”
Well, the very able Eric Eldon has done some educated reporting and the numbers are looking good for the privately held company.
He estimates that Facebook revenue rose as high as $700 million in 2009 and is on track to hit $1.1 billion in 2010. Facebook did not comment on the estimates.
“The company has been roughly doubling its revenues every year,” Eldon wrote. “We expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future, making Facebook a multi-billion dollar company within the next few years.”
How is Facebook making money? A combination of brand and self-serve advertising, the sale of virtual goods and other stuff. It also has its own virtual currency now, which could spread beyond Facebook.
“Facebook,” Eldon said, “is innovating in multiple areas, in ways that we believe will work for the long-term.”

Congratulations on your ribbons. Don't spend the winnings all aat one time!
hehe love "homage to hedwig" and of course the autumn one. Just remembered I didn't post you that thing...doh! will do asap. How's the shoulder doing now?
What a great way to spend your last day together...
Congrats on all those shiney blue ribbons, too!
That looks pretty good to me! Hearty Congratulations!
Looks like a fun day!
Congratulations, Deb! Hard to believe that you got $30 and the cabbage got $2000!
Your quilts are worth way more than the $2,000 cabbage. Congratulations. I got a kick out of the mention of the reindeer sausage.
Wow, looky all them shiny blue ribbons! Woohoo, girl!
Makes me want to run down to the Colorado State Fair in Pueblo, where the temp is much higher, and I doubt there will be reindeer anything. Good to see all those blue ribbons. Not surprised that the Nasties won big time, and I love Hedwig, again. What is the appeal of giant sized veggies? The small ones taste much better! $2000?!!!!!
I agree with Fran, the tiny veggies are way better than the giant ones. Love your little quilts too!
Congratulations Deb. It sounds as though you had a wonderful time.
Congratulations on the 4 ribbons. Looks like a fun day.
congrats on the ribbons - you do fabulous work! looks like you had a fun time. My kids are thinking about heading to the fair on Saturday - if still running - or maybe going on a hike!
WOW! 4 blue ribbons! that's great! Love the dress too--holey moley!Phyllis E. “Philly” Dake, philanthropist and matriarch of Stewart’s Shops, has died, Stewart’s announced Wednesday. She died at her home in Saratoga Springs, the company said. Philly was 85.
Philly served as executive vice president of what is now Stewart’s Shops Corp. and spent 50 years with the company. She also was known for her philanthropy, supporting the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, the Saratoga Hospital, WMHT, Albany Medical Center and a number of other organizations.
She was married to the late Charles S. Dake, and both were graduates of Cornell University. She was the sister-in-law of Bill Dake, current Stewart’s Shops chairman and the aunt of Gary Dake, president of the company.
Philly Dake introduced the Make Your Own Sundae concept at Stewart’s in 1947. Later, customers would also make their coffee, deli dogs and morning toast. The popular ice cream variety Philly Vanilla was named in her honor.
Dake had long lived with the complications of Huntington’s Disease, the company said in its online obituary.Legacy.
Shrinking city theorists say the problem with the legacy city is that people leave. But urban powerhouses such as New York lose more people in a day than the Clevelands.
Over a decade ago Michael Levin, a professor at the City College of New York wrote a very brave and insightful book, "Why Race Matters." For those who are pondering the negative fate of the once great cities in the middle of the United States, reading this book will clear up much of this intellectual confusion and the needless frustration that goes along with it. I was raised in downtown Cleveland during the late 1940s through the early 1960s. The huge influx of minority people into the city doomed it to become what it is today. Everyone fled. And I mean EVERYONE! Most sought safety in the suburbs. The brightest left the State and went West to the Golden State and beyond.
My sister still lives there, but far out in the country, outside of Cuyahoga County and all its ills. The folks living away from the City of Cleveland have a very nice life. Their demographics are 90%, plus white. Crime is low and services are good. It is the same for all these cities. For any thinking person, given the current situation in the city center, investing there is a good way to have a poor return on capital, if any return at all. Destroying capital is bad for society and should be discouraged, no matter what the cause.
The solution INMO is to end racial and gender preferences, privatize policing, get rid of HUD and reform if not eliminate the current tax system.
Anthony Downs, in an appendix to "New Visions for Metropolitan America" (1994) finds the correlation to be with children born out of wedlock, not "race" per se. Of course some races have a lot more children born out of wedlock.
But children born into minority "mom and pop" families have little difference in life outcomes to children born into white majority "mom and pop" families.
Charles Murray has been tracking this for decades: he predicts a "coming white underclass" as the percentage of children born to white solo mothers continues to increase. Of course there is plenty of white trash in the UK, it is famous for it. It tends to be Asian immigrants who work their way up and out of the blighted areas as soon as they can. Of course there are other immigrants also associated with social immobility, but I recall some impressive statistics about the rate of achievement among immigrant Hindus and Sikhs and Buddhists and East Asians. Obviously culture matters.
I agree. Living in the SF Bay Area, I can attest to the presence of very productive, focused minorities from Asia, and to a lesser extent Latin America. Charles Murray's assertions about family structure are revealing too. However, the attraction of certain groups to the poisonous lifestyle of welfare enabled indolence and corruption is in itself telling of certain differences that cannot in my opinion be laid entirely at the doorstep of culture. We have a chicken or the egg question here. However, Arthur Jenson answered most of these questions in his book, "The g Factor."
The Social Engineering type would like to imagine a world populated with more homogeneous material than actually exists. It is for this reason that the Austrian Epistemology more accurately reflects the foundation of economy than the Positivist schools, who choose the path of will and violation (Affirmative Action) versus ones of non violation and acceptance. I think the declining prospects of the American economy, founded on militarism and central bank money printing, will finally put this question to rest. When the inefficiencies of our model of society finally cause the reality moment to occur, we will see the bankrupt vision of humanity we have been living under to be the fraud that it is.
How can we have a neighborhood that is 54% white, 20% Hispanic and 36% black? It doesn't add up.
Cleveland and the county in which it sits, Cuyahoga, have a problem with taxing residents and consumers to pay for poor people and rich people, with very little return back on that investment. Only people in Greater Cleveland would think that creating an entire new tax on smokers to fund a new arts council that serves basically a niche market is a "progressive" idea. It's not.
The housing stock in Cleveland is old. The streets are crumbling and the recently elected mayor thinks giving Jimmy Haslem, the new Browns owner, millions for fancy additions to the stadium is a good investment. The city has $4 million to start the year. The Browns can't even get a .50 season.
Cleveland has been searching for a new identity for decades. Unfortunately the same incestuous relationships that make the most off the taxpayers don't really like anyone's new ideas crashing their party. Cleveland ranks just behind Detroit for the 2nd highest poverty rate in the country. Want to tell us how 30% pulling a wagon filled with the other 70% is a desirable zip code?.
The City's safety forces have been a joke. Lacking discipline and any urgency to respond to calls from citizens, it has been dragging down the city for decades. Residents are hard-put to understand why mayor after mayor can't seem to get the department straightened out!
Cleveland forgets where it came from and who it really is. It's a working-class city not a NYC wannabe. It should be a middle-class enclave due to it's affordable housing and other amenities. But the schools are not getting the job done no matter how much tax money is thrown at them.
Cleveland suffers from flight sickness, people leaving for better opportunities, lower taxes, and better standards of living. It's too bad. To turn cities like Cleveland around you have to eliminate that part of the welfare policy that treats the pregnancies of unwed, young single women like disabilities deserving of cradle-to-the-grave entitlements. The social costs of this dysfunctional program have over-whelmed the reason for it's existence. The children born to such self-imposed poverty don't stand much of a chance.
There's a big part of the problem. Now, ask a Democrat to fix this.
"........"
I think something like "Municipal Utility Districts" (MUDs) that are usually used for new greenfields developments, should be allowed to be carved out of failed large municipalities just as soon as a private investor who is taking the risk of bringing about urban restoration, has acquired sufficient blighted property.
We need "localism", and not just that, but COMPETITIVE localism including continual new entries to the competition. The suburbs to which flight has occurred are part of the great American efficiency which makes it a more productive economy than its rivals. The competitive suburb is not the problem, it points the way to theHSE Manager

According to researchers at Fox Chase Cancer Center, insurance coverage may not only affect a patient's access to health care, but also the quality of care they receive. Research findings, presented today at the American Urological Association's Annual Meeting, may have implications for a national debate on healthcare reform.
"We discovered a discrepancy in the type of surgical treatment patients are offered based on their health insurance," says Robert G. Uzzo, MD, chairman of the department of surgery at Fox Chase and the study's lead author. His research evaluated differences in surgical treatment for kidney cancer based on a patient's health insurance carrier. The study explored this question in one specific area of medicine, but the results may have implications for other areas of medicine as well.
The study results showed that kidney cancer patients with Medicare as their primary payer were more likely to have their kidney surgically removed entirely (radical nephrectomy) whereas those with private insurance were offered surgery to preserve organ function (partial nephrectomy).
"The notion that the kind of insurance you have can affect the quality of the care you receive has implications for the ongoing discussion about national health care reform. This research raises important questions for the government to consider," adds Uzzo. "As our national leaders begin to discuss health care reform, it will be important to keep in mind that who pays for the care can affect the quality of care received."
Kidney cancer is commonly treated by surgically removing the entire organ, but this is often unnecessary. Due to its technical demands, however, kidney-sparing surgery remains widely underutilized except at high-volume academic centers, where surgeons are experienced not only in resection of very complex kidney tumors but also in minimally-invasive techniques to treat patients with kidney cancer.

All of this, even though they knew our insurance coverage would be turned back up within a week or two and everything would be back paid.

If I could write a letter to my teenage self I'd probably say something like: "You ain't gonna believe what will become of you." I recently went back to my home town of Cape Town with a production of The Tempest, and it was the longest time I'd spent there since I left 41 years ago. It was a kind of vindication - I felt like a Martian when I was growing up. I was a gay nerd in a homophobic, racist, misogynist, rugger-mad society; earmarked for absolute death. Cape Town's now one of the gay capitals of the world. It's come a long way, too.
Don't take cocaine. I was addicted for a long time, and it really screws you up. Chemically
it cuts out your self-critical faculties, and that's a lovely feeling, and very dangerous. I did more than my fair share of thinking I was fantastically interesting at parties.
At the beginning of my adult life I was ashamed of all the aspects of my identity: gay, Jewish, white South African. It was like I'd knocked three closets into one.
I'm a complete technophobe. I can't even email. But why should we be contactable every second? Mobile phones have precipitated the collapse of etiquette - they go off in the theatre; they force people into parroting the bleeding obvious: "The train is pulling into King's Cross."
I got offered the wrong knighthood at first. It was an honorary one, because they didn't know I'd become a British citizen. I told my mum I was knighted, unknighted, then knighted again, all in the space of a few days. In the end she said: "Are you sure? Because I just can't take any more of this." My mother was able to come over to the Palace before she started succumbing to Alzheimer's, so that was very special. It's of no practical use - it doesn't get me to the front of the queue at the post office or anything. But it looks good on the stationery.
I believe deeply in therapy. There's no one in the world who wouldn't benefit from it.
It was Tom Stoppard who said: "Only in Britain could you insult someone by calling them too clever by half." I've been accused of dilettantism by maintaining my acting, writing and painting alongside each other, but if I was forced to choose only one? It would be painting.
I'm very emotional. I cry a lot - much more so as I get older. As much with joy as with sadness, I hasten to add. It's a healthy thing. My partner Greg is also a cry-baby, and we set each other off.
I'm a safari junkie. It's the elemental nature of the thing. I can be so overwhelmed by sights of natural wonder that I'm reduced to open-mouthed awe. We once had a lioness use our jeep as cover while she was stalking a wildebeest. I remember her turning round and looking straight at me. She couldn't have been more than 5ft away, and this was an open-sided jeep. I was much easier prey.
I can't cook. But I can heat up a Marks & Spencer ready meal to perfection. I'm also tone deaf. This was an added trauma in my youth, because the Jewish religion decrees that you sing your way into manhood at your bar mitzvah. So I guess I'm still waiting to cross that particular rubicon.
I've never lost a sense of otherness. I'll always be an outsider, I think. I don't actually know who the insiders are. I've never met completely normal people. We're incredibly complex mixtures of good and bad and weak and strong. That's good news for me, because I'll never be short of raw material to work on.Voters Do Care About the Deficit and Oppose ObamaCare

Dr. Garfield proposed in 1965 a metric to measure and compare impact of journals that in 1975 became Journal Citation Reports. In 2001, additional databases became available on the Web of Knowledge platform, including Derwent Innovations Index, ISI Proceedings, and BIOSIS. These databases and more have been integrated into the new Web of Science platform, including the Book Citation Index and Data Citation Index.Pub. Util. Code § 399.15(c) requires the Commission to adopt.
The April 30, 2004 comments show general consensus on certain broader issues, although some of the details remain ambiguous or in dispute. For purposes of discussion, MPR issues can be categorized as process-related, modeling-related, or gas forecasting-related.
With regard to process, the Commission must specify how and when the MPRs will be disclosed. CEERT, PG&E, SCE, SDG&E, TURN, and CalWEA/CBEA provided recommendations on some or all of these issues.
With regard to modeling, eight of the ten commenting parties (CalWEA/CBEA, CEERT, GPI, PG&E, SCE, SDG&E, and TURN) agree that a cash flow modeling approach should be used to calculate the baseload and peaking MPRs. Six of these eight parties agree on using the SCE cash flow model as recommended by the MPR workshop Modeling Subgroup, whereas CalWEA and CBEA recommend using the TURN model.
With regard to gas forecasting, CalWEA, CEERT, PG&E, SDG&E, and TURN generally agree that some combination of New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) data and forecasts of natural gas fundamentals should be utilized. SCE, however, proposed using a "cost of carry" methodology in place of fundamentals-based forecasts. CalWEA, PG&E, SDG&E, and TURN agree on PG&E's hedging cost proposal, although CalWEA would apply the hedging costs to all twenty years whereas the other three parties would only apply it to the non-NYMEX years.
A. Defining the MPR
D.03-06-071 adopted "a proxy plant methodology for calculating the MPR, using a combined cycle proxy plant for the baseload product and a combustion turbine proxy plant for the peaking product" (OP 6). The decision also determined that the "market price referent will be calculated as an all-in cost, with an exception for as-available capacity" (OP 10). Eight of the ten commenting parties (CalWEA/CBEA, CEERT, GPI, PG&E, SCE, SDG&E, and TURN) agree that a cash flow modeling approach should be used to calculate the baseload and peaking MPRs. These same parties also agree that the MPR represents the levelized price associated with the appropriate referent generation technology, as described here. Each separate MPR represents the levelized price at which the proxy power plant revenues exactly equal the expected proxy power plant costs on a net-present value (NPV) basis.9 For example, in the SCE model, the fixed and variable components of the MPR are calculated separately and summed to produce an all-in MPR price that reflects the proxy plant NPV on a levelized basis.10
With the cash flow model, the fixed component of the MPR is calculated iteratively (using the MS-Excel goal seek function), such that the expected revenues from the fixed component of the MPR exactly equal the expected fixed costs on a net-present value (NPV) basis. The total revenues from the fixed component are equal to the total annual production of the proxy power plant (e.g., 8 million kWh) times the fixed component of the MPR (e.g., 1.08 cents/kWh). These fixed component revenues will offset all fixed costs including Insurance, Property Taxes, Fixed O&M, Debt Cost (the cost of paying off the loan on the power plant), Income Taxes, and the cost of a Rate of Return on the down payment made on the power plant (the equity investment).
The variable component of the MPR is also calculated iteratively (using the MS-Excel goal seek function), such that the expected revenues from the variable component of the MPR exactly equal the expected variable costs on an NPV basis. The total revenues from the variable component of the MPR are equal to the total annual production of the proxy power plant (e.g., 8 million kWh) times the variable component of the MPR (e.g., 4.29 cents/kWh). These variable component revenues will offset all variable costs, including Variable O&M and the Cost of the Natural Gas to fuel the plant (Variable Component Revenues less Variable Component Costs).
1. Six All-In MPRs Must Be Calculated
Section 399.14(a)(4) states that utility procurement plans shall include "direction to respondent bidders to offer prices for 10-, 15-, and 20-year contract terms." D.03-06-071 also stated "utilities should seek bids for 10, 15, and 20-year products" (p. 57). Therefore, one MPR must be calculated for a baseload product and another MPR for a peaking product. These two MPRs must be adjusted for contract terms of 10, 15, and 20 years. Thus, six all-in MPRs must be calculated.
In the April 30, 2004 comments, seven of the ten commenting parties (CalWEA/CBEA, CEERT, GPI, SCE, SDG&E, and TURN) respectively agreed with this approach. Specifically, these seven parties agreed with workshop consensus recommendation to use a cash flow model to calculate three baseload and three peaking MPRs. While PG&E generally agrees with this approach, PG&E contends that utility specific MPRs should be calculated (p. 4). Thus, PG&E would have us calculate six MPRs for each utility. In addition to the fact that we do not have a sufficient record from which to prepare utility-specific MPRs, PG&E's proposal is inconsistent with D.03-06-071, which stated that we would generally use statewide numbers. (Id., p. 21.).
2. Utilities are not Required to Pay More Than the MPR
Pub. Util. Code § 399.15(a)(1) states that "an electric corporation shall not be required to enter into long-term contracts with eligible renewable energy resources that exceed the market prices established pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section." Thus, the MPR for a given power product and contract term establishes a dividing-line above which the utility is not obligated to pay, but for which a bidder may apply to the CEC for Supplemental Energy Payment (SEP) funding. Although this is clearly understood, the utilities have inquired as to their flexibility in structuring actual contract payments in a way that might result in certain payments in certain time periods actually exceeding the MPR. For example, a utility may want lower prices in the earlier years and higher prices in later years, or the opposite. For example, would it be acceptable if the MPR were 5.5 cents/kWh and the contract price for years 1 - 10 is 3.0 cents/kWh and 6.5 cents/kWh in years 11-20?
As an initial matter, we note that the one purpose of the MPR is to establish a standard of per se reasonableness applicable to RPS contracts. Approved contracts at or below an MPR would receive this reasonableness designation, which may be a benefit to the utility. However, the language of § 399.15(a)(1) is clear that the utility may choose to propose RPS contracts at supra-MPR prices. The Commission would carefully consider the merits of such contracts, bearing in mind the state's aggressive goals for renewable energy development and the limited amount of SEP funds presently available. While these supra-MPR contracts would not be considered per se reasonable, we encourage the utilities to propose all renewable contracts that provide ratepayer and environmental benefit.
We note, however, that the least-cost imperative is essential, and the utilities should not pass over cost-effective resources as a result of this direction, but rather may consider themselves encouraged to propose renewable contracts in excess of their RPS targets.
We interpret the utilities' question in light of the per se reasonableness standard. In response, we reiterate here that each MPR represents the levelized price at which the proxy power plant revenues exactly equal the expected proxy power plant costs on an NPV basis at an assumed discount rate. Thus, if the NPV of an alternatively structured contract results in lower prices in certain years and higher prices in other years, relative to the MPR, the yardstick with which to judge the per se reasonableness of the proposal would be to compute the NPV of that bid at an appropriate discount rate. If the NPV of the bid is less than or equal to the MPR, it will be considered per se reasonable.
B. Modeling the MPR
1. MPR Modeling Issues
With regard to modeling, eight of the ten commenting parties (CalWEA/CBEA, CEERT, GPI, PG&E, SCE, SDG&E, and TURN) agree that a cash flow simulation modeling approach should be used to calculate the baseload and peaking MPRs, as opposed to the closed form method that was presented in the MPR white paper. Parties agree that the SCE model, the TURN/SDGE model, and the CEC's Comparative Cost of Generation model (and associated report11) are all generally acceptable implementations of a cash flow simulation analysis. However, six of these eight parties agree on using the SCE cash flow model as recommended by the MPR workshop Modeling Subgroup, whereas CalWEA/CBEA recommends using the TURN model. Parties agree that the SCE model has one of the most transparent structures, and it requires the fewest modifications. In addition, parties agree that the same methodology and model should be used to calculate both the baseload MPRs and the peaking MPRs.12 We accept this recommendation, and adopt the use of the SCE MPR model.
In its April 30, 2004 comments, SCE provides an overview of the SCE MPR model structure and function (pp. 4-5). The model has certain fixed and variable components; for example, federal and state depreciation schedules and federal and state tax rates are fixed components in the model. A description of the model and a list of the variable components are attached to this decision (see "Appendix A: Description of SCE MPR Model").
The SCE comments further state that "in order to avoid a plethora of input cost categories" in the SCE MPR model, the parties agreed that most cost components should be assigned within the following variables in order to prevent "duplication or omission." The model contains the following five cost categories (aside from Capital Cost): Fixed O&M, Variable O&M, Fuel Cost, Insurance, and Property Tax. See Appendix A for a list of costs included under each of these categories.
2. Capital Recovery Term
CalWEA/CBEA, PG&E, SCE, SDG&E, and TURN recommend that the calculation of all MPRs should be based on a capital recovery period for both debt and equity of at least 20 years, regardless of the actual contract term. On the other hand, CEERT recommends that winning renewable bidders should be allowed to, for example, recover their entire capital cost over a 10- or 15-year contract, even though a renewable power plant may have a useful life of 20 years or more. This issue represents a significant policy determination that will ultimately affect the actual value of the resulting MPRs, but one that is relatively easy to implement from a modeling standpoint. The key consideration here is the residual value of the proxy plant.
PG&E and SCE contend that it is more appropriate to assume a 20-year useful life for a proxy power plant (with a residual value of zero after 20 years).13 TURN/SDG&E support this approach as well.14 The bidder benefits from this approach in that there will very likely be a positive residual value after 20 years.15
In contrast, CEERT contends that that capital recovery should occur over the contract term, even if it is only 10 or 15 years. CalWEA/CBEA take a similar position. CEERT argues that (1) the average maturity of project loans is generally less than the length of the contract, (2) if the contract term is less than the project life (e.g., a 10-year contract), the owner is taking on the risk that revenues during years 11 to 20 will be sufficient to achieve the target equity return, and (3) this increased risk necessitates a higher target return in order to attract investment in the project.
CEERT's arguments are not persuasive, and it provides no real supporting evidence for its contentions. Potentially, a guaranteed capital recovery over 10 years might serve to increase risk. If this approach were adopted, it could conceivably lead to a disproportionate number of 10-year bids, which would be inconsistent with our goal of a more balanced and diversified power contract portfolio. Further, CEERT does not address the central issue of residual value, which was raised in pre-workshop comments. There is no good reason to believe bidders should assume a residual value of zero at the expiration of a contract shorter than 20 years. Therefore, for modeling purposes, we conclude that capital recovery should occur over 20 years, regardless of the contract term.
3. Capital Structure
The question of how a proxy power plant should be financed is an open issue. From a modeling standpoint, a key question is what ratio of debt to equity (capital structure) should be used, i.e., how much of the total capital cost of the project should be financed and how much should be paid upfront in the form of a down payment (equity in the project).
The parties present widely disparate numbers, in large part because the have cast this issue in terms of whether the proxy plant should be modeled as typical utility-owned asset or as an independent power producer. For example, CalWEA/CBEA note that the debt/equity ratio for PG&E and SCE is 52/48, while SDG&E is 51/49 (p. 9). CalWEA/CBEA suggests that the Commission might want to consider using an average of these numbers and the CEC Cost of Generation model, which assumes a ratio of 61/39 (resulting in something like a ratio of 56/34). CEERT essentially argues for the utility asset approach when it contends that the debt percentage should be less than what is used in the CEC Cost of Generation model. The TURN model (submitted with the April 9, 2004 TURN/SDG&E Pre-Workshop Comments) uses a 70/30 ratio. PG&E recommends a 55/45 ratio, whereas SCE proposes an 80/20 ratio of debt to equity. Parties did not, however, generally provide an abundance of supporting evidence or rationale for these recommendations.
Our goal is to construct an estimate of the long-term market price of electricity, and in this case that is through the use of a cash flow simulation analysis of a proxy power plant. A relevant question on this issue is, if such plant were constructed under current market conditions, how much leverage would be appropriate for a power plant?
We believe that the CEC model provides the most reasonable (and non-partisan) starting point. The CEC model uses an independent power producer, and given the current state of the market, that appears to be a more reasonable assumption than a utility-owned facility. Given the general context we are working in (and also consistent with our determination in the previous section), we will assume that the plant has a 20-year contract with a creditworthy utility.
It would not be appropriate to use a ratio less than that used in the CEC Cost of Generation Report, given that the report was "intended to provide a basic understanding [of] some of the fundamental attributes that are generally considered when evaluating the cost of building and operating different electricity generation technology resources" (p. 1).16 Furthermore, the CEC Cost of Generation Report states: "debt financing costs were based on the expected terms for a merchant-financed project with a 12-year loan and a BBB debt rating in November 2001." (Id., p. 9.) Under current market conditions, a proxy power plant having a 20-year contract with a creditworthy utility would be able to utilize more leverage and thus attain a higher debt/equity ratio. From the record before us, the model that appears to most closely correspond to these realities is the TURN proposal. Accordingly, we will use a 70/30 debt/equity ratio for MPR modeling purposes. Nonetheless, we recognize that California's power purchase market has changed since November 2001. Independent power producers can now undertake development based upon a 20-year contract with a creditworthy utility purchaser. The proxy power plant's current cost of capital, rather than the November 2001 assumptions, will be used to calculate the MPR.
4. Selection of Modeling Inputs
As previously discussed, there is general consensus among the parties on the appropriate categorization and classification of cost inputs necessary to run a cash flow simulation of a proxy power plant over a 20-year period. However, there is not broad consensus on (1) general decision criteria upon which to select actual input values, or (2) acceptable data sources for these values.
There is a spectrum of opinion regarding the most appropriate general decision criteria to use in selecting actual input values. On one end, CalWEA/CBEA contends that the Commission should adopt capital cost assumptions that are "broadly representative of plants actually being developed and built in California" (p. 7). At the other end, SCE argues that: "input assumptions should be selected so as to produce the lowest reasonable MPR to best reflect the values that would result from a utility solicitation" (p. 8). PG&E states that: "input values should be reliable and unbiased" (p. 4).
With regard to acceptable data sources for input values, PG&E recommends the use of "bond financing prospectuses, property tax records, and mandatory filings with regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission" (p. 4). In addition, "PG&E supports the CPUC retaining an independent third-party consultant such as an investment bank to survey the market and compile capital and operating cost input assumptions from such sources of information."17 SCE recommended that the Commission "look to experts in the capital finance and project development field, who can provide current market data, understand current market trends and can knowledgeably extrapolate beyond current data," at the time the MPRs are calculated. SCE suggests, with respect to technology-specific data (O&M costs and heat rate) that the Commission obtain empirical data from major Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs) like General Electric Company (GE) and Siemens (pp. 7-8). In addition, most every party put forward recommended input values or ranges.
On the issue of specific modeling inputs, we must carefully assess the recommendations put forward to ensure that these values and ranges are supported not only by judgment, but also grounded in evidence and supported by a clear rationale. Numbers put forward alone without significant basis will be weighed accordingly in our decision-making. Because we are only required to adopt a specific MPR methodology at this time, and because we must balance the tradeoffs between transparency and competitiveness, we will not rule on specific inputs at this time, aside from our determination set forth in the capital structure section of this decision.
However, with regard to general decision criteria with which to select actual input values, we determine here that it is appropriate for us to use a consistent set of input assumptions that would account for certain cost tradeoffs. For example, plants with higher capital costs may be expected to have lower heat rates, and plants with higher variable O&M expenditures may have less heat rate degradation over time.
5. Peaker Proxy Plant
For purposes of the MPR, we define a peaker power plant as a Combustion Turbine (CT) generator with a relatively low capacity factor that delivers a majority of its power during on-peak, daylight hours. Parties generally agree that the same methodology and model should be used to calculate the baseload and peaking MPRs. However, the gas price forecast data will be in accordance with the PG&E proposal, as discussed in the gas forecasting section of this decision. Specifically, PG&E recommends that peaking MPR fuel cost be set at 95.8% of annual average prices on a nominal basis to reflect the average reduction in mid-summer gas prices (June through September).
Certain inputs to the peaking MPR model, however, will be different, such as the capacity factor, heat rate and capital cost appropriate for a CT facility. Bearing these distinctions regarding certain inputs in mind, we agree that the basic design of the MPR model should be the same, as should be the gas forecasts utilized for both calculations.
C. MPR Gas Forecasting Issues
Section 399.15(c)(1) requires the Commission to determine the "long-term market price of electricity for fixed price contracts" over certain terms. There is consensus among the parties that there is no transparent, liquid market for natural gas forward products for 10, 15 or 20-year terms, which is necessary in order to fuel a proxy power plant producing fixed-priced electricity over these time periods. For purposes of discussion, we will address a gas price methodology for years 1 through 6, and another methodology for years 7 through 20. We will, however, first specify the source and composition of these gas prices.
1. Forecast at the Proxy Power Plant Burnertip
CalWEA/CBEA, PG&E, SCE, TURN and SDG&E agree that the NYMEX data should be basis adjusted (positive or negative) to California, plus the SoCal/PG&E average distribution rate (with an appropriate escalation). CalWEA/CBEA and PG&E also recommend adding a statewide average franchise fee surcharge. Generally, no party supports adjustments for imbalance and storage costs, or the use of a separate peaking price based on observed differences in summer month prices, as considered during the workshops. PG&E recommends that peaking MPR fuel cost be set at 95.8% of annual average prices on a nominal basis to reflect the average reduction in mid-summer gas prices (June through September).
We agree that gas prices should be estimated at the proxy power plant burnertip. This would include a basis adjustment to the California border (e.g., the average of the SoCal border and the PG&E Citygate delivery points), along with charges for intrastate transportation, shrinkage (if applicable), distribution, municipal franchise fee, and any hedging costs that may be appropriate. In addition, the gas price forecast data should be the same for both the baseload and peaking MPRs.
2. Gas Forecasting -- Years 1 through 6
There is consensus among the parties that NYMEX futures contracts are the best representations of forward market prices for natural gas; however, there was not. CEERT, TURN, and SDG&E all expressed concern that the contracts in years 4 through 6 are, in some cases, too lightly traded or not traded at all.18, we do not have on our record a basis for determining the suitability of the full six years of available NYMEX futures prices. Therefore, we will direct staff to study the NYMEX data in advance of the preparation of the MPRs for this year, and to determine whether the full six years, or some subset thereof, is appropriate. Regardless of whether we use NYMEX data for the first two, three, or six years, there remains a question as to the granularity of that data (i.e., whether we should use a daily, weekly, or monthly average of the NYMEX data). PG&E recommends using the most recent NYMEX 22-trading day average. TURN and SDG&E contend that a NYMEX 60-trading day average should be used. CEERT suggests, "a longer averaging period of perhaps six months should be used" (CEERT, p. 13). PG&E notes that a 22-trading day historical average of closing prices for each NYMEX contract will avoid the possibility of a short-term spike or dip in futures prices to skew a 10- or 20-year MPR price (PG&E, p. 22). While PG&E has a valid point, we believe that a longer time period would in fact be more useful in smoothing statistical anomalies in the forecast price. Therefore, for purposes of establishing the gas price forecast for years 1 through 6, we will use a NYMEX 60-trading day average.
3. Gas Forecasting -- Years 7 through 20
CalWEA/CBEA and PG&E recommend that the Commission use natural gas fundamentals forecasts produced by CERA, PIRA, and Global Insight19 to forecast prices for years 7 through 20. In addition, CalWEA/CBEA noted that the public sector forecasts produced by the CEC and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) could also be consulted, but only in the event that those forecasts are no more than six months old. TURN recommends using an average of these private and public sector forecasts. SDG&E supports TURN's April 30, 2004 comments on gas pricing issues (SDG&E Comments, p. 4). CEERT generally recommends the same approach as TURN. In contrast, SCE contends that such natural gas fundamentals forecasts should not be used at all, and instead recommends the use of a cost of carry model to calculate expected gas prices for years 7 through 20, "as an alternative to using price forecasts as a surrogate for forward prices." (SCE Comments, April 30, 2004, p. 11.)
a) Fundamentals Forecasts
As already mentioned, CalWEA/CBEA and PG&E recommend that the Commission use specific natural gas fundamentals forecasts produced by CERA, PIRA, and Global Insight to forecast prices for years 7 through 20. However, CalWEA/CBEA also recommended that the Commission carefully consider the details and underlying assumptions embedded in these forecasts as follows:
"CalWEA/CBEA urge the Commission to use judgement [sic] in the choice of which of the private forecasts to use. In addition to using only forecasts prepared in the last six months, the Commission should only use forecasts with an adequate number of data points for the forecast period. For example, in reviewing the exemplary forecast that PG&E presented in its April 9 comments, CalWEA/CBEA noted that the PIRA forecast appears to include just two data points in the 20-year forecast period. PG&E applied each of these data points as a constant price for a five-year period. CalWEA/CBEA submit that this is not enough data to use for a 20-year gas forecast. Furthermore, PG&E's forecast used only the relatively low EIA forecast for the final years of the forecast, because CERA and PIRA data did not extend to 2023. This caused PG&E's forecast to drop suddenly in the later years. The Commission should use an average of several forecasts only for the years that are covered by all of the forecasts. If one or more of the forecasts ends before the end of the forecast period, then the average value for the last year covered by all of the forecasts should be escalated to future years based on the escalation rates in the other forecasts. This will avoid discontinuities in the forecast caused simply by a lack of data from some forecasters." (CalWEA/CBEA April 30, 2004 Comments, p. 4.)
Alternatively, TURN recommends using a forecast of escalation rates, or the rate of change between time-series price data in the forecast. In practice, one would determine the average escalation rate of the private and the public sector forecasts, which could then be "applied to the last NYMEX price for the remaining years of the MPR to obtain a proxy `fixed' price over the entire period." (TURN Comments, p. 6.) SDG&E concurs with TURN. CEERT also recommends the same approach as TURN, although CEERT would use year 2 NYMEX data as a base year to compute a forecast for years 3 through 20.
TURN notes that by using an average of the available forecasts of escalation rates, as applied to the last year of NYMEX data, the Commission would avoid the task of "attempting to reconcile discontinuities between forward prices and forecasts - an exercise certain to consume substantial resources without resulting in any appreciable increase in real-world accuracy." (TURN, p. 6.)
Regardless of whether we opt to use a specific fundamentals forecasts, an average of the forecasts, or just the average annual escalation rate of one or more fundamentals forecasts, our MPR process will, to a certain degree, be dependent upon these outside forecasts to calculate MPRs for use in RPS power solicitations. To date, we have not received information on the record regarding the frequency with which these public and private sector forecasts are published and whether the respective publication cycles would impose constraints on the MPR process. For example, we might be faced with the possibility of either calculating MPRs using slightly stale natural gas forecast data (older than six months), or waiting until updated forecasts have been published.
b) Cost of Carry Model
On the other hand, SCE contends that "the cost of carry model provides a consistent way to estimate long-term fixed gas prices," (p. 11) without using public or private sector fundamentals forecasts. However, SCE did not submit an actual cost of carry model for our review and consideration. According to SCE's comments, "the cost of carry model is standard in the economic theory of derivatives markets." Specifically, according to SCE, "the cost of carry model relates the forward price of a commodity to (1) the spot price, and (2) the risk-free interest rate, (3) the cost of physically storing the commodity, and (4) the convenience yield on the commodity."
SCE provided few details regarding this approach. As we generally understand the cost of carry model, it would essentially compute a single, annual escalation rate to be applied to a base year gas price, where the base year gas price might, for example, be a 12-month average of the year-6 NYMEX prices (e.g., March 2009 through March 2010). Two advantages of the cost of carry model approach are (1) it would be transparent, and (2) it would be easy to update at any time. In contrast, public and private sector fundamentals forecasts may not be published on a regular basis, and such forecasts are admittedly subjective, given that many underlying assumptions reflect significant judgment calls about uncertain future events.
Consequently, we are open to examining a specific cost of carry model as a forecasting approach if and when one becomes available. However, although this approach has some potential advantages, the fact remains that we have not been presented with a specific model, nor have we had the opportunity to fully consider whether an economic theory of derivative markets would accurately capture the complex and evolving dynamics specific to natural gas transactions in California. The cost of carry model is consequently not a viable forecasting tool for use at this time in this proceeding. Therefore, we will instead use a fundamentals forecast approach, and more specifically, the forecast of escalation rates method advocated by CEERT, TURN, and SDG&E, as described above.20
4. Discontinuity Adjustment Between the NYMEX Forward Curve and Fundamentals Forecasts
In the event we use actual price series data from one or more fundamentals forecasts, there will likely be a discontinuity between the NYMEX data and the fundamentals forecast data, specifically between years 6 and 7. The degree of such a discontinuity may warrant different types of adjustments in order to blend or merge the two data sets together. However, there would be no discontinuity effect in the event we opt to use the forecast of escalation rates approach advocated by CEERT, TURN, and SDG&E.
If the CEERT, TURN and SDG&E approach is not taken, there are at least two ways to address a discontinuity between the NYMEX forward curve (years 1 through 6) and the fundamentals forecasts (years 7 through 20). We have the option of (1) making no adjustment, or (2) blending the two data sets. At this time, we opt to use the forecast of escalation rates approach advocated by CEERT, TURN, and SDG&E, applied to the appropriate year of NYMEX data, as determined by staff, in order to calculate the gas price component of the MPR for specific contract lengths. Under this approach no discontinuity between the two data sets is created.
5. Calculation of Hedging Costs
Hedging costs as applied here refer to the additional expense incurred to guarantee the purchase price of natural gas. With regard to these costs, CalWEA/CBEA, PG&E, TURN, and SDG&E support PG&E's proposed method of calculating a natural gas hedging cost premium. PG&E, TURN, and SDG&E would only apply this hedging cost premium to forecast years 7 through 20 (to the non-NYMEX gas prices), whereas CalWEA/CBEA supports applying a hedging cost premium to all 20 years. We conclude that a hedging cost premium representing the transaction cost of executing a NYMEX transaction is appropriate and should be applied to the prices taken from NYMEX
PG&E proposes to add one-half of the bid/ask spread as observed on the NYMEX floor for both natural gas futures and natural gas basis contracts, plus a collateral carrying cost (pp. 25-26 of PG&E post-workshop comments). PG&E states that their proposal is offered in lieu of the hedging value recommendations set forth by many of parties in their pre-workshop comments. PG&E notes that Ryan Wiser, a primary author of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study cited by a number of the parties (and who also participated in the MPR workshop), stated (as part of the MPR Gas Subgroup Report) that it was not appropriate nor was it his intention for parties to simply add the $0.45 to $0.80/MMBtu derived in the study to any forecast as a "hedging value."
PG&E computes the hedging value as follows:
PG&E's hedging proposal is a reasonable method of approximating the transaction costs of executing a NYMEX transaction, and we direct staff to apply it to the appropriate NYMEX data. This process will approximate the cost of a fixed-price gas purchase in the NYMEX period.
Applying an average of the escalation factors present in the gas forecasts for prices outside of the NYMEX period (adjusted via the PG&E proposal) has the effect of estimating a fixed price for gas for all the years of an RPS contract. Essentially, the gas price is hedged automatically by escalating a fixed price contract from the final year of the appropriate NYMEX transactional data. Adding a hedging premium on top of this estimate would therefore be redundant, just as adding a further hedging premium to the NYMEX data would be. Therefore, we will not adopt a separate hedging value for the gas forecasts for years 7 through 20, unless compelling evidence is subsequently presented that requires us to alter this determination. Escalating a fixed price contract does the job directly.9 The cash flow analysis assumes the proxy power plant will have a residual value of zero at the end of the 20-year term, which is a consensus assumption among the parties. While there will likely be some positive residual value at the end of the 20-year period, it would be difficult to estimate or agree upon. 10 In light of a number of party comments on the Draft Decision, we will clarify also what the MPR is not: it does not represent the cost, capacity or output profile of a specific type of renewable generation technology. As is clear in Pub.Util.Code § 399.15(c), the MPR is to represent the presumptive cost of electricity from a non-renewable energy source, which this Commission, in D.03-06-071, held to be a natural gas-fired baseload or peaker plant. Party comments regarding issues of Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) will therefore be considered in the pending Decision on least cost/best fit issues. 11 The CEC's August 2003 Comparative Cost of California Central Station Electricity Generation Technologies report,, is the most recent version of this report. Note that prior to the table of contents in the August 2003 version, there are three pages of errata to the earlier June 5, 2003 Final Staff Report of the same name. The August 2003 report was prepared in support of the CEC's Integrated Energy Policy Report (IEPR) Subsidiary Volume: Electricity And Natural Gas Assessment Report, see p.10 for citation,. 12 In practice, two identical copies of the SCE MPR model would be utilized, one to calculate the baseload MPRs, and another to calculate the peaking MPRs. The model structure and function would be identical between the two differing only by input values. 13 Twenty-year capital recovery: PG&E April 30, 2004 Comments, p. 10; and SCE Pre-Workshop MPR Comments, April 9, 2004, p. 6. 14 TURN/SDG&E Joint Comments on April 9, 2004, p. 7, attached to TURN's April 30 filing. 15 We observe that many Qualifying Facilities (QFs) have recently opted for contract extensions at the end of their 20-year contracts. 16 These costs do not reflect the total costs to consumers of adding these technologies to a resource portfolio. The technology costs in this report are not site specific. If a developer builds a specific power plant at a specific location, the cost of siting that plant at that specific location must be considered. Some projects may require radial transmission additions, fuel delivery, system upgrades or environmental mitigation expenses. (CEC Cost of Generation Report, August 2003, p. 1.) 17 PG&E further suggests that the "least emphasis or reliance should be placed on information from such sources as press releases, trade press articles, or other such self-published materials because there is no verification or fiduciary responsibility for the project proponent to provide a full and accurate accounting of project costs" (p. 4). 18 It is our understanding that for futures contracts that have not traded, NYMEX reports calculated prices rather than last trades as daily closing prices. 19 Private sector natural gas forecasts by Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), PIRA Energy Group, and Global Insight (formerly DRI), respectively. 20 The natural gas forecasts employed in this process will include the most recent or otherwise most appropriate forecast prepared by the CEC.

Magori, Mukare B.E:
A survey identifying the principal sources and type of effluents within four industries in Dar es Salaam Region,namely: Tanzania Breweries,Friendship Textile Mill, Tanganyika Packers and Tanzania has been conducted. The effluents have been characterised by flow measurement, sampling and analysis. Flow measurement and sampling were carried out simultaneously. The variations in wastewater quality parameters were noted. A study on the present industrial wastewater treatment and disposal in the reqion was also conducted. The results of the survey and analysis form the basis for decision making on the possible methods of minimizing water amounts and waste volume, wastewater treatment and disposal. The creation of a National Environmental Management Council to plan and implement measures for control industrial waste discharges and other environmental problems in Tanzania has been recommended. /Kir0913

I’m so proud of myself. I did this little thing with my scarf and it got a lot of compliments yesterday:
I’ll show you how to do it if you’re really interested. I honestly didn’t think much of it, but so many people (haha, three on the way to-and-from class) asked me how to do it and I gave them such a bad explanation that they walked away while I was still attempting to explain.
Anywayss…..
Yesterday’s workout:
Sucky run around Lake Merced. Why?
Started out way too fast apparently…
Up to 3.5 miles, I was going at about 7:59 or 8:00 pace. This was supposed to be an easy week of running, and I have failed that (or that’s at least what my body was screaming to me).
So I ended up walking 0.50 mile, then jogging for 0.50, walking 0.25 mile, jogging 0.50 mile… whatever felt right.
I covered 6 miles in about 54:30? (Someone stopped me to talk near the end and it super annoyed me because I was just trying to get to 6 miles and then go home).
Afterwards, I did about 10 minutes of Pilates for the hips and butt. That crap made my entire butt feel sore for the rest of the day (I’m talking from the top way down to the bottom… the deep muscles, side gluteus minimus and medius muscles… everything!).
Hopefully, strengthening my hips can help me with my running. Many people believe that hip or core weakness could lead to poor form, which leads to injury. We’ll see if things change with regular Pilates.

Made a crazy protein-heavy breakfast this morning:
Two eggs, one big banana, one scoop of protein powder, and about 1/3 cup of pumpkin.
The batter came out really nicely:
(Yeah, I didn’t even wash my pan after I made eggs yesterday, hehe).
Anyways, you’re supposed to have it on low heat and let all the bubbles come up. It usually says to be patient and “walk away”. Well, I don’t think you should actually walk away for too long like I did:
Yeah. Whoops. This poor thing got super owned. Also, I think I had the heat a little bit too high.
In any case, I was able to peel off the burnt layer and was only able to eat half of it before feeling FULL.
(Protein powder= 16 g of protein, two eggs= 14g of protein, and the pumpkin probably has negligible amounts… like 1g? That’s more than 30 g of protein).
BTW, the texture of this protein pancake is not really pancake-y, but I still think it’s good and mega-filling. Just don’t think you can go upstairs and do other things and then accidentally forget about the pancake…

This weekend, there is a movie night with the church folk, I’m volunteering at the Summit Rock Run in Sanborn Park (7 minutes from my house, whoop whoop!), Christmas skit practice, and possibly a longish run.
For today? I want to go to the gym to check out the new gym equipment (they supposedly got new stuff during this week). I hope they have a bunch of new treadmills!
Have a wonderful Friday!
You are looking amazing! Keep up the good work! (Yes, I wish I could tie a scarf like that)
Aww thanks so much for your kind words! I’ll do a little how-to for the scarf in one of my next posts ;)
Yeah, can’t wait. I can be fashion challenged on creating scarf looks, but I have many of them!
The scarf is very cute!
Thank you~
Yeah, I was getting bored of just wearing it in the usual ways.Posted on 08/18/2013 7:52:07 PM PDT by Red Steel.

The “good” news is that 2016 none of us will have any income...
Does anyone know how it will affect people eligible for VA hospital benefits?
The 2016 penalty is still way less than insurance.
Seems like this may be the straw that finally breaks the Washingtonians back.
What VA hospital benefits? BHO2 is abolishing veterans benefits, don’t ‘cha know!
Gee... I thought it was FREE.
Add that to the 2% Payroll tax.
Gee this is swell.
obamacare has a lot of things in it that we don’t want. We’re just now finding out the feds can go into your home anytime they want. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a clause in there somewhere giving obama the right to confiscate firearms. And another clause giving the feds the right to watch you through yout TV.
Stossel said your cell phone and laptops can be turned into listening devices. Can be? They already are. A few weeks back my wife and I were talking about buying something that we’ve never bought before. The next time I went online a pop up ad came up for that item. No kidding.
I’d like to know the same thing. And what about medicare? Both are considered insurance.
Of course once they get single payer EVERYONE will be going to the VA.
So do I get to "shop" for a Cadiolac Plan to make myself exempt?
That’s Cadillac.... smartphone meets fat fingaz.
Wait until people have to cut these checks.
Get out the popcorn.
We have the “conservative” judge John F’n Roberts to thank for this (among many other scoundrels, including traitors, socialists, do-gooders, unionists, librarians, public employees, universities, and school teachers)
As noted in the article, an estimated 80% of the estimated 30 million uninsured will be exempt from paying the fine (or tax or whatever).
You may interpret that to mean that a.) illegal aliens and minorities will get a free ride while b.) only the honest, poor, working class whites will be stuck with paying the fine.
Our premium for 2 people turning 60 this year would be over $1200/month, which is more than 20% of our income, so we don’t have to pay the penalty. We also no longer have access to affordable health insurance, thanks to ZeroCare driving up the premiums with mandatory pregnancy and pediatric coverage, both of which I neither want nor need at my age!
Medicare Part B insurees are exempt from the fine. They’re already covered by an “approved” policy.

The Congress could have put a lawsuit forth that said Roberts usurped them.
Roberts says if it is a tax it stands, but it did not pass congress as a tax.
Even Obama argued that is was not a tax.
Should this not go back through the congress upon Roberts ruling?
Where are all OUR lawyers? The place is stacked stinking thick with them.
Wait’ll the working folks with budget policies in the “expanded” states discover that they’re now in the Medicaid program. Popcorn futures should be an excellent investment.
Remember that those who are uninsured next year are more likely to be middle class struggling to pay for their healthcare after paying for the peoples next door first (taxes)
Doctors are now required to ask if there is a gun in the house, this is going to be the reason they choose to raid.. I mean "inspect" your home.

F****************
It’s amazing so much of the citizenry wanted this.
I don’t know, but it makes you eligible to be president of the United States.
Wwwelllll, let’s see...
You’re right it didn’t pass Congress as a tax and Obama did argue it wasn’t, HOWEVER, during Supreme Court brief submissions and arguments Obama switched tactics and had his DOJ lackey claim it WAS a tax.
That flew under the radar screen of the reporting.
I recall how LIVID Mark Levin was at Robert’s ruling along with the faithful 4 libs, but after he collected himself he said it WAS presented in regime briefs and I think oral argument at some point. At the time he thought it was such a crock it could never be accepted by the court and was SHOCKED and ANGERED that Robert’s used it as a fig leaf over the worst decision EVER.
As for Congress running this through again this time as a tax so it could be defeated as such - it’s like anything else. The House would do one thing, the Senate another and Obama sides with Reid. The Regime and Reid do whatever they must to continue down this road. That’s all they care about.
Short of a deFUNDING showdown a la Mike Lee’s approach, I don’t see any legislative hope.
On that point, we have the GOP E running amok using the Left’s lingo that we must not “shut down the government” like it was us that would be shutting it down, when truth is it would be Obama/Reid shutting it down in order to continue shoving this monster down our throats.
Generally, such devices’ microphone function(s) can be defeated when desired (best is if an external plug [only] can be used to do so, as a mechanical “open” cannot be defeated no matter how much time / effort / money the NSA throws at it from a remote location. If they have a truck outside your house, you have a bigger problem!)
Perhaps some computers are different, but on my machines, either it is not possible to activate the internal mic when the mic jack has a plug in it, or, there is no internal mic in the 1st place.
Of course, if about 20 million people were devious and fed a stream of canned but “suspicious” audio with all the right “keywords” into U.S.’ communications network, at semi-random times, that’d overload NSA’s whole system. The problem is, we (or at least I) actually DO want them listening for real terrorists, so the question is how to limit the surveillance to only that. I have no real answer for that, as we have seen how easily any “legal safeguards” can be avoided or ignored.
So, a person earning $30,000 a year would be exempted if ObamaCare insurance would cost them more than $200/month. (8% of $30,000 is $2,400)
Hmmmmmmm . . . .
EXACTLY!
Roberts had to rewrite the letter of the law to approve it--and that isn't his job.
If I was a liberal Democrat, I’d be laughing and crapping on everyone too.
The only thing the Tea Party has done to stop these people is push an Amnesty bill through the Senate...
$95 ???
I understand that not only the uninsured but also whose insurance does not measure up will have to either: (1) pay some kind of penalty, or (2) have their policy meet the government’s minimum standard which will raise their expense even more.
There is one sure fire way to get rid of this:
(1) A total wipeout in the Senate and House with override majorities in each in the 2014 election AND getting rid of the Rino type republicans.
(2) Majorities in the House and Senate in 2014 with conservatives willing to vote down obamacare and undercut it in some way.
(3) Ultimately, in 2016 winning the presidency and supermajorities in the house and senate OR winning operating majorities, ending the filibuster, and repealing obamacare altogether.
One of you probably looked at one of those items online. From there (somehow) the information got to providers of that item, all of whom want to sell it to you.

On-site apartments are also included in the plans which were sent to Adur District Council this week.
Airport manager John Haffenden said the development would make Shoreham "unique among British Airports".
'Incredibly excited'
It is hoped the jobs will be created with the building of the office space and hangars which will be rented to local businesses.
The 70-year-old Grade II listed terminal building will be restored and the departure and arrival facilities, which currently take place elsewhere, will be brought back into the airport's concourse.
Mr Haffenden said: "We are incredibly excited about these plans.
"These represent a substantial investment in the airport and will help turn it even more into an aviation business and facility the local area can be proud of."

Posted on September 29, 2011
Filed Under General
Living in New York and commuting to downtown Manhattan to work, I’ve always been curious about the city’s behind-the-scenes anti-terrorism efforts. So the 60 Minutes story that ran on Sunday, 9/25/11 featuring NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly definitely piqued my interest—not only from a security perspective, but from a media relations view as well. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall in the communications meetings leading up to Scott Pelley’s interview with Kelly. How much of the anti-terrorist program should be revealed? What tone should Kelly take? I would also love to know the parameters set up for the interview between 60 Minutes and the city.
As for the interview itself, I asked crisis counselor and media training expert Andy Gilman of CommCore Consulting for his take on the finished product. Gilman was pretty impressed. “I saw this as a terrific piece for the NYPD and Commissioner Kelly,” he says. “Kelly comes across as thoughtful, organized and committed to public safety, and he had messages for a number, but not all, audiences.” The only trouble spot I saw with Kelly’s performance was when Pelley asked if the NYPD had the capability to shoot down a plane. Kelly seemed hesitant in his answer (which was yes), and the day after the media would call him on that fact. Gilman doesn’t see it as a gaffe. “He was being candid and also trying not to reveal all the tactics that might be used to thwart a plot,” he says.
I agree with Gilman’s further assessment that CBS gave him a pass–at least on the edited version–on how the NYPD balances security and protection of civil liberties. Pelley also didn’t ask if $3 billion was too much of a price to pay for security. But then, as someone who takes the Metro North train, walks through Grand Central and hops on the subway down to Wall Street, I don’t think $3 billion is too much of a price to pay at all.

Due to its greater rear head- and legroom, backseat passengers will be able to stretch out a lot more in the Buick LaCrosse than the Toyota Avalon. As far as headroom and legroom go, there's not much difference between the Buick LaCrosse and the Toyota Avalon in the front seats.
Convenience
The Buick LaCrosse Buick LaCrosse or the Toyota Avalon, it's going to cost you about the same. Another consideration is the Destination Charge, which is a standard charge for transporting the vehicle to the dealer from where it's built. The Destination Charge for the Buick LaCrosse is much higher than that for the Toyota Avalon.
Dimensions
The Buick LaCrosse is a little wider than the Toyota Avalon, so getting in and out of the car in a crowded parking lot may be a little more of a squeeze. When looking at overall length, the Buick LaCrosse takes up about the same amount of space in your garage as the Toyota Avalon.
Drivetrain
The Buick LaCrosse has much less torque than the Toyota Avalon, which generally means that it won't feel as fast or powerful.
Handling
The Buick LaCrosse has about the same turning radius as the Toyota Avalon, allowing equal maneuverability in and out of tight spots.
Performance
When it comes to horsepower, the Buick LaCrosse is somewhat more powerful than the Toyota Avalon.
Utility
In terms of seating you'll be able to fit the same number of people in both the Buick LaCrosse and the Toyota Avalon. The Buick LaCrosse has significantly less cargo room than the Toyota Avalon, which may be a concern if you do a lot of warehouse shopping.
Warranty
You'll have greater peace of mind with the more generous basic warranty of the Buick LaCrosse than that of the Toyota Avalon.

Like any crisis, it has led to numerous inaccuracies and exaggerations, especially when it comes to the impact on food supply and retail food prices.
“Yesterday at the White House, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack noted that farmers only receive a fraction – about 14¢ – of every dollar spent on food at the grocery store. Look at corn, for example, which even at its current price is an inexpensive food ingredient. The corn in a box of Corn Flakes only costs about a dime, and there’s just over a quarter’s worth of corn in a pound of beef.
“When it comes to the RFS for ethanol and other biofuels, now is not the time for changes. It’s working...
“Given the challenges of the drought and suffering of all farmers, now more than ever, U.S. agriculture needs to pull together. NCGA will continue to help lead the way in trying to unite, rather than divide, American agriculture,” says Niemeyer.Villous cytotrophoblast regulation of the syncytial apoptotic cascade in the human placenta

Abstract
Villous trophoblast in the human placenta consists of a population of proliferating stem cells which differentiate and individually fuse into the syncytiotrophoblast. We studied the apoptotic cascade in this complex epithelial layer by immunohistochemical localization of Fas, FasL, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, pro-caspase-3 and caspase-3, T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-related protein (TIAR), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), lamin B, topoisomerase IIα, and transglutaminase II in cryostat and paraffin-fixed tissue sections from normal human first-trimester and term placental villi. The relationship between the apoptotic cascade and syncytial fusion was studied by coincubation of intact villi with FITC-coupled annexin-V, to detect the phosphatidylserine flip, and propidium iodide, to detect plasma membrane permeability. The final events of the apoptotic cascade were studied by the TUNEL reaction and ultrastructural appearance of the trophoblast. The phosphatidylserine flip was identified in some of the villous cytotrophoblastic cells, but the presence of both Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins presumably prevented continuation of the apoptotic cascade. The syncytiotrophoblast demonstrated heterogeneous findings, suggesting variable progression along the apoptotic cascade. In some areas Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 predominated, with preservation of the nuclear proteins PARP, lamin B, and topoisomerase IIα; in other areas, especially in and around syncytial sprouts, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were absent, accompanied by loss of nuclear proteins, presence of phosphatidylserine flip, and TUNEL positivity. These data suggest that the apoptotic cascade is initiated in the villous cytotrophoblast, which in turn promotes syncytial fusion. Donation of anti-apoptotic proteins into the syncytium, such as Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, focally inhibits further progression along this cascade. Completion of the apoptotic cascade takes place in and around syncytial sprouts, providing further evidence that these are the sites of trophoblast shedding into the maternal circulation.

This piece has been brewing for years. It is not a reaction to the well-organized Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions effort that in 2010 struck the Bay Area, Berkeley in particular. Nor is this a response to the BDS conference organized at the University of Pennsylvania last month. It is a processing of my experiences over the last five years as a rabbi, a Jew, and a Zionist in the Bay Area.
The Zionism I embrace is Theodor Herzl's two-fold vision: 1) securing international legitimacy for the right of the Jewish people to a state of our own, and 2) actually building our national home. This mission remains incomplete, and it is both everyone's and no one's fault. "Hawks" delegitimize internal critics. "Lefties" denounce rightist campaigns. Both distract the Jewish People from the greatest project in our collective history: The State of Israel.
How can a Jew today feel (as do more than half of Jews under 35 in a 2010 study by Ari Kelman and Steven M. Cohen) that they would not view the destruction of Israel as a personal tragedy? Has half of our Jewish family forgotten the necessity of a home? Do we believe that "the wandering Jew" is a story of the past? I wish from my heart of hearts that this were true. It's not true yet. And though the day might come, please God, when we can turn our Nuclear Submarines into underwater ploughshares, for now we need those shields. And while we are called to try not to use them, we are also called to have them at the ready.
Just one year ago, the Fogel family was massacred in their own home. Udi (36) Ruth (35) Fogel and their children Yoav (11) Elad (4), and three-month-old Hadas, may their memories be a blessing, were murdered by a terrorist. They lived in a settlement called Itamar in the West Bank. There are Jews who compare their Israeli activist commitments with the motivation of the terrorist. It is an absurd comparison which comes along comments like "we have to question whether we should be mourning the death of the crazy uncle who is making things worse." The Fogels were people I would have argued with until I was red in the face (and then some). But emphatic, fundamental disagreement is different from murder, and I weep and mourn for my lost sisters and brothers, no matter the deep differences with which we would have struggled together in life.
I am a liberal Zionist. That means I support the work of the New Israel Fund ("Say Yes to a Better Israel") and AIPAC ("Ensuring Israel's Security"). It means that, when I do criticize Israeli policies, I do so with a cautious and conflicted heart because I am talking about my home and about my family. It means that I sing the Hatikvah with tears in my eyes as I pray that "we have not yet lost hope, a hope of 2,000 years, to be a free People in our land."
There are those who suggest that our traumatic family history has rendered us unable to make ethical decisions. I disagree with this interpretation, but hear it as as a challenge to every side of the Jewish Israel conversation. Can we embrace the numerous challenges Israel faces on behalf of the Global Jewish People, knowing that our disagreements are part of Zionism in-progress? Said simply, is it possible for Jews who disagree to see each other as partners in building our People's home? This must be, I believe, based on "hawks" allowing for the dissent upon which democracy is built, and it must be based upon "critics" recognizing that their credibility must be based on explicit support for the State of Israel.
I am reminded of the teaching of Reb Nachman of Breslov, perhaps itself the ancestor of Herzl's vision: "If you believe you can harm, then believe you can heal."

The Enterprise Public Library in the City of Enterprise, Wallowa County, is among Oregon’s latest entries in the National Register of Historic Places.Completed in 1914, the Enterprise Public Library is recognized as an important community institution that represents the City’s commitment to continuing public education and as a representative example of a Carnegie Library. The Library was constructed with a $5,000 grant from the Carnegie Corporation, founded by steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie financially supported the construction of hundreds of free libraries across the country between 1886 and 1917 because he believed that free public libraries played an important role in social betterment of the people they served. In exchange for the grant, the City of Enterprise committed to providing a building site, $500 for the annual operating budget, and to follow the Carnegie Corporation’s construction guidelines. The Enterprise Public Library includes many of the characteristics of Carnegie-funded libraries, including Classical Revival styling and brick construction. Also typical of Carnegie Libraries is the location of the reading room on the main floor with windows set above the open book shelves, a centrally located circulation desk, and public meeting space in the basement.Oregon’s State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation recommended the building’s nomination at their June 2013 meeting. Eight historic properties in Enterprise are now.War-Front News Rivets and Repels ; Nonstop Coverage Offers Viewers Unique Access to Battle Zone, but May Give a Distorted Perspective
Article excerpt.
Live coverage and loss of perspective. …Be ready for downsizing vote if campaign promise kept
Whether it was something in the water or in the air, town residents were drawn to Republicans on Election Day. Perhaps it was because the candidates said they were willing to give residents the right to vote on the size of the board.
With the general election behind us, and this year nearing its end, we anticipate that a special election on the downsizing matter isn’t too far away in 2010.
In preparation for this vote, we encourage all residents to really think about what a five-member board would mean.
Is the $50,000 spent annually for salaries, plus benefits, worth having two additional representatives — two more decision-makers?
Or is seven just too many people? An excessive number for the decisions and tasks that are regularly before them? Or would five be spread too thin, trying to represent a town of 120,000 people?
When baking a chocolate cake there is the option of buying Hershey’s brand cocoa powder or the store brand. For some, paying extra for the brand name makes the difference — a better cake. Others buy generic, save money and don’t notice the difference.
There is the seven-member “more expensive” board that should be able to do more than a leaner five-member board.
What happens when a developer is proposing a super-duper gas station next to your house? Do you want seven people asking the questions, pondering the pros and cons and ultimately voting, or is five enough?
We aren’t going to express our opinion on the matter at this time, because we also have some research to do and consequences to weigh.
Kevin Gaughan, who is leading the charge for downsizing across Western New York, has been very vocal about the issue. We want to hear from the other side — those who don’t think Amherst has too many elected officials. And we want to hear from those supporting downsizing.
It would be advantageous for the board to bring this motion forward in January, set the vote, and allow both sides the chance to present their reasons to the public.
Say what you will about campaign promises, but we believe the Republicans will bring this issue forward. Be ready when they do.Manning up
Kevin Cadle previews the 'Manning bowl' - Denver at NY Giants - which is live on SS2HD on Sunday.
Last Updated: 19/09/13 11:59am
The second part of our live Sunday double header is the 'Manning bowl', Peyton's Denver Broncos making the trip to take on his younger brother Eli's New York Giants.
The teams are coming off contrasting performances; Denver enjoyed a long week of preparation after demolishing defending Super Bowl champions Baltimore in the Thursday night season opener, while the Giants produced an error-strewn display in a 36-31 defeat on the road at division rivals Dallas.
Our NFL anchorman Kevin Cadle previews the game and makes his prediction.
Denver Broncos @ New York Giants - Sky Sports 2 HD from 9pm
You know how it is in families, the older brother usually beats up on the younger brother - and that's what has happened on the two previous occasions Peyton and Eli have played against each other in the NFL.
But I'm going to stick up for Eli as his supporting cast doesn't always do him many favours. That was shown again last week when the Giants turned the ball over six times at Dallas and still only lost by five points.
Starting running back David Wilson was benched by Giants head coach Tom Coughlin after giving up two early fumbles and his team-mates will have been messing around with him in the locker room and practice facility this week, trying to knock the ball out of his hands and making a joke of it.
But it is an issue that he needs to address quickly as Coughlin doesn't have a whole lot of choice at the position. They've re-signed Brandon Jacobs this week but he's not going to hurt you running ball.
The Broncos are the early Super Bowl favourites with the bookies and, fresh from his seven-touchdown display last week, Peyton is still playing as well as ever.
But, if we are talking about winning championships, I have two questions about this team.
First, is the defence consistent enough? It certainly looked up to the task against Baltimore and they still have Von Miller to return from suspension to give them a boost.
Second, can the running game carry their share of the load offensively? It doesn't matter to me that there is a committee in the backfield (Knowshon Moreno, Montee Ball and Ronnie Hillman split carries in week one) because none of these guys are stars, they are not comparable with the elite rushers in this league.
Kev's call: This is a tough one - and I'm trying not to base my prediction on just one week - but I think the Broncos have the better team and Peyton will come out on top once again.Rocky: Can you believe this? Just LOOK at us ... all three of us squished up in ONE little dog bed!

Legal Publisher Gave State, Federal Judges Gifts, Newspaper Says
1995, Reuters News Service, St Louis Post-Dispatch (MO)
Federal judges, including several U.S. Supreme Court justices, have accepted travel and other gifts from one of the nation's leading legal publishing houses, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported Sunday.
The jurists accepted the benefits from West Publishing Co., of Eagan, Minn., while in some cases making decisions relating to the company, the newspaper reported.
West is a privately held $600 million-a-year company that has been reporting decisions by state and federal courts throughout the country since the turn of the century. West's reports and cross reference system are considered so authoritative that they are accepted virtually as official and are cited in court documents.
The Star Tribune said the judges who accepted gifts broke no laws but should have excused themselves, according to some ethics experts the newspaper contacted.
West Publishing strongly denied it has done anything illegal and said it has followed all rules covering contracts with public officials, the Star Tribune said.
According to the Star Tribune, at least seven Supreme Court justices - Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy and retired Justices Lewis Powell, Byron White and William Brennan - took trips at West Publishing's expense.
The trips were part of the selection process to pick the winner of the annual Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award, a $15,000 prize established by West Publishing in 1982 and awarded to an outstanding federal judge. …If there was ever a day to talk about hope, it would be Monday. Almost everyone has hope on Monday. We hope the week goes by quickly, (wishing our lives away 5 days at a time) we hope for our work day to go smoothly,(as if they ever do) we hope for the hangover(physical or mental) to disappear. And the usual; we hope our family and friends will be safe and healthy, to win the lottery, world peace and other issues of importance to each of us in our lives.
But without hope, there aren’t any bright days, only a seemingly endless supply of dark days full of despair, foul temperament and negative attitudes. Personally, I’ll take the positivity that hope has to offer and eschew the negative. Where there is life, there is hope!
I HOPE that we all have a bright and positive Monday,
Jake.
The Birth Of Hope
With the dawn
of a new day
with a thought
of a new way
or a sprout
in the spring
the fledgling
on wing
all signal
the birth of hope.
For without it
we’re doomed
to a life
of sheer gloom
feeling never
the light
seeing only
the night
and with darkness
e’er must we cope.

So what should we make of all this?.
Is there anything that money can buy for these children? I am sure that Head Start buys some of them a few hours a day in a safer, warmer and more nurturing environment than the one they have at home. Whenever that’s true, I don’t care about long-term outcomes. Accomplishing just that much is a good in itself. But how often is it true? To what extent does Head Start systematically fail to serve the children who need those few hours of refuge the most?
Asking those questions.
This head-in-the-sand attitude has to change. If we don’t know how to substitute for absent, uncaring or incompetent parenting with outside interventions, then we have to think about how we increase the odds that children are born to present, caring and competent parents..)

They might be interested to know this extended back way before hip-hop and can be used to different ends, You could show them 'Cosmic Ray' if you can find a copy (I might be able to help off list), a Cornell short (c.f Jack's Dream) and have them do a found footage piece but prohibiting them from using pop music on the sound track to keep them away from simulating. You'd want to provide them with a fixed set of found samples in the mode of 'Stockstock,' the idea being everyone would get different results from the same sources. Another project might be to show the middle part of 'Critical Mass' (kids might not have the attention span for the whole thing), then have them shoot some kind of long take, and throw it into Barbara Lattanzi's HF Critical Mass software and play with the automatic processes of turning it into a structural film. Experimental film can be very 'adult' and 'heavy', and at risk kids probably don't need more heavy than they have. (A different kind of heavy that might work is Maclaine's The End, a very serious film that also generates a lot of laughter.) It's also tough to show anything with sexual/erotic content to kids without them just giggling and wiggling and you getting into trouble. That doesn't leave a lot. You also want to show them examples of things they could reasonably take off from, which leaves a lot of graphic/animation stuff out (no Belson, Whitney, Bartlett...) Maybe Bridges Go Round, and selected bits of City Symphony films, and have them try to do a poetic take on their neighborhood?? If you have a lot of minority kids, it would be nice to show them examples from minority makers, though again finding copies may be a challenge... Kevin Everson, Roberts Banks, Alex Rivera, Ella Troyano. All probably difficult to get on video. One issue is how much male/macho/homophobic attitude the group displays. You probably don't want to get too confrontational with their beliefs. But if they can handle it, you could show Sadie Benning's Rubyfruit program, and/or 'Chronic.' And for something closer to home 'AKA Don Bonus,' and have them do a subjective diary project. I might also consider screening 'Jack Smith and The Destruction of Atlantis', which might be able to inspire something having to do with resiliance in the face of extreme outsider-ness. It's not that 'experimental', but you could show the moc-doc C.S.A. and have them play with cultural artifacts from alternate histories.

Calvin Moss, says the chief decided Tuesday to put most officers back on regular shifts.
"My understanding is we had no continuing or new threats to Atlanta's security and that some favorable progress had been made in [the war in] Afghanistan," Moss explains.
Harvard earlier had said she put the entire force on 12-hour shifts immediately after bombing began Oct. 7 in Afghanistan. During the ensuing five weeks, no credible terrorist or anthrax threats had been reported in Atlanta.
She lifted the overtime early evening Tuesday, Moss says, shortly after CL hit the streets with an article that criticized the 12-hour shifts as an unwarranted waste of taxpayer money. As recently as the previous Friday, Harvard told CL she had no schedule for ending the extended hours.
Officers stationed at Hartsfield Airport and others assigned to a handful of unnamed special details will continue working 60-hour weeks for the time being, Moss says.Sunset Vistas Beachfront Suites Hotel St Petersburg

Even in smaller classes, these systems can provide useful feedback to both instructor and student as well as providing stimulus for discussions. They are expensive though, and I always have my eye out for alternatives. Recently I've found two that can be had for free, but with major limitations.
The first is from Microsoft. They have developed the Interactive Classroom for Powerpoint plug-in, available as a free download It seems like a well designed system. Instructors can put questions up right on a Powerpoint slide, start and stop when the question is open for responses, and immediately display results. You can even spontaneously pop up questions on the spur of the moment. There are two limitations, on the instructor side it only works with the latest Windows version of Powerpoint, 2007. The second limitation is that all the respondents must be connected to the network, and have Microsoft OneNote installed. OneNote is bundled with the version of office available to our students, but except in our Windows teaching labs, and maybe some classes in the College of Business, it's far from likely that every student in a class would have a Windows computer available.
A more likely scenario which uses devices almost all students have in their possession, is Poll Everywhere. The instructor side is entirely web based, so you can use it on either a Windows or Macintosh. On the response side, you can use any device that can access the web, via a web page or Tweet, and also regular phone text messages, a modality dear to the heart of college students. Between laptops, notebooks, smart phones, iPod Touches, iPads, and regular cell phones, almost every student would likely have some device that could respond. Each individual question is set up as a poll, but you can group polls and move from one to another rather easily. You can choose to view a "static chart" that just displays the possible answers and the codes needed for submitting, and when you've received all the responses, switch to a "live chart" which displays the results. Polls can be embedded in a Powerpoint slide. The big limitation with Poll Everywhere is that it's only free with up to 32 respondents. There are paid plans that allow up to 1000 respondents per poll, but they're not exactly cheap. $399 per semester for each instructor. (This would actually be cheaper than we're paying now for eInstruction's CPS System). There are also plans where each student subscribes for $14 apiece for a semester for each class.
It should be noted that there are some features available in the classic clicker systems not available on these. The most noticeable one is that it is not recorded who responded to what. You get the interactive benefits in class, but lose the ability to track how students are doing, as well as using it as a way to record attendance. The other issue is the question of whether every student would have a compatible device, and if that were a basic free cell phone, a text messaging plan that wouldn't cost them extra to use it.
It would really be great if someone created an open source solution for this. It seems like it would be within the capabilities of the Plone content management system which we use on our campus, although it would probably require some special scripting or workflows to make it workable. (You know who I'm talking to here).
The system would probably have to be web based. Eliminating text message responses would reduce the universality as with Poll Everywhere, but I think it would still have a lot of application. For example, in our College of Nursing, all students are required to have a smart phone, and in several nursing classes I've been in recently, every student had a laptop open (following the instructors Powerpoint, I might add). I'd be willing to bet it's not unusual to see College of Business classes where everyone had a laptop, netbook, ipad or smart phone, and likely upper division science courses too. And keep in mind, the price of admission here would be as low as a refurbed iPod touch, which college kids could also find lots of other uses for, and who knows how cheap Android devices will get. If the system was free otherwise, and lots of instructors adopted, I'd bet it would encourage students to get some kind of device to make use of it.
The basic system would consist of a series of one question polls. A sophisticated Plone user could probably rig this up without special scripting, but to make it widely applicable, I think some special tools to simplify it would be necessary. The nature of the questions would primarily be multiple choice, but numerical entries and text entries would be useful too. The Instructor would have to be able to move to a particular question (from a menu maybe), make it active to receive input from users, and stop it from being active. When they had received all the input, they would then display the results, perhaps as a graph or a histogram in the case of numerical answers (This would be a great way to demonstrate a normal statistical distribution).
On the client side, you'd probably want to strip it down to all but the essentials needed to vote, since you might have as many as 200 users logged into the wireless network. If the users were on mobile devices a special CSS for them could do the trick, but I'm not sure how you'd do it for regular laptop users, maybe having one display for the page owner, and a different simpler display for the rest of the world. It would be great if they didn't have to move to a different page to go to a new question, that is, it would just update as the instructor moved to a new question.
I'm sure Plone stores survey results, so the instructor could later review how the class did, but it would probably be difficult to track who voted how without creating an account on Plone for each student. I'm not sure how much this would clog up the server, but we spend enough on conventional clickers that it would probably be worthwhile for a specific Plone server just for this purpose to be set up and connect it to the LDAP server.
If this could be set up as a Plone "product," I'm sure we could see some widespread use of it around the country, and it would probably be a sure conference presentation, and of course it would be the ultimate of cool.

Here is Evason on a few topics regarding the Ads:
On Taylor Beck’s progress: “I guess he’s getting closer. He hasn’t been on the ice yet, I don’t know what the status is. He’s riding the bike and working out. We expect him to be at practice at some point this week.”
On Ryan Ellis getting his first action of the season this week: “The first game he wasn’t the Ryan Ellis we knew he is, or we’ve seen and expected. Obviously he has been out a long time and it was his first game. His second game he played well, his third game, he was really, really good. We played him against the top line, he and Victor Bartley against Grand Rapids and the line of Tomas Tatar, Gustav Nyquist and Joakim Andersson – arguably one of the best lines in the AHL. He not only did a real good job there, but offensively had a very good night as well as far as making plays and controlling the puck. He hasn’t played for a long time so it was nice to get him back and see him progress. He’s only going to get better obviously.”
On whether Jonathon Blum’s minus-7 rating is indicative of his play: “If you would have asked me the first five or six games of the season, I probably would have said yes, it’s a true stat. But he plays against the top lines pretty much every night. We haven’t produced a whole lot offensively so you don’t get the pluses on that side of it. My answer is, I wouldn’t read too much into it. He has been real good for us on both ends of the rink. We need him to be even better because we think he’s an NHL defenseman. I wouldn’t read too much into it, but we do expect a little bit more from him.”

Help! The Faerie Folk Hid My Ancestors!
Blog type: Individual family history, Irish genealogy
I am a former prosecutor, and my father and uncles were policemen and detectives. This background has given me a unique perspective on family history research (my “detective eyes”). I prefer the term “family historian” over “genealogist” because I believe the heart of our research is the collecting and preserving of our ancestors’ life stories, and not just the adding of leaves on the family tree.
Journey To The Past
Blog type: Individual family history
Welcome to my blog. I am an avid, some might say obsessed, fan of genealogy. I hope to share stories, pictures, research finds, family recipes and other items related to my family history journey.
Know Your Story
Blog type: Genealogy vendor, Photography
My name is Brooke Neugebauer and I started this blog for two reasons:
1) Because I have goals that I would like to meet and this is my way of being accountable
2) I’d like to let others know about the photo and genealogical preservationservices that I’d like to provide them so they can enjoy their own photos and family history stories for years to come.
Photos, family history, genealogy – preservation of one’s story. Part of this blog is about trying to get past “road blocks”, reaching goals, and a journey of learning to live in the moment. But most importantly, it is about preserving our pasts and presents though our photos, so all of our wonderful memories and family history stories can be cherished in the future.

“I may have had a pastime in the making when I was little just listening to family stories and then being curious afterward. Or maybe I am hooked because I love the feeling I get when I discover something that helps solve the mystery…I like playing detective. Either way, I thought I would finally get around to blogging about family history. After all, it is on my mind most of the time and keeps me up at night anyway.”

9 new #genealogy blogs this week – Irish genealogy, industry news, photo preservation and more!1. Blinds in the family room. We moved in last May and since the seasons have changed--the sun is ridiculous in the morning. You can't sit in the family room without the sun in your eyes.
2.Window treatments. I was fortunate to have window treatments from the previous owners that match what I already have but I still have a couple of rooms that need them.
- Jeff's Office
- Guest Room
- Bonus Room
- Master Bedroom
- Master Bath
- Guest Room downstairs
3.Attempt to reupholster a chair using drop cloths. I thought I would start with a small project with this one.
4. Wallpaper powder room and daughter's bathroom
5. Eliminate more from my attic space. I got rid of so much stuff before the move but my storage space is small so I would like to eliminate even more.
6. Hang more photos and artwork in upstairs hallway.
7. Plant more flowers.
This is my list so far. I will post more as they come to me.UPDATE: 8:15AM - GoPrint is back up and working. If you experience any issues, please call the LIS Technology Help Desk at ext.1000.

The paper link is broken.
Could it be possible that this is a correlative effect only? e.g. it could be the case that states with a high proportion of black residents tend to be poorer, and poorer states are more adverse to redistribution.
With any luck, the authors found some way to control for this.

“…and poorer states are more adverse to redistribution.”
I wonder about this. Are Louisiana and Mississippi poorer than Wyoming and North Dakota? I could look it up of course.

It’s also true that widespread poverty limits the ability of the state to make adequate payments. Now I’ll be the first to admit that the strong racism in the Deep South in particular did a lot to contribute to the overall high poverty of those states. Still, if a state is poor, then it’s poor – regardless of what causes it to be poor.
Take a look at the sort-of-middle regression line. Maryland, It has a high % of Blacks but it’s wealthy. Therefore, they can afford higher AFDC payments. Also, look at the left side of the graph. The states above the regression line tend to be wealthier in terms of per capita income and/or gross state product per capita than those below the regression line (e.g., Connecticut is above the regression line, Idaho is below it).
So while it’s interesting to correlate the AFDC payments with the % of Afr-Ams, the most the graph might be showing is the long-lasting effects of Jim Crow segregation. IOW, if you treat a huge % of your population like dirt for long enough and pervasively enough, your society creates poverty lasting far into the future – a poverty difficult to dig yourself out of even long after you stop treating the oppressed population like dirt. Put more simply, it’s the “sins of the father” phenomenon.

FWIW, here is an insight from Brink Lindsey, president of the American Enterprise Institute:
Does America’s smaller welfare state reflect important cultural differences between us and folks on the other side of the Atlantic? Yes, probably, but the main one is hardly worthy of defending. A 2001paper, .

It would be hard to untangle this from what filrabat points out. Either way it’s a whole lotta F U, I got mine.

Nov. 17, 2011WWE Smackdown review
May 27, 2011
Taped 5/24/11 in Spokane, Wash.
Aired on SYFY
By Greg Parks, PWTorch Columnist
- WWE Open.
- Smackdown Open.
- Fireworks shot off as Josh Mathews talked about new superstars getting new opportunities on Friday Night Smackdown.
- And speaking of new superstars and new opportunities…Randy Orton! He led off the show by coming out to his music, still sporting the World Championship. During his entrance, Mathews, Booker T, and Michael Cole were all shown at the announce desk. Orton soaked up the “Randy” chants by the crowd before he spoke. “My name…is Randy Orton. And I am still the World Heavyweight Champion,” he began. That’s about all he could get out before Christian’s music hit and he came out. He was all smiles, just like the week after he lost the World Title in the first place. Christian said he didn’t want to spoil Orton’s moment, but he did say that last Sunday’s match was one of the greatest of his career. He thanked Orton, congratulated him, then shook his hand. He said the outcome could’ve gone either way, but Orton was the better man and he won. But Christian said he knows he can beat Orton, so he issued a challenge for one more match. Before Orton could answer, Sheamus’ came out to his music. He walked to the ring saying this was painful to watch, as Christian has already had enough chances. He compared Christian to a gambling addict. Sheamus said Christian will have to wait 17 more for his next title reign, because on Sunday, he became a two-time loser. Sheamus said he’s a two-time WWE Champion and came to Smackdown to compete in epic matches with the likes of Orton for the World Title. He called himself the star of the show and said if anybody should be #1 contender tonight, it’s going to be him. Right on cue, Mark Henry interrupted. Great, another one of these segments.
Henry came to the ring and told Christian that Edge is on a golf course waiting for Christian. As for Sheamus, he said as the World’s Strongest Man, you don’t wait in line – you butt in. He told Orton he has just butted his way to the front of the line for the Championship. Then Teddy Long’s music came on and the Smackdown GM walked out. He said there’s some de ja vu out there, with those four again arguing about the World Title. Sing it, Teddy. Long told Christian that he agrees with Sheamus and Henry: Christian had his opportunity. But what really matters is what the people say. So Long polled the live audience who should challenge Christian, just as he did when Christian defended the title his first time. There were some boos (quite a few, actually) when he asked if Christian deserved another shot. He said if Christian gets another opportunity, he has to earn it. Therefore, there will be a Triple-Threat Match to determine the #1 Contender to the World Championship. It’ll be Henry vs. Sheamus vs. Christian. Mathews had the gall to call this “unpredictable” and “exciting.”
[Commercial Break]
- Cole plugged WWE.com for exclusive photos of Over the Limit.
1 – SIN CARA vs. CHAVO GUERRERO
Cara countered a hip-toss and took Chavo down with a few arm-drags. Chavo was at ringside and Cara feigned diving at him. Missed corner splash by Cara, and Chavo nailed him with a double-knee to the chest. European uppercut by Chavo on Cara, followed by a side slam for a one-count at 1:52. Chavo locked in a key-lock on the left arm of Cara. Cara took Chavo to the outside again and this time landed a springboard moonsault. Thus far, they haven’t addressed anything dealing with Cole’s new place at the announce table, though he still acted a little testy at times. Cara used his kicks as his primary offensive weapon. Springboard cross-body by Cara, but a jackknife cover by Chavo for two. “Chavo sucks” chant, then Cara did the move that won him the match at Over the Limit, and it got him the win again.
WINNER: Cara, at 4:47. Either that finisher wasn’t a botch at the PPV, or he has botched it twice now. Upon replay, it did look like he intended to face-plant Chavo, rather than having Chavo flip like a traditional head-scissors.
- Tonight, the #1 Contender will be crowned when Christian squares off with Mark Henry and Sheamus.
[Commercial Break]
- Cody Rhodes came out for a match, flanked by his bag men. He said if he didn’t know better, he’d think there is no God, because with each town he goes to, he prays he’ll see a mildly attractive face. And each time, he’s disappointed. He reiterated his paper bag line and told his baggers to do their work. “Shut up and bag yourselves!” Rhodes shouted. Rhodes’ speech was interrupted by Daniel Bryan’s music.
2 – CODY RHODES vs. DANIEL BRYAN
Cole went into full heel mode ragging on Bryan. Arm-drag by Bryan, but he caught an elbow charging in on Rhodes in the corner. Bryan countered Rhodes’ leg-lock and then applied a modified surfboard. Kick to the chest put Rhodes down for a one-count at 1:04 of the match. Bryan was hip-tossed over the top rope, leading to a break at 1:31.
[Commercial Break]
The show returned with 4:48 gone in the match. Bryan fired back with European uppercuts, but Rhodes countered and kicked Bryan right in the stomach. Rhodes continued working over Bryan. Rhodes appeared to be out-wrestling Bryan, but the announcers were too busy squabbling to get over any storyline in the match. Bryan got his boot up in the corner, then came at Rhodes with a flying leg lariat. Running clothesline took Rhodes down at 7:30. Dropkick in the corner, then Bryan went to the top. High missile dropkick for a near-fall at 8:03. Rhodes countered a LeBell lock attempt and rolled Bryan up for two. Bryan did the same for a near-fall. Springboard kick to the face by Rhodes. Cross-Rhoes countered into the LeBell Lock, and Rhodes immediately tapped.
WINNER: Bryan, at 9:08. Surprise win there, and a good one for Bryan over Rhodes, who has been a major player lately.
After the match, Rhodes got his heat back by attacking Bryan. Unfortunately, that mean the win by Bryan was overshadowed. Cross-Rhodes by Cody, then he put a bag over Bryan’s head. A Bryan vs. Rhodes feud would be one I’d look forward to. Did Mathews just say “symbolical”?
- The announcers talked about Capitol Punishment, and sent it to the Obama spoof video from the PPV. Coors Light did this so much better with the NFL coaches. Mathews talked about all of Washington being invited to Capitol Punishment. What politician would want to attend an event title “Capitol Punishment,” even if you are in favor of the death penalty?
- A Triple-Threat match to determine the #1 contender is still to come tonight.
[Commercial Break]
- Stone Cold Steve Austin will be on Jimmy Fallon tonight.
3 – HEATH SLATER vs. EZEKIEL JACKSON
No entrance for Slater. Slater did his best to use his speed, but he was put down by a Zeke right hand. Jackson grabbed Slater in a choke and bealed him out of the corner. Slater stopped Zeke’s momentum and tried to stay on top of him, but Zeke kicked out of a cover with authority. Jackson made his comeback just shy of 2:00 in, splashing Slater in the corner. Big bodyslam from Jackson, followed by another. Torture Rack applied, which Cole called by name. But before Slater could submit, Justin Gabriel and Wade Barrett ran out for the DQ.
WINNER: Jackson, via DQ, at 2:34. We still don’t have a really good reason to root for Jackson as a babyface. Mathews did try to get over the idea that he was being bullied by the Corre, which is something, I guess.
Jackson was able to fend off all three men, and Corre had to re-group outside the ring while Jackson flexed inside it.
- Christian was backstage with Matt Striker. Striker noted this could be Christian’s last chance at the World Title. Christian said he was always picked last for kickball in school, but he’d always kick the most home runs. He was also the last kid in his class to hit puberty, but by the time prom rolled around, he had the prettiest girlfriend there. And in WWE, he proved everyone wrong and won the World Title. The odds may be stacked against him, but he’s going to get the last laugh. Would be nice to see Christian show a more serious side, knowing what’s a stake as it relates to his Title chances.
- A Monster’s Brawl match is next between Kane and Great Khali.
[Commercial Break]
4 – THE GREAT KHALI vs. KANE
Ranjin Singh accompanied Khali. So apparently, there are no stipulations that would make this different than any other match, despite being billed as a “Monster’s Brawl” match. Khali shoved Kane down on a lock-up attempt. They went at it again and Khali elbowed Kane in the corner. Kane shot back with a big uppercut. Kane hit the ropes, then hit the mat after a clothesline from Khali. Khali whipped Kane into the buckle, then kicked at Kane. Nerve hold applied by Khali, as the announcers noted Singh was a bit more animated at ringside. At 2:00, Kane grabbed Khali’s throat. Khali did the same, and dumped Kane over the top rope. Kane caught Khali and brought him throat-first over the top rope. Top rope clothesline from Kane, which took Khali off his feet. Kane made the cover and picked up the win.
WINNER: Kane, at 2:35. Yeah, it was Khali vs. Kane. Fill in the blanks there.
Jinder Mahal’s music played, and he walked to the ring with a microphone. He spoke in a foreign language (possibly from the Foreign Land, Ishbu’s home). He got into the ring and slapped Khali across the face again. Singh then got in Mahal’s face, but Mahal shoved him. Khali returned the shove to Mahal and put a finger in Mahal’s face. Singh continued ranting in Mahal’s general direction, but Khali then extended his arms and applied the Khali Vice to Singh. Mahal was quite pleased, and they played his music to end the segment. Cole called it an act of cowardice on Khali’s part. Mathews questioned the relationship between Khali and Mahal.
- Still to come, the #1 Contender’s Triple Threat match.
[Commercial Break]
- They showed the outside of the arena in Spokane.
- A video package aired from Raw of Big Show getting run over by a car and he and Kane losing the tag titles.
- Cole talked about the situation being a “terrible accident,” and Mathews related an injury update on Big Show, saying he suffered a crush injury to the knee and will be out several weeks.
- Booker T’s music played, and he was in the ring. Booker asked us to bear with him as he had something he wanted to do. He asked Cole to come into the ring. Cole said he wasn’t going too, and Mathews egged him on by asking if he was afraid. Cole entered the ring and Booker reminded fans that Cole lost the Kiss My Foot match at Over the Limit. They showed the still of Cole eating foot. Booker asked him the best way to get toe jam out. Cole dejectedly walked to the ropes. Booker though, said he wasn’t going to let the fans say “kiss my feet.” Of course, the fans chanted it. Booker’s music then played as Cole walked back to the announce table. Well, they had to address it, but that didn’t seem to accomplish much.
- Striker knocked on Sheamus’ locker room door. Sheamus came out and said neither Christian nor Mark Henry deserve a title shot. He reminded Striker that he won his first title in only a few months, doing something that Christian and Henry strived their entire lives for. Sheamus then headed back into his locker room and slammed the door on Striker.
[Commercial Break]
5 – ALICIA FOX & TAMINA vs. A.J & KAITLYN
Natalya accompanied the greenhorns to the ring, while the heels were already in the ring. They had an inset interview with Nattie, AJ, and Kaitlyn. They did acknowledge AJ and Kaitlyn’s NXT season three experience. Headscissor take-over by AJ on Fox. She tagged in Kaitlyn who hopped over the ropes and took Fox down with a headbutt to the mid-section. Kaitlyn grabbed a handful of hair as the announcers did a good job talking about what Kaitlyn and AJ did on NXT. Side slam by Kaitlyn, but Tamina broke up the pin. AJ fended her off and Fox beheaded Kaitlyn with a beautiful axe kick.
WINNERS: Fox and Tamina, at 1:36. No explanation for Tamina being a heel here. Kaitlyn’s offense didn’t look great, but she and AJ didn’t have a lot of time to establish themselves here. Still, good to see those two getting some TV time, although it’s probably mostly due to injuries to Layla and Kharma’s absence.
- The announcers plugged the WWE All-Stars video game.
- The winner of the Triple Threat main event will face Orton next week on Smackdown for the World Title.
[Commercial Break]
- They showed the animated poster for Capitol Punishment, the next PPV event for WWE.
- Mark Henry joined Striker backstage. He asked Henry for a response to what Christian and Sheamus said earlier. Henry told Striker to answer, since he probably agrees with what both men said. Striker clarified a point Sheamus made, and Henry took offense to it. He continued to intimidate Striker, then pushed him aside and walked off.
- Mathews, Booker and Cole reminisced about Randy Savage, and they sent it to the video package that aired on Raw.
[Commercial Break]
6 – SHEAMUS vs. MARK HENRY vs. CHRISTIAN - #1 CONTENDER’S MATCH FOR THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
The heels double-teamed Christian as Booker predicted a win for Sheamus. Sheamus held Christian so Henry could punch him in the gut. Christian was sent into the ropes, but ducked under to get a breather. Sheamus tried to take the fight to him out there, but Christian landed a drop-toe hold on Sheamus into the ring steps. Henry brought Christian in the hard way, and picked him up, only to let gravity do the rest. He got a near-fall off that at the 1:50 mark. Henry choked Christian with his boot, then stood on top of him near the ropes. Henry charged, but Christian low-bridged him. Sheamus snuck up from behind and rolled Christian up for two. Brogue Kick missed, but Christian hit the Killswitch at 3:15. Henry pulled Christian out of the ring at the two-count. Orton’s music then played and he walked out, perhaps to get a closer look at his possible opponents next Friday. They went to break at 3:50.
[Commercial Break]
Back at 7:40 of the match, and Orton had joined the announcers at ringside. He did not, however, have a headset. Henry had Christian in a bearhug. Sheamus took the fight to Henry in order to get back into the ring, but Henry impressively belly-to-bellied Sheamus back to ringside. Henry slowly worked over Christian, concentrating on the back. A missed splash gave Christian a chance to recover at 10:30 of the contest. Dropkick off the second rope rattled Henry, and a second one felled him. He only got a two-count, though. Sheamus cut Christian off as he tried to go to the top rope, and Sheamus laid the knees in on Henry. Sheamus went to the top to suplex Christian off, but Christian knocked him off instead. He dove at Henry, who caught him and slammed him. Sheamus broke up the pin attempt. Irish Hammer knocked Henry right out of the ring. He then covered Christian at 12:15, good for a two-count. High Cross was set up, but Christian got out the back door. Flip kick in the corner, followed by a Tornado DDT. Henry went after the champ, then went back into the ring. Christian side-stepped Henry, who splashed Sheamus. Spear by Christian on Sheamus. Orton recovered and RKO’d Henry. That distracted the ref and didn’t allow him to see Christian covering Sheamus. By the time he realized it, Sheamus kicked out. Charles Robinson explained that Orton was in the ring and he had to get him out. Christian pleaded his case unsuccessfully, then turned around right into a Brogue Kick by Sheamus for the pin. Mathews shamelessly called next week’s match between Sheamus and Orton, “perhaps the biggest match in Smackdown history.”
WINNER: Sheamus, at 14:29. Sheamus vs. Orton didn’t exactly set the world on fire on Raw, so we’ll see what they can cook up here.
After the match, Orton held the title above his head in the ring as Sheamus backed up the ramp. Christian had a look of disbelief on his face in the ring. Sheamus pointed at Orton and trash-talked him.Stewed Cabbage – Simple Teochew Food
Teo Heng Teochew Porridge is a favourite amongst Teochew Porridge fans and this venerable stall at the Hong Lim Food Centre is always packed from the time they start selling at 7am till they run out of fish at around 1 to 2pm. Ask a handful of people where to eat the best Teochew Porridge in Singapore and most of them will point you to this particular stall.
At the heart of the stall is a Teochew Ah Pek who has been dishing out hawker food for 60 years. Mr Liew started selling food at the age of 17 and can still be seen serving Teochew Muay at this stall. The old man still looked remarkably fit and still has a keen mind. Perhaps mom was right after all and eating fish is good for your brains!
We Teochews are probably most famous for our fresh fish which we cook by simply steaming it or alternatively, boiling it quickly in a cauldron of preserved vegetables (Chye Bueh). If you go at around closing time, the vat of simmering “Chye Bueh” would have been used to as a spa for hundreds of fresh fish and has turned into a really sweet and tangy soup. You can imagine what a bowl of this soup can do for you especially if your boss had just given you a whole stack of work to do in the afternoon!
Teochew Porridge must have the “Mountain and the Sea”
A good bowl of Teochew Porridge has got to have just the right proportion of water and rice. The Teochew Muay connoiseur can tell you immediately if a particular Teochew Muay stall is worth eating at by just eyeing the bowl of porridge. Firstly, what we want to see is the “Swa ga Hai” (Mountain and Sea) which basically means that the porridge is watery but not overly watered down. Secondly, the rice must remain whole and unbroken. The best Teochew Muay places throw away the pot of porridge when the rice breaks.
Lou Nerng (Seasoned Eggs)
If you think that those Japanese Rutan (Seasoned Eggs) with its watery yolks are new to the Singapore food scene, think again. This stall has been selling this style of eggs for over a generation! I don’t know why but this is the only Teochew Porridge stall that sells their Lou Nerng (Seasoned eggs) this way. What is commonly seen is the hard boiled version which often has that ugly, smelly green grey ring around it because they have overcooked the yolks. Most of the time stallholders actually buy the eggs already hardboiled and then put them into the braising sauce. So if you love the Japanese Charshu Ramen eggs, then here is where you can get it cheap! 4.25/5
Another must have at any Teochew Porridge place is that vat of braising sauce with various poricine parts stewing in its goodness. A perfectly balanced and fragrant braising sauce is not easy to achieve and once you have it, you could use it for lot of stuff and it would all taste good. I jokingly asked if Ah Pek’s braising sauce has remained in the pot for the years that he has been in business and he curtly told me that he washes it out completely at the end of the week. Well, there goes that urban legend! 4.25/5
Conclusion
If you love Teochew Porridge, this is one of those stalls that you just have to visit because you can’t really discuss Teochew Porridge if you have not eaten here. It’s too bad I got there after 1pm so the steamed fish have all sold out. Many of my kakis tell me those are the die die must try dishes!

Linda has been a painter for over 30 years. In 2007 she took a workshop in Moku Hanga, Japanese watercolor woodblock printmaking, and fell in love with all parts of the process: designing an image, carving the blocks and experimenting with colors while proof printing, refining the blocks and ink colors, eventually printing the image. This is a simple low-tech form of printmaking, using brushes to apply watercolor paints and printing with a hand-held baren. This has now become her primary medium.
In search for balance, energy, peace and connection to the earth, she spends as much time as possible out of doors, hiking, cross-country skiing, kayaking, gardening and painting or observing birds in their habitats in New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Downeast Maine and coastal New Brunswick, Canada. This interaction with the natural world is the source of her inspiration.
Look for Linda at Arts in the Park, Belfast on July 12 and 13, 2014..

25. Understanding National Stalinism: A Comparative Approach to the History of Romanian CommunismJul 07, 2011
In this paper, the author examines the case of the Romanian Communist Party (RCP) and its most recent leader. Until the violent upheaval of December 1989, the RCP epitomized adamant anti-reformism. Its complete collapse cannot be explained without reference to its Obstinate refusal to engage in de-Stalinization. more

17. National Identity and Cultural Politics under Ceausescu: An Example from PhilosophyJul 07, 2011
This author's objective is to investigate how intellectual activity in Romania under Ceausescu contributed to reproducing an ideology in which "the nation" had pride of place. Much as had occurred in the period between the two World Wars, Romanian intellectuals debating with one another helped to strengthen a national ideology; their actions, and not simply Ceausescu's much-invoked "manipulation of nationalism to promote legitimacy" contributed to fortifying the idea of the nation and undermining the discourse of Marxism-Leninism on which Romania's socialist system supposedly rested. moreDustin Leftwich, who is charged in the killing of Seaman High School graduate Brenna Morgart, now faces a charge of capital murder in the 18-year-old’s death, District Attorney Chad Taylor said in court Wednesday.
On Wednesday morning, Taylor handed an amended criminal complaint to Shawnee County District Court Judge Cheryl Kingfisher that included the count of capital murder.
The amended criminal complaint also carries the additional count of rape, the charge that qualifies the capital murder count, Taylor told Kingfisher. The victim in the rape is the slaying victim, according to court records.
“We will be seeking a charge of capital murder against the defendant,” Taylor said.
If Leftwich were convicted of capital murder, a jury then would have to decide whether to recommend the death penalty. If the jury recommended the death penalty, the judge would make the final decision on whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison without parole.
In Kansas, a premeditated murder committed during a rape is one of seven offenses when a capital murder charge is applicable.
Other offenses are kidnapping for ransom, a contract killing, killing by an inmate, killing of a law enforcement officer, killing more than one victim and killing a child younger than 14 during a kidnapping with the intent to commit a sex offense.
A lengthy motions hearing was scheduled for Wednesday. Instead, the hearing lasted just several minutes.
Word of the capital murder filing met no reaction from the nine supporters of the victim and four supporters of Leftwich. Also seated in the gallery were two Shawnee County sheriff’s detectives who investigated the case.
During the hearing, Leftwich, 21, sat between defense attorneys Kathleen Ambrosio and Joe Huerter. Also prosecuting the case is chief deputy district attorney Jacqie Spradling.
Leftwich previously was charged with premeditated first-degree murder in Morgart's May 25 death. Morgart was a homecoming queen and Sunday school teacher who graduated magna cum laude five days earlier from Seaman High School.
After the hearing, Taylor said his office decided to file the capital murder charge "when we received further results in the investigation." He declined to elaborate on what the results were.
On July 16, the judge had ruled prosecutors could conduct DNA testing on potential evidence. The evidence included possible seminal fluid and blood found on underwear, a rape kit, and finger swipe marks on the inside of a vehicle trunk.
Results of that testing haven't been disclosed.
Besides the murder and rape charges, Leftwich also is charged with aggravated kidnapping of Morgart, as well as aggravated battery of Morgart and misdemeanor reporting false information tied to a vehicular accident in connection with her death.
Morgart, who had been a member of the Seaman cross-country team, was reported missing about 3:45 p.m. May 25 when she failed to return after going on a jog about 10 a.m. from her home near N.W. 62nd and Brickyard Road.
Her body was found in a field later that day in the 6600 block of N.W. Huxman Road. That was three miles from the 6800 block of N.W. Jennings Road, where sheriff’s officials said she was hit by a vehicle.
Two more charges stem from a separate incident on June 29, 2011, in which Leftwich is charged with using a vehicle against an unidentified 14-year-old.
In that incident, Leftwich is charged with aggravated assault with a vehicle and aggravated battery, according to court records.
Leftwich next will appear at a motions hearing on Jan. 10.
An eye for an eye...
Or do things like they do in China.
Life without parole. Make him sit in a cell and think about what he has done for the rest of his natural life.
But really, the death penalty is so primitive and unnecessary in an advanced society like ours. The death penalty is simply revenge.
In China they put a bullet in their head, & charge their family for the bullet.
"The death penalty is simply revenge." The same could be said about life without parole.
Death penalty sentence will still give him several years in prison to think about it.
I just doubt that he will give much thought to it - but we can give it a chance while the long process drags out.
Kansas will never ever ever execute anyone. Look how long we have had the death penalty and we dont even have one ready to go. Apparently we need to get with Florida and Texas, copy their laws and get to work.
It seems our laws dont work well here...maybe because our legislature is so messed up with ding dongs they just cant get the job done. But it could be our courts here too, they take forever and allow way to many continued court dates that drag things out for 20 years.
Is that it is the criminal justice system and not the victim justice system. Another is that judges can declare laws passed by our elected representatives unconstitutional. I agree that judges are also on the ballot for retention but having the ability to strike down a law instead of just using it to weigh the facts and determine guilt or innocence takes a lot of power away from the people.
Hope he does the same to the rapist for the Highland Park incident.
(Too painful for relatives to read about this, so I won't say more)
He's still just FACING charges? Justice is: whatever he did to her should be repeated on him daily, for the rest of his life!
Shifty and ABE make good points.
It will be interesting to see what happens with this case. Going for a capital murder charge takes some guts.
As far as the article goes, why did the author include this info-"Morgart, who was a homecoming queen and Sunday school teacher who graduated magna cum laude May 20 from Seaman High School."? This is the type of stuff that disgusts me about journalism, give us the facts. A victim is a victim no matter their background.
"better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer"- Blackstones formulation
Just as an alternative view to trigger some introspection on this and to remind everyone why we have a careful system that does take so long for justice to be served. None of use really want to live in a society where the police drag a person out of their home and shoot them as we have in other societies.
That said, I am a proponent of the death penalty and this case seems to fit the law. I will not loose any sleep if this guy is tried, found guilty and executed.
You should really google "judicial review" or "Marbury v. Madison" - it doesn't sound like you understand how our government was designed.
Those are facts. Morgart was a homecoming queen and Sunday school teacher who graduated magna cum laude May 20 from Seaman High School. She was a "true" victim who was simply jogging when attacked.
I think you will agree that she is a very different victim from the "victim" gang member who was standing on a street corner slinging drugs when they were shot by a competing gang member.
Including the facts puts the story into perspective and allows us all to understand the horror that this family is going through. It also makes you value the time you have with your own family and makes you truly appreciate them.
Understanding and disagreeing are two different concepts. When someone who reported herself as the victim of a sexual assault cannot use the word "rape" while testifying because it might prejudice the jury, the scales have swung too far. Don't make assumptions. :>)
What do you know about China....you read that online somewhere? You know being an angry old white guy is not that unusual and frankly is getting kind of pitiful.
anyway
so many rumors about what happened, but still the charges do not reflect the rumors.
If the rumors I've heard about what really happened are true, and if what people who know this kid tell me is true, then our society may very well be better off without him.
Just so you know.. I'm a 22 year old FEMALE.
I've been to China.
My dad lived there for 3 years.
I've met a lot of people.
I've heard a lot of factual stories.
So how exactly am I pitiful?
What do YOU know about China & the way they run things??
The death penalty is put out there to get them to plea bargain for life without parole.
Kinda knew this charge was coming. What a sick, sick monster. He needs to spend the remainder of his pitiful life in solitary. Just a 6x6 cage, no human contact, no TV, no radio, no reading material, until he dies & goes to h#!!
As long Life means no more parole hearings or any other attempts to get out of prison using the "system" and the leaves the prison feet first in a box.
"China commonly employs to."
To my knowledge no one has ever been killed from te death penalty. And if he is sentenced to death, he wil sit and think about what he did and know he's going to be killed. It's a win win.
The Death Penalty is "inappropriate"?
Was in "inappropriate" for what he did to poor Brenna? Anything less would be criminal in itself.
I am not questioning the validity of your points about capital punishment in China ...
But don't ever cite Wikipedia as the source of your evidence. Wikipedia articles are "contributed" by and "updated" by users ... meaning anyone can say anything on Wikipedia until someone changes it.
For example, on the KState basketball page it previously said that the Wildcats play homes games at "Allen Fieldhouse West".
Find a better souce to back up your arguments.
Death would be to good for him but appropriate
I agree with ya DJquick1, they should make sentences fit the crime & make them public.
Nothing deters crime like humiliation & graphic memories of what your future could be if you continue to make bad choices in life.
Wiki was just the first site that popped up when I was looking for some way of proving my point. I realize that what is said can be altered by anyone, but it stated everything I had been taught while in China.
"While China introduced lethal injections in the late 90′s."
but you've been listening to a few too many of your favorite talk show hosts. I was actually in the public square in Kuwait City when a couple of guys who killed their wives were beheaded. And executions are much more common in Saudi than in liberal little Kuwait.
Yeah, that's it ZCKS, I've lived in the middle east for about a decade. I think I may know just a teentsy bit more about "sharia controlled countries" than you do, based on that experience. But hey, Sean and Rush may know more.
But DJQuik does bring up an interesting point. Suppose "Warden Howdy" told Leftwich's roomie "there's a parole in his pants, do you think you can find it?" I guarantee Leftwich would have the sort of last few hours that his victim did.
Taliban Sharia Law and Oklahoma's death penalty. And my insistence on due process. So I'm a procedural kind of guy. I should probably thank you for that, but I don't think you meant it as a compliment. It's better than being called a "fascist" or a "racist" (both things some other posters have called me in the last month) at any rate. And you DID assign me the Skipper's role in our Gilligan's Island analogy ... .The first
step is to perform an initial survey in which the goal is to identify
if any archaeological
sites are in the area. This can be accomplished in several
ways.
One way is
to scan the ground for artifacts, or perform a surface inspection. Plowed
fields are often the easiest places to spot artifacts. If a cluster of
artifacts are found near one another, this could be identified as a site.
Another method
to search for sites is to dig holes about 30 centimeters in diameter (the
width of a shovel, or about 1 foot) in order to spot artifacts buried
in the ground. In Alabama the Alabama Historical Commission recommends
that shovel tests must be spaced 30 meters apart in areas with a high
potential for uncovering artifacts and 60 meters in areas with a low potential
for recovering artifacts.
When artifacts
are found, they are counted and their location is marked on a map. Areas
where lots of artifacts are found may be considered an archaeological
site.
Roll
your cursor over the above picture to see a difference in how
the area surrounding a site might look today versus how it may have looked
in the past.
The dark
soil area near the center of the picture is a clue to archaeologists of
where the village was located. Also, notice the fish dam, or fish wier.
This was used by Native Americans to enable them to catch fish.
step, Step 2Aug. 4, 1964 R. G. LOVE PRESSURE SENSING APPARATUS Filed Oct. 10. 1960 INVENTOR.
ROBERT 6. LOVE AGENT United States Patent 3,142,988 PRESSURE SENSING APPARATUS Robert G. Love, Duncan, Okla, assignor to Halliburton Company, Duncan, Okla, a corporation of Delaware Filed Oct. 10, 1960, Ser. No. 61,491 2 Claims. (Cl. 73-388) This invention relates generally to apparatus for determining the pressure of fluid in a pipe or the like. More particularly, it relates to pressure sensing apparatus which is suitable for use in a null-balance pressure determining system.
Null-balance systems for determining pressures have, in the past, proved generally satisfactory. One such system is described in detail by C. B. Moore in a paper entitled The Solution of Instrumentation Problem by the Pneumatic Null Balance Method, appearing at pages 598-603 of the September 1945 issue of Instruments magazine. That disclosure is hereby made a part of this application.
The type of sensing element or pressure tap used in such systems have, for the most part, been of the flat diaphragm type. V The flat diaphragm type has proved satisfactory where either the pressure of a static fluid is to be determined or where the fluid container is of relatively larger diameter.
Recently, however, situations have been encountered where it is necessary to determine the pressure of fluid flowing in pipes of relatively small diameter. In some of these situations, the pressure of fluids such as cement slurries or other materials which tend to harden or settle out in any irregularities in the pipe, must be determined. Obviously, a flat diaphragm installed in the pipe, particularly if the pipe diameter is small, will create irregularities. It follows then that erroneous results are obtained due to the settling out or hardening of the foreign materials about the diaphragm of the pressure tap.
Certain other situations, such as where the viscosity of the fluid was to be determined, have been encountered wherein laminar flow of the fluid in the pipe must be maintained. In these situations, no irregularities can be tolerated that would cause turbulent flow in the pipe.
It is therefore one object of this invention to provide improved pressure sensing apparatus for use in determining the pressure of fluid in a pipe or the like.
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved pressure tap having a continuous uninterrupted surface exposed to the pressure medium suitable for use with pneumatic null-balance systems.
This invention provides a pressure sensing device or pressure tap which includes a body member having a fluid passageway therein exposed to the fluid of which the pressure is to be determined. An element of resilient material is provided which is disposed along at least a portion of the wall of the passageway separating the passageway from a chamber formed in the body member. Some means, such as the nozzle of the null-balance system, is provided to sense the deflection of the resilient element when pressure is applied thereto. Suitable instrumentation may be provided if desired to indicate directly the pressure of the fluid in the pipe.
The foregoing and additional objects and advantages of the invention will become more apparent when read in conjunction with the following description wherein similar characters refer to similar parts in all views and wherein:
FIGURE 1 illustrates partly in schematic and partly in cross section a pressure tap constructed in accordance with the invention installed in a pneumatic null-balance system.
FIGURE 2 is a cross-sectional view of the pressure tap taken along line 22 of FIGURE 1.
3,142,988 Patented Aug. 4., 1964 Referring first to FIGURE 1, shown therein is a pressure tap constructed in accordance with the invention connected in a pneumatic null-balance system. The pressure tap includes a body member 1 which is connected between pipe sections designated 2 and 3.
A tube 4 is located ina bore extending through the body member 1 between pipe sections 2 and 3 thus affording a continuous fluid passageway therethrough. A portion of the side wall of the tube 4 has been removed forming a lateral opening 5 therein. A sleeve 6 of resilient material encircles a portion of and is bonded to the tube 4. The sleeve 6 is arranged whereby it provides a smooth and continuous interior surface with the interior of the tube 4, completely filling the lateral opening 5. The resilient material used should be compatible with the fluid flowing therethrough and should be of a type that exhibits no hysteresis. The preferred material is a natural or synthetic rubber compound although many others may be used.
A pontion of the interior of the body member 1 has been relieved thus providing a chamber A when the tube 4 is installed therein. The chamber A is located adjacent the sleeve 6 of resilient material, and the thickened portion of the sleeve 6 which fills the lateral opening 5 constitutes a diaphragm. The chamber A is at least suflicient in size to contain the covered opening 5 in the tube 4. As shown in FIGURE 2, the chamber A completely encircles the tube 4, but this is not necessary to the operation of the device.
A nozzle 10 is located in a port 9 which extends through the wall of the body member 1 into chamber A. The outlet of the nozzle 10 is positioned adjacent the resilient diaphragm and at the approximate center of the covered opening 5 in the tube 4. The inlet of the nozzle 10 is connected to an air supply pipe 11 which is connected to a conventional air booster pilot 15. The pilot 15 has a vent 16.
A partially threaded port 7 extends through the wall of the body member 1 providing for communication with the chamber A. A pipe section 8 is threaded into the port 7. Connected to the pipe section 8 are pipe sections 12 and 14. Pipe section 12 is connected to the air booster pilot 15 and pipe section 14 is connected to a gage or pressure recording device 17.
A pipe 13 connects the air booster pilot 15 with a conventional source of pressurized air such as an air compressor 18. The air booster pilot 15 is a commercially available device which is used in the preferred combination to further increase the overall accuracy thereof. One type of such device is described in US. Patent No. 2,5 16,333.
In operation, the pressure tap is installed in a system containing fluid under pressure. Air or other suitable fluid is supplied through the pipe 13 to the booster pilot 15. In the booster pilot 15, the air stream is divided into two output streams which have slightly different pressures. The higher pressure stream flows through pipe 11 and nozzle 10 into chamber A. The stream having a slightly lower pressure fills pipe sections 12, 8, and 14. The vent 16 in the booster pilot 15 is associated with the low pressure air stream and permits the escape of a small quantity of air to the atmosphere. The air escaping from the system allows the higher pressure air in the pipe 11 to flow continually through the nozzle 10 into chamber A and through pipe sections 8 and 12 to the vent 16 in the booster pilot 15.
Pressure applied to the fluid in the pipes 2 and 3 and the tube 4 deflects the resilient diaphragm portion of the sleeve 6 covering the opening 5 in the tube 4 outwardly, reducing the clearance between the outlet of the nozzle 10 and the surface of the resilient diaphragm 6. When the clearance is thus reduced, less air can flow from the nozzle 10. This results in a pressure increase in pipe 11 and, due to the arrangement of the air pressure system, in a proportional increase in the air in pipe sections 8, 12, and 14. The pressure increase therein is reflected as an increase in the reading of the pressure read-out instrument 17 which is connected to pipe section 14. The pressure read-out instrument 17 would, of course, be calibrated and have graduations corresponding to the pressure of fluid in the tube 4.
When the pressure increases in pipe section 8 and the chamber A, the resilient diaphragm covering the lateral opening is restored to its initial position. This deflection and restoration of the resilient material occurs almost instantaneously and is so slight that little if any change is effected in the fluid flow passageway in the tube 4.
As may be seen from the foregoing description, a pressure tap constructed in accordance with the invention provides a continuous uninterrupted flow passage. As previously pointed out, this is a very important and necessary feature when it is desired to measure the pressure of a flowing fluid for the purpose of determining the viscosity of the fluid or when handling fluids which tend to harden or settle-out in any irregularities in the system.
It should be be understood that the foregoing description is by way of example only and that many variations and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the annexed claims.
I claim:
1. In pneumatic, null-balance apparatus for determining the pressure of fluid in a pipe or the like having means for supplying air under pressure and a pressure read-out instrument, the combination of a body member having a bore therethrough connected in said pipe, a tube mounted in a said bore so that its interior is in communication with said pipe, said tube having a lateral opening in one sidewall thereof, a resilient sleeve encircling said tube, said 4 sleeve having a resilient diaphragm filling said opening whereby said sleeve member has a continuous interior surface, said body member having a portion of enlarged diameter in said bore forming a chamber with said tube, said body member also having a pair of spaced-apart ports extending into said chamber, a nozzle mounted in one of said ports, said nozzle having its outlet positioned adjacent the resilient diaphragm filling said opening and having its inlet connected to said air supply, and a pipe connecting the other port with the air supply means and with said read-out instrument.
2. Pressure sensing apparatus, comprising in combination: a body member having a bore, a tube in the bore forming a fluid passageway of constant size, said tube having a lateral opening, a resilient sleeve encircling said tube, said sleeve having a resilient diaphragm filling said lateral opening and having an inner surface flush with the inner surface of the tube, means on the body member cooperating with said sleeve to define an annular chamber therebetween, the chamber having spaced ports, and a fluid discharge nozzle in one of said ports extending into said chamber and having an outlet adjacent said diaphragm.

PRESS CONFERENCE BY GEORGIA
PRESS CONFERENCE BY GEORGIA
The Permanent Representative of Georgia to the United Nations, Irakli Alasania, briefed correspondents at Headquarters this afternoon in the wake of the Security Council’s decision to extend for six months the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG).
Mr. Alasania said that the Georgian side welcomed the extension of the mandate and was very pleased that the resolution contained a few new segments, one of which was that the situation in the upper Abkhazia region had been assessed as stable, contrary to the view of one Council member. The second important segment, paragraph 10, concerned the reliable timeframe in which the sides should create the security environment for the return of internally displaced persons.
While he welcomed those new segments, he said that the text had failed to reflect some new developments, particularly the Georgian President’s peace initiative of 28 March. The proposal to the Abkhaz side envisaged the setting up of a joint free economic zone in the Gali and Ochamchire districts, guaranteed Abkhaz representation in central executive and legislative bodies, and the establishment of a constitutionally guaranteed position of Vice-President of Georgia for the ethnically Abkhaz representative, who would be delegated a right of veto for all decisions concerning Abkhazia status and rights.
It had been underlined repeatedly that the Georgian authorities would offer Abkhazia “wide federalism”, as well as the necessary preconditions for developing their culture, language and national identity, he said. Abkhazia would enjoy unlimited autonomy within Georgia’s internationally recognized borders. The President’s initiative also called on the international community, including the Russian Federation, to play a fundamental role in ensuring those guarantees. Respective ministries had been instructed to inform the Abkhaz side about the new initiative and facilitate intensification of direct links between the two sides.
He added that success of the peace initiative depended on the international community’s more active involvement, including that of the Russian Federation, in the ongoing United Nations-led comprehensive assessment of the peace process.
The State Minister for Reintegration of Georgia had been entrusted with the task of elaborating a special programme to ensure reintegration of former combatants, their retraining and employment. Also by the President’s instruction, inter-governmental working groups on legal, economic and political issues had been set up. Their aim was to thoroughly process the new peace initiative, develop a plan for its implementation, enter into a direct dialogue with the de facto authorities and involve the international community in the process.
He said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia maintained that the new peace proposals opened up completely new perspectives for peaceful conflict resolution, created a unique mechanism for the protection of rights of national minorities in Georgia and provided additional opportunities for the engagement of the international community in the conflict resolution process. Indeed, the Georgian authorities’ new peace initiative provided the only reasonable and peaceful alternative to the “dangerous and provocative steps recently masterminded by the external forces in the conflict zones”.
Expressing gratitude to the majority of Security Council members who had welcomed the President’s comprehensive peace initiative, he reiterated his country’s wish to see the Russian Federation as a partner in peacemaking. Unquestionably, that was in both countries’ mutual interest, and he appealed to the Russian Federation to support Georgia’s new peace initiative, in order to build a solid foundation for peace and stability in the greater Caucasus region.
Responding to correspondents’ questions, he said that unlimited autonomy for the people of Abkhazia meant the Abkhaz people would have their say in all subjects of concern to their autonomous status within a unified Georgian State. It meant that they would have foreign trade rights, self-government, legislative and executive organs, and be represented at the federal or central government agencies. The vice-presidential post meant they would have a say in foreign and other matters to be decided by Georgia. The proposal effectively gave them “unlimited autonomy within the internationally recognized borders of Georgia”.
Georgia was open to negotiating with the Abkhaz side; it was not taking any unilateral steps, he added.
Asked to comment on reports that the leader of the Abkhaz de facto entity had already rejected the proposal, he said he thought the main target of the initiative was not only the de facto leader, but the Abkhaz ethnic group. The proposal aimed to show that Georgia was not a threat to them and that it was really willing to take into account their security and other legitimate concerns, which would later be enshrined in constitutional changes.
He added that he would have anticipated that reaction initially. What counted was how to deal in direct talks with the Abkhaz side and how to explain to them what the offer would do for the Abkhaz nation. Such a direct dialogue would be planned soon.
As for reports of the opening of embassies and the resumption of Russian flights into Abkhazia, he said the opening of embassies did not deserve serious discussion. He was not aware that the Russian side had opened up a direct air link to the Abkhaz side. In fact, that was impossible because it required Georgian permission as well. He did not know if that was true or not, but clearly, that would be illegitimate if it was so.
Asked how the Georgian proposal to Abkhazia compared to Serbia’s final proposal to Kosovo, he said he could not say anything about that because “we don’t see any connection and we don’t track any analogies”. It was the offer of the Georgian President to the separatist regime, based solely on Georgia’s national security interests and taking into account the security interest of the Abkhaz nation, and Abkhaz ethnic group. “So we don’t see any comparisons”.
To further questions about air travel and airports, he said there were no active airports; all had been closed in 1993 by presidential decree. However, as part of the new plan, Georgia was offering to open up an airport, thereby opening up the Abkhaz economy to foreign trade. UNOMIG was using helicopters and the existing airport.
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin had talked about some provocative flights over so-called Abkhazia airspace, another correspondent noted, asking for Mr. Alasania’s response.
Mr. Alasania said that it was Georgian airspace, adding “clearly, we are concerned whenever there are intrusions from the Russian Federation airspace”. Last year, he recalled, there had been incidents involving Russian air assaults on Georgian sovereign territory -– bombings, then intrusions of the Russian military –- “so clearly, we are very concerned about that and we are encouraging UNOMIG to expand its observation power on the ground to detect those kind of violations”.
He said, in response to another question, that the comprehensive review by the Secretariat was under way and should be completed in June. That impartial observation should lead to more constructive suggestions about how to change the existing format into a more productive and effective one. The Georgian President’s proposal had been timely and, hopefully, the Russian Federation would be part of the solution.
As for how the message was being spread through Abkhazia, given the State-controlled media, he said that word of mouth was one way, and noted that there were some radio transmissions and some television stations transmitting to parts of Abkhazia. Not only was media access controlled, but one member of the Security Council had blocked acknowledgement in the resolution of Georgia’s peace initiative. So, there were a lot of obstacles, but there would be more success once the bilateral track was expanded with the Abkhaz side.

It was given a radio collar before it was set free so it can be tracked as it roams the forest where it grew up.
There are thought to be only about 400 Siberian tigers left in the wild, with poaching for their skins and body parts one of the greatest threats they face.
Alarm calls
The rescued animal, whose age is put at from eight to 10 years, was found by the students as they hiked in the woods last week.
Hearing it roaring in distress they went to see what had happened and found it with the snare wrapped around its body.
The rescue team anaesthetised the tiger, and found that although it had numerous abrasions from the snare it appeared otherwise healthy.
They took it to a holding area to make sure it had no internal injuries, before fitting it with the collar to enable WCS scientists to track it as part of a long-term study aimed at giving the tigers better protection.
Back to the forest
John Goodrich of WCS said: "The release went well. The tiger leapt from his cage about a minute after the door was opened.
"He then bounded about 20 metres (65 feet) into the forest, stopped, turned and growled, before walking calmly away."
There are thought to have been about 100,000 tigers in 1900, stretching from eastern Asia to Turkey.
Conservationists believe their numbers have fallen by more than 90% since then, leaving about 5-7,000 animals in the wild.
In that time three sub-species have become extinct - the Java, Bali and Caspian tigers.
The South China tiger is now reduced to an estimated 20-30 individuals, with the Siberian (known also as the Amur tiger: it lives in China and North Korea as well as the Russian far east) the next most threatened.
Poachers sell their body parts for use in traditional far eastern medicine, and the skins always fetch a good price.Is the lust for presidential power in the genes?
posted at 3:31 pm on August 5, 2012 by Jazz Shaw
Is the desire to wield power over the masses rooted in a person’s genes? A rather frivolous but fun question which is being brought to light by an aspiring teenage genealogist. She has traced the roots of all of the US presidents from Washington to Obama and dug up a rather surprising common ancestor for almost all of.
Miss D’Avignon also found out that she is an 18th cousin to Barack Obama. (Sorry about that, young lady.) But is it really that remarkable that nearly all of the presidents share a common ancestor from the 12th century? There are lots of bottlenecks in humanity’s genetic history and they come from some fairly eclectic corners. It was previously announced that one in every 200 men are direct descendents from Ghengis Khan. Of course, the same study indicated that there was an equal likelihood that the same percentage of people could be directly descended from some anonymous goat herder in the Ukraine that nobody has ever heard of.
For many – though certainly not all – of the presidents, there is also the matter of entrenched social status. Power and money go hand in hand and that was even more true in medieval times than today. Families rose to power and tended to hang on to it. Those same families produced not only captains of industry but political leaders. Think of the Rockefeller family and all their ilk for only one example. So the genes might not be as big of a driving factor as the inheritance of wealth and influence.
But who’s to say? Maybe there is something to this. We’ve long acknowledged that there are “Type A” and “Type B” personalities. Does that run in families or is it completely random? The only loser here appears to be Van Buren. But on the plus side, his family can at least lay claim to not being related to Barack Ob

…one of the most despised kings in all of English history.
The Royal Family also considers his name “cursed” or “jinxed.” The story goes that Princess Diana wanted to name Prince William “John,” but the Queen refused because of the sordid association with King John and the tragedy that has befallen the very few of the royal blood with the misfortune of carrying his name.
For example, King George V and his wife, Queen Mary, had a son named John, who was the uncle of Queen Elizabeth II. Prince John was their youngest child and 5th son. He was an epileptic for most of his short life, segregated from the family, and died at the age of 13.
PS: Axe, I was getting ready to write, “Axe, this is one English royal history lesson that I cannot reduce to ‘pecker placement,’ but that’s not entirely true on second thought. The entirety of English history — no, human history — might indeed be different because of pecker placement. King John was Richard the Lionheart’s younger brother. D!ck liked, well, um, d!cks. In the entirety of his reign, he spent no more than 6 months in his realm with his wife, Berengaria. He liked his “boys’ years out” during The Crusades. For some of the participants, one might even argue that The Crusades were a forerunner to the Gay Pride Parade in The Castro District in San Fran.
If Old Dick had stayed on the throne with his scepter in his hand, instead of letting someone else take aim at his human “throne” while another played with his human “scepter,” it is very likely that John wouldn’t have been able to seize the English throne, become a tyrant, fail miserably, and be forced to sign the Magna Carta.
I knew you’d love it!

I’ll repeat my comment from the headlines. There is basically nothing to this.
This isn’t a surprising or special finding, and has nothing to do with wanting power. The most recent common ancestor of almost every human alive today probably lived around 2000 years ago, and the most recent common ancestor of almost every person of European descent probably lived around 1200 years ago. See here, for example:. This is because populations mix very quickly as the generations go by.
So it’s likely that there are many people who lived at the time of King John (the 1100′s) who are common ancestors of all Presidents. And it’s likely that most of us (at least those of us of European descent) are descended from King John and many others from that time. The only way King John is special in this regard is that he probably has more descendants due to wealth, but the same would go for any wealthy person living in Europe at the time. And the Presidents are special in this regard at all, since this probably applies to most of our population.

circa 1346, 45-50% of the western european population died due the the black death. in southern france (john’s mother was probably born in bordeaux) and spain it was more like 75%- smaller gene pool from which most western europeans are descended. the wealthy and of course the aristocracy were more likely to have survived and more likely to have married many times producing numerous offspring- because that’s what cemented power and gained one land-advantageous marriage and baby making.
most of the kings were just neer do wells who did whatever they wanted, manipulated by others, and were only expected to have offspring. they didn’t spend a nanosecond dissecting all the philosophical angles of why they had power – they didn’t have to- they had their power by divine right in the minds of everyone.
so – does this mean that white people from western europe ,seeing how we’re all descended from king john have the right to rule over everyone else due to genetics?
but really, now we’re dragging up precocious children to “prove” bull crap points about power mad narcissists. what’s the point- sociopathy and will to have power over can’t be bad or be criticized when it’s genetic? sounds like a white supremacist to me….
mittens on August 5, 2012 at 4:07 PM

Glenn Jericho on August 5, 2012 at 4:39 PM
As tneloms pointed out the gene pool was smaller.
Also How many people do you think you’re related to at that time? Simple math, how many parents do you have?
No step-parents, biological only. 2 right? they also have 2 so four grand parents, eight great grandparents sixteen great-great grand parents and so on.
King John I reigned from 1199-1216, around 800 years ago. I’ve only traced parts of my family back to 1435 Switzerland, but thats still gives me a pool of 902 family members to work out an average of 4 generations per hundred years. Which comes to 32 generations.
If all you do is figure the math of 2×2=4, 4×2=8 and so on by the 32nd generation you get 2,147,483,648 individuals, and the estimated population of the world in 1200AD was only around 360 million. yeah….. I’d say mathmatically the odds are pretty good that the presidents are all related.
Bigkatt on August 5, 2012 at 4:56 PM
Exactly. King John is responsible for many things (hey, at least because he made the barons so upset, we got the Magna Carta!), but it is plain silly to say the desire for presidential power came from him, considering the number of his descendants.

Texas Gal on August 5, 2012 at 8:08 PM
My family and I have traced portions of our family to the late 1500’s. No royalty has popped up, but a couple of minor interesting names have – nothing worth noting.
I don’t doubt that if you go back far enough many of us – let alone US presidents – would be related to each other. I mean, 18th cousins?! We’re all cousins when you go back far enough, and between the life expectancy of royalty and the wealthy, the number of children people typically had beyond the last century and the numbers of people who died in wars, dieseases, etc., not to mention that population growth didn’t exponentially occur until around the industrial revolution, it’s just a matter of generations to find enough links. And, depending upon where your ancestors lived, sometimes the connections are even closer.
I have a couple of ancestors from the 1800’s who married their cousins. A few years ago I ‘met’ an Aussie online in a message board who turned out to be a very distant relative via our shared Cajun heritage three hundred years removed. We shared the same grandparents in one line. I’ve got two good friends back home in Louisiana that I know I’m distantly related to… it’s south Lousiana… small isolated gene pool for a number of generations.
It’s kinda neat to find out famous and important historical figures one is related to, but in the end it doesn’t amount to much of anything except if you’re tracking medical/health issues.
I know there are at least two or three other posters on HA who are from Louisiana and I can safely suspect that I’m distantly related to all of them if they can trace any of their ancestry to south Louisiana and Acadie.
Logus on August 5, 2012 at 10:27 PM
I’ve always thought that if you have true power, confidence, self-esteem, you just have it, it comes from within and doesn’t matter whether you come from a family that has money. Likewise, I’ve also considered that people who obsessively crave power and fame are void inside of true power, confidence and self-esteem and crave the the faux power and attention to fill up that inner hole.
Oh yeah, and if you go back far enough, aren’t we all related?

PersonFromPorlock on August 6, 2012 at 7:21 PMHouston - Compaq Computer PC sales decreased 18 percent in the first quarter, reaching $3.5 billion, compared with $4.3 billion in the year-ago period, sequentially, revenue for this segment was off 6 percent in the first quarter.
Compaq's Access segment, the portion of the company dealing in consumer PCs, posted an operating loss of $36 million in the three months, ended March 31, compared with a loss of $110 million in the same period in 2001. The first quarter included a sequential operating improvement of $33 million over the fourth quarter.
Compaq attributed the reduced operating loss in the first quarter to continued customer acceptance of new products and continued business model improvements.
Overall, company revenue for the first quarter was $7.7 billion, down from $9.1 billion in the year-ago three months. Year-ago revenue was restated to reflect the new revenue accounting method.
Net income for the first quarter was $44 million, compared with a loss of $91 million year over year. Including an accounting charge of $222 million in the year-ago period, the net loss for that quarter was $131 million.
In this year's first quarter, Compaq earned $65 million, excluding merger costs, down from $214 million in the year-ago period, which excluded restructuring charges.
Gross margin in the first quarter was flat sequentially at 20.6 percent, reflecting an improved product mix in the Access segment.
First-quarter operating expenses were $1.4 billion, a sequential reduction of $101 million, but down $359 million year over year. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of operating expense reductions, said Compaq.
Compaq said it was not distracted in the first quarter by delays in the closing of its merger with Hewlett-Packard. The company said it expects the merger to move forward as planned.Date: 04/02/2002 at 17:19:36

Because there are two of them, (as opposed to the three sides of a

Motionless in White Disrupted Justin Timberlake With ‘Abigail’ — Video Premiere
One look at Scranton, Pa.s Motionless in White and it’s safe to say that the brooding metalcore outfit aren’t out to make a fluffy cheerful video. ‘Abigail’ needed a haunting visual to match the song’s screams of fire and heresy. Frontman Chris “Motionless” Ceruli told Noisecreep the band was able to capture a modern take on the days of witch trials for ‘Abigail’ with the help of director Kevin Mcvey, which we are beyond proud to be premiering.
Ceruli described the performances in the video as “intense,” which may be a watered down way to describe the haunting imagery of bloody kisses from an aged priest and a young girl picking out the assailant that sexually assaulted her.

According to Ceruli, the blasting music needed to shoot the video actually intruded on the filming of ‘Now,’ a movie that was shooting in the alley just outside that stars pop darling Justin Timberlake. “They tried to get us to shut down, but ended up sending a [production assistant] upstairs with a walkie so we could shoot in between their shots,” Ceruli recalled in laughter.
“Apparently they were doing a very expensive, very ‘emotional’ part of the movie and could hear our performance outside. It’s funny to think that our music video was potentially halting production and ruining a major motion picture.”

No, you're not feeble....I'm with you on that. One of our cats gets her thrills by watching leaves falling to the ground outside our floor-length window, at least your cats were looking at a real bird!
I think those cat boys need something serious to do. Put them to work! ( I'm not sure cats can really do that's useful though? )
Your Mum is looking well and in the pink, her hair all nicely done. I hope her health continues to improve and that she had a lovely day. Daughter's long card is a beauty.
Yes, I watched that Coast programme with demonstration of crumbling chalk and thought of several other ways to spend an afternoon at the sea-side!
I like days where nothing happens - few and far between here! Yesterday I rescued a small bat from nextdoor's cat. Couldn't think why it was sitting glued to a spot just under the conservatory window and the bat was hanging under the cill. We put it safe on the first floor balcony inside a pot on its side till it got dark.
I love those kitties! Glad the glass door was there, though...
Feeble no, sensible yes! I love the way Cassius and Sirius do things together. Like twins. None of our cats have ever been that close to each other. The best we can hope for with Tiger and Topsy is that they tolerate each other. Barely.Errors
The Lisbon Earthquake
Disconnecting Events from Ideas
The Lisbon Earthquake Error is the belief that thought arises and exists in isolation from life.
One of the most dramatic examples of life influencing thought is the Lisbon Earthquake of 1755, which produced a disaster in Lisbon, did damage for hundreds of miles around, and sent a shock wave through the thought of all of Europe, both sacred and profane. We here briefly recapitulate the facts, and conclude with an extreme and recent example of the error.
What Happened
On All Saints' Day, 1 November 1755, about 9:30 in the morning, Lisbon felt the rumbling shock of an earthquake. After a brief pause, a devastating second shock, lasting two minutes, brought buildings down in a deafening roar of destruction. Shortly after this came a third shock causing further damage, and a cloud of dust settled like a fog over the city. Fires broke out, and became a general conflagration. Some people managed to escape to the waterfront. As they were embarking in flight from the ruined city, an hour after the earthquakes, the waters of the Tagus rose menacingly and poured in three great towering waves over its banks, breaking with tremendous impact on the Lisbon quays and foreshore. The harbor waters became unmanageable, and many small boats were lost. Here is a contemporary engraving:
Shocks were also felt, and considerable damage was done, at other places in Iberia and North Africa, southern France, Northern Italy, and Switzerland. The tsunami waves reached England by 2 PM, and the West Indies by 6 PM that evening, and waters were disturbed as far away as Scandinavia. But Lisbon bore the brunt. Much of the city was destroyed, and by sober modern estimates not less than 15,000 people lost their lives. Rumor at the time made the toll 30,000 or 60,000.
What Followed
The second shock was to European opinion. Theologists struggled to justify this obvious act of God as an intention of God, and to explain what guilt Lisbon's inhabitants had cumulatively incurred to merit such dramatic retribution. Further disasters were prophesied. This produced terror in the lower populace, and derision among the learned. But the learned too were affected. The 18th century had been a period of philosophical optimism. The discoveries of Newton and Leibniz promised rational explanations of the order of nature, somehow in harmony with the designs of God. Voltaire, the typical figure of the age and of the learned Reaction, had been deeply impressed by Newton while visiting in England, and continued to be an admirer of Leibniz after his return to France. It seemed to him that the mind of man, aided in his case by a deistic sense of a general and benign Providence, had taken the measure of the cosmos.
In all this he was suddenly undeceived. His entry into pessimism was made with a Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne, printed in censored form in 1756 and immediately arousing controversy, including a sharp correspondence with the young Rousseau, who found it blasphemous and unacceptable. A certain Louis de Beausobre defended the tout est bien school of thought in a book called Essai sur le Bonheur (1758). He did his best to reason away the earthquake. Men die, but men always die. God remains good.
Voltaire returned to the attack in 1759 with his viciously satirical novel Candide, in which the naive hero is instructed by his tutor Pangloss (representing the clerics of the age) as to why various unoffending persons deserved to die in a particularly sudden and horrible way. Here is the scene as Candide and Pangloss are approaching the harbor of Lisbon, among the passengers being an Anabaptist who had befriended Candide earlier in his travels:Half of the passengers, exhausted and violently seasick, were too miserable even to worry about their danger; but the others kept crying out in terror and praying. The sails were torn; the masts broke; the ship began to leak very badly. Those who could tried to keep her under control, but nobody know what ought to be done and nobody gave any orders. The Anabaptist was trying to help on deck when a brutal sailor struck him hard and sent him sprawling, so hard that on the recoil the wretch fell overboard headfirst and hung over the waters hooked up on a bit of broken mast. The kindly Anabaptist picked himself up and tried to rescue him, but in the effort of doing so he was himself thrown into the sea and was drowned in full view of the man he had saved, who let him perish without even giving him a look. Candide came up at this moment and saw his poor benefactor appear for the last time and then disappear forever. He wanted to throw himself off into the sea after him, but Pangloss stopped him, pointing out that the Tagus approach to Lisbon had been created on purpose for this Anabaptist to be drowned in it . . .
Voltaire's novel was published, and, as Kendrick puts it, "the whole tout est bien philosophy was thereby blown to pieces in company with poor Louis de Beausobre's book and everything else of the kind, to the accompaniment of the derisive laughter of literary Europe."
Take what side you like on the question of Leibniz's theodicy, and that side was vigorously argued. In public, at the time and for decades thereafter. Lisbon changed the map of 18th century thought.
The Error in Action
The memory of the Lisbon Earthquake has not been forgotten among historians of philosophy. Rather, it has been suppressed. In the Routledge Concise Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2001), we have this epitome of the thought of Voltaire:After his stay in England, Voltaire became interested in philosophical optimism, and his thinking reflected closely Newton's view of a divinely ordered human condition . . . This was reinforced for the young Voltaire by Leibnizian optimism, which offered the view that the material world, being necessarily the perfect creation of an omnipotent and beneficent God, was the "best's witness Voltaire's final abandonment of optimism and providentialism in favour of a more deterministically orientated position in which a much bleaker view of human life and destiny predominates . . .
In this universe of explication, either thought has other thought as its cause, or it has nothing as its cause. What in the 1750's led Voltaire to abandon previously held views? This author does not feel required to say. Thought gives way to thought, untrammeled by anything outside the realm of thought.
The fallacy here illustrated is not confined to philosophy. The archaeologists have their version. So do many other corners of the academy. The general error is departmental. It is the mistaking of a toolkit for a discipline. If put into words, it would run like this: "What we [philosophers, or whatever] uniquely do is sufficient to answer all questions of concern to us; we do not allow the intrusion of other factors, such as a historian might handle." This is nonsense. A discipline, a toolkit, is a way of doing certain things; it is not an equipment for the whole of life. Familiarity with the technica of philosophy [or whatever] is a contribution to the understanding of history. It does not replace the understanding of history.
At least, not in the best of all possible worlds.

I say surprised since I do not recall seeing any Notice of Death nor obituary in any of the Motoring Journals.
This seems a shame unless I have just not read it.
May her soul RIP.

I think she was remarkably courageous to go through the ordeal (including the public opprobrium) of a sex change at a time when such a thing was very rare, and some of the surgery involved apparently hadn't ever been performed before.

There is a letter from Yves Kaltenbach entitled 'Memories of Roberta Cowell' in the current (October 2013) edition of The Automobile. From the contents of the letter, it seems that there was an obituary in a previous edition, with a photo, although I don't know which month as I haven't bought this magazine before. It seems that Roberta, aged 54 at the time, did some test sessions behind the wheel of Tony Kitchener's Kitchmac F5000, although she never raced it.
#11
Posted 10 October 2013 - 13:31
Yes she did race the Kitchmac at least once. She competed in a Libre race at Rufforth in late August/early September 1972. Sadly, she spent a fair bit of time spinning (lots of room to spin at Rufforth) and ran near the back of the field. The novelty of a transgender racing driver merited a small article and picture in the Yorkshire Evening Post (or Evening Press, can't remember which one) on the following day. Roberta sported an open face helmet painted red with black spots, which I thought was quite neat. Sad to hear of her passing. A courageous lady, in more ways than one.

I've posted this letter before - published in an early wartime edition of Motor Sport:
Sir,
Having just received your October issue, I should first like to say thank you for "carrying on". I see that you would like to hear from readers, so having been a regular reader for five years, here you are. It probably will not interest anyone but will fill up the odd corner.
Whilst at school in 1934 at the age of fourteen, a classmate of mine told me a number of interesting insights about a sport, of which I had heard but knew little, namely motor racing, or as I now know it, "The Sport". My enthusiasm soon grew and I began to buy motoring papers. The following year I had given to me Barre Lyndon's book "Grand Prix", this really fired my enthusiasm, and I was soon reading every book and paper on motor-racing I could lay my hands on. At that time the nearest venue was Brooklands, but unfortunately the cost to attend a meeting was more than I ever possessed and I had no friends with cars, who were interested enough to transport me there, so my motor-racing had to come from reports in the journals.
In 1936 I saw a racing car "in the flesh" or should I say "in the metal" for the first time, that was an ERA at the Schoolboys' Exhibition. Later in the year, whilst staying at Brighton, I found that the Lewes Speed Trials were quite near, so off I went to find the venue. It was there that I first saw racing-cars in action, what a thrill! There was a "works" sv Austin, Hadley up, MG's, Alta's, Bugatti's, the Vauxhall Villiers and that marvellous piece of machinery, Fuzzi. After that meeting I thought something must be done.
Nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, what luck! The Crystal Palace circuit was opening almost on my doorstep, no need to worry about transport. At that opening meeting I think I must have been one of the first to go through the turnstiles and I am sure the last to come out. Since then I haven't missed a RRC fixture. During that year and 1938 I found a means of attending some other meetings, that was the bicycle, for as I had now gone to a Technical College my funds would not allow a powered means of transport. Nineteen hundred and thirty-seven saw me attending at Lewes, Brighton, and one or two practises at Brooklands. Race day still being a little beyond my pocket. At last! August Bank Holiday 1938 I was able to attend a Brooklands meeting, and since then the track has been like home to me. The next question was Donington, 130 odd miles away! The Donington GP was my objective and fortunately, due to the Germans coming over, I was able to persuade some friends with a car, that it really was worth while going, on which point we all heartily agreed afterwards, even though Hitler nearly messed things up.
At the beginning of this year opportunity knocked loudly at my door and I wasted no time in opening it. The opportunity was given to me by Motor Sport in the February issue, when they published a letter from a reader, asking for someone to help with his racing car at meetings and such like. I offered my assistance and was accepted and I can honestly say I have had an interesting and enjoyable time, consisting of doing a spot of work at a racing car works, working on a pukka racing car, and attending a meeting in one of the fastest road cars in Great Britain, plus an hundred and one interesting and enjoyable jobs, here I should like to thank both Motor Sport and the reader in question. Through the same source I have been able to attend Shelsley and Prescott and numerous other speed trials such as Poole and Wetherby, all of which had been out of my reach, and of course Brooklands meetings, not behind the fence, but right out in front, all things of which I had dreamed of way back in 1934, and if this ------ war had'nt started I could have looked forward to another Prescott, Shelsley and Donington, and especially the runs to and from, which are always certain to be enjoyable, so the sooner we get back to normal, I for one will shout for joy.
I should just like to add another "thank you" for carrying on and if your staff can find enough interest in 200 miles a month to write "General Notes", everything in the garden will be lovely.
Hoping I haven't bored you too much.
I am, Yours etc

I had also lost track of Ms Cowell. Jenks got his introduction to motor racing from Bob Cowell, acting as his mechanic/go-for at Brooklands pre-war. The wartime Spitfire pilot's one-time wife remained friendly with DSJ for many years, and was a well-qualified engineer in her own right. She survived terrible injuries in a road accident and eventually died in old age, I believe in a tragic house fire at home on the Isle of Wight. In the lottery of life we are all dealt a different hand...seldom as widely different from 'the norm' as those dealt to the Cowells.

I found myself facing Roberta Cowell across my desk when I was selling VW/Audis for Normand Continental in Kings Road, Hammersmith in 1986.
The reality was that she looked like an ageing man in drag with clumsy makeup, a rather sad and gruesome sight.
This is not to be disapproving, rather it was tragically shocking and I sensed that she knew this.

I've been looking into "Betty" recently, with a view to putting her in Speedqueens somewhere. This is something I've sidestepped in the past, as reliable accounts of Roberta's races, as opposed to Robert's, are hard to come by. There is also a very vocal faction online, with heavy and very dangerous axes to grind, ready to jump on anyone commenting on transgender issues in ways of which they do not completely approve. I do not want their attention.
In this article, Roberta claims she had xx chromosomes from birth, and had some sort of hormonal or developmental disorder.
I'm going to read that pdf later."Take back our streets."
That was the theme at a candlelight vigil Friday night for Pottstown's latest murder victim.
Just 24 hours earlier, Steven "Mitch" Mitchell was gunned down inside a car in the 400 block of Jefferson Avenue. Mitchell was only 20 years old, and had just been out of jail for a few weeks, friends said.
More than 50 friends and relatives, as well as local clergy and Pottstown's mayor, attended the memorial.
"We should not be doing no memorial for Mitch," said friend Lashauna Simmons. "He was a good person and he didn't deserve what happened to him."
At times, the vigil became heated. One parent became angry at what many see as Pottstown streets that are getting too dangerous.
"What's going to be done?", the woman shouted. "I came up here from Philly, and I ain't come here to live like this."
Pottstown mayor Sharon Valentine-Thomas said illegal guns and drugs have become a major problem here and throughout the region.
"The root of crime is choice," she said. "Someone has a gun; they're choosing to act irresponsibly with that gun."
Pastors pleaded with young people to let them help take back the streets.
"We were out here," one said. "We weren't always serving the Lord. We weren't always walking the walk that we walk now, and we understand. So come and talk to me."
The mayor said changes are coming soon to clamp down on crime.
"I speak to the police department daily," said Valentine-Thomas. "There are some shifting strategies that are coming into position, and I think there are going to be more foot patrols by concerned citizens."
As for Mitchell's murder, police and prosecutors have been tight lipped about their investigation.Travel / Adventure Filming – Shooting with the Kessler Pocket Jib Traveler
Filming
Now, before I go any further, I need to make it clear that pre-production is imperative in these situations. Coming into this trip, very little was done as I was on vacation with my mom and didn’t want to make the trip centered around the short film that I wanted to shoot. I wanted to first and foremost have a good time and leave with a short film documenting it’s diverse landscape..
The Pocket Jib Traveler
Another focus of the trip was to test out the new Pocket Jib Traveler. Below is the video I shot while in St.Thomas.

In this video, we showcase the features, assembly and use of the Kessler Pocket Jib Traveler. (If you would like to view the quick start video, please click here).
About the Pocket Jib Traveler
The Pocket Jib Traveler was designed to fit into the ultra-jib category of products. Like other similar jibs on the market, the key features are it’s. It’s overall weight is 5 ½ lbs (5 lbs without the included ½ lbs weight bar). In regards to it’s weight capacity, this system can support up to 10 lbs. One aspect that helps the system support more weight is the center mounted camera platform which aids in the systems.

Population-based genetic association studies of unrelated individuals provide us with a rich source of data for investigating the genetic basis of complex diseases. Joint analysis of multiple genetic markers within and across genes is increasingly popular as these analyses may lend additional insight into associations. At the same time, model-based methods play an important role in the analysis of data derived from these studies because they serve as a flexible framework for incorporating covariate information, including environmental, demographic and clinical factors. Analysis of covariance is one commonly used testing framework for characterizing genotype–trait associations based on multilocus genotypes or haplotypes (Tzeng et al., 2006; Schaid et al., 2002). The majority of these analyses apply either Wald-type or score-type statistics for testing association. In contrast with single single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based studies, these analyses are hindered by potentially large degrees of freedom. For example, given n biallelic SNPs, there are 3n possible multilocus genotypes. Although in practice the actual number of such patterns is limited by sample size and linkage between loci, the resulting number of groups in an analysis-of-covariance model can increase rapidly. Thus, as we include more SNPs in the analysis, the degrees of freedom for the corresponding test statistic can become unwieldy, leading to a reduction in statistical power (Tzeng et al., 2006). In many instances, the degrees of freedom are spent on genetic variants that are relatively rare and for which no true association is detectable owing to insufficient power. Such a reduction of power is a main cause of the high false negative rate and non-consistently reproducible findings of association studies (Tzeng et al., 2006).
As a means of addressing this degrees-of-freedom challenge, a mixed effects modelling approach has been proposed recently for the analysis of data arising from genetic association studies, as described in Foulkes et al. (2005, 2007). A similar global testing approach has also been described for the analysis of gene expression data (Goeman et al., 2004). Mixed effects models provide a flexible statistical framework for controlling for potential confounders and identifying interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors that explain the variability in the measured trait. This is achieved simply through inclusion of these quantities as covariates in fixed and random-effects design matrices respectively. Within this framework, the associations between genetic variants and a trait are detected with the application of a single degree of freedom test. Notably, the degrees of freedom of this omnibus test are unaffected by the number of genetic variants and the approach is easily implemented by using existing software tools, including SAS PROCMIXED and the nlme package (Pinheiro et al., 2009) in R. Mixed effects modelling hence provides a complementary approach to study multilocus genotypes involving a large number of potential informative genetic patterns.
In this paper we propose a more general mixture modelling framework. This framework aims to explore association between a single trait, such as a quantitative measure of disease progression, and multilocus genotypes by testing for the existence of association, and then characterizing this association as a latent class structure. This is a natural extension of the mixed effects model approach for association studies, in which a Gaussian mixture distribution is assumed for random genotype effects. Indeed, in the case that a single Gaussian distribution is appropriate for the random effects, the mixture model that we describe herein reduces to the usual mixed effects modelling framework that was presented in Foulkes et al. (2005). The primary advantages of this paradigm over classical analysis-of-covariance and mixed effects models include that the mixture modelling framework
- (a)addresses the degrees-of-freedom challenge that is inherent in application of the usual fixed effects analysis of covariance for multilocus genotype,
- (b)relaxes the restrictive single-Gaussian assumption of the mixed effects model as described previously and
- (c)offers an exploratory framework for discovery of latent class structure.
Several approaches to relax the distribution assumption of random effects in the context of a mixed effects model have been proposed in the general biostatistics literature. See, for example, Magder and Zeger (1996) and Zhang and Davidian (2004). In this paper, we consider modelling the random effects as a mixture of Gaussian distributions as described in Verbeke and Lesaffre (1996), which can accommodate a broad class of distributions, including multimodal and highly skewed distributions. To our knowledge, application of the mixture modelling framework for exploration of multilocus genotype–trait associations has not been described. In a recent paper, Schumacher and Kraft (2007) proposed an application of a Bayesian latent class model with a mixture prior to select signal-bearing SNPs from a large number of loci in the context of a genomewide association study. This approach is notably different from the mixture modelling approach that is described herein. Specifically, Schumacher and Kraft (2007) reported posterior odds for each SNP based on an assumption about the prior distribution of the log-odds ratios. A fully Bayesian approach is applied with estimation achieved via Gibbs sampling. The goal of Schumacher and Kraft (2007) is to provide shrinkage estimates of single SNP effects by drawing strength from the totality of the data (Hoggart et al., 2008; Lunn et al., 2006). In the present study, an alternative modelling fitting paradigm is applied and, importantly, the aim is to group individuals (rather than SNPs) on the basis of multiple (rather than single) SNPs within and across genes. This provides a framework for discovery of combinations of markers that together explain the variability in the trait under study. In addition, a key feature of the approach proposed is that the number of components in the mixture distribution is data driven rather than assumed. This offers additional flexibility for characterizing complex multilocus genotype–trait associations.
This study is organized as follows. In Sections 2.1 and 2.2, we begin by introducing our notation and the mixture modelling framework. Here, we focus on the application of this modelling framework to data derived from genotype–trait association studies. In Sections 2.3 and 2.4 we describe a testing and model selection framework for determining the appropriateness of the mixture model and discovering latent structure. An application to real data arising from a study of antiretroviral-associated dyslipidaemia in human immunodeficiency virus infection is described in Section 3 and a simulation study is presented and discussed in Section 4. Finally, we offer a discussion of our findings in Section 5.

2.1. Notation and background
In the context of population-based association studies, inferential interest often rests in characterizing the association between multiple SNPs within and across genes, and a measure of disease status or disease progression. The former is referred to as the multilocus genotype, where locus refers to the site on the genome, whereas the latter is commonly referred to as a phenotype or trait. Here we focus on a single trait and aim to describe the relationships between combinations of SNPs and this trait.
Let be the set of all possible multilocus genotypes across the observed sites. For example, suppose that we observe two biallelic SNPs, with levels (AA, Aa and aa) and (BB, Bb and bb). Here A, a, B and b represent the nucleotides (A, C, T or G) at the corresponding sites. In this case, there are nine possible multilocus genotypes, given by . We begin by grouping individuals with identical observed multilocus genotypes, as described in Foulkes et al. (2004, 2005). Specifically, we let an individual belong to genotype group Gi if the observed multilocus genotype is equal to gi. For example, in Table 1 we report the observed multilocus genotypes for one data example (see Section 3). Here n=8 subjects have the same multilocus genotype (CC GG AA AA GG CC TT AA)—pattern 59—and are thus assigned to the same genotype group. Alternative formulations of genotype groups are tenable, as described in Foulkes et al. (2004). This approach to grouping individuals is similar to defining clusters on the basis of known familial relationships, though a select set of observed genetic markers is used to define the groups. On the basis of this concept, we define Z as an n×m matrix of indicators for genotype group membership, similar to the usual design matrix in an analysis-of-variance model, where n is the number of observations in our sample and m is again the number of genotype groups.
First, we consider application of a fixed effects model for this setting. Let y be an n×1 vector denoting the trait for the observations and X represent the n×p matrix for the covariates, including clinical, demographic and environmental factors. Here p is the number of covariates including the intercept. Let genotype groups be indexed by i, where i=1,…,m. Further suppose that ni is the number of individuals in the ith group and Σi ni=n. A generalized linear fixed effects model for this setting can be written as
- ( (2.1))
where yi and Xi are respective ni rows of y and X for the ith genotype group, Zi=Jni is an ni×1 vector of 1s, β=(β1,…,βp)T is a vector of parameters corresponding to the effects of covariates, γi is a scalar representing the ith genotype group effect constrained by Σi γi=0; E[·] denotes expectation and g(·) is a link function. In this paper, for clarity of presentation, we focus on a quantitative trait and the identity link, so model (2.1) reduces to
- ( (2.2))
Here we further assume , where φni is an ni-dimensional Gaussian probability density function. In this setting, the null hypothesis of no association between the trait and the genotypes is given by H0:γi=0 for all i. A test of this null hypothesis is commonly performed on the basis of an F-test with degrees of freedom increasing with the number of genotype groups. Detailed discussions of this modelling framework and associated testing procedures can be found, for example, in McCulloch and Searle (2001).
Under a classical mixed effects model (McCulloch and Searle, 2001), we assume that the multilocus genotype effects are random, arising from a single Gaussian distribution. To distinguish between the fixed effects model of equation (2.2) and a mixed effects model with random group effects, we use the following model notation to represent the latter:
- ( (2.3))
where
- ( (2.4))
is the random effect for the ith multilocus genotype, again i=1,…,m, the bi are independent of ɛi and is a univariate Gaussian probability density function with mean 0 and variance .
2.2. Mixture model
In the mixture modelling setting, we instead assume that each bi is independently drawn from a mixture of K Gaussian distributions with mean μk and variance for k=1,…,K. Formally, we have
- ( (2.5))
in place of equation (2.4), where K is the number of Gaussian components in the mixture and πk is referred to as the mixing parameter, which is subject to the constraints Σk πk=1 and πk0. For identifiability, we require that
In the single-component mixed effects models, the expectation of random effects is set to 0 for identifiability of the model's intercept term. It is desirable to keep this property for the mixture model and therefore the following constraint is imposed:
- ( (2.6))
In the case that K=1, this reduces to a single Gaussian component mixed effects model, i.e. equation (2.4), as discussed in Foulkes et al. (2005).
Assuming an equal variance for all Gaussian components provides stronger numerical stability in the estimating procedure, as noted by Verbeke and Molenberghs (2000), and guarantees the existence of maximum likelihood under the mixture random-effects setting (Magder and Zeger, 1996). The adequacy of this assumption is further discussed in Section 4.2.
The distribution of yi is then given by
- ( (2.7))
where . The likelihood of the data is represented as
- ( (2.8))
where θ=(β,σ,σb), μ=(μ1,…,μK), π=(π1,…,πK) and is a Gaussian likelihood function of ni dimensions. In this paper, we adopt the expectation–maximization algorithm for model fitting described in Komarek (2001) which is the basis for the existing optimization routines for mixed effects models that are provided in SAS (PROCMIXED) and R nlme package (Pinheiro et al., 2009).
2.3. Detecting association
Two stages of hypothesis testing and exploration are of interest within the mixture modelling framework proposed. First, we aim to determine whether a single-component model (i.e. K=1) provides an adequate fit to the data. If not, we conclude that there is variability in the trait that can be explained by the gene(s) under consideration. Further exploration of the data, as described in Section 2.4, will then allow us to characterize the latent class structure. If a single-component model (K=1) is indeed adequate, then we aim to test whether the genotype effects in such a model has significant variability. If the data suggest that this is so, we again conclude that there is variability in the trait that can be explained by the gene(s) under study.
Given a fitted single-component model, we first test whether the model fits the data adequately. In this paper, we apply the goodness-of-fit test that was suggested by Verbeke and Lesaffre (1996) and Verbeke and Molenberghs (2000) to determine the adequacy of the fitted model. First we define a stochastic variable Ui for each genotype group i as follows:
- ( (2.9))
where m again denotes the number of observed genotype groups, ai is a prespecified vector of constants and and are the estimates of β and Vi respectively. If the model assumed is correct, then the Ui, i=1,…,m, are independently and identically distributed according to a univariate normal distribution. This is tested formally by using a Shapiro–Wilk test, such that a model is rejected if the corresponding Shapiro–Wilk statistic SW({Ui}) is smaller than the threshold value corresponding to significance level α. Although the goodness-of-fit test can be performed for any ai, a good choice of ai can improve the power of the test. Verbeke and Lesaffre (1996) suggested choosing ai to maximize so that the variability in that is due to the random effects is large compared with the variability from the error term. This is achieved by letting ai equal the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of . In our setting of univariate random effects, this simplifies to choosing ai to satisfy .
Rejection of the single-Gaussian assumption (H0:K=1) both confirms the existence of association and implies the need for a more complex model of association. If we fail to reject this null hypothesis, association may still exist by way of a random effect that arises from a single Gaussian distribution. Under this simpler model, a test of the null hypothesis of no association between multilocus genotypes and the trait is given by an omnibus test of , as described in Foulkes et al. (2005). Since this null hypothesis is testing a parameter at a boundary, a likelihood ratio test statistic is approximately distributed as where represents a distribution with a point mass at zero (Stram and Lee, 1994).
The detection of association therefore potentially involves two tests and a Bonferroni adjustment is applied to control the familywise error rate. Further characterization of association in this framework is achieved through examining the best linear unbiased predictors of the random effects and the corresponding prediction intervals, as described in Verbeke and Molenberghs (2000) and Foulkes et al. (2005). Sensitivity of the performance of these tests to the Gaussian mixture assumption is studied in Section 4.2.
2.4. Defining latent classes
Once the single Gaussian distribution assumption is rejected by the goodness-of-fit test, the multilocus genotype effects are then modelled by a mixture of Gaussians. An evaluation of the approach is presented in Section 4.2. The number of Gaussian components (K) is determined by using Akaike's information criterion (Akaike, 1973). In the application below, we limit consideration to 2K5 for ease of interpretation of the final results. The model with the lowest corresponding Akaike information criterion value is selected. Alternative approaches for determining K can be found, for example, in McLachlan and Peel (2000). After an appropriate model has been identified, we aim to characterize further the structure of association. We begin by defining some additional notation by recalling the mixture model that was described in Section 2.2. The mixture model can be interpreted as a latent class model (McLachlan and Peel, 2000) in which a multilocus genotype arises from one of the K latent classes that have differential effects on the trait, each specified by a separate Gaussian distribution. We define the latent class membership of the ith genotype group by a vector of indicator variables, di=(di1,…,diK), where
We assume that di, i=1,…,m, are independently and identically distributed according to a multinomial distribution consisting of one draw on K categories with probabilities π=(π1,…,πK), i.e.
It leads to
Although di is unobservable, we can estimate the posterior probability that dik=1. This is given formally by
- ( (2.10))
where is the estimated mixing proportion for Gaussian component k, and are restricted maximum likelihood estimates of μ and θ=(β,σ,σb) respectively and fik is the kth Gaussian component of the density of yi, given by
- ( (2.11))
We classify the ith genotype group as belonging to the latent class with the highest corresponding posterior probability, i.e., if c(Gi) denotes the latent class to which the ith genotype group is assigned, we let . A scaled version of the classification uncertainty, as suggested by Fraley and Raftery (2002), is defined as
- ( (2.12))
This uncertainty measure ranges from 0 to 1 and is defined such that, if a genotype is classified into a latent class with a high posterior probability, then the classification has a low uncertainty.

In this section we apply the mixture modelling approach to data derived from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group ‘New works concept sheet’ (NWCS) 224 study, which was an investigation aimed at identifying genetic factors that predict lipid abnormalities in antiretroviral-treated individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus, type 1. A complete description of the study population can be found in Foulkes et al. (2006, 2007). In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the pregnane X receptor gene, which is also known as NR1l2, and fasting non-high-density lipoprotein. Analyses are adjusted for potential confounding effects of age, gender, use of lipid lowering therapy, CD4 cell count and antiretroviral therapy drug exposures. A total of n=306 Caucasians are included in the analysis. Individuals with missing genotypes, unknown drug exposures, short durations of exposure to a specific class of drugs or a short washout period are excluded. Eight SNPs within pregnane X receptor are considered: rs1054191, rs2276706, rs2276707, rs2461825, rs2472682, rs3814055, rs3814057 and rs6785049. Each SNP is coded as a three-level factor variable, resulting in 59 observed genotype groups. A complete listing of the multilocus genotypes is given in Table 1.
Diagnostic quantile–quantile plots (see Section 4.2) in the initial analysis show that the random effects deviate from the Gaussian mixture assumption with a long-tailed distribution. Box–Cox transformation, Box--Cox(y)=yλ−1/λ, with λ=0.8, is therefore applied to the trait (non-high-density lipoprotein) and a mixture model is refitted. A further discussion of Box–Cox transformation for Gaussian mixture models is given in Yeung et al. (2001). Visual inspection of the distribution of , as well as the residuals from the fitted model, using quantile–quantile plots against a Gaussian distribution for each latent class, suggests that the Gaussian mixture assumption is reasonable. Application of the goodness-of-fit testing leads us to reject the null hypothesis of a single Gaussian distribution on the random effects (Bonferroni adjusted p-value, 0.040) and a two-component model is selected on the basis of the Akaike information criterion value. On the basis of the posterior probability estimates, we assign about 90% (n=273) of the subjects across 48 genotype groups to latent class 1 and the remaining 10% (n=33) of the subjects across 11 genotype groups are assigned to latent class 2. The corresponding uncertainty for each latent class assignment is given in Table 1. The average uncertainties for assignments to latent classes 1 and 2 and their (10th, 90th) percentile are 0.20 (0.00,0.59) and 0.54 (0.26,0.91) respectively. By comparing the odds ratios for each SNP between these two classes, SNPs rs2461825 and rs3814057 appear to be the most influential.
A visual representation of the effects of the genotype groups with classification uncertainty less than 0.5 is provided in Fig. 1. For genotype groups within latent class 1, the posterior means of the random effects of the lipid outcome cluster around zero (marked by a vertical line). In contrast, for genotype groups in latent class 2, the estimates of the random effects shift upwards. This suggests that individuals with genotypes belonging to the second latent class are likely to have higher non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than individuals with genotypes belonging to the first latent class. Finally, for comparison, a fixed effects analysis of covariance, also adjusted for patient level covariates, is performed using the same data. This approach similarly provides evidence for association (overall p-value, 0.007) and the effects of genotype patterns 57 and 58, as given in Table 1, are significantly different from 0 (p-values, 0.013 and 0.008). The remaining nine groups in latent class 2 were not identified.

The results of a simulation study are presented in four parts. Part one studies the power of the mixture models under various conditions. Part two presents a sensitivity study for the Gaussian mixture assumption for the random effects. Part three compares the fitted distribution of and the true distribution for mixture models. The connection between the misclassification and uncertainty is also studied. Finally, part four compares the performance of the mixture models with the lasso, which is a popular high dimensional data analysis approach (Tibshirani, 1996). Each simulation study is based on N=1000 data sets, and each data set is of size n=1000. Moreover, for the comparison of power under various displacement and scale values, and number of mixture components, all simulated data sets concerning power estimation are rescaled such that the total standard deviation of bi is equal to 0.5. The noise level σ is set to 1 in all cases.
Each simulation begins by generating a set of multilocus genotypes and then simulating the trait according to model (2.7). For our simulations, we define binary genotype variables (e.g. an indicator for the presence of at least one variant allele at a given SNP locus), with probabilities P(AA)=0.6 and P(Aa/aa)=0.4. The conditional probability distribution of genotypes across two neighbouring loci is P(BB|AA)=0.7 and P(BB|Aa/aa=0.4). Genotypes are simulated sequentially one locus at a time such that, given the genotype at locus i, the genotype for locus i+1 is generated according to the conditional probabilities.
4.1. Power study
We begin by investigating how changes in the displacement parameter for the random effects, given by δ=|μ2−μ1|, and the scale parameter, given by σb, alter the power to detect overall association and latent class structure under a two-component mixture model for the random effects. In simulating the data, we assume that the random effects arise from a two-component model, i.e. . For comparison, the simulated data sets are rescaled such that the total standard deviation for bi is equal to 0.5 under all simulation conditions. The power for δ=0.5,1,4 at σb=0.1 is reported for increasing number of loci. Next, the power is recorded for σb=0.1,0.2,0.5 at δ=4 and with increasing numbers of loci. The results are presented in Fig. 2. The power to detect overall association is defined as the proportion of simulations that result in rejecting either the single-Gaussian assumption for random effects through the goodness-of-fit test or the omnibus test at the Bonferroni-adjusted 0.05-level. The power to detect latent structure is defined as the proportion of simulations that result in rejecting the single-Gaussian model in favour of a model with two or more components, based on the Shapiro–Wilk goodness-of-fit test. Notably, this definition of power implies that the data-generating distribution can be captured with a mixture of components (i.e. there is latent structure) in the case that the single-Gaussian model is rejected. Further, power for detecting latent structure is defined loosely in terms of identifying more than one component, i.e. power is defined as Pr(reject single-component assumption | multicomponent model). In the simulation study, we use two-component models as realizations from the alternative space and calculate Pr(reject single-component assumption | 2-component model). Although not explicitly part of our definition of power, we additionally suggest coupling the proposed approach with close examination of quantile–quantile plots for for each fitted component in Section 4.2.
As expected, a larger displacement raises the power to discover latent structure. For example, from Fig. 2(a), we see that the power to detect latent structure for a five-locus genotype (x-axis) at σb=0.1 increases from approximately 60% to 100% as δ increases from 0.5 to 4. However, the differences in the power to detect overall association is small in the context of a large number of genotype groups. Smaller values of σb also lead to improvements in the power to detect latent structure. For example, from Fig. 2(b), for five-locus genotypes and δ=4, by reducing σb from 0.5 to 0.1, the power for detecting latent structure increases from approximately 90% to 100%. Such a decrease in σb leads to a slight decrease in the power to detect overall association.
4.2. Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the validity of the testing result when there is a deviation from the modelling assumption for the random effects. In this analysis, bi is simulated following four types of distribution—single Gaussian, log-normal, uniform and beta(). For all cases, bi is rescaled to have standard deviation σb equal to (0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1) with zero mean, and σ=1. Single-component models are fitted to these simulated data sets. The proportion of rejected null hypotheses for omnibus and goodness-of-fit tests is obtained on the basis of 1000 simulated data sets under each condition and displayed in Fig. 3. For the omnibus test, the proportions of rejected null hypotheses are very close for all cases; only minor differences are found when σb is between 0.3 and 0.7. For the goodness-of-fit test, which is testing for more than one Gaussian component, proportions of rejected null hypotheses are similar under low signal levels (i.e. σb0.1). At medium and higher signal levels, data sets with log-normal random effects give much higher proportions of rejected null hypotheses than others. Additional simulations (which are not displayed in the figures) show that the omnibus test under Gaussian mixture random effects with three and four components has similar proportions of rejected null hypotheses to those of single Gaussian (with less than 4% differences when 0.3σb0.7).
On the basis of the above analysis, we note that rejection of the single-Gaussian assumption for random effects does not imply that the true distribution of the random effects is close to a mixture of Gaussian distributions. We therefore introduce two diagnostic tools to measure how well the mixture of Gaussian distributions approximates the actual distribution for the random effects. First we study the measure of uncertainty of the classification.
Random effects under the three non-Gaussian distributions that were described in the previous paragraph and a two-component Gaussian mixture (σb=0.5, |μ1−μ2|=1 and σ=1) are simulated; their total standard deviations are rescaled to equal 0.5 for comparison. Two-component Gaussian mixture models are fitted to these simulated data sets. The empirical cumulative distribution function of the uncertainty is obtained from fitted models for each simulation; their average is shown in Fig. 4. For the Gaussian mixture and log-normal models, most uncertainties are low; for the beta and uniform models there are more high uncertainty values. On average the 75th percentile of the uncertainty is about 0.1 for the log-normal, 0.25 for the Gaussian and 0.6 for the beta and uniform models.
To study further the source of high uncertainty for the beta and uniform models, we study the relationship between the uncertainty and the shape of the distribution for the random effects on the basis of four simulated data sets under different random-effects distributions. Fig. 5 shows the kernel density estimation of and the measure of uncertainty corresponding to each . In general the uncertainty is higher at the boundary of two latent classes. For the beta and uniform distributions, there is a stronger concentration of high uncertainty values at the boundary of two latent classes and the average uncertainty is therefore inflated. For the log-normal distribution, the measure of uncertainty is low as the Gaussian mixture generally gives a good approximation to the long-tailed distribution as pointed out by McLachlan and Peel (2000).
The second method to detect deviation from the Gaussian mixture assumption for the random effects is to inspect the quantile–quantile plots for against the Gaussian distribution for each fitted component. If a mixture of Gaussian distributions is a good approximation to the true underlying distribution, we expect the distribution of for each fitted component to be close to Gaussian. Thus, although not intended to make generalizations, quantile–quantile plots in this setting serve as an important diagnostic tool (similar to the usual regression setting) to assess the appropriateness of modelling assumptions. The quantile–quantile plots for the four distributions are shown in Fig. 6. For log-normal random effects, the plots give a strong indication of deviation from the assumption. For the beta and uniform models, the tails of the quantile–quantile plots raise concern. The information that is gained from using the quantile–quantile plots as a diagnostic tool depends on the quality of classification. The measure of uncertainty as presented in Section 2.4 provides a tool to evaluate the quality of the classification and should be used as a complement to the quantile–quantile plots.
The assumption of a common variance for all latent classes is mainly for numerical stability. To study the adequacy of the assumption, we perform a simulation by fitting common variance models to simulated data sets under various variance ratios assuming that , with total standard deviation for random effects rescaled to be 0.5. The results show that, given a moderate variance ratio, i.e. less than or equal to 3, the deviation from the common variance assumption does not have significant effects on the power for detecting association or the number of components selected. The bias in estimation of displacement δ is mild. However, the bias in estimation of is stronger and we observe a higher rate of misclassification and uncertainty of classification. Again, we can use the diagnostic plots to detect whether there is a strong deviation from the common variance assumption.
Simulation is also performed to investigate the sensitivity to outliers and skewness in the error. The results show that strongly skewed noise and large outliers may inflate the type I error rate for the goodness-of-fit test and therefore falsely reject the single-Gaussian assumption. However, it also significantly inflates the measure of uncertainty for those falsely rejected to the range 0.7–0.9. Therefore high uncertainty also signals the presence of outliers and skewed noise.
4.3. Model comparison and misclassification
We compare with the true distribution of yi when the data arise from a three-component mixture model. 1000 data sets, each with a sample size of 1000, are simulated by using the three-component model that was described in Section 4.2. We set the separation of the components equal to the noise level, i.e. μ2−μ1=μ3−μ2=σ=1 and σb=0.1. Mixture models with 1–4 components are fitted to these simulated data sets. To compare the performance of these models quantitatively, we calculate the Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance as a measure of the dissimilarity between the cumulative distribution function of yi for the true model and the fitted models. The distributions of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance under 1–4-component models are displayed in Fig. 7. Models with three or four components appear to give the best fit; however, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance for the overfitting four-component model has larger spread due to higher variance for the estimates of parameters. On the basis of the goodness-of-fit test and Akaike information criterion approximately 58% of simulations are determined to have three components, about 34% are chosen to have two-component models and the remaining near 8% are chosen to have one component. Few fitted models are chosen to have more than three components. Notably, the large separation between components as described may not be observed in practice. Additional simulations, for which the separation between components is reduced by half, result in centres of the estimated density curves for 2–4-component models that are close together and approximately 84% and 16% of the simulated data sets are chosen to have two- and single-component models respectively.
To illustrate the relationship between misclassification and uncertainty, a simulated data set with two latent classes is generated with δ=2 and σb=0.3. The posterior means, 95% prediction intervals, group sizes and classification uncertainties for the 32 genotype groups that are observed in this simulated data set are presented in Fig. 8. The vertical dotted line in the middle panel divides the genotype groups into two latent classes such that genotype groups with posterior means to the left of the line are assigned to latent class 1 whereas genotype groups with posterior means to the right of this line are assigned to latent class 2. Genotype groups with relatively large or small posterior means are correctly classified with low uncertainty. The two genotype groups that have the highest uncertainties are misclassified. On the basis of this finding it appears that declaring the genotype groups with high uncertainty as unclassifiable may be appropriate and would reduce the overall misclassification error.
4.4. Comparison with lasso
Several alternative high dimensional data methods have been applied to SNP data, including classification and regression trees (Foulkes et al., 2004), random forests (Breau et al., 2004), multivariate adaptive regression splines (Lin et al., 2008) and logic regression (Schwender and Ickstadt, 2008). Although a comprehensive assessment of the relative performance of these approaches is beyond the scope of the present paper, we offer a brief comparison with one popular regression-based approach: the lasso (Tibshirani, 1996). The lasso is an approach that focuses on variable selection, i.e. selecting a subset of variables (SNPs in our setting) that are associated with the trait under study. We begin with seven binary SNPs and let σb=0.1 and σ=1. Two scenarios are considered. First we assume that the trait has the distribution
Secondly, we assume that
where ‘_’ can be 0 or 1. Scenario 1 can be interpreted as a model for a genetic pathway controlled by SNP 1 and SNP 2—when both SNPs become ‘1’ the mean trait value rises. Similarly, scenario 2 models a slightly more complicated pathway controlled by three SNPs where SNP 7 determines the direction of displacement of the trait values. Mixture models and the lasso are then applied to the same data sets simulated under these two scenarios. For comparison, we define selection power as the proportion of simulations for which the lasso selects at least one of the correct SNPs associated with the trait. In this paper, R package LARS is used for fitting lasso regression and the results are summarized in Table 2.
On the basis of the first scenario, the lasso has a similar ‘power’ to that of the mixture models and it can pinpoint important SNPs with moderate noise level—on average 34% of selected SNPs are irrelevant. For the second scenario, the performance of the lasso is markedly lower as the SNP selection becomes more noisy—on average 65% of selected SNPs are irrelevant. The difference is mainly due to inadequate modelling of multi-SNP interactions in lasso regression. In the mixture modelling approach, SNP-by-SNP interactions are in a sense embedded in each genotype pattern and thus do not require explicit modelling. In contrast, the lasso considers each SNP as a separate variable and directly provides a subset of important SNPs.

In this paper, we demonstrate the application of mixture modelling as a tool for discovery of multilocus genotype–trait associations in the context of population-based genetic investigations. In this framework, the strength of association is measured by the spread of bi (as quantified by ) in a single-component model, and by both and the separation between components (as measured by the difference between the μk) in multiple-component models. This modelling approach reduces to the usual mixed effects model in the presence of a single component, while offering a broader framework that may be more suitable for some complex disease association settings. Specifically, as described in Foulkes et al. (2008), under a founder model, in which a single allele is associated with the trait, and either a dominant or recessive genetic model is assumed, the mixed effects model with random effects arising from a single normal distribution may be inappropriate. A mixture model may better reflect the underlying association in this case since it is comprised of multiple components that could, for example, correspond to the presence (or absence) of a founder allele. A similar point was introduced in Roeder (1994).
Computationally, we adopt the algorithm that was described in Komarek (2001) to fit the mixture model, which is relatively simple to implement in R. However, it suffers a speed problem when both the sample size and number of SNPs become large (i.e. n>3000 and number of SNPs greater than 10). Future implementation based on Van Dyk (2000) may improve the computational efficiency.
Population substructure is a potential confounder in population-based association studies. In the example that was provided in Section 3, we include race or ethnicity as a covariate in our model, which addresses potential confounding by this self-declared category. Notably, if information on substructure informative loci had been collected, we could additionally apply a principal component analysis approach (Price et al., 2006) and use the resulting principal components in our regression framework. In family-based studies, an extra layer of clustering is present due to the familial relations. In this setting, a non-nested random effect can be added to the model to account for additional within-family correlations.
Although the application of a mixture model addresses the degrees-of-freedom challenge that is inherent in the fixed effects modelling setting, it remains unwieldy in higher dimensional settings. Specifically, as the number of SNPs increases, the number of genotype groups will rapidly approach the number of individuals in a given sample, rendering model fitting untenable. A limited number of genes, therefore, can be selected on the basis of an a priori scientific hypothesis when applying the mixture modelling method. In addition, a combination of mixture modelling and machine learning techniques, such as logic regression (Ruczinski et al., 2003) or random forests (Breiman, 2001), may be appropriate. This would involve developing an approach that is similar to the model-based recursive partitioning approach recently described by Zeileis et al. (2008), with the inclusion of a mixture model. These approaches may also serve as useful tools for post hoc analysis of signature differences across latent classes. Further extensions will allow for application of this approach to the study of ambiguous phase haplotype–trait associations.
Finally, major results of the simulation are summarized as follows:
- (a)the total power is over 80% under moderate signal strength;
- (b)the power of the omnibus test is insensitive to the Gaussian mixture assumption, and under low signal strength the goodness-of-fit test is also insensitive to the Gaussian mixture assumption;
- (c)deviation from the Gaussian mixture assumption may be detected by using uncertainty measure and quantile–quantile plots for ;
- (d)deviation from the common variance assumption for all latent classes does not have a significant effect on power or number of components selected, but it causes bias in the estimation of component variances and higher misclassification rates;
- (e)mixture modelling has a better performance than the lasso in detecting association when there is a strong interaction between loci; however, the lasso can pinpoint important loci that are associated with the trait.

Review by: susan canavarro on July 22, 2011 : (no rating)
In Throwback, Jack Remick writes about relationships, about pain and suffering, about illness and death, loneliness, emptiness, suicide, the last gasps of a life transversing from one story to the next, cutting across all characters. It’s interesting that Remick’s male protagonist in each is the one constant compassionate caregiver, the listener, the helper, but always, the one left behind, sad and bereft at his loss. It’s like there is a deep-rooted need to be the savior. And when death comes to one character, his protagonist transudes from one story, one loss, to another, as if passing through the pores of life, changing names, but remaining standing within his own loss.
I relate to Jack Remick’s writing because he doesn’t try to hide pain and suffering. He’s not scribbling down the words singing an upbeat life is wonderful tune. He’s telling it like it is. The undercurrent of pain bubbles up to the surface in each story and in each of our life stories. He forces us to face it head on.
Review by: Ryan Winfield on July 09, 2011 :
I just purchased this book on Smashwords. I would like to warn potential readers that once they pick this collection of short stories up, they won’t want to put it down until the last story is read. If you’ve ever looked at interesting strangers and wondered what their lives are like, you’ll love peering into the worlds of these characters. Five stars all the way.
Author Notes:
Sometimes a writer’s ideas are ahead of the techniques needed to make a story work. I wrote each of the stories in this collection in a 30 minute timed writing session. The 30 minute limit forces you to compress, forces you to start as close to the climax as you get get. In screenwriting, the gurus tell you to Get in Late, Get out Early. I experimented with form quite a bit. When I focused on Action and Image as the basic elements of story-telling, I found that sometimes the pieces came out in poetic form. Bad Debt and She Didn’t Mean to Do It and Ashes are examples of that form. The story is there, but the paragraph has dissolved. I think the paragraph isn’t a fictional unit any more than a chapter is. Both are constructs the writer uses for effect.
Excerpt:
Throwback
I remember the first time I saw her. A woman who floated on a sea of her own perfume. Free. Vibrant red hair like the mane of a Teutonic warrior priestess. Atavistic and primitive as if this were the one Tacitus wrote about—the mother of the collapse of the Roman Empire. She might have been a Hun, one of the wild women who ran screaming and naked into battle.
You can’t tie a woman like that down. Words fall off her like rain on oil cloth. You say, ‘God, you look good,’ and she turns her back. You say, ‘You smell nice,’ and she laughs at you. How do you pin down a woman whose ancestors put the fear of god into Julius Caesar?
A white straw hat, a sundress the color of calendulas in bloom, a bicycle riding down a chestnut tree lined boulevard in the heat of summer. Quiet and hot and humid.
I was stunned when she wheeled up in Sproul Plaza and slid off the bike like a lizard sliding off a hot rock. Glints of sweat shining on patches of sun-drenched skin. She smiled at me. The dismissive smile a woman masters after a certain age.
I held the door open.
Thank you, she said. A voice as rich in timbre as her hair was deep with the hues of bloody sunsets. She shoved her sunglasses up into her hair.A publication of the Archaeological Institute of America
U.S. Returns Smuggled Artifacts to India
Tuesday, January 14, 2014
NEW YORK, NEW YORK--The U.S. has handed over three artifacts stolen from a temple in Rajasthan, including a tenth-century statue of Shiva and Parvati, in a ceremony at the Indian consulate. Interpol had listed the looted objects as among the world’s most valuable stolen works of art. They were recovered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Department after a tip from India’s Directorate of RevenueI'm making the medium child/teen pj top for my mother who is very small. I put the neckline facing on yesterday, first I sewed the back neck facing to the front facings upside down, ripped that out and turned it around. I sewed the facings on and trimmed the seams, but it was not right. I had to throw it away. Luckily I had extra material and cut out another top. I have it sewed together right to that dreaded part of sewing the facing on the neckband and front. If someone could give me a hint on the secret of this neckband, I would very much appreciate it.
Without seeing the actual directions, it would be hard to help. What are you have difficulty with?
------height 5'2" bust 36, waist 31, hip 39.
I have way too many yards to count, and I will never use them up, but I will die trying!
Looks like the standard neck/front facing...exactly what is giving you the trouble? Is it stretching? Did you interface it? I always interface my facings. What type of material are you using? Flannel can be wonky sometimes. If it's a cotton or blend, should be an easy go. Let us know a bit more of what's causing the difficulty.
Not sure, but if you sew it right side of facing to wrong side of garment. Press. Turn it back to the front. Press. On the 'outside' edge - sew on your chosen seam allowance line (like stay stitching but a longer stitch [except near that top button where the CF moves out to the neck- short stitches there]). Turn that seam allowance under. May need to clip that above mentioned corner and around the neck curve. Press that down, pin as you go. When you have it nice and smooth - sew down close to the edge (about 1/16th inch). Press. Should be looking good.
If, from your previous experience, you think it needs some interfacing to look better/be more controllable - cut the interfacing without the outside seam allowance and you can fold the facing edge under the interfacing edge. Might be easier. Or not.
-- Edited on 9/2/13 8:58 AM -- -- Edited on 9/2/13 8:59 AM --
Some of the things that I have done wrong in the past in regard to neck facing;
Did not transfer the marking from pattern to fabric, which is always a problem waiting to happen.
Did not sew the shoulder seam correctly so neck is now different size than facings and none of the marks match up.
Did not stay stitch neck edge and clip to stay stitching so am fighting fabric when stitching the two shapes together.
Put interfacing on wrong side of facing. Hope I figure it out before I sew the two together and trim the seam allowances. Trying to sew 1/8" seam allowances is almost impossible, but I have done it.
Cut body of garment one size and facings another size.
Glad you had enough fabric to cut another top.

Wale would be “offended” if Kendrick Lamar hadn’t called him out on the song. Why? Because he feels as though being a threat to Kendrick makes him the greatest rapper around.
Wale Reacts To Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Control’ Verse
Wale really doesn’t care that Kendrick called him out. In fact, when TMZ caught up with him walking out of the airport on Aug. 14, he was happy about it.
“I’d’ve been offended if my name wasn’t in that sh*t,” he said. “I still feel like I’m the best rapper on the planet.”
Well at least Kendrick hasn’t upset everyone!
Diddy Responds To Kendrick Lamar By Slamming Him On Instagram
Diddy wasn’t amused by Kendrick’s opinions of himself, saying: “I’m Makaveli’s offspring, I’m the king of New York.”
Diddy responded with a pic on Instagram of himself and Jay-Z laughing and saying: “And then Kendrick said, I’m the king of New York.” He also wrote a note on to his over 2 million followers that read: “Kendrick got ya’ll n****s taking ya’ll time now. What ya’ll gonna do now. Haaaa lol lets go!”
Other rappers spoke out and seem to agree more with Wale. Big K.R.I.T. said he liked the verse and that it was good publicity for him.
Rap, Hip Hop has always been mad competitive.ñ for the promotion.'”
Pusha T tweeted: “I heard you loud and clear my n****.”
HollywoodLifers, sound off below and tell us what you think of Wale’s reaction!On August 5, 1963, Parnell E. Allen, a colleague and fellow member of the Montgomery County Bar, died in Washington, D. C. while driving his automobile. His passing was sudden and without forewarning.
Mr. Allen was a native of Pen-Argyle, Pennsylvania, having been born in that town on September 6, 1916. He attended public schools in Pen-Argyle, Pennsylvania, graduated from Lafayette University with an A. B. Degree in 1938, and received his law degree from the University of Baltimore in 1946. He was admitted to the Bar in 1949 in the State of Maryland.
He later established his own law office in Silver Spring, Maryland and continued to practice in Silver Spring until the time of his death. Parnell Allen was a member of the Montgomery County Bar Association, the Maryland State Bar Association and was a member of St. Thomas’ Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.
Mr. Allen is survived by his wife, Doreen Allen, of the home address, a daughter Mrs. Patricia Ferrell, a grandson, Matthew Ferrell, both of Bellmead, Texas, another daughter Deborah Allen of Missoula, Montana, two sisters, Mrs. Eleanor Baker of Bangor, Pennsylvania and Mrs. Betty Gallagher of Irvington, New Jersey.
Mr. Allen believed in making the most of each day and had a wide range of interests. He worked hard and improved his skill as an attorney by periodically attending the Practicing Law Institute in New York, New York.
He was a devoted husband and a loving father. We all knew him as a conscientious and friendly man who was always most willing to help others.
To his bereaved family we of the Montgomery County Bar Association extend our sincere and deepest sympathy and condolence.
I respectfully move, your Honors, that this testimonial be made a part of the permanent records of this Court and that a copy, properly inscribed, be sent to Mrs. Allen.
Respectfully submitted on behalf of The Montgomery County Bar Association

It looks good, but it’s just the usual suspects – I don’t see any signs of money people.

It's best to understand chords and how they are built. There are different kinds of chords, the most common of which are 3 part and 4 part chords. In fact, if you understand these two types of chords and how to use them, they are all you will really need to practice a lot; you can derive all other interesting variants from here.
More complex guitar harmonies are built using precisely these building blocks, so don't let making sense of the intervals within triads and four-part chords
scare you. Forget all about chord bibles and the like, and focus on really getting the basics.
Guitar chords are the basis to accompaniment in rock, Jazz, and many other styles. And you definitely need to know how to play rhythm guitar before you become an awesome lead guitarist, so take your time and explore this section until it all clicks...
Guitar Harmony and Chords: this subject, as most we'll cover in these pages, can be viewed from many angles. You can go as deep as you want, so take it all in one piece at a time!. Ironically, the fastest and most effective way to learn is to go slowly: rushing never helps!!!
The most basic definition of 'chord' is very simple: two or more musical tones played together. In practice, however, the term is more often used in reference to structures that contain three or more tones (the 12 tone tempered system —on which the guitar is based— allows combinations of up to 12 tones).
The 'Grandmother Chord', invented by Nicolas Slonimsky, includes all 12 tones and 11 different intervals. It cannot be played on a guitar!!!
The chords most widely used in most musical styles are triads (three-part chords) and 7th chords (four-part chords). They are built by stacking notes a third apart (major and minor thirds).
These are the guitar chords you really have to know in order to make sense of the underpinnings of the vast majority of guitar music: once you have mastered their use, you can use triads and 7th chords in many different ways. You can even use them as assumed roots to play implied harmony of up to seven simultaneous parts.
If you want to learn chords on piano and see how they are built on a keyboard, visit Play-the-Piano.org for helpful tools and advice.In response to a "flood of complaints" from parents and school districts, the State Department of Education (MDE) is issuing recommendations to address the problem of students not having enough time to eat their lunch.

We’re a bit late on this one but nonetheless, ‘Coming along’ from SP is an absolute banger. Here, the Birmingham MC spits raw emotion over a string-based instrumental produced by the up and coming Swifta Beater.
As the title suggests, SP is ‘Coming along’ in the music game and the lyrics are based on determination and working through hardship. This, alongside passionate delivery makes for a pretty solid track which has since been remixed by the likes of Funtcase and others.
The visuals are decent too, and it’s far from a typical hood-video which shows progression on the video side of things too. Overall, this is a strong track which certainly puts SP’s name on the map.

The cherry is a popular backyard tree grown for fruit and shade. Cherry trees produce the first fresh fruit of the season, followed by the other kinds of tree fruit. Winter injury can occur when winter temperatures fall below -10°F (-24°C). Trunk bark splitting or sun scald injury to tree trunks are common if trees have a southwest exposure (Southwest Injury), hardy to Zone 5. Sweet cherries usually bloom in late April. At this time of year the crop may be damaged by late spring frost. Sour cherries are hardier than sweet cherries, with Montmorency being as hardy as apple trees. Hardy to Zone 4.
Also see: Things to Know About Growing Cherries (cherry pests)
Cherry trees are usually grown on Mazzard or Mahaleb seedlings, or clonal selection Mazzard F 12/1 which gives vigorous, standard sized).
DWARF VARIETIES FOR SWEET CHERRIES: At the present time dwarf
sweet cherry trees are not as small as dwarf apples.
DWARF VARIETIES FOR SOUR CHERRIES: Montmorency can be kept as a small tree. Meteor and North Star are dwarf trees and can be kept at 6-8 feet tall.
Standard sweet cherry trees should be planted about 20 ft apart (6 meters) and some distance from the house so that there is adequate air circulation and light. Semi-dwarf sweet cherries can be planted as close as 12-15 ft apart (3.6 - 4.6 meters). Montmorency sour cherry can also be planted at these close distances. the soil is moist. Prepare a hole slightly larger than the root spread. Trim off any injured or broken roots before planting. If the tree is in a plastic pot, remove the pot. If it comes in a fiber pot you can slit the sides and plant with the pot or remove the pot. Sprinkle a handful of bone meal (phosphorus) in the bottom of the hole to help the root system get established. Place the tree in the hole, mix in some peat moss or compost with the planting soil, replace the soil in the hole, treading the soil firmly around the roots to ensure that the tree is securely anchored in the ground. Give the tree a good watering. An area of about 4 ft (1.2 meters) around the tree should be kept free of weeds or lawn grass during the early stages of growth. Organic or plastic mulches can also be used to suppress weed growth around the tree.
Cherry trees are vigorous and fast growing. In the nurseries and garden centers, cherry trees range from 5-8 ft tall (1.5 - 2.4 meters). If left alone the fruiting area may not be reached from the ground, necessitating use of ladders. Home gardeners need to think about their needs, namely fruit, shade, lawn mowers, etc. Normally, at planting time trees are headed at 30-40 inches above the ground. If the tree is for shade or if you need to get mowers under the scaffold branches, you may choose to head higher. Cherry trees are trained to an open-center system. Retention of the central leader will result in a tall, narrow tree. If a two year old tree is planted, reduce the branches to four well-spaced shoots and shorten each by one-third. Aim to develop a frame-work of well spaced branches that are capable of bearing heavy crops without breaking. In subsequent years, build up the framework branches and cut out entire shoots that are crowded or crossing into the tree center. Narrow angled crotches should be avoided as these are sources of weakness.
Soils in the Southern Interior are chronically low in organic matter and nitrogen. Minor elements such as: magnesium, boron, and zinc be applied as foliar sprays in early summer. Organic growers should use approved sources of organic nutrients. Mature cherry trees should have 12"-14" of new growth (30-35 cm) every year.
Sweet cherries are picked in late June through the month of July. For red cherries, leave on the tree until they have developed a full mahogany to black color. Once picked, no further ripening takes place. Cherries can only be stored for a short period of time.
The most common insect pests of cherries are: cherry fruit fly, black cherry aphid, fruit tree leafroller, and cherry slug. The main disease is brown rot. The main other pest of cherries is birds. They eat cherries and they don't wait until they are ripe. Various methods of bird control used are: netting, plastic tapes and streamers, dummy owls, balloons with eyes painted on them, and aluminum pie plates. For more information on pest management refer to "A Guide to Fruit Tree Sprays for the Home Garden" published by the B.C. Ministry of Agriculture or consult the publication "BC Home and Garden Pest Management Guide". Organic gardeners should use accepted organic control methods.

The proposal would renew a 2010 voter-approved one-cent sales tax to provide funding for education for students in the state who meet certain requirements, scholarships for college students and reinvestment in vocational education and new jobs, according to reports.
The initiative.
Text of the measure
Short title
The short title of the measure reads as follows:[1]."[3]
- According to Dan Sullivan, communications director of the Arizona Students' Association, “When passed, [the proposition] will provide up to $300 million a year for universities, half of which, about $150 million, will go to students in the form of financial aid."[4]
- According to State Representative Steve Farley, "We have to make up for things that this majority has decided to take away from our schools.".”[5]
- State Representative John Kavanagh stated, "So if we have another economic downturn, next year or in five years, we will have amply funded education and will be stopping other programs.".[10]
Judge Robert Oberbillig scheduled July 18, 2012 as the date for the hearing.[11]
On that same day, Oberbillig ruled that Ken.[12]
According to reports, Secretary of State Ken Bennett filed an appeal of the ruling, insisting that proponents of the initiative did not comply with state law. Reports also say that."[13]
However, that appeal failed as the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the measure be placed on the ballot. According to the high court, the text on the petition was enough that supporters of the initiative complied with state election law.[14]

Grand Polemarch Dwayne M. Murray Esq. announced the creation of the position, National Director of Program Funding, to coordinate the fraternity's expansive efforts to increase its funding efforts of its national program and initiatives. To lead this important effort, he has appointed Curtis Silvers, Jr.
Brother Silvers' primary responsibility will be to unify the multiple funding endeavors utilized by Grand Chapter and develop unique and effective projects to enhance the direct communication between the fraternity and core funding resources such as grant making organizations and philanthropic minded corporations. "Kappa Alpha Psi does an enormous amount of work within the community and Brother Silvers' role will be to ensure that that work is noticed and funded to meet its maximum potential," Grand Polemarch Murray said.
Brother Silvers' high regard among the fraternity is evidenced by his standing as the Polemarch of the Western Provice and his tenure as the second longest -serving in that position. Only the 18th Grand Polemarch and Laurel Wreath Laureate, Mayor Thomas L. Bradley, who served in that position for 10 years stands ahead of him. Brother Silvers began his life - long commitment to the fraternity as a 1982 initiate of The University of Virginia Chapter, the Eta Sigma of Kappa Alpha Psi.
His professional life as the Area Development Director of the UNCF Los Angeles Area Office, responsible for supervising initiatives in support of the UNCF's 39 member colleges and universities places him in a unique place to understand how to galvanize support and unify and an effective message to broaden funding potential.
"I am grateful to the Grand Polemarch for this new opportunity to contribute to Kappa Alpha Psi. I am extremely excited about this new endeavor to serve and help the fraternity expand its message, brand and key program objectives," said Silvers.Â Brother Silvers will work closely with National Committee Chairmen and Directors as well as the National Director of Project Development to create a portfolio of information, images and assessment data to provide verifiable evidence of the footprint fraternity leaves in the hundreds of communities it serves. "If we can effectively tell our story," Grand Polemarch said, "We can effectively get essential funding."
Brother Silvers' appointment is effective immediately..

Back in the day when Vince Neil, Nikki Sixx, Tommy Lee, and Mick Mars ruled the airwaves, their libido ruled their actions. No surprise there, expect for the fact that when they were confronted with a BIG STINKY PROBLEM, they picked the dumbest way possible to cover their “tracks”.
Hustler initiated an interview with Neil. We’d love to post it verbatim, but we need to censor it just a bit…
“…we were always kaboinkin’ other chicks at the studio and backstage… We would take Tommy Lee’s van to a restaurant called Noggles to buy these egg burritos and then rub them on our crotches to cover the smell of the girls we had just kaboinked. So our weewahs smelled of eggs… We would tell our girlfriends, ‘Oh, we dropped the burritos in our laps.’ The girlfriends thought we were a bunch of clumsy slobs. We never thought about going into the restroom and just washing our weewahs.”
What a waste of a perfectly good burrito! And these women couldn’t tell? We’re not sure what’s worse…

As you may recall, that "Underground Railroad" already exists in the form of the virulently anti-gay Liberty Counsel, as the kidnapped child was found living in the Nicaraguan home of the father of a Liberty Counsel employee. Over at Dead Jerry Falwell's Liberty University, students were taught that it's sometimes best to obey "God's laws" rather than "man's laws" and that "righteous kidnapping" in cases such as Lisa Miller's were justified. Those classes were taught by Liberty Counsel president Mat Staver and Lina Lindevaldsen, both of whom represented Miller in her failed custody attempts. The students were then tested on whether they'd break the law for God.
That semester’s midterm exam, obtained by Religion Dispatches,?”As word broke late last year that the federal government was about to find Lisa Miller, Fischer and other anti-gay sites declared that the FBI had been infiltrated by the "gaystapo." it was expected of them.”.Fischer's tweets from yesterday (at the top of this post) have generated widespread condemnation, which is an everyday occurrence when he bloviates on any topic. But this time even some anti-gay and Christian sites are backing away from him, resulting in today's flurry of "clarifications."

The saxophone lynchpin of the James Brown band, Maceo Parker was the featured horn on such JB classics as Papa's Gotta A Brand New Bag and I Got You (I Feel Good). In May 1970, Maceo and his brother Melvin, dissatisfied with the lack of independent recognition achieved within the Brown band, decided to hit out on their own. Taking with them the majority of James' then band (a few others had left already including St Clair Pinckney, Sweet Charles Sherrell, Marva Whitney and Fred Wesley), Maceo formed his own aggregation - the appropriately-named Maceo & All The King's Men. Their first album was released on House Of The Fox Records and (also appropriately enough) titled Doing Their Own Thing. Two singles were released from that album - Got To Getcha and Funky Women. Their second album Funky Music Machine - was recorded for Nashville's Excello label in late 1971 and released the following year. A groovy, dance floor affair of funky stuff, melodic jazz and soft rock it failed to garner the success it so obviously deserved (different stories blame a variety of business or personal problems). The band broke up in May '72 and the members rejoined James Brown's new band The JBs (which included such youngbloods as Phelps and Bootsy Collins, recruited while the rest of the band were "doing their own thang"). Maceo went on to play in the various George Clinton P-Funkster groups and recently cut a new album - Southern Exposure - in the company of Pee Wee Ellis, Fred Wesley, a couple of The Meters and The Rebirth Brass Band. Funky Music Machine captures those early steps towards the musician's own identity.AMIA/Alamo REELS OF STEEL is back! Bring in your cinematic treasures and win.

Need a clarification in regards to default xml manager.
In our environment(SVP)we have created a custom application domain and a custom XML manager for the same domain.
All the services are configured in that custom application domain and it uses the custom XML manager(not default XML Manager).
During some test run i noticed that in the "HTTP Connection Statistic" even the default XML manager getting requests. I can confirm no objects(WSP or MPGW)are hooked to the default XML manager in that application domain.
So wondering what work is the default XML manager doing in that application domain?
Would really appreciate if anybody clarify my doubt..
Thanks in advance.
Cheers,

Re: Default XML ManagerHi Kumar,
I assume you'd done an export and you don't see any references to the default xml manager? If so, all I can think of is there are some implicit usages of the default XML manager, but I don't have insight as to what that would be. This just goes to show though that you should NEVER change the default XML manager as those changes could be applicable in places where you don't expect them. Perhaps Hermann can look at the DP code to give some clues here???

Re: Default XML ManagerI looked up the box configuration, and internal stuff (Webgui, Probe, ...) uses internal (invisible) XML managers.
I logged on two of my boxes and see only 0 entries for default XML manager.
You should just look how long you have to wait for a change in HTTP Connection Status for default XML manager.
Let's say it changes every three minutes, then just take a packet capture for 3:30min, or have extensive logging in order to identify all transactions in that time.

And the choices you make for what to stock in your refrigerator can make or break your diet. When carrying around a baby bump, you want to be certain that most of the items in cold storage qualify as health superstars—for both mom and baby. Make some simple switches to ensure your diet is rich in all the essential nutrients necessary for the healthiest nine months possible.
Like this? Fruit-flavored yogurt
Try this: Plain Greek yogurt
Too often, fruity yogurts are drowning in an alphabet soup of ingredients, which may or may not include real fruit. Plus, the added sugars can contribute to excessive pregnancy weight gain and increased risk for gestational diabetes. On the flipside, plain Greek yogurt is supercharged with about twice as much protein to help keep the growing belly feeling full. It’s so deliciously thick and creamy, you won’t miss the sweeteners—and if you do, consider adding berries for a flavorful boost. Like traditional yogurt, the Greek version is laced with probiotics, friendly micro-critters that can improve digestive health. It’s a good idea to aim for up to 4 servings of dairy a day during pregnancy, but stick with 2 percent or less fat content to keep calories in check.
Like this? Cold cuts
Try this: Smoked salmon
Upgrade your lunch sandwiches by swapping out ham, chicken and other cold cuts from the deli counter for smoked salmon. Doing so helps you reel in the omega-3 fatty acids shown to improve a growing baby’s brain and eye development. Higher intakes of these high-powered fats may also slash the risk for prenatal depression. Smoked salmon is delicious atop toasted English muffins or strewn over salads.
Like this? Mayonnaise
Try this: Avocado
Instead of slathering nutritionally lackluster mayo on your sandwich bread, try using mashed up avocado. The buttery flesh boasts a laundry list of must-have nutrients—including significant levels of fiber, vitamin K, heart-healthy monounsaturated fat and folate. Expectant gals need to seek out foods brimming with the B vitamin folate to help reduce the risk for neural-tube defects.
Like this? Strawberries
Try this: Raspberries
Raspberries are teeming with fiber, more than twice the amount found in strawberries. In fact, a mere cup of the sweet red morsels provides 8 grams of dietary fiber, about 30 percent of the daily needs during pregnancy and lactation. A high fiber diet can help alleviate constipation, a commonly loathed problem among moms-to-be, and also work to keep blood sugar levels on an even keel, preventing sagging energy levels.
Like this? Peanut butter
Try this: Almond butter
Spoonful for spoonful, almond butter provides about six times as much calcium and twice the amount of magnesium as its iconic counterpart. The dynamic duo of calcium and magnesium in this tasty spread will help build your baby’s bones and teeth. Plus, it’s often spared the unflattering sugar and hydrogenated oils added to many well known peanut butters. When possible, choose unsalted options made with only almonds, and store in the refrigerator to maintain freshness.
Like this? Feta cheese
Try this:Goat cheese
While feta can gussy up any salad, pasteurized soft goat cheese contains about a third less sodium. A recent study found that a pregnancy diet with overly generous amounts of salt may produce undesirable alterations in fetal heart structure. For some women, high sodium intake may also lead to potential pregnancy complications, such as bloating and high blood pressure. Research also suggests that goat milk used to make the horned variety of cheese is richer in nutrients such as omega-3 fats and bone-building calcium than cow’s milk.
Like this? Iceberg lettuce
Try this:Spinach
A good rule of thumb when deciding which greens to stock in your crisper: the darker the green, the greater the nutritional value. Dark leafy greens like spinach, kale and Swiss chard provide a payload of nutrients including vitamin C, vitamin K and beta-carotene. In the body, beta-carotene can be converted into vitamin A, which supports proper organ formation in your developing babe.
Like this? Original soymilk
Try this: Unsweetened soymilk
Surprise! Even unflavored nondairy beverages like soy and almond can sully your diet with extra calories. To avoid sending your blood sugar into a tizzy, look for nondairy drink alternatives labeled “unsweetened.” As you drink more, your taste buds will become accustomed to the absence of sweeteners. Make sure your preferred brand is fortified with vitamins and minerals, in particular calcium and vitamin D.
Like this? Diet soda
Try this:Coconut water
While sipping diet drinks can help you avoid an avalanche of calories, there is little research about the effects of artificial sweeteners used in most diet sodas on expectant and nursing moms and their babes. To be on the safe side, it’s a good idea to steer clear. Instead, guzzle tangy coconut water to help meet your heightened hydration needs during pregnancy and lactation. Gleaned from green coconuts, coconut aqua has potassium in spades, which may help prevent unhealthy rises in blood pressure numbers. With only about 6 grams of natural sugar in a one-cup serving, sipping this tropical delight won’t send your blood sugar on a Rocky Mountain High.
Like this? Eggs
Try this: Omega-3-enriched eggs
Omega-3-enriched eggs are from chickens that have been provided a diet supplemented with a source of omega-3 fatty acids (often flaxseed). Cracking open a couple for breakfast or a budget-friendly dinner can give your diet a boost of these extra special fats necessary for the proper development of your baby. As with other eggs, the omega-enriched ones are a source of choline, an important nutrient that helps brain cells develop normally, which may boost future brainpower in your baby.
Frost Bites
Stock your freezer with these nutrient-packed subzero heroes.
Edamame
Tasty soybeans deliver a smorgasbord of nutrients including fiber, protein, iron and folate. For a quick snack, boil a cup of shelled edamame for five minutes and season with a squirt of lemon juice and a dash of smoked paprika.
Wild blueberries
Research shows that these blue gems possess soaring levels of antioxidants, molecules that help stamp out cell-damaging free radicals. Blend into smoothies or stir into Greek yogurt.
Whole grain waffles
Top a waffle with low-fat cottage cheese and berries for a quick start to the day that doesn’t sacrifice your nutritional needs. Just make sure the first grain in the ingredient list is a whole grain, such as whole-wheat flour.

For the first time since 1996, there are no English representative in the Champions League quarterfinals. With the rise of Bundesliga, this could mean a possible drop to third position in the UEFA rankings for Premier League – which started the season on top, above Spain and Germany.
Currently, La Liga sit six points clear of the Premier League and with three teams still in the Champions League, they can extend their lead on top. Bundesliga is third and they are four points behind England. A single win for each of the German teams can see them secure the second spot.
However, the leagues get equal points for Champions League and Europa League, Chelsea, Tottenham and Newcastle United can still save England’s current position. Although VfB Stuttgart is also playing in Europa, with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the Champions League, it makes three teams for Germany as well.
After Arsenal’s exit at the hands of Bayern, Arsene Wenger rightly called it a “massive wake-up call” for English football. He told reporters:
“It’s a massive wake-up call for us and it means that the rest of European football has caught up with us. We have to take that into consideration when we talk about the Premier League in the future.”
England began the current campaign on top of the UEFA coefficient rankings with 84.41 points, fractionally ahead of Spain (84.186). The latest rankings, which are updated after each round of UEFA club competition matches, see Spain top the charts with 86.453 points and England trail them with 80.106 points while Germany have 76.757 points.
With chief executives slamming the Premier League already, this will come as a defining blow to England’s top tier competition which has long claimed to be the best in the world. First it was the two horses of Spain that overtook England with a little help from Malaga. Now, Bundesliga are closer than ever to add some foundation to their claims of being better than Premier League.
The coefficient rankings are based on the results of each association’s clubs in the five previous European seasons. The rankings determine the number of places allotted to an association in the forthcoming UEFA club competition.
UEFA rankings: Point distribution
Each team gets two points for a win and one point for a draw while the points for the qualifying and play-off rounds are halved. For the Round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals and the final of the Champions League, an extra point is awarded to each club. While the same goes for just the quarterfinals, semifinals and the final of the Europa League.
Finally, four points are awarded for participation in the group stage of the Champions League and another four for qualifying for the Round of 16.
The UEFA country coefficient is calculated by averaging the points obtained by all the clubs representing an association in both of that season’s European club competitions. The average is than tallied with the previous four seasons to calculate the coefficient.
England’s recent European performances
England’s domination in Europe has been fading for a couple of seasons now. Although since the all-English Champions League final in 2007/08, there has been an English team in the final on three out of the four occasions.
In 08/09, there were three English semifinalists, but Barcelona took the crown in their memorable sextuple-winning season under Pep Guardiola. The following season, Manchester United and Arsenal were both knocked out in the quarterfinals. United reached the final again in 10//11 but Barca were still too good for them.
Last season, Chelsea was the only English team to make it through the Round of 16 and they were the eventual winners of the competition. This season, their only hope of retaining the second spot on the country coefficient rankings lies in Europa League.
Chelsea and Newcastle face Steaua Bucuresti and Anzhi Makhachkala respectively and if they want to go through to the next round neither can afford an away goal as things stands right now. While Tottenham are heading to Italy to face Inter Milan but the Nerazzurri have a 3-0 deficit from White Hart Lane to overturn.
Germany’s recent European performances
Football in Germany has been on a steady rise for some years now and it seems like their hard work is finally starting to pay off.
Bayern Munich has dominated domestically but in more recent years we have witnessed the emergence of teams like Stuttgart return to the throne for the first time since 1991/92 and VfL Wolfsburg win their first ever Bundesliga trophy in 2008/09. Dortmund won the league in 2010/11 and managed to retain their title last season.
In Europe, we have seen Bayern Munich played the Champions League final twice in the last three seasons. The other regular participant is Schalke 04, who reached the 2010/11 semifinal and the 2007/08 quarterfinals.
Schalke are not playing in Europe anymore this season but Bayern and Dortmund are awaiting their Champions League quarterfinal draw while Stuttgart have a two-goal deficit against Seria A side Lazio.
Other possible changes in UEFA rankings
The race for European domination is on but further down the table, Portugal are pushing France. Benfica have a one goal advantage over Bordeaux while PSG knocked out Valencia to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League.
On the UEFA rankings table, Portuguese Liga are placed 6th with 57.501 points, just over one point behind 5th placed Ligue 1 (58.666).
With Ajax’s elimination in the Round of 32 of the Europa League, Netherlands have lost their chance of chasing Russia for the 8th spot. The Russian Premier League are looking strong to overtake Ukraine by the end of may with three of their teams still in Europe.

The EPL being best has been a dubious claim for several years now. Over the last two years both runners up to the EPL title got knocked out of the CL in the group stages. The EPL may actually be one of the most attacking leagues, but this trend implies poor defending as well.
It’s both an issue of poor tactical planning and poor defending. Look at how Liverpool were ko’ed by Zenit or how Modric killed United despite having just scored one goal and made a couple assists through all his Liga play this season. In open play Liverpool were comfortably defeated and its because Modric got so much space on the ball compared to la liga that he could have than much impact.
20/03/2013 @ 01:38
The Premier League was the strongest between 2004-2008, which is four years.
This idea that the Premier League has been dominant for much longer stems from the UK media and Sky Sports, which both try at their utmost to overhype the league.
I’m not stupid and will not say the EPL is a bad league, it’s a fantastic league, yet only its followers think that it’s the best. Ask any football neutral and you’ll probably be surprised by the answer.
It would also help if EPL fans broaden their horizons a bit and realize that football is not just the EPL and the Clasico.Round eight of the 2011 AMA Supercross, an FIM World Championship, took place at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, GA, over the weekend and the Honda Red Riders put in solid performances aboard their Honda CRF450R and CRF250R race machines. American Honda Racing's Trey Canard recorded a solid fifth place finish aboard his CRF450R, while TwoTwo Motorsports' Chad Reed raced his CRF450R to his fourth podium finish of the season by taking third overall. GEICO Honda's Justin Barcia raced an inspiring main to finish runner-up in the Supercross Lites East competition aboard his Honda CRF250R.
After winning his heat race, including nailing the holeshot in the race, Canard got away to a solid start in the main and was among the top five rounding the first turn. Moving into third early on the opening lap, the Honda racer had his sights firmly set on catching the leaders when he made a mistake in the whoops section, which sent him off the track. Losing six spots in the excursion, Canard rallied hard from ninth position and made up four places before the race's end to finish in fifth overall.
"I loved everything about my bike's setup tonight; it had such a good feel to it," said Canard. "I'm really disappointed about crashing in the whoops section. I got a kick off a whoop and lost my footing and I nearly went over the bars. Luckily, I didn't hit the ground and was able to get going again pretty quickly. Unfortunately, there were a lot of riders close behind me going into that section, and they were able to get by me while I was off the track. Once I got going again I made some good passes and was able to get by Andrew Short for fifth place on the final lap. Despite my little off-track excursion, everything else about my race was pretty good tonight. I got the holeshot in the heat race and was among the lead pack in the main off the start, so that's great. I have the speed to be up front and at the last couple of events I've gotten good starts so that part of my race has really started to come together."
Reed put in a dominating performance in the main by nailing a good start and quickly moving into second position on the opening lap. By lap three the Honda racer was in the lead, where he stayed for most of the race until getting passed late in the race. Digging deep, Reed made an aggressive move to regain the lead, but had a coming-together with the race leader on the final lap that resulted in a crash. He got up charging and made a pass in the final turn to finish in third.
GEICO Honda's Kevin Windham put in a solid performance aboard his CRF450R, taking eighth overall. Getting a mid-pack start in the main and rounding the opening lap in ninth position, the veteran Honda racer had worked his way up into seventh position by lap five but relinquished a spot before the checkers fell.
In the Supercross Lites East competition, GEICO Honda's Justin Barcia put in an inspired performance aboard his CRF250R after injuring his wrist in a crash during qualifying earlier in the day, pushing through the pain to win his heat race and finish second overall in the main. The Honda racer got the holeshot in his heat race, then got another good start in the main and was among the front-runners rounding the opening turn. Teammate Blake Wharton was fastest out of the start gate, and he raced away to an early lead while Barcia slotted into second. From there the duo went on to dominate the top two spots for more than half the race until Barcia relinquished a spot on lap 11. Unfortunately, Wharton lost his front end and the lead the following lap, and Barcia was elevated back into second spot, where he stayed until the race's end. Despite going down late in the race, Wharton recovered to finish fourth overall.

X
All Updates
A lot of individuals want to live a more environmentally friendly lifestyle but they just don't understand how. The planet is being damaged each and every year and this is among the main reasons folks want to begin living green. For people who don't know how to start living green you are going to find some guidelines below.
One of the first things you're going to want to begin doing is choosing more properly the things you throw away in your garbage. You have to remember that our landfills are being filled with items that could actually be recycled but instead they are simply being buried in our earth. Of course if you decide to separate everything that can be recycled, not only will you be keeping this out of our dump's, you will also be protecting a few of our natural resources. I know you already comprehend that anytime you dispose of an aluminum can or a glass bottle, these are in fact things which might be recycled which would help preserve our resources.
The next automobile you invest in should also be something that is better for the environment than the old gas guzzlers. While a fully electric car would be the best option, picking a hybrid which runs on gas and electric is still a viable option. Regular vehicles produce a lot of pollution but a hybrid car will create much less and will also end up saving you cash on your gas costs.
Consider purchasing solar power panels or even getting yourself wind turbines to help you power your house. You need to remember that solar and wind power have dual benefits for both you and the planet. If you don't have a lot space in your yard for solar energy panels, consider installing them on your roof. Of course the best placement for your solar energy panels is on your roof as it will normally wind up catching more of sunlight. For individuals choose wind turbines, because they take up such little space they are able to fit and pretty much any size yard. This can be since conventional approaches now are enhancing rates year on year but when you then reason in that the expense of a solarking solar panels setup have in fact cut in half within the last Twelve months.
An additional good way to live environmentally friendly is to keep trees and plants in your yard as opposed to cutting them down. Having a bare yard won't permit animals and nature to have any place to live in your yard and getting shade trees can help keep the cooling bill down during the summer. Not to mention you need to recognize that these trees also create oxygen, which is essential for just about every living thing on this planet.
There are so plenty of different ways to become eco-friendly you just need to learn what you can do and also the best ways to go about it. If you're trying to find more ways that you can help protect our planet and live a green life you can try looking at search engines like Google. Even if you only decide to do little things, you need to bear in mind that if millions of people are doing small things, it can make a difference.additionally information concerning this solar panels

So I get more bug reports. The problem is not pcsc-lite or the CCID driver. The bug is in libusb.
History of the bug #56
- The bug has been identified and a fix was proposed in April 2010.
- libusb-1.0.8 has been released in 4th May 2010 without the bug fixed.
- A fix has been committed in libusb git repository in September 10th, 2011.
- libusb 1.0.9-rc3 with the fix has not moved since September 22th, 2011.
- The patch is not yet available in the master branch, only in the testing branch.
This is the 4th article about this libsub bug. We already had:
- "new" version of libusb, March 30, 2011
- "new" version of libusb, part 2, May 5, 2011
- libusb 1.0.9-rc1, September 18, 2011
- and now libusb-1.0.9-rc3, December 3, 2011
How to get a fixed libusb?
$ git clone git://git.libusb.org/libusb.git $ cd libusb $ git branch testing origin/testing $ git checkout testing
If you want to use an already prepared .tar.bz2 archive I provide one at.
ConclusionA lot of time and energy is lost by users of smart cards reporting bugs, and by me answering to bugs.
The bad news is that I don't see any positive signal for the future of libusb. I will continue to refer to the this article for any bug report mentioning a 60 seconds delay.Save our Homes Haringey’ say ”NO!’ to forced gentrification., Save Our Homes Haringey stand up against the planned eviction. The first is due for 11 March 2013.
Crown Housing Association, estate managers, informed the tenants before Christmas that they had to hand over the land to its owners, the Metropolitan Police. Eviction notices have been issued for the second week in March 2013. The Met requires the land back in order to sell it on to property developers, although no planning permission has been given.[1]
Residents set to be evicted from a Muswell Hill housing estate by the Metropolitan Police have accused the force of preparing to destroy their community for “the sake of greed”.[2]
Crown Housing say they have no other vacant properties and have advised tenants to apply to Haringey Council, who have in turn advised that due to individual circumstances they have no legal obligation to re-house some of the residents, leaving these families homeless and vulnerable.[3]
The Met are ripping the heart out of the community that live here. Many of the families have raised their children here and the community has grown together. When they signed their Tenancy Agreements they had no idea that years down the line they would be evicted from their homes and made to start their lives all over again.
The residents have written to recipients including David Cameron, the Housing Minister, Boris Johnson, the Met Police Property Services and Crown Housing Association, without any positive response.
These planned evictions are typical of what is happening across Britain. Government austerity cuts mean that the Metropolitan Police, like all other public services, has to reduce its budget by £500 million.[4] The cuts are due to the policies that the government is implementing to pay its debts. Britain’s debts have resulted from billions of pounds awarded to the financial investors via the bankers’ bonuses, made worse by a financial system that allows corporations to avoid paying tax.[5] Recent academic studies have calculated that in Britain there is the largest gap between the rich and the majority.[6] The government’s policies are destroying services and peoples’ lives all for the benefit of the few. In England alone, there are 710,000 empty and derelict properties [7] which only serve the interests of rich property tycoons who can raise the price of rents for everyone. Who’s paying taxes now?
Local resident Caroline Gallagher said “I want to fight: it’s unreasonable to be pushed out.” [8] Caroline’s sister Susie said, ‘No one is accountable for what is happening to these families. It’s as though profit and monetary gain are more important than peoples’ homes and lives”.
Residents invite their friends and family to show support on Saturday 2nd March at 3pm, as they stand up to forced eviction.

The indictment charges all 25 defendants with conspiracy to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine from August 2009 through June 2010. The indictment also charges various individual defendants with distribution and possession with intent to distribute both powder cocaine and crack cocaine. In addition, the indictment seeks the forfeiture of property constituting or derived from the proceeds of the defendants' drug trafficking. If convicted, the defendants face a minimum of 10 years to life in prison on the conspiracy charge andbetween 20 to 40 years in prison on each count of distribution and possession with intent to distribute.
Sixteen of the 25 defendants were arrested on June 6 and 7, and made their initial appearances in federal court before Magistrate Judge Ann E. Vitunac. Two are in statecustody, and seven defendants remain at large. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Donald D. Middlebrooks.
Operation Mexican Minute is a cooperative federal, state and local law enforcement investigation, approved and funded by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF), a national Department of Justice program that supports investigations of significant multi-state and international drug trafficking organizations. This investigation hasresulted locally in the seizure of powder cocaine and crack cocaine, including one seizure of 10.
Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for ICE John Morton said, "This investigation represents one of the most powerful attacks the U.S. government has launched against criminal organizations smuggling narcotics, weapons and cash across our borders. The results of Project Deliverance clearly demonstrate the combined strength that federal agencies bring to bear in the battle against cartels."
U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer stated, "Simply put, today's announcement would not be possible without the cooperation of federal, state and local law enforcement. By working together, we exponentially multiply our resources and refocus our commitment to fight crime on a local and even a national level. Project Deliverance confirms the success that can be achieved through such cooperation."
"Project Deliverance identified and dismantled a group of Mexican drug traffickers distributing multi-kilograms of cocaine per month. These traffickers were able to create significant transportation routes from Mexico to the residents of Florida," said Drug Enforcement Administration Miami Field Division Special Agent in Charge Mark R. Trouville.
E.J. Picolo, special agent in charge of the Fort Myers Regional Operations Center of the FDLE, stated, "FDLE is pleased to have partnered with Highlands County Sheriff's Office, DEA, the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office, ICE, and the U.S. Attorney's Office on this important investigation. I am proud of the results, and the cases impact not only in Highlands County, but much of South Florida. We look forward to continuing our combined efforts."
Highlands County Sheriff Susan Benton also praised the coordinated effort, saying, "This dedicated team of law enforcement professionals, without regard for rank or jurisdictional boundaries or agency, worked long days and long hours conducting a nearly year-long investigation. Our communities should be proud of the results of this cooperative action. The leadership displayed by the U.S. Attorney's office resulted in tremendous enthusiasm among our agents and deputies, which further ensured these offenders would be apprehended and prosecuted and our citizens safer as a result."
The investigation was conducted by DEA Miami Field Division, ICE Homeland Security Investigations in Miami, FDLE Fort Myers Regional Operations Center, the Palm BeachCounty Sheriff's Office and the Highlands County Sheriff's Office with the assistance of the Delray Police Department, the Boca Raton Police Department, the Hendry County Sheriff's Office and the U.S. Marshals Service.
This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Patricia L. Diaz and Jennifer Millien.Walkers Asks Customers to “Do us a Flavour”
During the summer of 2008, UK-based Walkers, makers of potato crisps (chips for our American readers), asked their customers to help create the company’s next flavor with their “Do us a Flavour, Pick us a Winner” competition. And though contests are nothing new, this one is modeled a bit differently. Not only does the winner get bragging rights as the taste’s inventor, but they also receive 50,000 pounds in prize money and 1% of future sales in the new product – an unique opportunity to truly feel apart of the Walker brand.
After receiving “zillions” of entries (according to the website), Walkers has narrowed the field down to six choices that they have made available in stores, leaving the final verdict in the public’s hands with a popular vote taking place online and through mobile devices. A smart move that encourages further engagement with the brand as both consumer and judge. And giving customers the feeling that they have a stake in a brand’s decision making process and ultimately in determining its success, might be the most important part. The Independent explains:
The truth is, getting one million people to engage with your brand at a level that goes much deeper than a single moment at the point of purchase creates a very different sort of customer relationship. In fact, your customers become much more than customers; they become partners. And, at a stroke, Walkers is seen as a company that respects its customers enough to cede some brand control to them, to give them a sort of co-ownership in the product.
It’s a mirage, and we know it. But though Walkers isn’t letting its customers run amok with its brand, it recognises that brands now have to open themselves up for the public to engage with, play with, manipulate and, crucially, have fun with.
The whole process has become democratised. Consumers are already demanding interaction with brands, and they’re not waiting to be invited to participate. If they’re not appropriating brands to make their own YouTube films with, they’re blogging on them, or creating Facebook pages dedicated to their love of them, or criticising them before a potential web audience of millions.
Brands can ignore all of this (bad idea) or join in and encourage it (good idea). And since brands have become public property, Walkers clearly reckons on using the public as its product development team; consumer as brand architect (and therefore brand advocate).
And in case you were wondering, our money is on “Builder’s Breakfast” to walk away with the grand prize in the end.

STOW: The Stow Police Department and local Target store are holding Stow’s National Night Out event on Aug. 6 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on the grassy area between SKIP Playground and Fire Station No. 1 on Darrow Road.
The free event will offer food, games, prizes and entertainment for residents of all ages. Children can play on inflatables or explore safety vehicles from the Stow Police & Fire Departments. Officers will be available to discuss safety with all residents, and parents can bring their children for finger printing or identification.
National Night Out is an annual event designed to strengthen our communities by encouraging neighborhoods to engage in stronger relationships with each other and with their local law enforcement partners. The goal is to heighten crime-prevention awareness, build support and participation in local anti-crime programs.

The email he sent me:
Dear Laura:
In the last 15 days, supporters of the 2nd Amendment pledged nearly $15,000 for support of the important new film “Assaulted: Civil Rights Under Fire” that exposes California as the front line in the civil rights battle between public safety and the 2nd Amendment. The Second Amendment Foundation and the Calguns Foundation have each contributed $5,000.00 to get this project off the ground.
As a blogger and the writer of "Insert Witty Title Here", you are at the cutting edge of communicating with the online Pro-2A community and we are asking you to join us in supporting this project. Your help is necessary to make this happen.
Please go to and make your pledge now. Also, of equal importance, we are asking you to reach out to your readers and let them know about this project.
Thank you for your support,
Ray Carter
Director of Development
I tossed a few dollars their way. I like the 2AF, and I like what they're doing for our community. They're doing a heck of a lot more than that massive organization that likes to harass the crap out of the lot of us, that's for sure...
So, if you've got a little spare cash available (assuming you've already supported the kilted guys, of course), consider it.

Done and done. I know Ray, he's a stand up guy!Two hours ago I suddenly felt like crying on the way home from a picnic with friends at the Mission. Not crying because I miss Shawn (is that mean? I don't mean it to be) but because I NEED A BREAK. I've said before that I don't know how military wives do it. I don't know how single parents do it. I don't know how moms (or dads) give of themselves all day every day and not want to just scream at their kids and random childless people at Costco who run to the "I can help the next guest in line over here!" register. Hey- asshole! Look at me- I have two kids poking each other's eyes out over here? Throw me a bone?
{And if Birdie kicks the wall while she should be sleeping ONE more time while I'm trying to blog, I might scream. I'm convinced most moms drink around bedtime. I need to get on this.}
It's been a crazy week in general with all these play dates I set up to distract the kids from Shawn being gone and then the Santa Barbara newspaper running a story on MPM and the upcoming Nickelodeon show this Sunday... I feel like I should be so excited and hopeful and yet, I'm just tired. I'm tired of thinking about the business and what steps I need to take... Right now I feel like I will never be able to put the time in to MPM that I actually want to. I can't even walk in to Coffee Bean for 5 minutes to pin up business cards without my kids fighting and screaming and embarrassing the living day lights out of me. Why can't we leave our kids in cars again? (Thanks to the idiot that had to screw that up for me.). I mean seriously if I were President the SAHP (whether it be mom or dad) would get paid a nice fat salary! Sometimes I think it's crazy I do this all day and get no financial compensation! It's THE hardest work I've ever done.
And then there's way more awesome moms out there attempting to explain homemade Play-Doe recipes to my kids. LALALALA- we're not listennning! I cannot handle regular Play-Doe, why would we make it homemade? That sounds like the worst idea evvverrr... Especially when the husband is gone. For a week. And our carpets already look like the dog just rolled around in mud on them. Oh wait that's right he did.
Friends keep "giving me ideas" for blogs to write while Shawn is gone. Yes you. And you. Stop. I have ideas- I've never been at a shortage for ideas to blog about. I'm actually avoiding the blog because I'm tired. Like blogging currently does not fit in to a kids-home-all-Summer-long-and-Mommy-gets-no-break lifestyle. I think people who don't blog think blogging is easy and posts just go up magically and within an hour. Hey- try it! It's not easy! It's time consuming! I wish it were easy and magical and that when I posted something people would just read it and share it and comment and I got a paycheck where I could buy a new rug every month. Gosh I love rugs.
I digress... I need my husband back. I need my wing man- my parenting wing man. Because I'm not cut out for single parenting. Did I mention Birdie peed on the couch twice this week so my living room inevitably smells like good ol' fashioned urine? Ya! And that she got ahold of a bag of sugar at 7am and filled 6 glass cups to the rim (and the floor all around) with it? Win! And Cormac's having night terrors again... Awesome! And yep, I just need to have a day to myself a-sap. Like a-lone. Like I don't even want a stranger to say hello to me. (Unless you saw me in the paper, then tell me how awesome I am.)
Here's a picture so you know we're all still alive. Well really just the kids because I'm pretty much dead. Tired. Dead tired. No reason to be alarmed. I'm totally alive and kicking. And screaming.
Ps- watch me on TV this Sunday night. I'll be moonlighting on Take Me To Your Mother on NickMom (check local listings for times). Who knows how long I'll be on or what I'm even going to say- I'm a loose cannon you know, so I don't even I know what I said... Hopefully something about throwing parties but I give no guarantees.
xo Party or Die xo
kenna
when are you and Shawn going on that anniversary trip? make it happen, we all need a break sometimes.
I have one 2 yr old in the needy, screaming, "no", whiney phase. I had to take him to work today (boring office job, family business) and I kept getting the "poor you" look. I'm hiding out in the bathroom right now because it's the only quiet time I get. *hugs*
SO awesome that you're on NickMom!!! Youre amazing!!! Im so living your parallel life, except my hubby is home. Your words - ." - is exactly what I think every single day. This working/stay at home thing is no joke! I think we need a 'business meeting' asap. Glad to see your still alive :)
xoxo

Comment (4)
Powell a big help for HopkinsPosted by on August 20, 2013 – 6:00 am
With Dustin Hopkins winning the kicking job following the release of Rian Lindell, the rookie kicker was quick to thank punter and holder Shawn Powell. Hopkins had Powell as his holder at Florida State for three seasons, so coming to kick in Buffalo proved to be an advantage for him. What Hopkins didn’t know is when he had an issue with accuracy it was Powell that was trying to correct it for him.
“Having Shawn for three years and having him aware of how I like the ball to lean, he’s actually helped me out a lot,” Hopkins said. “When I first came in I had a more drastic lean and without me knowing he was giving me more of a straight up ball and that’s when I started to get in a groove.
We noticed that on film and saw that. So I figured if I’m hitting a clean ball like this let’s just stick with this. So he’s helped me through that situation without even me knowing about it. He kind of did it and we’ve decided to stick with it.”
Hopkins was hooking field goal attempts to the left in the spring practices, but those steadily went away in training camp and Powell’s adjusted holds helped account for that.

Powell thankful for battle with MoormanPosted by on July 4, 2013 – 9:03 am
As we profiled with the beginning of our daily Top 25 questions until Training Camp on Buffalobills.com today, the punter competition figures to be even stiffer than it was last summer. Brian Moorman edged out then rookie Shawn Powell at the start of the season, but Powell got a call back a month later. Now the shoe is on the other foot for Powell, who as the incumbent has free agent Brian Stahovich breathing down his neck.
Powell believes the competition he had with Moorman served him well in preparation for the current competition he’ll face in training camp.
“There are going to be good punters out there. In this business everywhere you go there’s going to be stiff competition,” Powell said. “With Brian, it really helped me with the competitive edge and being able to understand what competition is all about.”
Of course Stahovich gained similar experience competing in Colts training camp last season, only to lose out in a battle with Indianapolis incumbent punter Pat McAfee.
Powell appears to have the ability to kick with superior hang time, but he’ll have to do it consistently to beat out a quality candidate in Stahovich. This very quietly is shaping up to be a very entertaining competition.

Powell ties Bills markPosted by on November 16, 2012 – 9:50 am
Rookie punter Shawn Powell tied a Bills mark with his performance Thursday night.
Powell tied a Bills record with five punts inside the Dolphins 20-yard line. His best was clearly the one late in the fourth quarter that went out of bounds at the Miami one-yard line.
“When I hit it, and I knew it was up there, I was like, ‘Alright, he’s probably going to fair catch this one.’ And that’s really all I could ask for is a fair catch,” Powell said. “You saw what he was doing to us, he bounced it to the outside and we just have a great coverage team to get him, but I didn’t want to give him that chance. I saw him run away from it, and I was like, OK, let’s see if we can get a good bounce on it. I looked up, and I hit it straight in the air, and at first I thought it was going to go from the inside of the pylon out (of bounds). Obviously it didn’t. It was a real good feeling. A real good feeling.”
Powell’s net punting average for the game was an impressive 40.9 yards on seven punts.

Thanks to everyone who came out to the Twin Cities Code Camp, where I was among many speakers. This event is huge, and the organizers did a great job, not just with logistics but also in pulling together a lot of great topics, and excellent speakers. For those who came to my presentation, the source for my demo code can be downloaded here. You can also view my presentation as well:
TCCC - Javascript Unit Testing with QUnit and Mockjax on Prezi
One of the coolest part about speaking at an event like this is when people come up to you afterwards with information on your topic that you don't know. After my talk, someone asked about integrating Code Coverage, and he showed me JSCoverage, which I'd never heard of before. It doesn't look like its being actively maintained any more, but it certainly looks interesting, and still worth a look to see if we can use this to bring first class Unit Testing practices to Javascript. I'll definitely be looking at it in detail to see if I can incorporate it into this presentation, and especially to pull it into our practices where I work.

Thanks to Milwaukee ALT.NET for hosting on Monday, and allowing me to present on Unit Testing Javascript with QUnit and Mockjax. It was a great group of people, and I appreciated the good discussion and questions. As promised, here is the presentation material from Monday:
Javascript Unit Testing with QUnit and Mockjax on Prezi
Also, you can look at the source code from the demonstration as well, which is in the following zip file. Thanks again to everyone who attended!
I'd like to thank the organizers and participants at Milwaukee Agile last night for making it a great time for me. I presented a slightly updated version of Guerrilla Agile, and the discussion afterwards with those who were there was excellent. I really enjoy presenting on that particular topic, because there are always people listening who have done something similar, and can offer great insights into how to introduce Agile in a company that is unreceptive to it.
For those that are interested, here is the presentation that went along with my talk.
Guerrilla Agile - Milwaukee Agile on Prezi
About a month ago, I took the day off from work and went to Oshkosh for the EAA Fly-In. If you've never had the opportunity to go, and you enjoy flying, it's quite the experience. For the two weeks of the fly-in, the skies over Oshkosh become the busiest airspace in the world, and the variety of aircraft is quite impressive. The day that I went up was declared to be Burt Rutan day, and the air show that day featured several of his innovative designs, and they had several more on display which did not fly. Burt Rutan was also there that day, spoke at several different venues, and I was lucky enough to hear him speak.
Burt Rutan, in my opinion, is one of the move innovative aerospace designers in history. While few of his designs have become extremely popular at the time, the designs he used often times were incorporated years later after more mainstream companies and designers started using them. He is truly the definition of "years ahead of his time". Among various aircraft, he also designed SpaceShipOne, the first private manned spaceship.
Rutan spoke on many different topics, from his history as a designer, to the Space Shuttle. However, one of the more interesting topics he talked about was the value of having an aeronatical engineering degree in aerospace engineering. His view was that graduates of an aerospace program were essentially statisticians with no creativity. They would look at lots of data about how a current design operated, decide on a couple of areas that could be changed, and made minor tweaks. Then they'd run the data again. In any given year, an aircraft design would improve, but only on the margins.
According to him, many aerospace designers don't have a "gut". They don't come up with innovated designs that are truly game changers because they don't have a gut sense about how a design should work. If they can't model it directly, it won't happen. Rutan also talked about some of the low tech and rather simplistic methods he used to test various aircraft designs to verify that it would actually fly... but that was generally enough. One of those methods involved pulling a scale model attached to a trailer with a ball joint down a highway with his car.
Rutan's point was, just like the old basketball saying goes that "You can't teach height", you also can't teach that kind of creativity. You are either an out of the box thinker, or you're not. And often times colleges are structured in such a way that they try to suppress any subersive thoughts you might have about new and innovated ideas. This is not to say that data analysis and modeling aren't important. But at the same time, in any technical field, there is far more to the job than simply following existing models and slightly improving them.
These same lessons apply to software development. Education and certifications can be good signals to someone's ability, but there is far more to being a good developer than knowing your GoF patterns and the syntax to your chosen language.
Misc
For those who were at my Windows Management Instrumentation talk Saturday at Chicago Code Camp, you may recall one of the attendees mentioning an eBook on WQL in Powershell. I thought it would be worthwhile providing the link to Ravikanth's eBook, and thanks to Steve Murawski for the added information. Ravkanth also has a series on his blog on using WQL in Powershell, which if you found WMI to be useful based on my talk, is definitely worth a read.
I want to thank all the organizers, volunteers and attendees for a great time at Chicago Code Camp yesterday. I ended up presenting on two different topics, instead of the planned one. One of the speakers in the first session was unable to attend at the last minute, so I filled in and presented Guerrilla Agile (which I'll also be presenting to Chicago ALT.NET on Wednesday). It was a good opportunity to test out that new presentation to a smaller crowd and get some feedback. There was no code to go along with this presenation, just this presentation:
Of course, I also gave a slightly shorter version of my Application Instrumenation with WMI talk which I've given before. The group for that talk was very good, and had lots of great questions, and a few extra insights which I appreciated. You can find the presenation and code for the presentation in this zip archive. I've also uploaded the presentation to Slide Share:
In case anyone thought that I only had one speaking topic, you will have an opportunity to hear me at Chicago ALT.NET on May 18th. I'll be presenting "Guerrilla Agile" - How to Adopt Agile in a Company That is Hostile to Agile Methodologies. How many times have you ever gone to a meeting discussing Agile Development, and heard many of the people in the audience talk about how they were "interested in Agile" and were "excited about it" but weren't actually doing Agile? That is often times because the company they are working for not only doesn't currently use Agile Methods, but is actually hostile to it's adoption.
Should you as a budding Agile Practitioner just stand back and study Agile without ever actually doing it? Or is there some other way that you can introduce Agile into that hostile environment? Guerrilla Agile will give you a set of tools to use in that hostile company.
What are you doing on May 14th? If you have the day available, you should definitely come down to Grayslake Illinois for Chicago Code Camp. Code Camp is for developers of all skill levels, and will have multiple sessions running side by side. There is no language or framework of choice, so developers of all stripes are welcome. You can see the full speaker list here as well as the session listing.
You might notice that I am on the speaker list, and will be presenting "Application Instrumentation with WMI". If you're interested in attending (even if you don't plan on seeing my session), you can do so for free at Event Brite.
I found this story about a man suing Facebook to be rather interesting:.
Now then, I don't know if this is worth half a million dollars, but it still poses an interesting question. I think he's right, that even though the service if "free", Facebook does get payment from all of us in that it uses our time and our information in order to allow it to make money through advertising. And while Facebook certainly ought to be able to ban people from violating its Terms of Service, does it not at least owe someone an explanation other than "you violated our Terms of Service"? After all, these are usually very complicated, and often times vague legal style documents.
Its quite possible that someone can violate any website's Terms of Service and not realize it. Oftne times these violations are really subject to debate. This type of issue has also come up with Apple when developers have their apps rejected for often times unknown violations of their App Store Standards. In Apple's case, these vague responses are even worse because developers pay money to submit an app to the store.
People also complain about Google's responsiveness when they have problems with their free services like Gmail. Since so many of the money making websites that we may develop are "free" and use an ad-based model for revenue, the question becomes... what do we owe our users?
So you may have noticed that my site template got cleaned up a bit. What can I say... being a software guy is sort of like being a cobler. Your children are often barefoot.
You may have also noticed this advertisement on the right side which I put up more than a week ago:
If you're interested in developing for Windows Phone 7, as I am, then you might want to think about attending one of these Developer Launch events. And as it turns out, putting that advertisment up will also give me a shot at winning a free Windows Phone 7. The odds are slim, but if you don't play, you can't win!
I've also added a link to my INETA Regional Speaker profile. As you've probably noticed, this year I've decided to venture into the realm of User Group speaking engagements. I've already done three this year, that have been fairly well received, and I'm hoping to expand on that. My first presentations were on "Application Instrumentation with WMI", but I have other presentations I'm interested in doing as well. I am currently developing presentations on "An Introduction to Umbraco" (a fairly well done open source .NET CMS package) and also another presentation on Software Estimation (no working title yet). If you are interested in having me come to speak on any of these topics, please feel free to contact me, or check out my INETA profile.

Anyone wishing to attend the once-in-a-lifetime Olympic Torch Relay special city celebration at Temple Newsam in Leeds next weekend has been given a late chance as an extra batch of tickets has been made available.
The free event which takes place at Temple Newsam Estate from 12:30pm on Sunday 25 June is part of Leeds’ celebrations for the visit of the iconic flame through the city on its way to the London 2012 Olympic Games next month. Flame itself will arrive and will light a special cauldron on stage.
Tickets had already been issued to those who had registered interest in attending, but a limited number of additional tickets have now been made available. They.
The special city celebration event will also showcase Leeds talent, with local dancers and volunteers leading a special mass-participation dance while there will also be performances by Leeds Young Authors and a mass sing led by international singer, jazz pianist and choir master Pete Churchill along with over 200 members of local community choirs.
The Olympic Torch Relay will be in Leeds over three days next week – Tuesday 19 June, Sunday 24 June and Monday 25 June, being carried by 55 torchbearers for a total of approximately 17 miles across the city.
On Tuesday it arrives at 11am and travels through Boston Spa, Wetherby and Harewood and then will be celebrated at a lunchtime event at Harewood House before leaving the city just after 1pm.
It then return to Leeds shortly after 5pm on Sunday 24 June travelling through Headingley, Potternewton, Harehills and Richmond Hill as it makes its way to Temple Newsam arriving at the concert, one of only four such major celebration events to be happening in the country, at approximately 7:30pm.
Early the next morning (Monday 25 June) the flame’s journey resumes shortly after 7am from Leeds Town Hall, and travels through the city centre taking in The Headrow, Millennium Square, Briggate and County Arcade before heading to the Royal Armouries and then through Hunslet via the John Charles Centre for Sport and to Beeston past Elland Road before heading through Morley and out of Leeds by approximately 9:30am.
Full details of the timings and maps of the route through Leeds can be seen at, along with information about the community celebrations being held along the route as the flame passes by.
Leeds City Council executive member for leisure Councillor Adam Ogilvie said:
“The waiting it almost over for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see one of the world’s most iconic symbols in Leeds. I would encourage everyone in the city to make the most of this chance by attending the celebration event at Temple Newsam, attending one of the community events along the route or standing on the roadside and giving the torch a wonderful reception as it comes past.
“Across the country the reaction to the torch has looked great with big crowds greeting it on its journey, so it would be perfect for everyone in Leeds to come out and make it a really memorable week of celebration.”
To find out how to volunteer and get instructions for the mass dance element of the Temple Newsam event go to. For information on how Leeds is getting involved in the London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games visit.
The Olympic Torch Relay is being produced by The London 2012 Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) along with Presenting Partners Coca-Cola, Lloyds TSB and Samsung.
The Olympic Torch Relay is a 70-day tour of the UK, travelling 8,000 miles 12 hours a day with 66 overnight stops around the country en route to London on July 27 2012, where it will light the cauldron in the Olympic Stadium to officially declare the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games. In total the Olympic Flame will be carried across the UK by 8,000 inspirational torchbearers each of whom will have a story of personal achievement and/or contribution to the local community.

As you can see above, this Galaxy Note 10.1 sign enthusiastically points out that the tablet does indeed measure 10.1 inches and is a Galaxy Note device, complete with its very own S Pen. The actual specs of the device are still unknown.
Some folks seemed a little underwhelmed with the arrival of the 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab 2 yesterday, so it'll be interesting to see what kinds of features Samsung decides to pack in to the Galaxy Note 10.1. The company won't be having a full-fledged MWC press conference, but you can bet that we'll be bringing you more details on the Note 10.1 as we get them. What do you all make of this new slate so far? Has its 10.1-inch size and S Pen functionality piqued your interest?

But now it seems the rapper has joined the ranks of celebrities like Lil Wayne, Damon Dash and R. Kelly in facing financial disaster. According to reports, Master P is being sued by a group of crew members from his 2003 film, Uncle P, for $240,000 in unpaid wages.
According to TMZ, court documents show that the angry crew members previously sued Master P in 2005 for unpaid fees and won, but the No Limit Records general allegedly failed to pay up.
Now, the class has taken their case to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles, hoping to finally receive their money as well as push Master P into bankruptcy so that an independent trustee will be appointed to manage the mogul’s assets.
Perhaps it’s time that celebrities like Master P divert some attention from making money to actually learning how to manage their colossal incomes for the sake of those they employ and their own piggy banks. –nicholas robinson

Real Name: Marshall Lee Brown
Aliases: None Known
Wanted For: Murder
Missing Since: December 29, 1996
CaseEdit
Details: In the early morning hours of December 29, 1996, Marshall Lee Brown came to a disabled van parked on Railroad Avenue. Four other individuals were in the van, including Steven Calhoun, who testified against him in a 1977 murder, and David Brown. Marshall seated in the front passenger seat, took out a gun and fired it at Calhoun, seated immediately behind him in the rear passenger seat. Calhoun later died from the gunshot. Brown attempted to obtain the weapon from Marshall, who tried to shoot Brown during the struggle. At the time of the shootings, Marshall was a fugitive who had escaped from prison in April 1996 while serving a sentence for second degree murder. Brown escaped the scene and is wanted by the police.
Extra Notes: This case first aired on the April 17, 1998 episode of Unsolved Mysteries. He was also featured on I (Almost) Got Away With It.
Results: Captured. Marshall Lee Brown was arrested in July 1999, convicted of Steven's murder, and is now serving time in prison.

Much of this emerging city-by-city strategy mirrors what ACORN initiated in moving living wage ordinances around the country, and in fact some of these fights in Connecticut and in various cities date back to the campaign ACORN initiated before 2008. Unfortunately, as exciting as this prospect is for workers as it appears to be gaining traction, the conservative forces of ALEC and others are also duplicating their blocking strategy first employed to stop the city-by-city spread of citywide living wage increases in places like Denver, Houston, and New Orleans by going to state legislatures controlled by Republicans as opposed to cities where Democrats might have the majority, and usurping home rule provisions that allow a city to take independent action in this area of worker protections.
Bills to trump sick leave provisions have now been introduced in Florida, Washington, Mississippi, and Michigan, and I would bet hard cash right this minute that another dozen bills will be introduced along these lines this year in states from Wisconsin to Louisiana to Arizona where Republicans have a death grip and can squeeze it on worker needs for health relief. This is precisely what happened in Florida, Louisiana, Colorado, Texas, and numerous other states after citywide living wage initiatives gained traction.
Unless progressives are moving preemptively to counter these legislative usurpations, we will be watching another door locked shut and bolted down forever just as we are prying it open.H.R.2179 - Idaho Efficient Vehicle Demonstration Act of 2009111th Congress (2009-2010)

Athlete of The Week
Going for the gold

Bettina Winkler gives thumbs up on her vision for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Photo provided
Bettina Winkler, a 12-year-old Clarkston resident, is putting her drive and determination on the 2016 Summer Olympics.
Her speed and drive has already paid off as she recently finished in first place in the 50- and 200-meter dash at the Junior Olympics AAU Nationals for indoor track.
"It is exciting to watch because she is so young and she has so much ambition and drive," said mom, Helga. "When she started this about two years ago we thought it was just going to be a phase. But each year she continues and gets better."
Bettina and her dad, Marvin, were watching footage of the 2008 Summer Olympics on cable when an idea struck.
"She said 'I can do that,'" Marvin remembered the seriousness in her voice. "Then it was 'I am serious, dad. I can do that.' With the determination she has now I know she can do it. When you have a kid dedicating six days a week to it - you know she is serious."
Marvin added Bettina reads the Olympics packet before she goes to bed and is thoughtful over decisions asking herself how it will affect her and her training.
She spends every day focused on running and her training. When she is not going to Ann Arbor for training she is at home stretching and keeping in shape.
Bettina also has the option to try-out for either her first choice United States of America or the Germany team, since she has dual citizenship.
She began running two years ago after she was approached by her athletic director when he noticed her speed even though she was in fourth grade.
"Him and my brother tried to convince me to convince me to try cross country," Bettina said. "It only took a day or two."
She decided to give it a chance and see if she enjoyed it as much as playing basketball.
"It's fun," Bettina said. "I get a good feeling after I run."
"It is something we never expected. No one in the family runs," Helga explained.
We are kind of blown away when we watch her. She was naturally fast.
Bettina also runs with her 9-year-old sister, Anna.
"She is a long-distance runner," she said. "It's good because during cross country she can help me and during track I can help her. I usually have fun when I am with my sister."
Running comes first but Bettina also enjoys playing basketball and watching sports.statelinetack.com > Apparel > Gloves, Hats & Accessories > Item # E0106 Helmet Bag

Copyright © 2011 Inhabitat Local - New York. All rights reserved.There's been a lot of news coverage about Dara Torres, the forty-one year old Olympic swimmer. Everybody's acting like it's a miracle she can even get into the pool at her advanced age, and I'm thinking, "Wait a minute! I'm older than she is! What does that make me, chopped liver?"
So then I was watching the equestrian events, and there was this Canadian guy jumping. (Okay, okay, he wasn't jumping; the horse was doing the jumping, and he was riding the horse.) And they were talking about how this guy was sixty-one years old, and this was his ninth Olympics. (Ian Millar, by the way, if you're interested. And when he takes off his riding helmet, he looks like he's around forty.) And then I discovered that there is a Japanese rider who is sixty-seven.
I feel better now. People older than me are competing at the Olympics.
But you know; I don't feel old, at all. When I think about being forty-five, it just boggles my mind. How the hell did I get to be forty-five? I can't possibly be that old! Jeezus Christ, fifty is right around the corner! What the hell?!
Is it just me, or does everybody feel that way?

- Christine FixThe actual racing experience is up there too. Ported over from MC2, DUB starts you out with a set of cool abilities that previously hard to be earned the hard way. You'll kick off races with the abilities to drift and power slide your way around tight corners, earn sweet turbo boosts by slipstreaming the car in front of you and even perform some crazy two-wheeled Dukes of Hazzard moves to allow safe passage through congested traffic situations. Additionally, if you're riding a hog or a Japanese super-bike, you'll be able to use the weight transfer technique to pop wheelies and lean hard into those tricky bends.
But it doesn't stop there. Nope. All new abilities created for DUB manage to raise racing tactics to new heights. First up is the "Agro" move, which only applies to SUVs, trucks, and luxury sedans. This basically allows you to ram pedestrian vehicles and objects into oblivion -- something which is very handy when traffic is gridlocked. Next up is "Roar" move, applicable to the choppers and muscle cars. By power sliding around corners, you build up your energy meter until it's full, and then you'll be able to unleash a mighty engine roar so loud that any car gets briefly stunned and loses control. Lastly is my personal fave, which lets imported and exotic vehicles and sports bikes enter a bullet-time mode called "Zone." By slowing down time for a split second or two, you'll be able to avoid collisions and potential crashes with pixel-perfect accuracy.
The new abilities must be unlocked by completing certain criteria, but when this happens, you'll have an entirely new arsenal of techniques with which to trounce the other players. Good stuff! Also new to DUB is the inclusion of 36 hidden Rockstar icons which can be gathered from around the three cities in order to unlock more stuff. Dub's gameplay is rock solid, for sure.
Graphically speaking, DUB is one great-looking game. The PS2 version sadly does not support widescreen or progressive scan modes, but this does not detract from the gameplay experience in the slightest. It's not quite up to the same visual standards as those found in Burnout 3, and the framerate does indeed drop below 30 frames when the weather effects and on-screen mayhem is at its most hectic, but otherwise, it's a game that's extremely easy on the eyes -- and indeed, something of a feat on the aging PS2 hardware. The level of detail and sheer size of the open-ended city environment is a credit to Rockstar's development team. The vehicles are no slouches either, with an intricate level of detail for all the custom parts and upgrades. You really get the sense that Rockstar was very passionate about making a game that looks and plays great.The Cold Filtered Ramblings of Gene Mueller
Never thought we'd see this headline: "NFL scrambles to fill seats"
It's in The Wall Street Journal, and it's not from the 1940's. It ran this weekend, and what it does is confirm what many of you say to your buds at the corner bar: watching a game on TV is better than being there in person.
Green Bay is the exception--as is almost always the case. Smallest NFL town. Most rabid fans. Gi-normous waiting list for season tickets. Nothing but sell-outs for decades. Still, the Journal's numbers show the Packers are filling Lambeau at a just-under 97% clip--not quite capacity.
Lambeau Field, by design, tradition and coincidence, is an NFL destination and an experience unlike any other in sports. The six-hour pre-game tailgate has to be seen to be believed, as is the rest of the pre-game culture. The intimacy of the stadium, the knowledgeable and friendly fan base make football a celebration as well as an education. And, there's something about seeing a major professional sport in what amounts to a Wisconsin neighborhood where you're minutes away from seeing silos and cows on the drive home.
Other teams without the legacy, recent track record, or fan-friendly venue are feeling the pinch that comes when the comfort of the couch at home in front of a HD TV wins out over a less-than-fan-friendly venue where food is overpriced, sight lines are poor and replays are at a premium.
Something else is in play here, too, a factor I didn't see in the Kevin Clark's Journal piece: fantasy football. For some of us, it's about bragging rights. Others play for big money. For many fans, it's an obsession and the information beast needs to be fed, certainly between noon and six p.m. when most of your players are in action. Sure, everyone is watching the Packers but how many of us aren't spinning the dial or working the smart-phone to keep an eye on the Ravens and Jaguars, dying to know if Maurice Jones-Drew cracked 100 yards yet? It's hard to track your fantasy fortunes inside most NFL stadiums--hence the free Wi-Fi so many franchises are now talking about adding.
You can't grow if you're standing still which is why the Packers keep Lambeau a work-in-progress. They're adding seats and scoreboards in both end zones--no matter what, there's always an appetite for Green Bay tickets.
The scoreboards are meant to bolster the in-game experience, to make it more and more like the one you get at home. And, they contain tons of ads. That's found-money, revenue the team doesn't have to share. Same with the new banquet rooms that can be rented out year long.
Lambeau Field construction progress: fox11online.com
Me thinks you should get used to seeing construction cranes and "pardon our dust" signs at the Frozen Tundra. Once one project finishes, it seems the team has another on the drawing board. Think Disney, where that which doesn't work gets phased and that which does gets enhanced and repeated.
It's still quite an investment to spend a Sunday in Green Bay. The tickets aren't all that expensive, relatively speaking, but driving from Milwaukee to Lambeau for a quality tailgating session means leaving at, say, 7 a.m. for a noon game? Then the drive home? What it the weather is something less than friendly--trust me, it gets more uncomfortable the older you get (think Brett Favre in that last game against the Giants). Sometimes, it's just easier to fire up the man cave, chill the beer, serve up the grub and stay at home where there are no lines to the bathroom and nobody sitting behind you with their knees in your back. Younger fans, meanwhile, have much higher expectations. They get everything digitally: news, weather and certainly their sports. They won't be happy if they're forced to be out of the internet pocket for six hours, wondering what else is going on while they're stuck inside a bowl, seemingly cut off from the rest of civilization.
This is what the NFL is up against: another seemingly invulnerable institution (like newspapers) being tested, tried and reshaped by digital technology. HDTV, the smartphone and the computer are enhancing the NFL experience. And, like everyone else, The Shield has to adapt to make the most of changing times while continuing to maximize its trusted revenue streams, even the most basic and seemingly assumed: the number of fans in the seats.

Bolts Force Game 6 with Decisive Win over Penguins, 8-2
by Tony on 04/23/11 at 06:33 PM ET
{ In his best Ron Burgundy voice… }
“Boy, that escalated quickly! I mean, it really got out of hand fast!”
Tap of the stick to the Tampa Bay Lightning, who scored the game’s first goal late in the first period and never looked back, blowing the Penguins out in their own barn by an 8-2 score in Game 5.
That said, the Penguins still lead the series 3 games to 2, and Game 6 will be Monday night.
You simply have to give the Bolts a helluva lot of credit. They were able to withstand a strong first 15 minutes of play by the Penguins unscathed, including a Penguins power play and a fortunate loud ringing of the crossbar off a Brooks Orpik slapper at the 13:09 mark. But soon after that it was two goals within 46 seconds from the previously invisible Simon Gagne and Steven Stamkos late in the first period, and it went nowhere but downhill after that for the Penguins.
It was definitely a game the Penguins’ defense surely wants to purge out of their collective memories, and quick. Chalk it up to whatever you want, but the Bolts were first to the puck to just about everything around the Penguins’ net. And it was one of those games where the Lightning were rewarded for their hustle by getting the bounces to put it past Marc-Andre Fleury.
The defense left Fleury hanging, but I think it would also be fair to state that Fleury wasn’t sharp as well. He gave up numerous rebounds, and unfortunately for the Penguins, the Bolts’ desperation resulted in goal after goal, which eventually led to Fleury’s departure after the fourth goal allowed on only 14 shots.
The special teams battle was downright embarrassing, with the Bolts’ PP going 4-for-7, while the Penguins went 0-for-7 with the man advantage. For the series, Tampa’s power play is clicking at a league-leading 36.4% rate, naturally also meaning the Penguins’ penalty kill, who led the league during the regular season, is now ranked last among playoff teams.
If you’re HCDB, no time to panic. In hindsight, IMO Tampa won Game 5 by playing the Penguins’ game for them. They were the most aggressive team, they were the quicker team, and that resulted in them being the most opportunistic team.
Might be a quirky thing to say, but a road game is exactly what the Penguins need.

Not until Pittsburgh was down by 3. The Penguins were dominating every area of the ice and winning every single battle except for 3 plays, all of which ended up in the Penguins net. After that, they basically stopped caring. Let’s face it; with the lineup they have, they know a three goal deficit is insurmountable.

Posted by Evilpens on 04/23/11 at 10:31 PM ET
Luckily it only counts for one game. The Pens have proven they can come back after a bad performance. Obviously, it would be pretty hard to have a worse performance than today, but if the Tampa stars can show up, the Pens lose this series. They simply don’t have enough scoring right now. Likewise, and not saying this series is going to 7, but if the Pens can’t go .500 at home in a series to win, then they don’t deserve to win the series.
Posted by Red Winger from Sault Ste. Marie on 04/23/11 at 06:42 PM ET
It doesn’t matter. A loss is a loss at this time of year. Most of the goals seemed to be due to getting outworked and horrible D. Like I said, if the Tampa stars keep going, they will probably beat the Pens.
As for the momentum, the past 2 years the Pens have had a chance in the first round to win in 5 games. Against Philly, they were soundly defeated 3-0. Then in game 6, they were up 3-0 before losing. Where was the momentum there? Last year, the Pens were beat in multiple OT’s against Ottawa in game 5, got down 3-0, and won in OT. Where was the momentum there? Momentum rarely goes from game to game. If it did, Detroit would have won the 2009 Cup in 6 games. Or the Caps would have beaten the Pens in 4 games. Or the Pens would have won that series in 6 games. Or the Pens would have won game 5 today.

Glad you thought about me all night and day. My afternoon was lovely as I missed most of the game due to prior obligations. Luckily it happens, and the Pens are still up 3-2 in the series.

I’m not a Pens fan at all. But I do respect the heck out of what they accomplished after Crosby and Malkin went down, and was totally surprised they did what they did. I’m not counting them out even though they are leading the series 3-2, like Vancouver.

Should retirees limit their spending to the interest and dividends they receive? Ken French says investors should be indifferent to how they raise cash, whether through dividends and interest, or through the sale of shares—a method Merton Miller called “homemade dividends.” Despite the economic logic, some investors focus on dividends and interest. While this approach may encourage disciplined spending, Ken explains that it also can distort one’s investment approach—for example, when investors choose dividend-paying stocks over broad diversification, or chase higher yields by holding riskier bonds. In an effort to get more, they actually lose.
Are we barking up the wrong tree by looking to increase taxes on oil companies? When you look at profit margins, it seems we are. Of the 200 or so industry groups in this county, Oil & Gas Exploration companies rank 46th in profits. The refiners and pipeline co’s are even further down the list. Some of the names at the top of the list?... Internet (7th,) Software (8th,) Healthcare Information (15th,) ... even the Railroads (24th) are ranked higher. If you’re looking to raise revenues through taxes perhaps the oil companies are not the best place to start.

Ken French (professor of finance at Darmouth College) says the simplest answer is found in the rate offered on a long-term Treasury Inflation Protected Security (TIPS). You can go beyond the TIPS rate if you don’t plan to live forever. Retirees with a shorter life expectancy might choose to consume more. Finally, you might increase your expected investment return and your expected sustainable withdrawal rate by taking more risk. But Ken warns that the expected return and the return you ultimately receive could be very different. That is the nature of risk.

Just a little secret to prove that… I didn’t even edit out a single word in her wonderfully long answers. After reading what she has to say I’m sure you will love her expressive, witty, and fun “writerly” personality just as much as I did.
What do you love most about Polyphony?
I’m on the staff of another literary magazine, The Adroit Journal, which is run entirely by high school students and college undergraduates but accepts work from high schoolers and Pulitzer Prize finalists and everybody in between. Besides the quirk of its editing body, it’s more of a traditional litmag, dry rejections with the spare sentences and so on; in its reading process, though commentary is preferred, one can select ‘yes’ or ‘no’ or ‘maybe’ without even a few sentences explaining one’s opinion of the submission. It wasn’t until I began reading for Adroit that I realized how submerged I had become in the Polyphony ethos—my comments on submissions went way beyond two or three sentences as I ached to poke about at specific sentences and certain details and, most of all, make sure the author knew what he or she was doing wrong and doing right. It’s terribly difficult to grow as a writer without the help in whatever fashion of others, and Polyphony offers such communal help in spades, making all of us stubborn young writers the better for it. I might be reluctant to fulfill the more traditional forms of community service required by my school but at Polyphony I know that what I’m doing will—at least, I hope, not to be arrogant—serve teenagers’ writing for the better, and in such a way that it helps both sides of the divide, both writers and editors (who are usually themselves writers—so maybe not even a divide). To state it outright: I love that. The opportunity to have the first look at the future literary talent—current talent, really—of our woebegone generation doesn’t hurt either.
What motivates you about being an editor?
Not to repeat myself, but the knowledge that what I think and say and advise really matters to somebody serious enough about their writing to submit it to a magazine does produce a certain drive. It keeps me feeling useful in a way that much of what I do as a myopic teenager doesn’t. Here my opinion has a real effect on somebody in the way that expressing an opinion in English class doesn’t (or at least, not always). The more I edit, the better equipped I am to be of use to another piece, and the more I’m exposed to wildly varying types of writing in both finished and unfinished form, all of it enlightening. That last bit is an especial privilege that I’m possibly a little too greedy to let go of. Having the opportunity to see the way teenagers from all over are thinking and writing is a definite pleasure, and I love the sense of community it gives me; editing their work gives me an active role in this far-flung fragile group.
What’s your editing process?
I’ll read a submission forwarded to me the same day it lands in my inbox, and then I’ll usually let it, erm, languish for far too long. A kinder, more euphemistic way of putting this would be that I let the piece simmer in my thoughts for a while. Then I’ll come to my senses eventually, read the piece over again, this time with a more critical mindset, trying to figure out what general themes the piece needs help on, and the last time I’ll write out my comments as I read. Based on the specific comments I write, I’m able to decide what to focus on in my general critique. For example, a poem that’s stubbornly clutching an inhibiting rhyme scheme might need more time devoted to why it’s okay to go the free verse route, and less about the importance of imagery. A badly written story with a cliché abusive relationship plot will probably need more commentary focusing on realistic characterization than on the inherent unoriginality of the setup. And so on. I find it essential to figure out what area the writer probably needs the most help in to further develop his or her writing. And most overarching, of course, is whether I can even see anyone with the magazine open in his or her hands, flipping the pages and seeing the submitted piece there in black print with the author’s name underneath. All this has given me, I think, a much more discerning eye in regard to my own writing, and it’s served to make myself a little more detached. It’s a little easier for me now to, as the saying goes, murder my darlings, as I read over my writing with a more objective eye. Even the hapless languishing each piece forwarded to me undergoes has helped; I now realize how importance it is to let the exciting heat of something newly written and newly read cool before it can be read without bias—that goes with the objective bit.
What genre of writing do you enjoy the most and why?
Oof. This one will elicit a lengthy non-answer. Well, I used to be one of those great weighty novel types, a participant in National Novel Writing Month and all that. After that came a new appreciation for the realm of short story and its masters (I maintain that Salinger is worthy of more than a nostalgic, thirteen-year-old sort of love). And only recently have I begun to properly like and love poetry. So here you have me trying to rank, say, the mind-blowing weight (figurative and physical) of David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest, the clipped but complete horror of JD Salinger’s A Perfect Day for Bananafish (or Lorrie Moore’s How to Be an Other Woman, or Miranda July’s Something That Needs Nothing…), or the absolute awe felt upon reading certain poems (I’m not even going to try to list a few examples here, but a recent few include Jack Gilbert’s Guilty and Stephen Dunn’s, well, anything, or—well, I’ll restrain myself). For my own writerly purposes, the short story reigns king, but nothing beats that certain fuzzy time between night and morning, 12 a.m. at the earliest, where you read an excellent poem and want to cry.
What is the most important thing you have taken away from working with Polyphony?
In an attempt to be succinct, the knowledge that even if I lack the time to write (not that time or lack thereof is an excuse), there’s always a way to be intimate with writing. That’s regarding myself. Perhaps also the fact that all those years I’ve spent reading well and badly and writing well and mostly badly come in handy to all my peers reading and writing well and badly. That it’s all for something, after all. Or, if we’re talking ‘thing’ in a non-abstract manner, the copy of Polyphony HS vol. VII perched on a bookcase a few feet away from me, which contains so many brilliant pieces of writing that I’ve paged through so often when feeling schlumpy, that for some reason give me so much more hope than any old novel or, say, The Paris Review might. The act of sometimes stumbling upon my own story in that issue, which was in many ways a product of the insightful advice I received from the PHS editors, and which was the product of all the clear, insightful commentary I’d received on the pieces Polyphony had rejected, but also showed me through its publication what I was capable of. Reading all that commentary on my pieces for the first time took me aback; I was deeply impressed by what the teenage editors were capable of and I wished to possess even a sliver of the skill they did. Hopefully I’m getting there.
And, do you think it is beneficial to young writers?
Unlike more traditional literary magazines, submitting to Polyphony is a more communal sort of experience, a back-and-forth based in correspondence rather than a back-and-forth of sending something forth and receiving a brief acceptance or rejection back. Polyphony seems to me the first exposure teenagers get to a writing community, and that this community is composed of fellow young writers with the same trials and tribulations is especially cool. A teenage writer is a wholly different beast compared to someone in their turbulent twenties or someone who is a proper Writer, an Author, capitalization and all. Different beasts require different, er, diets? (Bear with me on this comparison.) I think the interaction and give-and-take Polyphony offers is significant, maybe even necessary, to the burgeoning writer. We don’t need to be artistically alone just yet.
When did you get interested in writing?
I don’t think there was one defining moment or year. As early as second grade I lent my purple composition notebook filled with scrawled strange poetry (of the type only a seven-year-old can conjure) to my language arts teacher, but that doesn’t feel like the first time I became interested in writing. It’s always been intertwined with my reading, I think. I still own several notebooks from first through fifth grade whose first twenty pages are filled with abandoned fantasies or pale imitations of the books I loved. Around fourth or fifth grade, I think, was when I doomed myself by defining myself, rather precociously, as a writer.
What are your other interests and activities?
Of course I spend a mind-boggling amount of time reading, but you knew that, didn’t you? It goes inextricably hand-in-hand with writing. Not just literature, of course—essays, newspapers, magazines. I’m quite fond of journalism; I’m News Section Head of my school’s newspaper. Linguistics and language fascinate me, so naturally I’m a Latin nerd, a member of my school’s Junior Classical League. Bemoaning the United States’ current sociopolitical climate is always fun, but one must try to overcome the pessimism, so I’m a feminist and a member of my school’s chapter of Girls Learn International. I love art, both the history of and the doing of (I especially like to draw people, those perennially fascinating things, and collage). I’m particularly interested in mastering the art of witty banter, a cause I take up often when spending time with family and friends, preferably in art museums or flea markets.
Do you want to pursue your interest in writing further?
Ah, this question. As a rising junior, I’m now a victim of that terrifying onslaught of questions about college prospects, and because one thing always leads to another, about a future career, and whether or not I want to be a capital-w Writer. Answering this always discomforts me somewhat. I’m sixteen; why should I be able to or want to set in stone such decisions now? I try to be realistic—how many people, after all, make it as a writer? Regardless, I would of course like to develop whatever skill I have as deeply as possible, though that’s a kind of wishy-washy goal. I came to the realization a few months ago that whether or not I want to try my hand at being a writer, I do want to be deeply involved with literature in some form or another, that literature in whatever shape is what I want to do with my life. Take out of that raw sentiment what you will.

Caught between the pink suburban sky
and the desiccated snails, a sidewalk
littered with crushed pottery in miniature,
I compromise and brush against the unblooming
nubs of those narrow purple flowers whose name I
never remember, revert and ask my mother, stutter.
“Agapanthus,” she says.
Instead of the crow feather impaled in a lawn sucked
pallid by summer, glossy as the olive green dumpsters
across the pavement, I ask about the tiny, star-sharp flowers
whose smell my sister never liked.
“Society garlic,” she says.
Its rotting bunches are curdled mosquitoes
reaching at slick angles for the smog.
The two-year-old shoes I’m wearing are still
big, my feet still narrow and small, thanks to
relativity. I can pretend I’m young and not a youth. And
how about those that were my favorite, three-petaled, spring-pink?
“I can’t remember,” she says.
“It’s on the tip of my tongue,” she says,
and I think about how the tongue’s taste buds
die as one ages, if maybe my mom just can’t sense the sweetness
of the words jostling for attention in her mouth. A gum wrapper
had also lain pasted on the pavement near the crow feather,
but I hadn’t mentioned that, had I, or the time I’d watched
a mosquito clamber, spindly and sure, between
the shoulder blades of my mom and said nothing, the words
disappearing at the tip of my tongue. Or this morning,
when she took deep mouth-breaths while she drove
our beat-up ’99 Honda Accord and said, “Does it smell like
gas exhaust to you, too?” How she had rolled
the windows down so we wouldn’t asphyxiate
to death, or, to use a more relative term,
so that we could breathe.When.

Even though Friday's game was rained out, Miami and the New York Mets still played 30 innings of baseball this weekend in the Big Apple. On Saturday, the Marlins won 2-1 in 20 innings in the longest game played since Citi Field opened in 2009 and one that matched the longest ever in Marlins' franchise history. The Saturday marathon included 15 straight scoreless innings, from the 5th through the 19th, 561 total pitches and saw the Mets go 0-for-19 with runners in scoring position, setting a new team record for the worst performance in that situation. Miami needed half the innings to beat the Mets again on Sunday, this time scoring four in the top of the 10th to secure a 8-4 victory and the two-game sweep on the road. While Saturday's game lasted 6 hours and 25 minutes, Sunday's affair took only 3:35. A total of 894 pitches were thrown by the two teams on Saturday and Sunday. This marked the first time in 24 years that teams played a game of 20 innings or more, then went extras again the next day, according to STATS. The Marlins also became the first team since the Angels in 1982 to win consecutive games that went exactly 20 innings and then 10.
30To the Editor.—In the December 1974 issue of the Archives (109:741), E. N. Wardle presents data that confirm previous reports showing a high correlation between the development of endotoxemia and the hemorrhagic complications of major injury to the liver. One can account for this effect of endotoxin by its capacity to aggregate platelets and, thus, release vasoactive agents that can cause the endotoxemia and become self-sustaining. Dr. Wardle refers to the report by Das et al that states that endotoxin binds to platelets by virtue of the fact that the larger fraction, if not all, of the circulating endotoxin is found in platelet-rich and not in platelet-poor plasma. Since we could not, in a joint study with Deykin (unpublished data), confirm the alleged binding of endotoxin to the platelets, it appears that the data of Das et al reflect the variation in particle size of circulating endotoxin..The full cost of cleaning a “disgusting” house has finally been revealed.
A team made up of staff from Preston Council’s cleansing and environmental health departments descended on the semi-detached house in Parkside, Lea, on August 1, after fed-up neighbours made an official complaint about smells and fly infestations.
Four men worked for two full days at the address, but some cleaning and advice giving continued for a month afterwards.
Now Preston Council has announced that the cost of the operation was £3,729.22, but declined to say whether the sum had been repaid by the elderly woman owner and her middle-aged son.
A Council spokesman said: “This amount covers officers time, equipment and the disposal of waste.
“We are not allowed to say whether the money has been paid, but the home owners have been sent a demand for expenses with an invoice.
“This is general policy, and not specific to this case.
“Typically an arrangement can be made for repayment, or a charge can be made against the house, to be repaid when the property is sold.”
The clean-up team had to break the front door down to gain access, due to the amount of clutter in the hallway and workmen wearing full overalls and face masks were seen retching as they left the house with their shoes caked in dirt.
A wood-panelled hallway could be seen covered in brown stains, with wallpaper hanging off.
Dirty and decayed furniture was moved into the front garden, and waste was removed in tens of wheelie bin trips.
At its worst, neighbours said they were swatting 30 to 40 flies a day, were plagued by bad smells and had seen rats.

Great initative for a documentary. Respect. I love projects like this. Surfing needs them. Check out the website here.
Synopsis
The one thing that unites all surfers is their love of the waves. Yet within the surfing community there have often been lines of distinction: based on skill, gender and even sexual identity. Some gay surfers have struggled with discrimination, homophobia and the fear of losing jobs, friends and family, while others have been able to confidently paddle out into the line-up. With the growth of social media, previously isolated gay surfers are now able to connect to others from all around the planet.
We’re currently at a turning point in our social perception about homosexuality. In the sports world some leading athletes have already come “out”: Gareth Thomas – Rugby, John Amaechi – NBA, Jason Ball – AFL, Amelie Mauresmo – Tennis, Matthew Mitchum – Diving, Megan Rapinoe – Soccer and more recently Puerto Rican boxer Orlando Cruz and Kevin McClatchy in Baseball. Support for emerging gay athletes (and against homophobia) has been demonstrated by straight athletes such as Michael Irvin in NFL, the Dutch soccer administration and Ben Cohen in Rugby.
The acknowledgment of a gay presence in surfing seems long overdue.
Why are there no “out” gay male surfers on the pro-surfing tour?
What pressures do gay women experience in getting sponsorship?
Can surfing culture create a positive and inclusive environment that minority groups, such as gay surfers, can feel part of?
Are sport sponsors in tune with changing social attitudes?
Has the new generation of surfers moved on from the homophobic attitudes of the past?
And what are their hopes for the future?”
A film team follows Thomas, the founder of the world’s first website for gay surfers, as he visits fellow surfers in the US, Australia and Brazil. He speaks to pro-surfers, psychologists, media specialists and sponsors about the issues around homosexuality in surfing.
Interviews are mixed with anecdotes, observational and archival footage. Scenic locations and dynamic surfing footage is underscored with modern and emotive music. The documentary communicates the beauty and connection with the ocean and natural elements. A mixture of high energy and slow-motion footage creates emotion and engagement.
Out in the Line-Up overturns clichés and breaks down stereotypes. It makes gay surfers visible for the first time. As an unseen part of surfing and gay culture they were without a voice, without a place in the line-up and without role models.
This film brings many, until now, untold personal stories to the public eye. It allows for reflection and interpretation. It creates space for discussion about equality – in order to challenge limited thinking and stereotypes. It reaches out to an up-coming generation where open-mindedness, diversity and acceptance can become positive social values.
Great! checkout how Jason Ball made a splash with his Out in the AFL change.org petition –
How is it even the British politicians can be dragged into the modern era… how is it Oz pollie’s can vote it down?
I guess till the sponsored surfers are rewarded for their whole person, not just their athleticism and courage and waterskills, we will just see more 2dimensional heroes. Suitable for consumption by forever-teenage minds and marketing apparatchiks.

Afghanistan: After the War
by Fariba Nawa, author, Opium Nation: Child Bride, Drug Lords, and One Woman’s Journey Through Afghanistan • Photos by Benjamin Lowy, BFA ’01, specialist in conflict and feature photography (For a Q&A with Ben Lowy, visit the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts news site.)
The 2014 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan will end the longest war the United States has fought. Since Operation Enduring Freedom was launched in 2001 to eradicate Al Qaeda operations within the country, more than 3,300 U.S. and coalition troops have been killed, according iCasualties.org. And, although reports vary widely, some estimates put the Afghan civilian death toll at more than 30,000.
While recent surveys (including the Pew Research Center, The New York Times and the Associated Press) suggest the American public is ready to bring its soldiers home, the Afghan people seem to view the withdrawal with much trepidation.
Some reports estimate that more than 36,000 Afghans have already left the country. STATT, a nongovernmental organization that conducts migration research and polling, reported in January 2013 that the “fear of instability in 2014 is driving emigration of the very people and money that could prevent instability.”
Against this backdrop, Washington Magazine asked journalist Fariba Nawa, author of Opium Nation: Child Brides, Drug Lords, and One Woman’s Journey Through Afghanistan, to interview our faculty and alumni with special expertise on the region. Topics discussed include the country’s future with regard to security, human rights, the fragile economy and the status of U.S. involvement.
The billion-dollar question is what will happen to Afghanistan after the troop withdrawal, but there isn’t one answer, says Jean-Francois Trani, PhD, assistant professor at the Brown School, who has done extensive research in Afghanistan.
Trani’s work on the country’s current conditions is diverse, including research on poverty, gender issues and, most recently, disability issues.
Having just spent June 2013 in Afghanistan (Kabul, Mazar, Kunduz, Taloqan, Jalalabad), Trani believes the most optimistic scenario is that Afghanistan will be a peaceful country without conflict once the troops withdraw. Yet the most likely scenario is a relatively low-intensity conflict, with the main cities and roads continuing under the control of the central government and President Karzai’s allies (the former mujahideen), and the large rural areas under the control of insurgents against the central government, particularly various Taliban groups.
“Relative stability will depend upon the results of the 2014 Afghan presidential elections,” Trani says. “A fairly elected government would do a lot to improve the trust of the population.” The popular perception is that the Karzai government and its allies have worked harder to fight the Taliban than to fight internal corruption.
Trani says external support for special interests is another wild card. The countries of Pakistan, India, Iran and China all have their own agendas in the country, he says, and Afghan forces do not have the capacity to maintain law and order.
According to his research, the limited progress that has been made over the last 12 years — in areas such as education, health care, infrastructure and livelihoods — could be in jeopardy.
At this point, Trani concludes that concerns beyond surviving are not at the forefront for most Afghans.
“Afghans are thinking of basic survival,” he says. “More than anything, the common man is concerned about his capacity to generate enough resources to feed his family.”

Leila Nadya Sadat, JD, LLM, DEA, the Henry H. Oberschelp Professor of Law and director of the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute, says the United States has a responsibility to assist in bringing human rights to Afghanistan after 12 years of occupation.
Afghanistan: Country at War
As a special adviser on crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court (ICC), Sadat says the ICC has received nearly 100 allegations of crimes against humanity (systematic beatings, torture and killings) and war crimes since 2006 from Afghanistan, and the court is currently examining these cases.
On May 1, 2003, Afghanistan ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC, which gives the court the right to investigate these reports and prosecute the criminals. Sadat says Afghanistan’s acceptance of the court’s jurisdiction is a big step forward for accountability and justice. If the ICC issues arrest warrants against Afghan nationals, the Afghan government must help arrest the perpetrators so that the ICC can try them in The Hague.
The best approach to progress post-2014, according to Sadat, may be a truth and reconciliation commission. “The worst perpetrators should be tried,” she says.
Sadat says Afghans must form a grassroots movement from the bottom up to be effective in the long term. She sees many Afghans working hard to regain what they lost after the Soviet invasion: a fairly stable, safe and tolerant country. The challenges are immense, yet Sadat believes “in the tremendous courage of Afghan men and women” to advance.
With regard to the advancement of women’s rights, in particular, Assistant Professor Trani says political factors will play a deciding role. If, for example, members of the Taliban rule a large part of the country, they would again impose their strict interpretation of tribal ethics.
Economic factors also will impact women’s rights. Trani’s research shows that men with more economic opportunities have more self-esteem, less anxiety and, ultimately, a more balanced relationship with women in their household. “This will allow women to negotiate for their rights,” Trani says. “But, I believe, mentalities will take another generation to start changing.”
The technological changes in the last 12 years in Afghanistan can lead to greater social change in the future, says Robert Canfield, PhD, professor emeritus of sociocultural anthropology in Arts & Sciences and an expert on the war-torn country.
Afghanistan: Fast Facts
Canfield, who lived in Afghanistan for nine years, has done extensive research on social affairs in the country since the 1960s.
“Technological changes have already been huge,” Canfield says. “I have been told that in a country of 30 million, 22 million have cell phones. Those phones will change, have changed, the means of social interaction and economic activity.”
Yet social mores will take longer to change, he says. For example, women’s rights and education are less likely to advance. Recent media coverage shows that many young Afghan men do not believe that women deserve the same rights as them.
According to Canfield, whether or not those areas will change depends on who is in control. Depending on the region, Afghanistan is controlled by different groups: the Karzai government, warlords, the Taliban.
The relationship between the Taliban and Pakistan has been the most problematic, he says. “They [Pakistanis] have been nourishing the Taliban all along,” Canfield says.
Secretary of State John Kerry visited Pakistan in summer 2013 in hopes of finding a solution to the cross-border conflict. According to Canfield, Pakistan has its own divisions, and its current leaders are concerned with sustaining their own power and interests, not necessarily with Afghanistan’s future.
As for Iran, another neighbor and strategic player in Afghanistan’s future, Canfield says its new president may sustain the same policy toward Afghanistan post-2014. However, Iran’s pro-Islamic Revolutionary Guard may have other plans.
“The Revolutionary Guard has historically supported Shiites and Farsi/Persian speakers in Afghanistan, but since the U.S. ousted the Taliban, reports point to covert Iranian support for the Taliban,” Canfield says. “Iran is uncomfortable with Afghanistan’s closeness to the United States and has tried to convince Karzai to distance himself from Americans.”
If managed well, the vast mineral deposits in Afghanistan could be used to advance the country’s economy, says Jack Schramm, JD ’59, an international development expert.
“Mining these minerals, including lithium and copper, could bring jobs and wealth to the impoverished country,” Schramm says. “But first security issues must be addressed, and protections against corruption and potential exploitation by foreign contractors must be put in place by the Afghan government.”
For the last 24 years, Schramm has worked in the international development field in 26 countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan. As senior trans-boundary water rights adviser in Afghanistan, he developed recommendations on water usage between the country and its neighbors. Four of Afghanistan’s five water basins touch other countries, but international rules must be applied for equitable use of the water. Negotiations, especially with Pakistan, hold some promise.
Afghanistan’s economy could flourish with international support, he believes. He also believes the United States should remain in the country with enough troops to continue training Afghan forces and to quell Taliban uprisings.
According to Schramm, the pullout in Iraq provides a cautionary tale about the potential for instability. Whereas in Iraq, the government has overcentralized its power, in decentralized Afghanistan, the government suffers from a lack of control over its people. But both nation-states deserve the United States’ help, he says.
“If we don’t want to revisit an instability that is likely to get out of hand even more quickly than we have witnessed in Iraq, then we need to remain in Afghanistan for some time,” Schramm concludes.
For reserve soldier Raymond Gobberg, AB ’08, one of the most important lessons he learned on active duty in Afghanistan was to build trust among the local Afghan population.
Gobberg, who studied political science, served as a communications liaison from October 2010 to July 2011 in Zabul province, the birthplace of Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Then a first lieutenant in the Air Force, Gobberg worked on the provincial reconstruction team. His job was to relay to the local population “ideas and beliefs that support the Afghan government’s progress in the region.” He met with district governors, local clerics, police and elders to tell stories of what good the Afghan government was trying to do for them. He did not interact with any women native to Zabul, which is an ultra-conservative province.
Working in the region was difficult, he says, because the military’s rotation of personnel did not allow for the time needed to build long-term relationships. Gobberg also faced security obstacles — insurgents tried to attack his unit on a few occasions.
“People we interacted with ran the risk of being intimidated or killed because they associated with us,” Gobberg says. “Because their safety was also at risk, I struggled with how much we were assisting the people we were supposed to be assisting.”
Even so, three years after his tour of duty, Gobberg feels strongly that the U.S. should stay engaged, whether through military installations, diplomatic missions, aid or development.
“Afghanistan is a strategic country in that region, especially given its neighbors,” Gobberg says. “It’s important that we maintain a respectful relationship with whoever’s governing.”
Gobberg returned to St. Louis with a Bronze Star for his work in Afghanistan, and, since coming home, co-founded Bonfyre, a social networking app. He’s also pursuing a master’s in political management. Gobberg says he’s simply lucky that he never had to fire his gun in active combat and that he returned without PTSD or other war-related trauma.
According to Rumi Kato Price, PhD, MPE ’90, professor of psychiatry, Gobberg’s experience is not uncommon. And her research shows reason for optimism about the future of returning soldiers.
Price, who has studied trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse and suicide among the new generation of American military service members and their families, as well as older Vietnam veterans, says “the notion that our soldiers deployed to conflict regions come back ‘broken’ is a one-sided story in the media. There are both potential positive and negative effects of war experiences.”
At the faculty panel, Professor Rumi Kato Price (center), PhD, MPE ’90, discusses the need for jobs and educational opportunities for returning veterans to be successful at reintegration into society. (Mary Butkus/WUSTL Photos)
Price’s current also may be a contributor to this rise, but experts disagree about its impact. A report recently.
With regard to substance abuse, U.S. troops inside Afghanistan and other conflict regions show little evidence of increased illicit drug use,.
To assist soldiers in the reintegration process, Price suggests that universities and corporations could further expand their veteran employment and education outreach programs to help returning service members transition to civilian life. (Of note, Washington University participates in programs such as The Mission Continues for disabled veterans and the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program for the National Guard.)
Remarkably, the transition from civilian to military life can often be just as jarring.
Alumnus William Hartel, DDM ’85, for example, sold his dental practice in Brentwood, Mo., in 2011 and accepted a commission in the Army Reserves the following year.
“The Army has only half the dentists it needs,” Hartel says, “and I was told that if I joined, I would have a good chance of being deployed.” He completed Basic Training in 2013 and was immediately slated for a tour in Afghanistan.
From April through August of this year, Hartel provided emergency care to coalition forces seven days a week, dividing his time between the operating room, trauma bay and dental clinic.
The daily pressures of life on the front line required resilience, as well as an ability to withstand extreme weather and to deal with the military’s bureaucracy, he says. But despite these challenges, Hartel says, he and the other U.S. soldiers wanted to work in Afghanistan.
“People have their own reasons for joining the military,” Hartel says. “Some folks joined before 9/11, when the outlook for armed conflict was low, hoping to get college tuition benefits. Some joined after the attack out of urgent national pride, and still others more recently to take advantage of bonus payments. But, as a rule, everyone I met wanted to serve.”
According to Hartel, the air base in Kandahar was attacked regularly, particularly during Ramadan. At one time, Afghans were permitted to seek care in the NATO facility. But just two months before Hartel’s arrival, a local entered the trauma bay wearing a suicide vest. Although her bomb failed to detonate, the woman’s actions effectively canceled local access to treatment there.
Similarly, the 2014 withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces will reduce access to the additional resources Afghanistan has had for the past 12 years. And in that vacuum? History tells a story of a struggle for self-determination.
Since its founding in 1747, Afghanistan has been a place for rivaling empires to fight proxy wars. With successive occupations by the British, the Soviets and now the Americans, Afghanistan and its people have experienced ongoing conflict. Will neighboring China, with its interests in mining, become the next major player in Afghanistan? And what are Pakistan’s plans?
Compounding the country’s problems are a number of internal divisions — ethnic and religious — that have led to fractionalization.
And then there’s the matter of development. “There are resources, to be sure,” Hartel says, “but the average guy by himself can’t dig an oil well or a copper mine.”

In this study we argue that the export performance of affiliates of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in developing countries is determined differently from that of licensees of foreign firms or of domestic firms. Our empirical results for the information technology sector in India show that exports of MNE affiliates are greater when they have larger foreign equity stakes that bring more tacit knowledge transfer and complementary FDI advantages and when they import more explicit technology from the purchase of licences. Standard export determinants such as firm size and capital intensity do not matter for MNE affiliates, but they do for licensees ()

Planetary flybys are ambitious missions that use gravity assists to send spacecraft further with less fuel. As a spacecraft swings around the trailing side of a planet it gains speed, and if the geometry of planets is just right the spacecraft will accelerate right to its next destination with little need for fuel to guide or control its flight. The proposals came from Bellcomm, a division of AT&T established in 1963 to assist the space agency with research, development, and overall documentation of systems integration. Using upgraded Apollo hardware, these flybys were thought to be a natural stepping stone between Apollo and loftier goals like Earth-orbiting space station missions and manned Mars landings and Venus orbiters.

At a spaceflight mechanics conference in 1966, Bellcomm mathematician A. A. VanderVeen presented a study on possible manned Mars flyby opportunities between 1978 and 1986. This time frame was ideal, he said, because manned Mars missions would probably be of great interest at this point. Apollo would be over, and the next logical step in manned exploration after the Moon was our less hostile planetary neighbour.
According to his study, very little propulsion was needed to for this mission. After launch, the crew would make minor course corrections to adjust their path, but physics would be in the driver’s seat. The mission would look like a Mars version of Apollo 13 but without the exploding oxygen tank; one big burn would send the crew to Mars where they would whip around its far side and be flung towards Earth. Probes would do the hard work on a mission like this. At Mars, the crew would release a variety of automated probes, at least one of which would land and ideally bring a sample back to the crew.
Between 1978 and 1986, VanderVeen identified 5 oppositions – the point where Mars and Earth are at the closest points in their orbits. This was the best time for a Mars flyby since the geometry between planets allowed for the shortest transit time. But transit time wasn’t the real limiting factor for a mission, weight at launch was. The initial burn to send a crew to Mars demanded a lot of fuel, and some planetary alignments were just unfavourable and would need more fuel than was possible to launch into Earth orbit. But VanderVeen identified two favourable launch opportunities in 1979 and 1983. Both were equally conducive to the mission given the planets’ positions and the available technology for propulsion.
Manned Mars flybys got easier in 1967 when VanderVeen wrote another report on this mission type but added Venus to the roster. If launch weight from Earth was the biggest problem, using Venus’ gravity to slingshot a spacecraft to Mars could help solve the problem.
Mars, Earth, and Venus align with the Sun five times every 32 years, but Venus and Mars align more often making dual-planet flyby opportunities more frequent. The report found that adding a swing by Venus on both the outbound and inbound leg of a Mars flyby mission was feasible, turning a flyby mission into a triple-planet flyby.
The first triple flyby opportunity identified in the report was in February 1977; the next chance afterwards wouldn’t come until 1983. These dates made a triple flyby mission look doubtful – manned Mars landings and Venus orbital missions were expected to be well underway by the early 1980s.
But the possibility of a triple flyby started looking up when VanderVeen and another Bellcomm engineer, J. Bankovskis, found another triple flyby opportunity with a launch window in 1981. They described the mission in a report from September 1967. The ideal launch on May 26, 1981 would send the crew on a 790 day mission. They would swing by Venus on December 28, past Mars on October 5, 1982, past Venus again on March 1, 1983 before splashing down on Earth on July 25. But even a non-optimal launch was a good option. There was a 30 day launch window associated with this mission, and even the worst opportunity in that window only lengthened the mission to 850 days.
Finding a previously unknown launch opportunity inspired Vanderveen to look for other triple flyby launch windows. And he found some. In an October 1967 report he announced a November 1978 dual-planet flyby, an Earth-Venus-Mars-Earth mission. With a slight modification, it could become a triple flyby. Adding a swing by Venus on the inbound leg of the mission wasn’t out of the question. Launching on November 28, 1978, the crew would pass Venus on May 11, 1979, Mars on November 25, Venus again on January 29, 1980 and return to Earth on January 31, 1981. In all, the mission would be 800 days but a different launch date within the 35-day window could shorten the mission to 760 days.
What’s really interesting about these triple flyby missions isn’t just the chance for a crew to go on a miniature grand tour of the inner solar system, it’s that every flyby would be a unique scientific opportunity. Because of the geometry of the planets’ orbits, each mission, and even each leg of one mission, would take the crew by a very different part of the planets. Some trajectories would take the crew to a planet’s day side or near the equator while others would take them around the dark side or near a pole. Neither was, scientifically speaking, a bad path. Infrared sensors and mapping radar could make observations the crew couldn’t manage visually.

Whatever the final shape of the mission, triple flybys promised great scientific return on a very interesting mission. But, like a lot of the exciting plans for the 1970s and 1980s, this never went any further than a proof of concept mission. Maybe triple flybys will come back in vogue if NASA or some private company moves ahead with mission to Mars. If you’re going to do planetary recon for a landing mission, why not throw in some more science and a great, up-close shot of Venus at the same time.

Some people have very rare fears. For example, coulrophobia is the fear of clowns. This, of course, is a very misguided and unnecessary fear because if they go to a carnival and see some dope in full makeup and baggy pants, he shouldn’t be afraid of it. He should afraid of the carnie inside the clown outfit. They can pass diseases only monkeys have just by handing you a balloon animal.
The point is we all have fear. It’s a fascinating emotion. We’re repulsed by it and yet we seek it out with the same fervor and determination as happiness, an orgasm or love. Some people are actually addicted to it. Clawing at the seats and screaming for one’s very life is the same to them as having the first bite of a chocolate chip cookie after a long hunger strike. These people scare the living crap out of me.
My girlfriend is one of these people. I like horror movies, but she loves them. It makes for an interesting relationship. Usually when I date a woman, I worry about having to compete with other better looking men for their affection and attention. In this case, my competition is Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger and those poor bastards have to wear masks when they go out in public.
The weekend before Halloween, we get together at a friend’s house to watch horror movies. I, of course, get to pick the menu because I make a living writing about and reviewing movies. It’s what I do. One of my other friends is a chef, so he cooks dinner and bakes a cake for dessert. Another friend is an electronics expert, so he sets up his bad ass, big screen TV for the moment. I buy a slasher satire called â€œBehind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernonâ€ and the original â€œDawn of the Deadâ€ because the remake made me wish there was a zombie apocalypse on the off-chance the slow moving zombies would find the geniuses who thought it was a good idea to make stiff, dead zombies world-class sprints and tear them into tiny bite size pieces.
We watch both and there’s not a scream out of any of us, not even a minor jolt or a small jump in our seats. Both movies were excellent, but they weren’t true horror. Eventually everyone wakes up and we go to bed to dream about happy bunnies, rainbows and storm clouds that drop jellybeans on all the happy, shiny people.
I can not tell you the disappointment that permeated in that living room that cold, dark night. It hung on my collar like a cheap, drug store cologne. One friend showed us zombies that were so clear, you could see the maggots crawling around in their eye sockets. The other made a banana nut cake so good that it could make you believe in Jesus. I turned everyone into the Care Bears.
Fear is weird. When it’s there, you feel stiff, immobile and completely helpless and when it doesn’t show up when you want it to, you feel let down, abandoned and disappointed by life. It’s just like watching the â€œDawn of the Deadâ€ remake. Maybe next Halloween, I’ll watch that instead.

Pretty much this. I received my preordered Nexus 7 on Tuesday and found it no more difficult to open than my original Asus Transformer tablet. The top and bottom of the box fit together very snugly, as in I could feel the low air pressure inside making the box more difficult to open, but didn't provide and particular challenge. Perhaps people should try poking an air hole in their box if they are really having that much trouble.
I had supper with my brother Tuesday night, and he asked me if I'd had any trouble opening the Nexus 7 box; he'd apparently seen the videos referenced in TFA. I showed him the box and he wasn't sure how anyone had trouble opening it either.

by MyHandsAreMadeOfPasta - »Legal Leader: Professor Eric A. Kades
Eric A. Kades, Professor of Law, is one of five College faculty profiled in an article titled "The Professors: Leading Students Down the Academic Road," William and Mary Alumni Magazine, Winter 2004/2005.
In fall 2004, Professor Eric A. Kades was one of five College faculty to receive an Alumni Fellowship Award from the William and Mary Alumni Association. The award was established by the College's Class of 1968 to recognize outstanding young faculty members. The following profile is excerpted, with permission, from the William and Mary Alumni Magazine.
How does an economics and mathematics major from Yale University end up in the lecture halls of the Marshall-Wythe School of Law?
"It's the tale of a frustrated economist," says Professor of Law Eric Kades, who feels there exists an overemphasis on mathematics in the study of economics. Kades, who at one time considered pursuing a career as an economics professor, found researching and teaching economics with real life applications more interesting. In his case, this meant cultivating an extensive knowledge of land use and zoning, property law, real estate transactions and corporate structure. So, Kades returned to Yale and obtained a law degree rather than pursuing a doctorate in economics, a track perhaps more conventional for someone with his undergraduate background.
But Kades also prefers a classroom to a law firm. "Students are energizing," he says. "You always get new questions and different perspectives. Also, if you're in practice, you don't have the time to do in depth research." And research in a school environment is not necessarily restricted to supporting a single argument. "You have to come out on one side if you're in practice," Kades adds.
He teaches and researches in a variety of areas, including corporate law, economic analysis of law, and land use. His primary interest, however, is property law. "Property law is not as abstract - it has a tangibility that students find appealing," Kades explains. "They have a visceral connection with owning a home." In the classroom, Kades subscribes to traditional methods to engage students. "I certainly follow the law school tradition of making the class conversational," he says.
Kades also values one-on-one time with his students as a significant part of the learning process. "The most important thing is to have an open door policy. You need to put things aside and make time for students."
A native of Beloit, Wis., Kades spent six years teaching law at Wayne State University in Detroit, Mich., before moving to Williamsburg, where he lives today with his wife, Leigh Ann, daughter Jennifer and son Theo.
"The students in large part make it an enjoyable place to be," he says. "They're happy with us and we're happy with them."P.

The top ten Wal-Mart locations in each market will be getting the T-Mobile G1 on the 24th of November just in time for Christmas.
It comes as no surprise because big box stores such as Costco are already selling the G1 in many of their stores. Wireless sales in these stores have proven to be a good market for these companies. It is no doubt that Wal-Mart, who boasts low prices, will offer some sort of discount on the device, luring customers to their stores rather than the T-mobile retail locations. Rumors say that the price will be $148.88 with activation and a two-year contract.
For many the $31 dollar discount is not worth waiting a month to get this phone. Those who are interested in the G1 are more likely to want it sooner rather than later. The price will help with Christmas shopping this year for those effected by our economy. With so many T-Mobile stores outside of the 3G area, T-Mobile is wise to be allowing the overflow of G1 handsets to be sold in other stores as well bringing the market to those who would have otherwise missed.

Today's photo is one that I took at Urban Arts & Crafts last weekend. It's a snapshot of some of their beautiful specialty papers....aren't they gorgeous?! A few things to keep in mind about the colors.....
We're using chocolate brown for the bronze-y color you see on the papers. The bronze color looks a lot darker when the light's not shining right on it, so that's why I've chosen to use a chocolate brown for that color. The aqua is a light aqua -- not a bright turquoise. AND, the cream color is strictly optional. I know some girls feel like they really need a light neutral of some sort so use it if you need it, but if you can get by with the other 4 colors, that's totally fine too! I'll be using Papertrey's pure poppy, aqua mist, dark chocolate, kraft and vintage cream but just like always, you can feel free to use whatever brand of crafting goodies you have on hand. :)
Another thing to note, the challenge will run thru the weekend and will end next Monday (see specifics below).......what that MEANS is that you coooould make your challenge card this Saturday for World Card Making Day and have a little card fun to celebrate the big day, while also participating in the challenge! ....just sayin'.... ;)
Can't wait to see what you come up with this week! I think this will be a FUN one! Remember to let yourself enjoy this creative process.....don't stress about it! It's just paper, right? :) And for those of you that have said that you don't feel like your cards are 'good enough' to play along, EVERYONE is 'good enough' to play along! This challenge is JUST FOR FUN so there's no reason for anyone to feel like they can't play too! You just might be surprised at the feedback you'll get from your fellow crafters.....feedback that can be so encouraging and just might help boost your mojo!
All righty, have a ball and I'll anxiously await your projects this week!

President Barack Obama asked Congress for $3.7 billion Tuesday to handle the thousands of child migrants on the southern border, and he’d like lawmakers to treat the emergency request as a simple matter of human compassion.
“Our hope and expectation consistent with the incoming we have received from both parties is that this will be treated as the urgent humanitarian situation that it is,” said a White House official who briefed reporters about the request.
But nothing is quite so simple in Washington these days. By sending the request to Congress, Republicans, who are outraged over Obama’s immigration policies, will now have an opportunity to express their fury in must-sign legislation, possibly attaching policy riders or demanding budget cuts elsewhere.
“The Appropriations Committee and other Members, including the working group on the border crisis led by Rep. Kay Granger, will review the White House proposal,” Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said in a statement. “The Speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas—which this proposal does not address.”
And liberals are organizing to block the White House efforts to rewrite laws to make the deportation of child migrants from Central America less cumbersome.
Under current law, unaccompanied minors from Central America are automatically referred to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, which works to place them with family members already residing in the United States while they await a court date. Unaccompanied minors from Mexico, however, are treated differently, and can be screened for immediate return to their home country by U.S. Border Patrol if they do not present human trafficking or refugee concerns. “There isn’t really a policy rationale for treating them differently,”a second White House official said Tuesday, arguing that the current system is allowing too many children to stay in the U.S. for extended periods of time. “The number of kids removed is not large enough. That is why we are seeking to make this process more efficient.”
But immigrants’ rights advocates argue that the conditions in Central America and the length of the journey justify temporary placement in American homes and schools, even when there are no immediate signs of suspected criminal trafficking or refugee claims. Leslie Holman, the president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, has condemned the White House proposal to expedited removal of Central American children. “That is simply unconscionable,” she said Monday in a statement. “No matter what you call it, rapid deportations without any meaningful hearing for children who are rightly afraid of the violence and turmoil from which they fled is wrong, and contradicts the fundamental values of this nation.”
The White House request for $3.7 billion in emergency funding for 2014 is also significantly higher than the “more than $2 billion” estimates senior Administration officials offered reporters last week. It includes $1.6 billion for enhanced deterrence and enforcement on the border, $1.8 billion for Health and Human Service programs for the youth, and $300 million for international programs to aid Central America. The Administration is also bundling the request with an additional $615 million in emergency funds to fight wildfires in the West, a move that is likely to attract the votes of a number of members of Congress.News for May 21

Fisker's plan is to restore bespoke coach-building (undone by the Great Depression and WWII) to the marketplace, but instead of one-offs, the company plans to build 150 copies of each model per year. Customers will pay around $135,000 above the cost of the donor car (a Mercedes SL55 in the case of the Tramonto and BMW 6-Series for the Latigo) for a new, Fisker-designed skin with carbon fiber and stamped metal, a custom interior, and in the case of the Tramonto, a Kleeman tuning kit. Trivia note: Fisker says the cars' shared fascia design was inspired by the F/A-22 Raptor fighter jet.

Handbook for Aboriginal Alcohol and Drug Work
(Book)
The Handbook for Aboriginal Alcohol and Drug Work was written in response to Aboriginal health professionals requesting an easy-to-use resource to help them meet the challenges they face every day, while being respectful of both the clinical and cultural domains across Aboriginal Australia.
Written in plain language, the Handbook has practical sections on alcohol, tobacco and other drug issues, as well as other common problems like poly drug use, viral hepatitis, HIV, mental health, sexual health, contraception, pregnancy, child protection, prison and legal issues.
It can be downloaded online for free or a hard copy purchased at cost price.
The Handbook was created in partnership between the University of Sydney and Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal agencies and health professionals.

Smoking or alcohol dependence among Indigenous Australians: treatment may be needed, not just education
(Review)
In trying to help Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) individuals or communities to stop smoking or reduce the harms from alcohol, it is important to be aware of the strong biological basis to smoke or drink.
There is a firm evidence base for the use of pharmacological treatments for nicotine or alcohol dependence, particularly in severe dependence or when counseling or non-pharmacological approaches have failed.
Indigenous Australians should be able to access the full range of approaches to managing these conditions.
Working in partnership with Indigenous health staff and agencies can help ensure that appropriate access to treatment and quality treatment delivery occurs.

Professional needs of Aboriginal drug and alcohol workers in NSW
(Original research)
As part of his MPhil studies Steve Ella has conducted of a survey of 51 Aboriginal drug and alcohol workers in NSW.
This study was designed to better understand the composition of the NSW Aboriginal drug and alcohol workforce, and to assess the workers’ professional needs and supports.
It is hoped that this research will help guide future policy development so that there is a better framework to support ongoing professional development of this workforce.
Around the time Ella was working on his MPhil thesis, he was inducted into the National Indigenous Drug and Alcohol Committee Honour Roll.

Location: Peldon, Essex
Event: 29 April 2012
Report: Snowdon Sports
Second in the Ed Taylor Memorial last weekend, Scott Cousins moved up to the top of the podium with a fine solo victory in VC Revolution’s Ken Wright Memorial Road Race in Essex.
On a day for the hardy with strong winds and standing water across the 12-mile Peldon circuit, 24-year-old Cousins (Maldon & District CC) rode away from his last remaining rival, Adam French (East London Velo) on the last of the five laps to cross the line 42 seconds clear with Toby Parnell (Cambridge CC) leading in the rest some two minutes down.
Cousins, from Bicknacre in Essex, and French were part of an original five-man break that went clear early on and made their own bid on the third lap.
On the last lap Parnell and Wayne Crombie (East London Velo) were dropped from the chasing group that formed, but they battled their way back on with the former having enough left to secure third place.
There were 20 finishers from 49 starters with the bedraggled state of the survivors highlighting the absence of mudguards.
Results:
1 Scott Cousins (Maldon & District CC) 2-36-12
2 Adam French (East London Velo) at 42 sec
3 Toby Parnell (Cambridge CC) at 2-01
4 Malcolm Smith (St Ives CC) at 2-02
5 Patrick Schils (Velo Schils-Interbike)
6 Graham Galvin (East London Velo)
7 Vince Divine (Finchley RT) all same time

Zenaida Gonzalez and Roy Kronk, two names that were often mentioned in Anthony’s murder trial in the death of her daughter, Caylee Anthony, were told they have 21 days to make financial claims to a Tampa court.
Anthony did not appear in court for a hearing in the case Tuesday. She remains in seclusion.
Kronk discovered the remains of Caylee Anthony while working as a meter reader in Orange County. Kronk claims that during the trial it was suggested he could have played a role in the 2-year-old’s disappearance.
Gonzalez said her name was damaged because Anthony said a nanny by the name of Zenaida Gonzalez was the last person to be seen with Caylee Anthony.
Meanwhile, it also suggested in court Tuesday that Casey will turn over her laptop to the bankruptcy trustee, to see if there's any evidence of Casey's finances on that computer.
Anthony filed for bankruptcy and said she has no reliable source of income. She said she has been relying on the kindness of friends..Search

OK. we got a bit carried away on the title, but that's the shortest we could come up with.
We wanted to build a PC that not only was powerful and as functional as a desktop, but something you could take around with you in your shirt pocket or purse every day. To get to such a super small size without compromising desktop functionality, we had to go back to physics and develop a whole new patent pending technology inspired from the one used in space rockets by NASA. Our team has been working on this technology for over two years.
What's more, Tango PC can save you money. Instead of spending thousands of dollars on Computers at home and office, and not to mention HTPCs and gaming consoles, all you need is just one Tango PC which you can carry just like a smart phone. Replace the Computers, gaming consoles and IPTV boxes with inexpensive and tiny docking stations.
Additionally, you save on licensing costs on additional software that you need to keep on all those PCs.
That's truly a savings of thousands of dollars if you have multiple machines.
Tango™ consolidates data, apps, games and OS clutter with a single remarkably personal, hassle-free device with hands-free mobility.
We are a self-funded start-up based in California. Our product is
ready with engineering samples built by a large manufacturer in Asia.
We need to bring it to the market by placing production order with them, with retail
packaging and with completed hard tooling.
Help us bring back the PC to the forefront of design refresh and be part of our campaign!
The Product
Tango provides gaming performance that is better than last generation gaming consoles. In terms of office use, you will have a smooth and snappy experience while using business applications, browsing, watching HD videos and HD movies with home theater sound quality. You can also run CAD software applications like Autocad and Solidworks.
Due to the fact that Tango uses the latest Solid state drive, the Windows Boot up time is a snappy 15 seconds in our test. You do not need to reboot the system when you move the system from one dock to the other dock. The system simply goes to sleep and wakes up so that you can start working where you left last time.We offer bootable images of Ubuntu Linux and Chromium OS. We are working on making SteamOS work on Tango.

Turn your TV into a media center. Tango also serves as an IPTV set-top box. Using the latest Microsoft RDP client from iTunes® , you can use your iPAD® as a touch panel interface to Windows PC.
and much much more...
Next steps
We are a small team working tirelessly to bring the Tiny Tango to the world, we already have production ready systems and we have the commitment of one of the worlds Top 10 ODM manufacturers to bring Tango into the world.
We need your help to show our partners that this is a revolutionary product and the best way we can do that is to show that our backers are committed to bringing Tango into the world.
As in any crowd funding campaign, there are risks associated with product development. However, we think we have taken care of most by already having working consumer samples.
Our Team
Tango Team consists of very experienced and talented people with exceptional credentials behind them. We have over 50 years of combined experience in the following fields:
1. Hardware development
2. Systems software development in C++, C# and Java.
3. Cloud architecture – including force.com, Amazon, and Azure based infrastructures.
4. Enterprise Architecture – for large enterprise, public sector and financial institution implementation
5. Security Architecture – for Banks and PC based security designs.
6. Startups – we have worked at over half a dozen startups in our lives.In spite of being a small company with our own money, we have received an extensive support from AMD. We also have a contract in place with the world's top 10 manufacturing company in Taiwan to produce Tango for us. So even before gaining the traction in the market, we have taken care of the scalability problem.
1. What is Tango and why do I need it?
Tango is a smartphone sized PC that has built in CPU, RAM on socket and SSD on socket. It helps you remove the clutter of multiple desktops lying around in your home and office. replace all the desktops with inexpensive docking stations and have one single Tango PC that you can carry around and plugin wherever you happen to work. Saves money and hassles of upgrading multiple PCs, OS'es, Apps, and Games. Saves a lot on multiple software licensing costs. Saves you from the hassles of data synchronization.
2. I do not see any fan or cooling mechanism on Tango. Does it heat up?
We have a patent pending technology that allows us to transmit heat from Tango PC in to the docking station. We have a fan and a large heatsink in the docking station. That's how we cool Tango. A device of a same size without this technology would be too hot to touch even at 5 watts. Tango handles 25 watts with a comfortable warm touch.
3. Do you use any special RAM or storage RAM?
No. We use standard DDR3 RAM and mSATA SSD you can shop online from vendors. You can upgrade very easily. open two screws, slide open the metal cover of Tango PC, pop out the old RAM from the SODIMM socket and insert the new RAM. Same goes with SSD, which uses mSATA.
4. What is the weight of Tango PC?
Tango weighs 210 gms approximately when fully loaded.
5. Does it have a battery?
Yes. It has a small battery, that allows it to go standby when you pull it out of the docking station. after a few hours in standby mode, the system saves the memory content on to disk and hibernates. If the battery goes low, the system immediately goes to hibernation under Windows.
6. Does the system bootup every time I plugin Tango?
System just wakes up from standby mode when you plugin. In case the system was undocked more than 6 hours ago, it would resume from hibernation. The amount of time in hibernation is configurable under Windows setting. We suggest you keep it below 8 hours.
7. Would Tango work with multiple docking stations?
Yes. You can undock Tango from one docking station and dock into another and it will resume operation.8. Does Tango support multiple monitors?
Yes, you can use an HDMI splitter cable.
9. What if I have a VGA monitor?
You will need an inexpensive HDMI to VGA adapter cable.Download 5 Days of War - UK Premiere Interviews video

Thank you for your help!Jeff Bezos made his fortune by starting Amazon.com. Not content with merely sending packages to your door, now he's hoping to send you to space.
Rex Rystedt//Time Life Pictures/Getty Images
Frequently named in Forbes Magazine lists of richest people, Jeff Bezos is one of the most successful visionaries of Internet business. He founded Amazon.com, an online marketplace for books, in 1994, when the Internet was still young. The Web site exploded in popularity, and later Bezos incorporated movies, music, electronics, apparel and food into Amazon's inventory. Amazon has made Bezos a certified billionaire.
So what's he doing with all that wealth? He's entered the commercial space race.
Unlike many of the other space race contenders, Bezos has kept his space project quiet. In 2000, Bezos started a Seattle-based company called Blue Origin to build and test rockets. But for several years, he virtually kept the company a secret, releasing only a few details about its purpose and plans. In 2003, the media researched state documents to confirm Blue Origin was involved in spacecraft research [source: Newsweek]. Then, Bezos piqued people's curiosity when he bought 165,000 acres in West Texas. He even secured secrecy by having locals sign confidentiality agreements [source: Mangalindan].
In 2005, he finally divulged to a local paper that he would be using the land to launch Blue Origin's rockets. Since then, he's opened up a bit, revealing more details, largely because he's looking to recruit talented engineers for his team. One notable figure, science fiction author Neal Stephenson, has already spent some time working for Bezos' team. Though he only minored in physics in college, Stephenson tinkers with electronics and has always immersed himself in scientific subjects. In an interview, Stephenson described himself as Blue Origin's "Spock," the "Star Trek" character who offers his thoughts whenever he gets the chance [source: Slashdot].
Something else separates Bezos from his fellow commercial space racers -- he doesn't seem to be racing at all. He's taking his sweet time, and he's proud of it, evidenced by Blue Origin's motto, "gradatim ferociter," which translates loosely to "step by step, ferociously."
Slow and steady seems to be working for Blue Origin. It tested a vehicle named Goddard and released a video showing that it was a success. Ultimately, Bezos hopes to send tourists on suborbital space trips on a weekly basis by 2010. Can he do it?
Read the next page to find out more about his plans.The Shrimp Trucks Are Awesome And So Is Ted’s Bakery, Banzai Sushi and Cholo’s Mexican
Dining on the North Shore does not involve five-star restaurants, tourist theme spots or famous chefs serving “Asian/fusion cooking.” Drinking does not involve dance floors and cover charges. The North Shore is far too simple for such extravagance.
Instead, meals are as likely to be served on paper plates and drinks downed in a cozy little joint where the staff knows at least half the patrons.
The shrimp trucks are the perfect example of North Shore cuisine. For about 10 bucks a full meal can be enjoyed while sitting on a picnic table with friends and strangers as traffic trickles by on the adjacent highway.
Giovanni’s Original White Shrimp Truck is legendary in a place of legends. Its ample serving of peel-and-eat shrimp is heavy – and we mean heavy – on garlic. More napkins, please! Good thing it comes with rice. A few feet away is the Famous Kahuku Shrimp Truck, which has more of a variety with its menu including coconut tempura shrimp; garlic butter squid and teriyaki beef. The Thai truck has what some locals consider the best Thai food on the entire island, Honolulu’s fancy restaurants be damned.
Further up the road, Romy’s Kahuku Shrimp & Prawns raises its own shrimp, making it a popular stop. It’s located in Kahuku between the James Campbell wildlife refuge and Turtle Bay Resort. If there’s a line here (likely) and the stomach can’t stomach the wait, a half-mile farther up the highway is Macky’s Original Shrimp Farm.
All these shrimp and food trucks are open for lunch and early dining, from 11 a.m.-6:30 p.m.
Another simple and delicious spot is Ted’s Bakery. It serves hearty plate lunches with four – four! – scoops of rice and sandwiches. Many simply come here just for the pies, specifically the chocolate haupia cream. A couple of small tables are roadside outside and even the occasional North Shore shower doesn’t keep the surfers from their food. Like the trucks, Ted’s is open ’til 6. The kitchen closes at 3, so only sandwiches and pies are then available. Ted’s is on the right side of the highway just past Sunset Beach.
A bit more sophistication – we said a bit, not a lot – can be found in the North Shore Market Place (about a half-mile from Giovanni’s shrimp truck). For starters, there’s Cholo’s, a Mexican restaurant. If this seems out of place in Hawaii, just have one of its margaritas, the best in the North Shore. They are made with fresh lime juice, not a pre-made mix. The food is pretty authentic, too. The salsa sells this fact right from the start.
Pipeline isn’t the only bonzai in the North Shore. After dark it’s Bonzai Sushi. There’s no pounding waves, but pounding down sake and sushi on the outdoor patio, especially during the 4-7 Happy Hour.
Some sit on cushions on the deck and Wednesday is unofficial local’s night. It’s usually going until 10 or 11, not rocking like a nightclub, just hanging and telling stories. It’s the closest thing a visitor can get to sitting around a campfire with North Shore surfers.
The North Shore Market Place also has a third restaurant, a small surf museum, a clothing store, a surf and bike shop and an ATM that doesn’t work. The latter brings up an interesting point: bring enough cash for the visit and a couple of credit cards in case an establishment doesn’t take, say, American Express. (Been there, done that!) Also in the market place is The Coffee Gallery with Java so strong it’s amazing it doesn’t burn a hole in the cup.
The only sit-down dining with an ocean view in the North Shore is not actually on the water but across it, Halewa Joe’s. It features fish, shrimp, meat, chicken and soups and salads.
And tourists always stop for the famed shaved ice in Halewa.The exhibition aims at strengthening ties between the two countries. PHOTO: PUBLICITY
A group of 17 Pakistani artists showcased their work in Mumbai alongside four leading Indian artists, in an exhibition organised by Gallery 6 which opened on Wednesday at the spacious gallery of PL Deshpande Maharashtra Kala Academy.
Being the first collaborative exhibition with any country, Gallery 6 aims to make it memorable. The show has been organised in partnership with an independent organisation International Creative Art Center (ICAC) in Mumbai is being led by Ravindra Mardia, a former industrialist who has now focused his attention towards the promotion of art.
ICAC excels in showcasing the work of artists belonging to various age groups and genre and has been consistently supported and encouraged by the senior Indian artists in doing so.
The Pakistani artists which taking part in the exhibition are Abid Hasan, Abrar Ahmed, Akram Spaul, Aqeel Solangi, Arjumand Faisel, Hajra Mansoor, Irfan Gul Dahri, Mussarrat Nahid Imam, Masood A Khan, Mughees Riaz, Mudassar Manzoor, Mutaib Shah, Mansoor Rahi, Omar Farid, RM Naeem, Sana Arjumand and Wahab Jaffar. The Indian artists are Jatin Das, Lalita Lazmi, Vinay Sharma and Vinod Sharma.
Gallery 6, which was established in March 2008, is the largest private art gallery in Islamabad, showcasing a large collection of paintings, prints and sculptures by established and amateur artists.
Pakistan and India, which have many common cultural grounds, have been exchanging artists belonging to different fields of art. Being Gallery 6’s first exhibition in collaboration with any other country, this exchange is aimed at strengthening ties between the two countries. The exhibition ends on Monday.

The direction of exchange seems pretty one sided. I do not have a problem. IF people in India can see the best of PAkistani art sitting i India, their experiences are enriched.
@emory: “ofcourse the onus is on India since it claim to be secular unlike pakistan “
As mentioned earlier, I welcome such an exhibition, however, your sense of entitlement is annoying. India does not OWE Pakistan anything. Secularism has nothing to do with foreign policy. It only concerns citizens of own country.

This time around, young people – on a national level – played an equally important part in helping Obama earn his second term in the White House. But Iott, like other students, said he didn’t sense the same level of enthusiasm on campus as in 2008.
“I don’t know if there was that same passion but I know that people did care,” said Iott, a senior at GVSU who serves as president of the Student Senate.
Whether that perceived drop in enthusiasm translated into fewer GVSU students voting is a difficult question to answer.
Although some students may have cast their vote in Allendale, others undoubtedly did so by an absentee ballot. And with the largest percent of the university’s students coming from Kent and Ottawa counties, it’s also likely many students return home to vote. Combined, that makes sizing up the youth vote at GVSU difficult.
In an effort to boost turnout, student groups on campus held voter registration drives and tried to get the word out about how to vote by absentee ballot. Representatives of Michigan’s Secretary of State office visited campus in September to, among other things, register students to vote.
“I would probably say voter turnout was better in '08 at Grand Valley,” said Kyle McMillen, president of GVSU’s College Democrats and a double major in history and political science. “I just think there was more of an effort to get out the vote in '08 than 2012.”
Fifty percent of young people – those between 18 and 29 – voted in the 2012 Presidential election – virtually the same number as in 2008, according to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.
“There’s definitely a lot of people who aren’t involved campus-wide,” Rachel Doane, a member of the GVSU College Republicans, said of voter turnout. But “it depends on where you look.”
Allendale Township Clerk Candy Kraker said there was a noticeable difference in the number of young voters who turned out to the polls in her township.
“Four years ago we had masses of students from Grand Valley – they were busing them into vote,” Kraker said. “We had quite a few (this year) but they came on their own and their counts were way down.”
In the township’s 5th precinct – the territory where Kraker said many off-campus student apartments are located -- turnout was 55.7 percent, according to the Ottawa County Clerk’s website.
Four years ago, turnout was pegged at 68.5 percent. That’s nearly 13 percentage points higher than this year’s election.
Still, it’s difficult to say whether the fluctuation can be attributed solely to students.
In addition, Kraker also said there was fewer voter registration materials turned into the township this year than in 2008.
“Four years ago there were massive registration drives, and honestly they would come in with stacks of registrations for us to process,” she said.
Iott said the Student Senate hosted several registration drives, primarily geared toward students from Ottawa and Kent counties, over a three-week period this fall.
And while the Student Senate had provided transportation for students to the polls in the past, the same wasn’t done this year because the number of students who took advantage of the service was relatively low, he said.
“Students weren’t changing their permanent address to be able to vote in Allendale,” said Iott, who traveled to his hometown of Milford, near metro Detroit, to vote.
So what needs to happen to boost youth turnout at GVSU?
McMillen, of the GVSU College Democrats, said participation, in part, boils down to how connected students feel to the candidates and whether they think their vote counts.
“A lot of college students, I think, think their vote didn’t count,” McMillen said.
Iott said it should be easier for students to vote absentee and from their temporary address.
Michigan residents who are first-time voters and register by mail or a voter registration drive must vote in person in their first election, according to the Michigan Secretary of State’s office.
“Honestly, I think students would vote more the day of if they were registered and could wake up and vote from anywhere,” Iott said.JC hires Nienhaus: Indiana native tabbed to lead men’s program

OK, on to more serious stuff, though I have to say that I'm having too much fun to take things completely seriously.
I've added another company to the portfolio, Vizibility. In the left column of this page, under my picture, you can see their product, the "SearchMe" button. Simple stuff, and if that were it, I'd have yawned and walked away. But their very impressive CEO, James Alexander, has some aces up his sleeve, and I think that the potential that he has in data acquisition will dwarf any direct revenues from button sales.
Earlier this month a couple of the local groups, Race Point Capital Group and Launchpad, merged their operations. I'm a good friend of RPCG's fearless leader, Christopher Mirabile, and I have a boatload of respect for Launchpad's managing director, Ham Lord, and I can only see great things coming from this merger so I jumped at the opportunity to join the combined group.
Once I've had more experience with Launchpad/RPCG I will post some thoughts on the differences between the groups.
But things are very busy for me these days. Looking at several deals, all of which are attractive, so I'm going to have to choose not to invest in one or more.
Pixability. Hot stuff. CEO Bettina Hein has been working for several years to find the right formula for leveraging her low-cost, high-value video production engine (human powered!). I think she and her team have got it right now. The most convincing piece of data: SEO is dramatically improved if a site incorporates video.
Brand-Yourself. Four young fellows out of Syracuse University who eat sleep and breathe SEO have developed a site that helps you manage your on-line "brand". Same general area as Vizibility, but a different, and really complementary approach.
StarStreetSports. I met Jeremy Levine this summer and, having come in to the meeting ready to tell him his business was crazy, left ready to invest. This one is a market in virtual shares of sports stars. Crazy, absolutely. But Jeremy is going to make it work, I'm convinced. Big Bux.
Anyway, that's the update for now.Open iTunes to preview, buy, and download this movie.

Fun little movie of eccentricity
Kevin Kline is amazing as an eccentric NYC social character. His bravado in his voice during certain scenes combined with the clever dialogue kept me laughing out loud. The rest of the cast was great as well. An interesting and fun little movie. Makes you want to meet people like this in real life and spend time with them just to experience it.

On April 22, 2011, Texas Governor Rick Perry, who has resisted the
science of man-made global warming, led the state in prayer: ."
Prayer can't hurt, and it surely won't stop the rain. But Texas is getting close to the point where it will require a miracle of global politics and coordination to avoid summers like 2011 in the future.
For the most part, scientists are loathe to pin specific weather events -- hurricanes, droughts, floods -- to human-induced climate change. More than loathe, actually. "Statistical nonesense" was the way MIT atmospheric scientist Kerry Emanuel characterized such claims in 2005.
But James Hansen disagrees. In a recent column for the New York Times, Hansen wrote that "we can say with high confidence that the recent heat waves in Texas and Russia, and the one in Europe in 2003, which killed tens of thousands, were not natural events -- they were caused by human-induced climate change."
The proof is in his paper, a peer-reviewed survey of climate variability that Hansen shared with Time. Hansen scans the world for "extreme climate outliers" -- temperatures more than three standard deviations (σ) warmer than climatology. Here 12 maps of the world going back to 1955.

The Wauneta-Palisade FFA chapter held its annual banquet Tuesday, April 22.
Speaker Spencer Hartman of Imperial, who recently finished his term as president of Nebraska FFA, spoke to attendees about potential.
Using the analogy of the FFA jacket, Hartman said the jacket itself has little possibility until the student puts it on. The possibilities then become endless as is the student given the opportunities and encouragement.

Officers for 2014-2015 will be Nicole Strand, president; Cameo Rector, vice president; Ellie Lee, secretary; Lesley Towery, treasurer; Stephanie Acosta, reporter; Billy Straub, sentinel; Joseph Sramek, officer at large; and Cody Barrett, historian.
Jayden Ingold and Reagan Skow received their Discovery Degrees.
Green Hand awards went to Logan Fischer and Seth Straub. Star Green Hand award was given to Lesley Towery.
Receiving Chapter Degrees were Strand, Rector, E. Lee, Tailor Lee, Cassidy Rathe and Landon Jutten.

This book is about the American short story since 1950. It is a book about some of the greatest writers of the period, who consistently found in the short story a form well adapted to their most fundamental preoccupations, and about the literary cultures within which they wrote: the magazines they published in; the prizes they did or did not win; the university courses which taught them how to write, or enabled them to teach others how to write; and above all, or beneath all, the (more often than not disappointing) sales figures.
In order to understand fully both the quality of the short stories published in America since 1950 and their sheer quantity, it is first necessary to consider some historical context. This introductory chapter will explore some of the key issues raised by enduring debates about the genre’s historical development and distinctive formal features. In particular, it will address the paradoxical status of the short story in American literary theory and practice during the past two centuries. How did the short story gain its reputation as a genre at once ancient and modern, formulaic and innovative, fragmentary and complete, local in emphasis and yet a means of understanding the nation as a whole?
While people have been telling each other tales since the days of cave-painting and publishing them since the days of Gutenberg, the term ‘Short-story’ did not appear in print until 1885, in an article by the American critic, Brander Matthews.1 Matthews’s use of capitals and a hyphen to join his two terms was a deliberate attempt to distinguish short stories from stories which merely happened to be short. In other words, he was arguing that short stories (I’ll drop the hyphen) were not only different from novels in length but also in kind. A case was beginning to be made for the short story not just as a ‘short prose narrative’, but rather as the quintessentially modern literary form, ideally suited to the demands of both commerce and innovation.2 For these, and other, reasons it was also often described as a quintessentially American form.

Raissman : Santana Rape Accusation Far From A Non-Issue
Of a Wednesday TMZ report citing an October 2009 sexual assault accusation against Mets starter Johan Santana, The New York Daily News’ Bob Raissman wonders, “If the name on the complaint was “Alex Rodriguez”, would there have been a real sense of urgency across the media board?” Though I’ve already weighed in (albeit in 140 character or less form), Raissman is just as right as he’s bald when warning, “no one knows where the story is headed…and no one can accurately predict how much of a distraction it will be to Santana and his teammates.”
Some of Santana’s pitching performances (velocity down, blah, blah, blah) have been subject to question. Now every time a Santana performance is deemed subpar, there will be a new set of inquiries. Are continuing media reports of this seamy sexual encounter interfering with his brain waves? Is dealing with his family taking his focus away? Johan, how long has all this stuff been on your mind?
And what happens when Jane Doe goes public, in front of microphones and cameras?
Some outlets, such as ESPN-1050, ignored the story for much of Wednesday afternoon. Instead the station opted to pound its listeners with Bonnie Bernstein updates featuring news of Team USA’s dramatic 1-0 World Cup win over Algeria, the Wimbledon marathon match and Lawrence Taylor being indicted on sexual assault charges.
The oversight was not without irony.
“You have to watch carefully how this thing is going to play out,” said WFAN’s Mike Francesa, pointing out that the story could take on a life of its own.
This is a talkie who has been around for all those Mets days of whine and bleach, rape allegations and drugs. Those stories did not end in happy recaps.
If A-Rod were accused of sexual assault, it would only have been on himself.
A friend with a legal background pointed out the victim had retained a civil attorney (on the last page of the sheriff’s report on TSG), and this friend believes that the matter has been settled outside of court – not necessarily because the allegations were true, but simply to make it go away. So we may not see the accuser in front of tv cameras any time soon.
I’m still struggling with my personal response to this.

Dubuque, Iowa. Along with Gary Busey (whose GF is Steffanie Sampson) who`s going to breaking apart this weekend.
The yearly Julien Dubuque International Film Festival runs April 4 to 7, so, if you’re at all in the region, now’s your opportunity to watch movies and perhaps take a seat next to the guy who was snubbed for a Best Actor Oscar back in 1978, plus a Best Supporting Oscar, IMHO.
Details on this weekend’s event:
On Friday, April 5, Gary Busey will be there for the Cause We Can gala, which includes a screening of Busey’s Oscar-nominated roll in 1978’s The Buddy Holly Story and a Q-and-A conference with the actor later; tickets to the event are $15, with proceeds going to the Busey Foundation for Children’s Kawasaki Disease.
But enough of Gary, let’s meet his girlfriend, Steffanie…
She was born in Aug. 19-1974. In Hollywood Hills, CAL. She is 5′ 6″ (1.68 m)
She started performing at the time she was 5, with her sister Marnie. They would produce characters together and act them out for hours on end. She studied acting in Hollywood.
She is also certified as a Master Hypnotist.
Steffanie and Gary have a son, Luke Sampson Busey, who was born on February 23, 2010. Luke weighed 6 lbs. 7 oz.
In spite of her husband’s continuous madness, she manages to spend a rather normal day with her family, girlfriend and their young son, at their home in Malibu for his birthday.
Although the performer announced his monetary woes and filing for ruin, the couple have managed to keep all in shape.
Steffanie is a splendid mom who holds it all together…
Eventhough there is a thirty year age difference between her husband and Steffanie, love doesn’t follow any exact rules of life, let alone common decency.

Hey! This is super early but I am so excited that I'm planning now...I will be in Dublin, Galway and places around Galway (Doolin, Aran Islands) this summer on vacation!!! :) Where should I eat? What should I order? What is something I should not leave Ireland without trying? I know Ireland is not known for its food but I'm sure there is something I should experience. I'll be on a backpacker's budget so nothing too expensive...well, maybe one splurge. Thank you so much! I wish I could go tomorrow! I just can't wait!
Not mad about Park house but each to his own I suppose! Can't really think of any evening meal places in Galway off the top of my head but for great salads and sandwiches Delight on Abbeygate Street is great (pick a warm day cos there is no room to eat here so you might as well bring it with you and eat it up in Eyre Square) There are actually a few nice little cafe/bistro type places on that same street too. If you go down Quay Street (really easy to find) there are lots of restaurants there but one of the nicest long lunch places i've been to is above O'Neachtains Pub, however I can't remember the name of it (due to much time spent downstairs obviously:) For a splurge.......I would wait till you get here and then maybe save it for a good seafood place out in Connemara - I won't give you a name cos I havent been out there in a couple of years and I could be waaaay wrong at this stage. Good luck and enjoy! Oh and don't leave Galway without going to Sheridans Cheesemongers(smelly but fabulous) and having one of the stuffed crepes from the stall outside....Yum!
- re: ELDee
Ard Bia is upstairs from Neachtains (Naughtons in English):
Decent grub was there last time I was Galway for dinner one night, good grub in a rustic boutique type setting. And I think the lunch menu in Neachtains is from Ard Bia.
However, many of the places on the same section of the street (Quay Street) are touristy and seem a bit overpriced for the grub they offer. Galway City is a nice town, well worth spending a least a day or two there.
McDermott's in Doolin has great pub food at a reasonable price and good craic in the evenings. O'Connors was a little pricier but you can get a good chowder and a pint there.
BTW, Ireland has AWESOME food! We saved a ton of money by picking stuff up in the local bakeries, produce and deli or butcher shops for our lunches and snacks. Local produce and cheeses, fresh breads, local made deli meats, it was awesome! You can get good smoked salmon almost anywhere but Lisdoonvarna near Doolin is famous for it.
We stayed at B&B's so we had breakfasts included. If you're staying at hostels, find out where the nearest bakery is and chow down on the stuff they have fresh out of the oven and still warm in the morning. Lots of them also offer tea and coffee. That and some local fruit and cheese make a great budget breakfast. And if you've got some smoked salmon leftover, even better!
Evenings we hit pubs for dinner. Out of 3 weeks worth of traveling we had only one dinner that was a disappointment. The portions were generally large enough for two of us to share with maybe an addition of a bowl of soup or an extra salad. Be aware that if you order something like chicken salad what you'll get is not diced chicken in mayo but beautiful slices of chicken breast laid on a bed of greens and accompanied by sliced fresh veggies!
Also, pack along about a half dozen plastic grocery bags. You'll need them for grocery shopping because the stores don't automatically load stuff in bags like they do here. You bring your own. I stuffed scads of bags in the cell phone pocket attached to my back pack. Also pick up a cheap paring knife once you land, it'll come in handy. We had a medium size soft sided cooler with gel packs for ice that worked great carrying our food. It folded flat in our checked luggage to get there, carried our food nicely while there and served as a carry-on coming home for the stuff I bought. The places we stayed we very nice about throwing the gel packs in their freezers overnight for us.
You are going to love your trip! Doolin is still my favorite place to be and after that comes Dingle or maybe Connemara...or the Burren... But everywhere is beautiful!

It would usually be described as a salad with grilled chicken, or chicken caesar salad, or some other indication that it was a green salad with chicken included.
(However you won't find a lot of restaurants offering the chicken with mayo type salad unless it's a diner or maybe a deli type place. But it is what first springs to my mind when I hear "chicken salad.")
Anyway, yes, food in Ireland is much improved over its reputation. Lots of wonderful seafood, especially in Galway. I've had my share of bad meals there too, but have learned what things are usually a bad choice.
- re: irishnyc
Thank you for the explanation. I knew I'd had "salad with chicken" in previous visits to the States. Had never occured to me that it wouldnt be called "chicken salad" :-)
Returning to the OP's question, you need to eat locally caught seafood and locally grown beef. Ireland has many good cheesemakers - look out for products at farmers & country markets. The markets are likely to provide the makings of good cheap picnic lunches as you move around:

was never under any illusions that he would have it easy in his defense of the MotoGP world title, and once again the Italian was made to fight for glory at the Alice Motorrad Grand Prix Deutschland. The Fiat Yamaha rider took the win at Sachsenring by just 0.099s from persistent rival Jorge Lorenzo in a breathtaking race to extend his lead in the World Championship.
After starting from pole for the first time at the German track, Rossi took the lead of the race after thirteen laps. Both the Italian and teammate Lorenzo eked out an advantage to make it a two-way battle to the chequeredup. stamina tyre wear and was forced to call it a day before the end of the 30-lap Grand Prix.
MotoGP Race Results Sachsenring
250cc
Marco Simoncelli kept his title challenge alive with a win in the 250cc contest, his second victory of his World Championship defense. As in 2008, the Metis Gilera rider broke free from the pack in the early going. This time, however, he had Álex Debón along for the ride. Simoncelli couldn’t shake the Spanish veteran despite his best attempts, although he had enough breathing space to prevent any overtaking moves.
Debón held on to second place, his first rostrum of the 2009 season, whilst behind him a fierce battle developed for the final podium spot. Álvaro Bautista took the trailing group up to his countryman on the final lap, but was unsuccessful in making a move on Debón despite putting in a circuit record lap. He did, however, get past title rival and series leader Hiroshi Aoyama to cut the gap in the standings to ten points.
The race had been restarted after an initial lap when rain fell on the Sachsenring, but during the wait between starts the track was deemed to have dried sufficiently for the majority of riders to change back to slick tyres.
125cc
Julián Simón extended his lead at the head of the 125cc World Championship classification, meanwhile, with a runaway win. The Bancaja Aspar rider had been the standout rider in every wet practice session for the German date, but proved equally adept in the dry on race day for a second triumph of 2009.
An all-Spanish podium saw Simón’s teammate Sergio Gadea extend his podium run to three races with second place, also allowing him to become the closest rival for Simón in the overall standings.
Belson Derbi’s Joan Olivé completed the podium with his first rostrum of the season, following the battle of the race between himself, fourth placed Nico Terol and Marc Maquez. A clash of fairings between Olivé and Marquez led to the latter taking a huge highside on the final lap.

Patrolman Terry Lowther. Lakewood Division of Police. Lakewood, Ohio. Otis, a white boxer, got loose from his owner’s house in Lakewood, Ohio early in the morning about a month ago. Now a loose dog can be a problem — for the owner, for the dog, and for innocent bystanders. So when responsible people see a loose dog in their neighborhood, they’ll usually keep their distance, try to keep an eye on it, keep it out of the road, shoo it away from anyone who passes by, and, while they have an eye on it, find the owner to get them to bring the dog to heel and take it back to its home.
Unfortunately for Otis, the first people to encounter him were not responsible people but rather a couple of heavily-armed police officers working for the Lakewood city government, who had made their way into the neighborhood on an unrelated call. So, instead of trying to keep anyone from getting hurt, the cops decided that the situation needed controllin’. They surrounded the dog and started yelling at it and waving their weapons around. After being surrounded by these complete strangers barging into his neighborhood, Otis started barking and backing up defensively. A couple times he tried to run off. The dog posed a threat to exactly nobody, but since it wouldn’t stop barking, and since twitchy government cops have been trained not to consider themselves safe as long as anyone or anything in the vicinity is moving without their permission, rather than waiting the literal 90 seconds that it took for the dog’s owner to get out there, they decided instead to close in on the dog and try to get a noose around its neck. When the dog barked and bristled at the complete strangers moving in to grab it, Patrolman Terry Lowther decided to blast Otis with a 50,000-volt electrical charge from his taser. After the dog tried to stagger to its feet — while it already had a noose around its neck — they blasted him again with a second 50,000-volt electrical charge. Just to be sure, I guess. Then they dragged the senseless dog along the ground over to their patrol car.
Trigger warning. Graphic footage of a dog being tortured and dragged by police officers.
When Otis’s owner showed up — a whole 90 seconds or so after the first taser blast — they hollered at him and gave him a citation for having a dangerous animal and for letting the dog run loose. I guess he’s lucky they just tortured his dog instead of killing it; according to the police report, the only reason consummate professional Patrolman Terry P. Lowther Jr. didn’t just whip out his handgun and shoot Otis dead is that he was afraid that the bullet might ricochet off the blacktop and harm a bystander.
When the story hit the local news, the cops tried to defend this electrical torture of a helpless animal that was already surrounded, did nothing more than bark, and posed no physical danger to anyone, in two ways. First, they made up lies about the dog’s breed — first they claimed it was a pit bull; when the owner contradicted their claim and put out photos of the dog, they claimed that it kinda looked like a pit bull and musta had some pit bull in ’im. Then they tried to spin the story back their way by releasing the video from Patrolman Terry Lowther’s taser-cam — video which they claimed showed the dog
acting aggressively and threatening the cops. This seems to have been a serious miscalculation on the city government’s part — since the ideas that twitchy government cops have about what counts as
aggressive and
threatening is very different from the ideas that civilized people have, and the video didn’t show the dog doing much of anything more than barking. Also, presumably, since most people react poorly to hearing a helpless animal howl in agony and seeing it writhe on the ground while a cop shocks it twice in rapid succession. After the police released the film, it quickly spread through the Internet, and public outrage over the case intensified rather than petering out.
In any case, the city government responded to the situation by using the
vicious animal charges to exile Otis and his owner, Daniel Kier, from the city: the city agreed to drop the utterly bogus
vicious animal charges against Kier only in exchange for an agreement that he would not sue the Lakewood city government for torturing his dog, and that he would move with Otis out of the city limits (to the city of Cleveland, as it happens). None of the news stories I’ve read on this case have mentioned it, but the
vicious animal charge is just a misdemeanor rap for Kier; but since the same law also provides for the impounded
vicious animal to be
humanely destroyed, I suspect that the reason he was so ready to get it dropped, even if it meant moving out of the city, is because the city government was effectively threatening to kill his dog if he didn’t shut up and accept their terms.
So who are the real
vicious animals running loose here? I’m pretty sure it’s not the poor son of a bitch that got tasered.

Around Spadina Chinatown, I can't say I would recommend too many spots that would fit your criteria. I've had good experiences at Rainbow (which I think is now called something else, but can't recall at this moment what that new name is) on Dundas, just west of Spadina, but it's really casual (tile floors, bright lights, and terse service folk). I've heard okay things about Forest View on Dundas east of Spadina, but can't vouch for it myself. I've only been to Sky Dragon in the mall at Spadina and Dundas for dim sum so I don't know much about their dinner menu, but what I had at dim sum I found to be quite greasy and overcooked. Same goes for Bright Pearl at Spadina and St. Andrew.
You may actually want to try Dynasty on Bloor (east of Avenue, 2nd floor, in the same building as the Lacoste store), which is more formal than what you'll find on Spadina, but nothing as fancy as Lai Wah Heen as far as decor and menu are concerned. Prices are above average (equal to or a bit less than prices at Casa Imperial or Full House), food is decent but nothing to write home about.
Alternatively, there's Pearl Harbour at Queens Quay Terminal, which I prefer less than Dynasty on Bloor because I find the execution of the food to be a notch lower, and you have to navigate around the North Americanized dishes on the menu. Price-wise, it's slightly less expensive than Dynasty on Bloor.More diplomacy is needed if Beijing’s new leaders are to avoid a clash with America as its pivot to the Pacific gains traction, writes Andrew Hammond
In his end-of-year press conference last week, US President Barack Obama announced he will nominate Senator Max Baucus in January as America’s ambassador to China. If this is confirmed by Congress, Baucus will take up post in 2014 during a period of significant uncertainty in bilateral relations that is reshaping the Asian geopolitical landscape.
This key moment comes in a context of substantial change in 2013 with a once-in-a-generation leadership transition in Beijing, and the US “pivot” of its foreign policy toward Asia. In this fluid, unpredictable environment, it is perhaps unsurprising that there have been tensions between Washington and Beijing.
For instance, following the near-collision of an American warship and a Chinese naval vessel on 5 December, US defence secretary Chuck Hagel on 19 December accused China of acting in a “very incendiary [way] that could be a trigger or a spark that could set off some eventual miscalculation”.
While Hagel asserts that the episode resulted from the Chinese vessel cutting in front of the US ship, Beijing claims its vessel was conducting “normal patrols” and adhered to proper protocol. Beyond question, this was the most serious Sino-US incident in the South China Sea for several years.
This incident came soon after another diplomatic flare-up in November when, without consultation, Beijing declared an air “self-defence identification zone” covering islands which both Japan and China claim as their own. While such zones are common across the world, Washington has expressed concern to Beijing about both its unilateral imposition of the zone, and the warning to aircraft that if they do not comply with demands to submit flight plans, unspecified “emergency defensive measures” will be taken.
These and other demonstrations of Beijing’s assertiveness in 2013 – including the recent refusal to participate in a United Nations arbitration process over a territorial conflict with the Philippines – have raised tension in Asia. In turn, this has complicated the China-US relationship.
A crucial question arising is whether, following the inauguration of the new leadership in China in March, we are witnessing the rise of a much more bold and forceful nation on the world stage. If so, 2013 would mark the beginning of at least a partial departure from Beijing’s previous grand strategy, premised on a gradual, peaceful and low-profile rise to power.
Chinese President Xi Jinping’s assumption of power this year has been confident and assured. But his precise international intentions remain unclear.
For instance, Xi has repeatedly voiced his desire for a relationship with America based on peaceful co-operation. This was most strongly emphasised in June when he called for a “new type of great power relationship” at his first summit meeting with Obama.
This is an audacious goal, which is still lacking in any obvious definition. Given foreign policy tensions between China and the United States, however, perhaps the obvious way to realise better ties is in the economic sphere, where their are substantial shared interests in sustainable global growth.
However, even on this agenda the two country’s interests are by no means identical. This is underlined by Washington’s current championing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade initiative, while Beijing is simultaneously promoting its alternative Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
It is in this context of competition that the United States and China are looking to enhance their regional influence. While both countries have formidable military and economic assets to enable their ambitions, 2013 has shown Washington has an edge in the “soft power” stakes.
Thus, in numerous (but by no means all) key Asian countries, Washington’s pivot towards the region is generally welcomed. Meanwhile, there is considerable angst and concern about Beijing’s growing assertiveness.
In the Philippines, for instance, 81 per cent of the population now regard the United States as a “partner” and only 3 per cent as an “enemy”, according to Pew Global, compared with 22 per cent and 39 per cent respectively for China. In South Korea, the numbers for the United States as “partner” are 69 per cent and “enemy” 4 per cent, compared with 27 per cent and 17 per cent for China. And in Japan, the figures are 76 per cent and 2 per cent for the United States, compared with 11 per cent and 40 per cent for China.
While not uniform through Asia, these patterns of public opinion can only complicate the realisation of Beijing’s regional ambitions. And this is one reason why Xi has been conflicted in 2013 between his apparent desire to show a more assertive China on the world stage, and his recognition that the country’s power needs underpinning by better diplomacy so there is greater international understanding (albeit not necessarily acceptance) of the country’s motivations and intentions.
With multiple potential flashpoints in 2014, it is crucial that Beijing now doubles down on enhancing its regional and global diplomacy. Unless this happens, international perceptions of the country could deteriorate further, fuelling the possibility of miscalculation and an incident triggering an explosive escalation of tension.

The Mets blew out the Phillies 11-2 on Monday night to win four of out of five in Philadelphia. The Mets have won seven of their last nine to improve their record to 28-29, just 3 1/2 games out of first place Atlanta in the National League East and in a virtual tie with the Washington Nationals (27-28) for third place.
The Mets' run began with their win in the second game of the doubleheader agianst Arizona on Sunday, May 25th. The Mets have played with a renewed spirit, which was lacking for most of the first six weeks of the season. One thing that can be said about the Mets with Terry Collins as manager is that they may not be the best, but they try hard.
The trademark of this run has been the great starting pitching they have received from the rotation, as presently constructed, of Bartolo Colon, Zack Wheeler, Rafael Montero, Jacob deGrom, and Jon Niese. The bullpen also is as settled as it has been all year, with Jeurys Familia setting up closer Jennry Mejia.
Monday night was another one of those nights, as Bartolo Colon had his second straight great outing. Colon, who improved his record to 5-5, went 7 innings, and allowed 2 runs on 6 hits, 3 walks, and struck out 5. Colon has a 1.61 ERA in his last three starts.
Mets Manager Terry Collins said of Colon, "He knows when he has to put a little something on it. He's the master of taking stuff, taking speed off the ball, getting it to sink, getting it to move. When he needs it, there's still plenty there."
The Mets got on the board in the second inning when Bobby Abreu doubled, and scored when Lucas Duda got a double of his own to give them a 1-0 lead. Abreu has quietly become the Mets' starting right fielder, and he has earned it by swinging a hot bat. The 40-year old Abreu is hitting .360 (9-for-25) with 5 RBI and 4 walks in his last ten games, and .315 overall.
It stayed 1-0 Mets until the 6th. Matt den Dekker, in the lineup for the injured Juan Lagares, singled on a line drive to center to open the inning, and Daniel Murphy followed with a single. David Wright, who has hit well throughout this streak, doubled home den Dekker and Murphy to make it 3-0. With one out, Abreu walked and Lucas Duda reached on an error to load the bases. Wilmer Flores then doubled home Wright and Abreu to make it 5-0 Mets.
The Phillies got a run each in the 6th and 8th innings, so it was 5-2 Mets heading to the 9th. The Mets rallied, as Chris Young walked, Murphy singled, and Wright walked to load the bases. Curtis Granderson delivered a two-run single to make it 7-2. Flores then hit a grand slam to blow it open and make it 11-2 Mets.
Flores went 2-for-5 with 6 RBI, and said of his night at the plate, "It felt good. Been struggling the last couple games, and I didn't feel god my first two at-bats, but as the game was going I made the adjustment, so I put a good swing on it. I haven't been playing that much, so I've just been taking extra batting practice. That helped."The up close and personal tour offered a great opportunity to the inner workings of an operation that blends the traditions found in English breweries with the high-tech systems of the 1990's. The spacious layout allowed for first floor stainless steel hot liquor tanks where some initial water treatment takes place. The second story brewhouse offered quite a view of the surrounding old brick neighborhood as well as the numerous odd-shaped vessels inside. The Peter Austin boil kettles were accompanied by dozens of 50 and 100 bbl vessels used for fermentation, conditioning and bright beer purposes. Inside one large temperature-controlled room was even a 300 bbl square fermentation tank.
Lacking a state liquor license, no on premises tasting was allowed, instead, the most memorable moment came from seeing the next batch's yeast slurry waiting to be pitched. It was sitting in an open 30 gallon plastic bucket that looked remarkably like a home garbage can. Following the tour there was the opportunity to shop at the merchandise room that fortunately stocked a full range of Shipyard bottled beer in addition to shirts, caps, and memorabilia. A search for the draft products won't take long, it's available just across the parking lot at a nearby restaurant and bar.
The Goat Island Light Ale was a light straw color with the pronounced carbonation producing a thick white head. The assertive hop aroma was followed by a light body but good mouthfeel. Although a malt presence was not evident, the hop flavor was very crisp and led to a similar aftertaste. From the label, consumers would learn that this 1 pint 6 FL. OZ. bottle contained 110 calories, 5.0 grams carbohydrates, 1.0 grams protein, and 0.0 grams fat. Standing out from crowd was the Old Thumper ESA with its slightly cloudy dark straw color, minimal head, medium body, intense malt and hop aroma, very sharp hop flavor and aftertaste. Available "under a unique arrangement between England's Ringwood Brewery", the yeast used definitely contributes to the characteristic esters that dominate the flavor profile. Curious consumers can read the history of Old Thumper from the label of the 22 ounce bottle. Also characteristically English, the Chamberlain Pale Ale was a clear amber color topped by a fine white head. Strong hop aromas foreshadowed the sharp hoppy flavor that followed. Overall, the medium body combined with the underlying maltiness made for a very full-flavored pale ale.

Creating a sense of depth in a design can really bring it to life. Most often you might want to use a Drop Shadow to make something pop up off the page, but occasionally you might want to cut down into an object instead of raising it up. When that's the case, Inner Shadow is the tool of choice. Let's see how it works. Here I have a simple document with a placed photo of some flowers and some text here and I'd like to apply some Inner Shadow to them. First I'll select the photo. I'll go to my Effects panel and double-click at the object level.
I'll click on Inner Shadow and see how it works. So with the default settings of Multiply and black and 75% Opacity I can see that I have a shadow appearing inside my object along the top and left sides. I can increase the distance to increase the shadow. I can also increase the size of the shadow and I can change the angle to move it all the way around the object if I want to. I can also click on Use Global Light to make my lighting effects consistent.
This can be very important if you used other effects like Drop Shadow to make sure your lighting effects all look like they're coming from the same angle. I can apply Choke to intensify the shadow. Choke is the amount of the shadow that set at the full opacity and color. So as I increase the choke, I increase the opacity of the shadow all the way to 100%. That's too far, so I'll take that back down. And it's always good to add a little bit of Noise to a shadow, just to add a little bit of realism, just 1% or 2%.
Now let's apply an Inner Shadow to this text. I'll select the text frame, double-click, and click on Inner Shadow, and since these letter shapes are smaller and more delicate, I need a smaller Inner Shadow. So I'll decrease the Distance and decrease the Size. There, that looks pretty good right away. So I'm getting this sense that I have a blue surface to my design and I've cut through the letter shapes to something white underneath. I'll click OK.
Now let's see something else you can do with Inner Shadow. Here I have some envelopes that I created in InDesign and I was trying to give them a very subtle sense of dimensional, a little bit of life to them. And I used a really large Inner Shadow to create this little darkness around all the edges. So the edges of the envelope are just subtly darker than the center. I just wanted them to seem like they're little bit farther away and there's just a very subtle puffiness to this envelope. Let's see how I did that. So here is the envelope with no effects applied to it. I'll select it, I'll move it out of the way so we can open the dialog box, and I click on Inner Shadow.
I'll keep multiplying with black, but I'll decrease the Opacity down to 20%. I'll increase the Distance a little bit to 10 pixels, I'll keep the same Angle, but I'll really increase the Size to 90 pixels, make a huge Inner Shadow, and a little bit of Noise never hurt when you're looking for realism. So I'll just add 1% Noise and click OK, and there you have it.
Now it definitely looks like the edges of this envelope are just a little bit darker than the middle. It's almost like I've used a gradient fill, but it gives me this nice subtle sense of dimension and just a little more realism than if I just use a flat fill color. With the Inner Shadow effect, you can simulate cutting into an object, creating a sense of depth. You can also use a really big Inner Shadow to give a more subtle sense of dimension to an object, like we did with the envelope..Have you ever felt like it takes the Exchange Management Shell, like, FOREVER to get from the point where you click it to the point where you get the blinking cursor so you can actually do something? Yeah, me too.
Here’s a little trick that helps speed things up for me. It should do the trick for you too.
- Open the EMS
- Enter the command
Get-ADServerSettings [enter]
- You should see, well, basically, not so much. Like this.
- Pick a Global Catalog server in the same domain and site as your Exchange server, and enter this command
Set-ADServerSettings –PreferredServer fqdnoftheGC [enter]
- Then repeat the first command, but this time pipe it into format-list.
That’s it really. Rather than waiting for the EMS to find and bind to a GC, you are saving time by telling it where to go. “Heh-heh, you told it where to go.” The following video merely affirms that at heart, I am twelve years old.

My taste in humour notwithstanding, if the little trick above helped you out at all, how about a shout out with a comment below, or maybe even a follow on Twitter? If I get ten comments or five follows as a result of this little tip I promise not to use another Beavis and Butthead video ever again!

Scientists have found that an infection with malaria pathogens changes the scent of infected mice, making those infected more attractive to mosquitoes. These are the findings of a team of researchers from ETH Zurich and Pennsylvania State University in a new study.
Malaria published in PNAS, researchers showed.
Mosquitoes.
The researchers believe it is logical that infected people smell more attractive but do not form highly specific body odours, especially given that the malaria pathogen can also have adverse effects on mosquitoes.
“Since mosquitoes.Express.js is one of the most popular and mature Node.js frameworks. In this post, we’ll cover some core Express features in the form of middleware. You can read more about in Intro to Express.js series on my blog webapplog.com. To learn how to create an Express application from scratch please refer to the earlier post.
Request Handlers
Express.js is a Node.js framework that among other things provides a way to organize routes. Each route is defined via a method call on an application object with a URL pattern as a first parameter (RegExp is also supported), for example:
app.get('api/v1/stories/', function(res, req){ ... })
or, for a POST method:
app.post('/api/v1/stories', function(req,res){ ... })
Needless to say, the DELETE and PUT methods are supported as well.
The callbacks that we pass to the get() or post() methods are called request handlers. They take requests (req), process them and write to response (res) objects. For example:
app.get('/about', function(req,res){ res.send('About Us: ...'); });
We can have multiple request handlers, often referred to as middleware. They accept a third parameter, next, which when called (via); });
In the above example, the ID of a story in the URL pattern (“:id”) is a query string parameter that we will use to find matching items in the database.
Parameters Middleware
Parameters are values passed in the query string of a URL in the request. If we didn’t have Express.js or a similar library and had to use just the core Node.js modules, we would need to extract parameters from HTTP.request object via a combination of the require(‘querystring’).parse(url) or require(‘url’).parse(url, true) functions.
Thanks to the Connect framework and people at VisionMedia, Express.js makes it easy to support parameters, error handling and many other important features in the form of middleware.
This is how we can plug the param middleware into); });
We could also use multiple request handlers but the concept remains the same: we can expect to have req.story object or an error thrown prior to the execution of this code so we abstract the placing in middleware.
We can also combine multiple parameters:); })
In addition, logging should also be abstracted as middleware.
To trigger an error from within your request handlers and middleware you can just call:
next(error);
or
next(new Error('Something went wrong'));
You can also have multiple error handlers and use named instead of anonymous functions as shown in the Express.js Error handling guide.
Other Middleware
The res.json() function conveniently serializes JavaScript/Node.js objects as a JSON string. For example:
app.get('/api/v1/stories/:id', function(req,res){ res.json(req.story); });
which is equivalent to (assuming(); } }
Conclusion
As you can see middleware is a powerful concept for keeping code organized. The best practice is to keep your router lean and thin by moving all of the logic into corresponding external modules/files. This way the important server configuration parameters will be neatly in one place, right there when you need them.

People who know me well know that I don’t have a spontaneous bone in my body. Well, I might but my uptight “stick-in-the-mud” nature prohibits much spontaneity. So when I got a Facebook invite to join a friend celebrating her 50th birthday, my initial reaction was “oh that’s neat. I think I’ll load the dishwasher now.” But then I thought about it.
Just how many times does a friend turn 50? (Captain Obvious, I know.) And besides, the language of the event was too charming to resist: “Crossing over the Morrison Bridge to my 50’s (this bridge in Portland is 53 yrs old!) – come and join the CANDLE VIGIL for my Forties and walk with me as I enter the 50’s! All are welcome! We are crossing the Morrison Bridge -midway I will do a reading of “Ode to Desire”, and once across on the East side, dessert for all! Anyone who would like to join in is welcome!” Sounds like a hoot, doesn’t it? So I asked Mister Soandso what he thought, and then I tweeted, “So, should I join a friend celebrating her 50th birthday? And by celebrate I mean booze and chocolate.”
Everybody who responded said pretty much the same thing: Are you crazy? Go get your keys right now.
So I got dinner ready, got all my cherubs bathed and spruced up for their Granny’s birthday celebration today, and headed out.
But first I got my rain boots.
Because here in Portland we are known for a short list of things. Beer and bridges, food carts and fine dining, and of course, coffee, putting a bird on things and rain figure prominently on that list.
Now because I’m not very experienced at being spontaneous and was running a bit behind, I thought, “here’s a good idea. I’ll park on the east side of the bridge, walk over the bridge and then walk back with Joanie. This way, I won’t miss them if I can’t find parking.” Did I mention I brought my rain boots? Also, the Morrison bridge has 4 sprawling on/off ramps on either end.
So, really, my spontaneous walk in the rain meant that first I had to traverse a whole bunch of pedestrian right of ways. These are handy little buggers, unlit and safe-havens for sleeping vagrants. But I was being spontaneous! Undaunted I continued. And about half-way across the Morrison bridge the winds picked up.
And the gusts and driving rain gusted so hard as to blow me across the sidewalk and against the railing. As in, the only thing between me and the Willamette River below. And so I was reminded why I rarely attempt this thing called spontaneity…it can kill you for god’s sake!
Needless to say, by the time I found my friend and recrossed the bridge, I was drenched. Well, twice as drenched as everybody else. Yes, we were quite the group of wet women.
Afterwards we sat steaming in the Rimsky-Korsakoffee House drinking coffee, eating fabulous desserts and laughing loudly enough that the trio playing in the corner asked us to be quiet. (While normally I would never argue with the person who wields the microphone, you would be hard-pressed to keep a group of 9 women from laughing, especially when 2 of them are comediennes.)
I can tell you this, it is good to be spontaneous if it lets you hang out with a group of wet women in their 40s. Especially if there is a tiara, bifocals, and birthday candles involved!
And Joanie Blankenship Quinn? She makes an even better 50 year old than a 49 year old. Happy Birthday Joanie!
That sounds wonderful- even the being wet part! Good for you, sweets, and Happy Birthday to Joanie! :)
Happy Birthday to your friend, but, still, all I can think is..
can you imagine the search engine results you’re going to get with this post title?
Just be ready…..
Happy Holidays, beautiful lady…
Well, to be honest, sometimes I like messing with the “enquiring minds” out there. Talk about disappointing google searches! ;) You never know, they could enjoy reading the articles. Right? :)
Glad you let yourself be spontaneous AND sharing with us a bonus post. Sounds like it was a wonderful way to spend a Tuesday evening!
Sounds like an absolute Hoot! I’m so glad you decided to Go! When I read “Wet Women in their Forties” I kept hearing “Wild Woment of Wongo” .
Happy Birthday to Joanie!
Thanks for this spontaneous mid-week post.
I don’t do spontaneity well anymore. I once did, with great success. Over the years, my stick may its way into the mud. I, too, would wear my rain boots and park on the East side of the bridge. After I spent the day talking myself in and out of going.
It sounds like you had a wonderful time, Who could help but do so in that company for that purpose and in such a creative manner? I’m so happy you had this opportunity to exercise your spontaneity.Huzzah!
Take care,

Download
Download (h/t Bill W)
It's hard to break through the media juggernaut that is the promotion of Hillary Clinton as the presumptive Democratic candidate for President. I do like the meme that John Edwards is using to break out of the pack, as here on Sunday's This Week with George Stephanopoulis:
STEPHANOPOULIS: The same words keep coming up, again and again and again: honesty, sincerity & integrity. It sure sounds like you're suggesting that Sen. Clinton is not honest, is not sincere and can't be trusted as President.
EDWARDS: No, what I'm saying is that this is a very important issue for America, and I think there are questions that have arisen. And I think those questions are fair to take into the account.
The polls have Edwards doing very well against the Republican contenders...it will be amusing to watch the press flop around like a fish out of water if anyone other than Hillary wins those early primaries.

Source: entertainmentwise.comHeading into New Year’s Eve, my wife and I had planned a quiet night at home with the kids, with copious amounts of reasonably healthy snacks and loads of board games. When she approached the kids with this idea, the unanimous response that morning was that they wanted to play Dungeons & Dragons with Dad.
No joke. Allow me to repeat myself here: THE iconic creature of D&D is expected to be defeated by a party of four second-level characters.
Sigh.
At any rate, after running through the encounters contained in the Basic Game in September, I had several different ideas about where to take the characters next. The appeal to play on New Year’s Eve made the decision critical, so I turned to something that I knew would allow for some range of open decisions on my kids’ part and something that would allow for some exposition on detail, backstory, and whatnot. I was also concerned that it pose a serious enough challenge to them that it subdues their memories of killing a dragon so easily. What I decided upon was this: Dyson’s Delve.
I had a “battle map”: I’d wanted to run my adult players through this little gem in the next few months and so I’d already taken some time to prepare some blown-up versions of the first three levels. They weren’t perfect and they weren’t hi-res, but they worked with the kids’ miniatures at 10' per square. And they gave the kids something to look at. And I know, all my OSR friends and readers are apoplectic right now. I know that I didn’t have the maps and miniatures back in the day and I did just fine with my imagination. My kids range from sixteen to eight and have varying degrees of concentration so I’ve found the miniatures and maps are necessary for now.
I also have to admit that I turned to what most consider to be an overused trope: the tavern meeting. Not having a lot of time to plan any kind of set up, I jumped to Digital Orc’s Inn Table. The percentile dice came out and rolled twice giving me The Putrid Wand, a less-than-reputable inn on the edge of the Thieves’ Quarter in Burlingbrook, the town at the base of Mt. Chal (my homebrew location for the dungeon in our Basic Game).
WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!! (And to my Players: this means STAY OUT.)
Cast of Characters
Lanin: elf wizard (16-year-old daughter)
Carn: human rogue (14-year-old daughter)
Regdar: human fighter (11-year-old son)
Dothal: dwarven cleric (8-year-old son)
The town’s mayor sought the party out to hire them to clear out a nest of bandits that was harassing the town. The bandits had been tracked back to their nest in a nearby set of ruins. What the PCs didn’t seem to realize that they were being used; the mayor didn’t think they were actually expert adventurers, but they were easily expendable. Or they might get lucky and rid the town of the bandits and it would only cost the town a piddling amount. Win-win, in the mayor’s mind.
Long story short: the kids learned a few things, hopefully. One thing they learned was not to split the party. The other thing was the value of cooperation. Because my two sons decided they’d rather go off exploring two different sections of the level by themselves, individually, Dothal, Regdar, and Lanin nearly died. They wound up exploring all but two rooms on the level and turned seven or eight encounters (including a random encounter) into three encounters by "activating" several encounters at one time. There was far too much going on at once. Chaos reigned. Foes were swarming the PCs from all directions. My oldest almost died from an attack of giant rats, as did my youngest son. My oldest boy almost died surrounded by a horde of skeletons. And the rogue couldn’t hit anything to save her life.
Lanin wound her way through the caverns and hallways to join Carn and Regdar, leaving Dothal to go back up to #4, then into #5, walking through the door and dead into the Level 1 boss--a brutal hobgoblin that dropped Dothal to his knees with one blow. Without any backup. The other three had no more than seven hit points between them.

They echoed the mantra of GOP moderates, stating the only way to political viability was through "comprehensive immigration reform."
What these analysts did not do was explore the messaging (Affordable Care Act)." Clinton, which "is a big dream of mine."
The Miami Herald's Marc Caputo noticed a lack of media attention. .Of all of the games previewed at E3 2011, BioShock Infinite caused the most excitement. At the show, the lengthy game demo was limited to press only; that's now changed, and you can enjoy the whole 20 minute video after the cut. Curious as to why so many lauded it as the best game at the show? Read on, gentle gamer, read on.
As the 20 minute GameTrailers clip shows, it's a combination of graphics prowess and the promise of immersive gameplay that has so many people enthused. Shifted away from the BioShock storyline we've seen to-date, Infinite takes place in a new setting and at a different time, with the main character - former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt - staging a rescue mission on the air-city Columbia made up of blimps and balloons.
BioShock Infinite is pencilled in for a 2012 release on Xbox 360, PS3 and Windows PC. No word on when, exactly, during the year it will launch, unfortunately, so for now you'll have to sate yourself with the video preview below. Let us know if you're sufficiently excited in the comments below!
[Thanks to everyone who sent this in!]Posted by Tara, Health & Specialty Sales
Hi! I’m Tara and I am a field sales representative here at Tom’s of Maine. Among the many reasons that I joined Tom’s was my passion for the environment and my desire to work for a company that shares this passion. Thankfully, Tom’s has a slew of strong environmentally friendly practices in place for making natural toothpaste, natural deodorant and other personal care products. Working for a company that “walks the walk” on this issue is really cool, and it inspires me to improve my own stewardship of the planet. With that in mind, I think it is time for me to make some changes for the better and this is the year to do it!
Chief among my 2012 green goals is to use less energy and the place I want to start is my home. Between appliances, the TV, the computer and various cell phone chargers, I am sure there is a lot of room for improvement. However, I am quickly realizing that I don’t know where all that energy goes I don’t know which of my gadgets and appliances are guzzling the most power and when my energy consumption is at its peak. I am a bit of a tech geek, so I was hoping I could find a good techie solution to help. A quick internet search showed me I was in luck.
One of the coolest tools that I encountered was from the company EnergyHub. This Brooklyn-based company makes a home energy management system. The starter kit + thermostat consists of an electric socket, power strip and a programmable thermostat, all of which communicate wirelessly with a home base, which is also included. A touchscreen display provides details about how much energy each device is using in real time, including your thermostat information. You can also use the home base to control the devices. Finally, the system can connect to the internet so that all that information can be accessed from a computer or mobile device or used to control the system remotely. That means you can actually turn off individual sockets when you are away from home. The remote feature is particularly handy if you are like me and have left the lights on more than once. The starter kit with the wireless thermostat seems a bit pricey at $399. EnergyHub does have other options that range in price depending on the components you choose.
In addition to complete solutions like the system from EnergyHub, there are several power monitors that can give you a birds-eye view of your home energy usage. The Energy Detective (TED) offers the TED 5000-G which connects to your electricity panel and is able to monitor up to 5 individual appliances. The system includes software which can be used to track your energy usage in real time and project monthly bills. You can also purchase individual electricity outlet monitors, like the Belkin Conserve Insight Energy Use Monitor. This gadget is handy if you just want to periodically check in on a certain device’s energy use, like a TV or microwave; and seems pretty cost effective at $29.99 per monitor.
These are just a few of the options available to help get a better handle on how much energy is used in the home. I haven’t used any personally yet, and can’t attest to how well the products work. I’m weighing my options about what to do next!

We won't get here anyway, either fixing the output or the internal inconsistent struct. If fixing the output, then just as this patch did, checking if the nodeset is set (this prohibit the case which doesn't set placement for internal struct - like setNumaParameters does, the current output formating code doesn't take it into consideration). If fixing setNumaParameters to set a placement even if 'placement' doesn't make sense for cgroup, we also can't get the 'else' branch. Fixing the output is
wrong if we have an earlier bug generating an inconsistent struct in the first place.
Agreed.
The fact that this bug existed shows that the test suite for the XML parser is incomplete. Please resubmit with an extra test XML datafile for the test suite to validate this scenario.I agree.we already has good enough XMLs for the test suite: % ls tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-numa qemuxml2argv-numad.args qemuxml2argv-numad-auto-vcpu-static-numatune.xml qemuxml2argv-numad-auto-memory-vcpu-cpuset.args qemuxml2argv-numad-static-memory-auto-vcpu.args qemuxml2argv-numad-auto-memory-vcpu-cpuset.xml qemuxml2argv-numad-static-memory-auto-vcpu.xml qemuxml2argv-numad-auto-memory-vcpu-no-cpuset-and-placement.args qemuxml2argv-numad-static-vcpu-no-numatune.xml qemuxml2argv-numad-auto-memory-vcpu-no-cpuset-and-placement.xml qemuxml2argv-numad.xml qemuxml2argv-numad-auto-vcpu-no-numatune.xml qemuxml2argv-numatune-memory.args qemuxml2argv-numad-auto-vcpu-static-numatune.args qemuxml2argv-numatune-memory.xmlThese may have used<numatune>, but none of them used it in the manner that would have been detected by round trip parsing.
Yeah. The reason for why I think the testing xml datafiles are enough is we considered nearly everything from parsing p.o.v. Ergo, we are
missing a test, either a test that invalid input data is rejected earlier on,
And the xml datafiles cover this. or a test that when input data omits information, then round
trip handing of that data doesn't get the output into an inconsistent state when it adds in the defaults for the omitted information.
Yes, we miss such a test. Which doesn't relates with the parsing, it's monodirectional from the API -> internal struct -> output. So no xml datafiles. That was why I didn't understand Daniel said xml datafile is needed.
The problem is we have two entries to change the numatune config, and they share the same XML syntax (btw, I was thinking it's a bad idea to do so, it could just cause crasy results).Which two entries are you thinking of?
One is libnuma, one is cgroup, so I meant the entries underlying. they use same syntax, different implementation, and for same driver. Which could just make things a mess. We should avoid design like this in future. Maybe it is a bad design
decision, but we're stuck with it, so we should at least support what we have documented.XML parser actually ensures the placement mode can be always set with either 'static' or 'auto', but API via cgroup don't set placement mode as placement is meaningless for it, so IMHO no need to add XMLs to test the parser, instead we need to add tests to test the API.The TCK is a great place to test the API.
Guess I forgot this apprently. :-) But maybe the real bug here
is that if you hotplug a request for a numatune and it goes through cgroup, then we should be updating the conf struct to reflect either static or auto, even though cgroup doesn't directly care, so that the output function then works in all cases.
So, think we get a consensus: Add the test in TCK, and defaults the internal struct so that it doesn't fall into inconsistence. I will go this way and post v3. Thanks for the opinions! Regards, OsierSurprising Celebrity Mugshots

33 Co-Stars Who Totally Hated Each OtherA Georgia jury went for serious damages against a blogger, and their fear of cyberspace played a role.
The note asked the judge to seize the notes [the defendant] had taken throughout the week-long trial.
"The judge appropriately denied the jury's request, but the note demonstrates in our view that the jury was being influenced during deliberations by their own fears, not just the evidence," [attorney Thomas M. Clyde] said. The defense considered the note an indicator of the jurors' "fears about the Internet."
One caveat: that was the defense attorney.
(via Steve Worona's Twitter) far, so good and I drive in serious stop and go traffic in the Bay Area.
My Kia does not have the build quality of a Honda, but I only paid $8000 for a fully loaded car. It was a demo car and had around 6,000 miles on it when I got it.
It's been a very reliable car with the exception of the brake problem, which hopefully is truly fixed. My only cost has been oil changes $25.00 average every 3,000 miles and the recent 30,000 mile service(Radiator Flush, Transmission Service, Oil Change, Air Filter, ETC.) which cost $300.00.
We will see once the warranty ends how things go.....
I concur with the majority on KIA's poor brakes & rotors, having to replace the pads and rotors every 3 - 4 months. Warranty or no warranty, on the 97' LS, it was a pain in the rear to be going back & forth to the dealer for something they clearly could not correct. Having a warranty is supposed to be an advantage for the customer, however there is NO advantage to the customer when the cotton pickin service/repairmen don't have a clue how to correct a problem.
Alas, after falling out of my warranty, KIA wanted to sock it to me, with charges to put on new rotors - don't think so. I want to inform everybody that I've put on new rotors allright, but not KIA rotors or pads.. I switched to WAGNER parts and have not had the reoccurrence of vibration, squeaking, grinding etc. that comes with worn/warped rotors.
There are some of you who are in position to get rid of your car (inspite of being upside-down in the loan), however I knew I could not afford to do that and found, so it seems, a way to hang on to the pitiful car until I can afford to get rid of it. I'm hoping to trade it in May 01' after having it for 4yrs.
Hoping this bit of information will give relief to some of the KIA owners out there!

Well, you have definitely come to the right website! However, this conference really isn't the best place to get the answers to your questions. Our focus here is on maintenance and repair issues for our members' existing vehicles.
Help with buying decisions can best be obtained in our other conferences, such as Sedans, Coupes (depending on the types of vehicles you are interested in) and Smart Shopper.
The best thing to do would be to enter the model names of the vehicles in which you are interested into the Topic Search feature on the left side of the page (one at a time). Then you can join existing discussions in our other conferences on all of the models that might interest you.
After you've made your purchase, if you have any maintenance issues or questions you can come on back to see us over here. :-)
Good luck.

Good Luck!
in the past, it started with a mild "chirpping" when you first depressed the brake. then, after a matter of time, the grinding would start. this time, however, the grinding started right away and sounds much worse than last time.
i've read through some previous posts and i see people saying that you have to treat these cars with a bit more "tenderness". i find this hard to believe. my sister is 36 years old and has never gotten a speeding ticket. she certainly isn't being too hard on this car. her last car was an 89 toyota tercel auto. she drove it for almost 12 years and it had 210,000 miles. she certainly didn't have to replace the brakes 3 times in the first 9 months of driving it!
i've taken notes from you guys as to what to ask the dealer to do to correct the problems and hopefully it will work this time.
Maybe they'll put their hands on your sister's car once more, twice, or whatever... I wouldn't be surprised if the brake problem continues on and on.
Get a peace of mind. Get a good mechanic on your own, a new good set of brake pads, rotors, and get the rear brakes adjusted. That, unless you guys get lucky and find a responsible and smart mechanic on your local dealership.
Good Luck.
After driving it for a few weeks when we stopped, it felt like the trans slipped. Well on 1-20-2001 we finally got an appointment to get the trans and the driver back power window looked at. on Sat. 1-20, we were told that they have not looked at it! So I called on Monday, they finally looked at it, and stated it was the rotors, and said that usually they would not service it for free but since we had low mileage 4100 miles, it would be free. (It better be free rotors going out within the first 5000 miles!!!) Then he tried to blame us for going up and down hills, and stop and go freeway traffic. BULL! This is a city car and little freeway use.. in a matter of fact we have been in bumper to bumper traffic once in this car and it was only for 2 miles.
Well today is 1-23, and we still don't have our car. I was told by the service center that they should have the part by tommrow and it should be fix also. In the meantime, I am still paying for partial of the rental, since Kia will not pay for the extra insurance (road hazard), nor did they want to pay for the rental in the first place. So we will see how long these brakes last. Any comments please e-mail me at anaconda@yahoo.com.

The 102-hour July Fourth holiday period began Wednesday at 6 p.m. and ended at midnight Sunday.
Last year, in just a 30-hour holiday period, there were two fatalities on Georgia highways during the July Fourth travel period.
The Georgia State Patrol said it investigated three of the fatal crashes that resulted in four of the fatalities.
Those were in Haralson, Jefferson, and Catoosa counties.
Meanwhile, local agencies reporting traffic deaths over the holiday period included Henry County Police, Atlanta Police, Fulton County Police, Carrollton Police, the Jones County Sheriff’s Office, and the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office.
Meanwhile, Georgia State Troopers investigated 785 traffic crashes statewide that resulted in 374 injuries.
In addition to crash investigations, state troopers arrested more than 300 people for driving under the influence.
Troopers also made more than 16,600 traffic stops.<<

Ob is unfortunate how the media is attempting to frame the recent protests in Egypt and Lybia as being fueled primarily by the youtube video "Innocence of Muslims" and nothing more. The truth of the matter is that there have been numerous videos on youtube and many other internet sights for years that have portrayed the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in equally negative and degrading ways. Yet these videos, which have been seen by Muslims around the world, did not spark the wave of anger and protest that was witnessed in the last several days. It seems that there has been some key information that has been overlooked (in my opinion intentionally) by reporters, the general public, and especially the professional commenters here in the Savannahnow community. For decades, and especially since the 9/11 attacks, American foriegn policy towards certain middle eastern nations has been intrusive to say the least . Time and time again America has violated international law to wage its endless war on terror. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan alone killed thousands of innocent men, women, and children and displaced millions more from their homes. These people were of all faiths and ethnicities not just Muslims. The war with Lybia was equally devestating resulting in the deaths of hundreds of innocent people and served to destabaliszed the entire region. Thus, this uprising has much more to do with the years of American violence towards and demonization of Muslim people and the Islamic faith as well as the devastating impact of America's thrust for regime change in the countries the gov. has labeled as the "axis of evil" than a mere distasteful youtube video. The next time you watch news footage of a the protests taking place pay close attention to what the people are really upset about. Better yet do some research on American foreign intervention in the middle east (and around the rest of the world) and get a better understanding of just how destructive and terroristic our nation has been to others around the world. Believe me when it comes to violence and terror no one does it better that the U.S. (e.g. Native American genocide, slavery, Heroshima, Nagisaki, Veitnam the list goes on) The protest that led to the unfortunate deaths of the four Americans in Bengahzi are deeply heartbreaking and troubling and the actions taken by the mob that killed them is unjustifiable. However, when placed in the context of all that has happened in that country in the last two years that was a direct result of American intervention I can't say I'm surprised. If anything, I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner. (As Salaamu 'alaikum wa rahmatulaah)..What is the difference between Polymorphism and SNP - (Dec/31/2011 )
What is the difference between Polymorphism and SNP? And because of which one of thez two, is responsible for diseases?
SNP is just one type of polymorphism and involves only one nucleotide. Any type polymorphiism can be associated with disease.
You should read this paper
DDLJ on Sat Dec 31 16:50:47 2011 said:
1. SNP is a type of polymorphism
2. polymorphism just means that the DNA is "different" due to a mutation for example, a base switch (T and not G for example at a certain place)
3. I think its clear that when you normally have GATC and due to a SNP you have all of a sudden AATC that this change in sequence can cause a disease..
(another example: take for example a SNP in a gene coding for a protein and because of this SNP you get a stop codon rather then a codon for an AA , then what happens? translation will stop and you will not form that protein.. result: disease (or not, its not always the worst case scenario ofcourse)
And that paper might help indeed.
each person has their own polymorphism .. although we are human but we are difference ....
SNP is the altheration in your genome seq. that may or may not be the cause of your disease
depend on where it occur and if it occur in coding seq. some ime it can change your amino acid or cannot...
and althoug it change your amino acid but if it not effect to the protein function it cannot cause the disease...
In the case ,SNP can cause disease such as sickle cell anemia....
remember that when the symptom or disease occue it mean that our body cannot control or cannot compensate to be the normal condition.....
Polymorphism originaly meant something that differs from person to person (or individuals within other species in general), and is considered normal and common. Like, there are known mutations, that are causes of diseases, cancer or so. These are not called polymorphisms, but causative mutations. And of course these are also rare. Sickle-cell anemia mutation would be hardly called SNP, at that time.
Many things can be polymorphic, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), repeat lengths, bigger sequence changes (insertions/deletions), immune system antigens and receptors... but they all need to be generaly present in population and not directly and clearly linked to a disease. (on the basis of highly polymorphic regions of short tandem repeats in genome is based the person identification and paternity testing, because no person has all of the regions of the same length).
So originaly SNP, was not connected to a disease.
However nowadays things get more complicated. As far as I now a sequence variant is considered a "real" SNP if there is some level of "commoness" in the population, like.. 5 %. But the more and more SNPs we know, we found out that many of them are actually associated with a disease (that means, that person with this variant is more likely to have a disease, than person without it, but there is no clear functional link, that this would cause the disease in 100 %, in in vitro model, animal models, etc.). As many of the diseases are caused by combination of factors (in reallity I would say all of them are) some SNPs may just help to develop a disease but can be pretty common at the same time.
Theory is, if some sequence variant is causing disease, the bearers are less likely to reproduce, so the frequency of the "bad" variant will be very low in population, selected out. Of course if the selection is not that hard, the variant not that often harmful or sometimes harmful sometimes even beneficial, the frequency in population could be even quite high, like those 5 - 10 % for example.
Of course, if someone was just screening people, he would initialy consider this variant a SNP, but later it can be found that it has a role in some pathology.
The more we know about cell systems, and the more genomes are we sequencing, the thin line between SNP (a "common" variant) and a causative mutation is getting more blurred. The SNP database for example, now hold every variation that was recorded from numerous whole genome sequencing studies, and there are variants or "mutations" there, that would be hardly considered either common or benign (like the rs77375493 entry, which is a causative acquired mutation, a direct cause of 98% of polycythemia vera, still... in a SNP database..).
So, to sum it up. Now it's really difficult to really specify what SNP is and what isn't. The original definition is depricated, since things become more complex. Some SNPs are considered just "one or other" variants, usualy when you have frequency around 50/50 and have no or very weak associations to anything, some could be very rare and with unclear connection to diseases. To even more complicate this, not only coding sequence variations can have some effect, variations in promoter, regulatory sequences, or just "some" regions we re not sure what function they have, these are usually called "functional SNPs".
Also it has been long thought, that coding sequence SNPs, that doesn't result in any change in the amino acid sequence (silent SNPs), are the "real" SNPs, having no effect at all.. seems this is not true 100%, it may doesn't have a direct effect on protein it codes, but differences in DNA (or mRNA) sequence, can have regulatory functions in addition, or higher succeptibility to mutation into differen variant or DNA damage or so. So some of these can be also "functional SNPs".
So probably now, every variant (single nucleotide) that's observed in person, is most likely to be called "SNP". But for some well established mutations, this is never actually used.
As time changes, today a SNP, causative agent tomorrow..
Thank you very much Brain on a stick
Slideshow: Who is Tom Brown?
I worked for Burr-Brown from 1988 until 2000 when Texas Instruments acquired Burr-Brown Corp. for $7.65B. I met Tom Brown many times, had discussions and dinners with him and he and his company helped make me the person and the engineer I am today.
I ask many people I know, younger than myself, what they know about Tom Brown. Many, many have said, "Who is Tom Brown?"
Well lest the newer generation forget about the man whose company put the first op amp on the moon in 1962 aboard the Ranger spacecraft; the man whose company made Texas Instruments the Analog giant it is today and the man who shaped the lives of so many people with whom he came in contact - let me show you in this slideshow, who Tom Brown is!
Burr-Brown was incorporated on May 8, 1956. Page Burr assumed the presidency and Tom.
In 1957 Tom's garage was getting quite crowded and they decided to rent an office on East Speedway for $125/month. By the end of 1957 sales had increased from $1,579 to $7,205 (over 356%), however, BBRC still suffered a net loss that year of $9,815.
January of 1958 brought even more bad news – the resignation of Page Burr. He left and started a new company in New York called Circuit Research Company. He felt he had accomplished his goals with Burr-Brown, stating that at the time he had "pooled his resources across the country" and that it was time to move on. Page turned in his stock and Tom assumed the role of president.
When Robert Page Burr, co-founder of the company, passed away on Thursday, December 31, 1998, the Board of Directors issued the following resolution:
"Whereas, in 1956, Mr. Burr recognized at the beginning that transistors inherently had the reliability of a "short piece of bare copper wire." He further observed that there was a broad market for small packaged circuits providing more complex functions. From that start Burr-Brown developed the first commercial solid-state operational amplifier. The basic market strategy identified by Mr. Burr has remained unchanged for the past 40 years."
The "Famous" Hobson Sample:
The famous "Hobson Sample" was named after Larry Hobson and it was often referred to for many years after Larry retired. It refers to a sample of one. It is conclusive. The Standard Deviation is zero. Once you start testing more than one unit in any experiment you begin to introduce errors and the results of the experiment can be inconclusive.
This started as a joke, but for many years, when an engineer would see the very first result of an experiment, he or she would say, "Based on a Hobson Sample it looks like the problem is solved!" This all started one day, in the early days of Burr-Brown, when the sales manager was pressuring Larry to solve a particular sticky technical problem. Larry told him, "I've only tested one unit, but it looks pretty good so far!" Larry was actually a very thorough engineer, and he would always test a sufficient sample size to show that a problem was solved statistically, but this term seemed to "stick" and Larry took it with a wry smile.
An article recently appeared on the University of Arizona ECE website about the dedication of the Thomas R. Brown Conference Room. Although the article reads very well, there is an inaccuracy that it is implied. One of the statements in the article says: Tom Brown "truly understood the importance of that type of partnership: in recruiting and retaining the best faculty, in being able to give financial aid to the best students, and in building programs."
Well, this is not entirely true. Tom was not really into philanthropy. Sarah (Brown) Smallhouse and Mary (Brown) Bernal and the other trustees of the Thomas R. Brown Family Foundation are very much into philanthropy. The next sentence is correct, "The Thomas R. Brown Foundations has endowed numerous professorships and student scholarships in the UA's College of Engineering, College of Science, and Eller College of Management."
Sarah's comment later in the article is also very true: "My father's success in business prospered because of the close relationship he developed with the UA. The UA gave Burr-Brown its competitive edge to rise to global excellence."
The bottom line is that Tom did understand the need to initiate a strong relationship with the University of Arizona in order to build a pipeline of talented engineers to build his company. The story being told in the conference room is certainly about Tom starting the company, but it is also about the many talented and innovative engineers that worked together with customers to develop creative solutions to problems in space exploration and medical imaging to digital audio, digital video and cell phones.
Tom's "quote panel" really summarizes this where he says, "While I take credit for founding the company, I do not deserve credit for its success" (see images to follow). Another important panel is the plaque on the outside of the room (also see images to follow). From my point of view, the purpose of the room is to inspire and motivate engineering students and professors to follow their entrepreneurial instincts, whether they start their own companies or join an existing company. It is to show how a company can work cooperatively with a university. Again, Tom said this pretty well in his quote.Also, I need to state that we could not include all of the talented & creative people at Burr-Brown in the panels. There was simply not room to include all of the great stories. Undoubtedly, this means that some will be disappointed or feel that we did not "tell the entire story".
The following are some of the large images on each wall of the conference room depicting the birth and growth of Burr-Brown Corp., courtesy of Paul Prazak, Senior VP, Burr-Brown Corp. who headed up this effort to dedicate a memorial room fitting for the legacy of Tom Brown.Epson FX-2180 Manual

If you often print on thick or heavy continuous paper, such as multi-part forms or continuous paper with labels, use a tractor in the pull position. The pull tractor provides the best paper jam prevention, and allows you to load continuous paper from the front, rear, or bottom of the printer. However, you cannot use the tear-off feature with the pull tractor.
Note: If you plan to use a pull tractor, you can remove the tractor from the front push position and install it in the pull position, or you can purchase the optional pull tractor (C800321) and install it in the pull position.
Paper Positions
Top-of-Form Position
The letters ABC above are printed at the top-of-form position. The top-of-form position is the position where the printer starts printing on a page of single-sheet or continuous paper.
Note: See page 4 for information on the printable area of your paper.
To improve continuous paper feeding and reduce paper jams, you can use the push and pull tractors in combination. This is especially helpful for printing on continuous pre-printed forms, multi-part forms, or labels, and for printing highquality graphics. The table below summarizes the paper paths available for printing on continuous paper.
Paper Path Front push tractor Front paper slot Description The paper path from the front slot is almost straight, which reduces the chance of paper jams. Use the front slot when you are printing on thick paper such as multi-part forms or continuous paper with labels.
Tear-off Position
Your continuous paper is in the tear-off position when the perforation is aligned with the printers tear-off edge, so you can easily tear off your printed document.
Rear push tractor Rear paper slot
Standby Position
Your continuous paper is in the standby position when it is attached to the tractor but not loaded in the printer.
When you print on multi-part forms that are bound on only one side by point gluing, load them onto the rear push tractor through the rear slot; the front push tractor cannot feed this type of form.
Pull tractor Front paper slot
Available Paper Paths
Printing on Continuous Paper
You can choose from three tractor positions (front push, rear push, and pull) and three paper entry slots (front, rear, and bottom) for continuous paper printing. If you often need to tear off sheets of continuous paper (for example, if you print purchase orders or sales slips), it is best to use a push tractor. This allows you to use the printers tearoff edge to easily tear off printed sheets of continuous paper at the perforation. Also, when continuous paper is loaded on a push tractor, you can load single sheets of paper from the paper guide without removing the continuous paper.
Pull tractor Bottom paper slot
The paper path from the front slot is almost straight, which reduces the chance of paper jams. Use the front slot when you are printing on thick paper such as multi-part forms or continuous paper with labels.
Because the bottom slot has the straightest paper path, it is ideal for printing on thick paper, such as multi-part forms or continuous paper with labels.
Note: When loading paper in the bottom slot, be sure to use a printer stand with an opening large enough so that the paper can feed through it without obstruction.
Pull tractor Rear paper slot When you print on multi-part forms that are bound on only one side by point gluing, load them onto the pull tractor through the rear slot; the printer cannot feed this type of form from the front or bottom slot.
The paper thickness lever is located under the printer cover. You need to set the paper thickness lever for the type of paper you are using, as shown in the table below.
Paper Type Ordinary paper (single sheets or continuous paper) Carbonless multi-part forms with: 2 parts (original + 1 copy) 3 parts (original + 2 copies) 4 parts (original + 3 copies) 5 parts (original + 4 copies) 6 parts (original + 5 copies) 7 parts (original + 6 copies) Thin paper Continuous paper with labels Envelopes Postcards Lever Position or 4 or 5 3
Rear push tractor Load paper printable side down.
Note: If the printing on the bottom copies of your thick multi-part forms is faint, turn on the double-strike mode as described in Chapter 2 of the Users Guide.
Make sure the left and right sprockets are positioned properly for your papers width. If they are too far apart or there is any slack in the paper, you need to move the sprockets. 1. If you are using the front push tractor, open the front paper guide and remove it. If you are using the rear push tractor, open the paper guide cover and remove the paper guide. 2. Open both sprocket covers. 3. Fit the first four holes of the paper over the sprocket pins (as shown above). Then close the sprocket covers.

4. If you are using the front push tractor, reattach the front paper guide and then close it. If you are using the rear push tractor, reattach the paper guide and close the paper guide cover. 5. Make sure the paper release lever is in the correct position.
Caution: Never press the Load/Eject or Tear Off/Bin button when printing on labels. When fed backward, labels can easily come off the backing sheet and cause a jam.
Switching to Printing on Single Sheets
You can easily switch from printing on continuous paper with a push tractor to printing on single sheets without having to remove or reload paper. Follow the steps below.
Removing the Printed Document From a Push Tractor
1. Make sure the Tear Off/Bin lights are flashing. (You may need to press the Tear Off/Bin button.) When the Tear Off/Bin lights are flashing, your paper is in the tear-off position. 2. Open the paper guide cover and tear off the printed document using the printers tear-off edge.
If continuous paper with labels is loaded in the printer, remove it before switching to single-sheet printing. If a tractor is in the pull position, remove any continuous paper from it before switching to single-sheet printing.
1. If any printed pages of continuous paper remain in the printer, press the Tear Off/Bin button to advance them to the tear-off position, and then tear them off.
Caution: Tear off your printed document before you press the Load/Eject button in the next step. Reverse feeding several pages at a time may cause a paper jam. Never use the knob to eject paper while the printer is on; this may damage the printer or cause it to lose the tear-off or top-of-form position.
2. Press the Load/Eject button to feed the continuous paper backward to the standby position. 3. Load single sheets in the top or front paper guide. 3. Press the Load/Eject button to feed the continuous paper backward out of the printer and into the standby position.
Caution: Make sure you tear off your printed document before pressing the Load/Eject button. Reverse feeding several pages at a time may cause a paper jam.
4. Set the paper release lever to the single-sheet position.
Switching to Printing on Continuous Paper
To switch from printing on single sheets to printing on continuous paper with the front or rear push tractor, follow these steps: 1. If a single sheet remains in the printer, press the Load/Eject button to eject it.
Caution: Never use the knob to eject paper while the printer is on; this may damage the printer or cause it to lose the tear-off or top-of-form position.
Removing Continuous Paper With Labels 1. Tear off the fresh supply of continuous labels at the perforation nearest the paper entry slot.

Adjusting the Top-of-Form Position
The top-of-form position is the position on the page where the printer will start printing. If your printing appears too high or low on the page, you can use the micro adjust feature to adjust the top-of-form position as described below.
Caution: Never use the knob to adjust the top-of-form position; this may damage the printer or cause it to lose the topof-form position. Note:
6. Press the Pause button to exit micro adjust mode.
Advancing the Paper to the Tear-Off Edge
If you use the front or rear push tractor, you can use the tearoff feature to advance your continuous paper to the printers tear-off edge when you finish printing. You can then easily tear off the printed document. As described below, you can use the tear-off feature in two ways: manually by pressing the printers Tear Off/Bin button, or automatically by turning on the auto tear-off mode. The Tear Off/Bin lights flash when the paper is in the tear-off position.
Caution: Never use the tear-off feature to feed continuous paper with labels backward; they may come off the backing sheet and jam the printer. Never reverse feed continuous paper loaded in the pull tractor using the Tear Off/Bin button; the paper may come off the pull tractor and jam the printer. using your software.
1. Make sure the printer is turned on and paper is loaded. 2. If you are using a push tractor, press the Load/Eject button to advance the paper to the current top-of-form position. 3. Open the paper guide cover and lift the printer cover up and off the printer. 4. Hold down the Pause button for about three seconds. The Pause light starts flashing and the printer enters the micro adjust mode. 5. Press the Load/Eject U and LF/FF D buttons to move the top-of-form position up or down on the page.
Using the Tear Off/Bin Button After the printer finishes printing your document, press the Tear Off/Bin button to advance the paper to the tear-off edge.
Note: If the Tear Off/Bin lights are flashing, the paper is in the tear-off position. If you press the Tear Off/Bin button, the printer feeds your paper to the next top-of-form position.
Advancing Paper to the Tear-Off Position Automatically To automatically advance your printed documents to the tearoff position, you need to turn on the auto tear-off mode and select the appropriate page length for continuous paper in the default-setting mode. For instructions, see Using the Default-Setting Mode on page 13. When auto tear-off is on, the printer automatically advances the paper to the tear-off position whenever it receives a full page of data or a form feed command followed by no more data. Adjusting the Tear-Off Position If your papers perforation is not aligned with the tear-off edge, you can use the micro adjust feature to move the perforation to the tear-off position. Follow the steps below.
Caution: Never use the knob to adjust the tear-off position; this may damage the printer or cause it to lose the tear-off position..
To adjust the top-of-form position for continuous paper loaded on the pull tractor, see the following example: First mark a point 6.5 mm (0.26 inch) above the papers perforation; then position the paper so that the mark is even with the top edge of the plastic ribbon cover. This gives you an 8.5 mm (0.33 inch) margin on the next page, meaning the printer starts printing 8.5 mm below the perforation. If you mark a point 5.5 mm (0.22 inch) above the perforation, you get a 9.5 mm (0.37 inch) margin on the next page.

Coolin’ Off
Casey Mitchell, F, West Virginia – Since returning from suspension, Mitchell has combined to shoot 2 for 13 for a total of 7 total points over his last two games.
Vander Blue, G, Marquette – I guess we can give the kid a break considering he’s a freshman, but after a promising start, Blue has faded away like the color of an old pair of jeans. He shot 1-9 against South Florida, and has scored a total of 6 points over his last five games. To be honest I really just want the chance to say, “You’re my boy BLUE!”, just once.
Peyton Siva, PG, Lousville – Just when Siva was starting to heat up, someone put tin foil in his microwave. Over his last three Siva’s turned the ball over 13 times and shot 5-22 from the floor, failing to score in double digits over his mini slump.
Top Five Most Important Role Players/Glue Guys
1. Corey Stokes, G, Villanova – Despite being a player who benefits from the creation of others, Stokes’ importance to his team can’t be emphasized enough. His ability to stretch the floor allows the better one on one guards like Corey Fisher and Maalik Wayns to work in space, playing right into Jay Wright’s approach which calls for his guards to attack. When Stokes' outside game is on, Villanova becomes awfully tough to beat.
2. Brad Wanamaker, G, Pittsburgh – If I was writing an infomercial selling the effectiveness of Brad Wanamaker, this is how it might sound…
“What can’t he do? 12 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists, shoots 39% from behind the arch and 47% from the floor! Anytime there’s a role that needs to be filled, just call on old Brad Wanamaker. Hurting on the boards? Call on Wanamaker! Lacking creativity and someone to make plays? Call on Wanamaker! Need a bucket? Call on Wanamaker! With a Wanamaker your team shouldn’t need help in any of the primary offensive categories! And if you call within the next 20 minutes, we’ll even throw in a defensive presence that averages over 1.5 steals per game, FREE! Every team needs a Wanamaker, so call now and get yours today!
3. Carleton Scott, F, Notre Dame – One of the more under appreciated role players in the conference, Scott brings toughness and efficiency to a finesse team that plays with a small margin for error. At 6’7 with a broad, strong frame, Scott does a great job of knocking down outside shots off curl plays, while shooting 49% from the floor, 39% from downtown and 88% from the line. He also blocks nearly two shots a game, making his presence known on both sides of the ball.
4. Justin Brownlee, F, St. Johns – A the jack-of-all-trades forward, Brownlee can knock it down from the outside, finish on the break or facilitate out of the post. He’s mobile and can run the floor, making him a great fit for Lavin’s uptempo offensive.
5. Jae Crowder, F, Marquette – Former JUCO player of the year, Crowder has made a name for himself wearing navy and gold. At 6’6 225 lbs, Crowder possesses a chiseled , wide frame that he uses to muscle away the weak under the glass. When he’s not posing as the Hulk under the boards, he’s knocking down shots from the outside, where he coverts an excellent 41% of his three point attempts. His ability to play inside/outside makes him a tough matchup for opposing forwards.
Weekly Thoughts
- Rutgers’ Jonathan Mitchell knocked in a 4 point play straight up Larry Johnson style to beat Villanova by 1. You couldn’t write an ending like that, unless you wanted it to sound like the most unrealistic, implausible, incomprehensible, Mighty Ducks-esque movie ending of all time.
- As a former Syracuse graduate, I have to say watching the Orange this season has almost been as painful as watching the Super Bowl halftime show.

BIG EAST!!!! BIG EAST!!!! BIG EAST!!!!South Texas College Starr County students and Rio Grande City Border Patrol Explorer Post No. 735 members Rubén Cantú, left, and Michael A. García were part of the RGC team that won the national Border Patrol Explorers competition last fall in Artesia, NM. Cantú is a Criminal Justice major at STC, while García is a welding student.
Discipline, dedication, and a whole lot of hard work goes into being the best of the best, and a pair of South Texas College Starr County students proved they have the right stuff last fall when they overcame a grueling four-day, 10-team competition in the sweltering New Mexico heat to win the Border Patrol Explorers competition held in Artesia.
The competition included real world law enforcement training skills such as obstacle course driving, marksmanship, and simulations.
“It’s a big honor, of course. It’s a real good feeling,” said STC Criminal Justice major Rubén Cantú. “The whole week you go through different training and it’s pretty hard, the weather is way different, it slows you down a lot, so that alone is a big challenge. At the end, to come out best of the best, it’s exciting and a great feeling.”
“It was a really big honor being the top of the top of the nation. It was a big eye opener” added STC welding student Michael García. “I’ve gotten a lot more discipline through the program and a better perspective about law enforcement because we are trained on all law enforcement, not just Border Patrol.”
Cantú, 19, and García, 20, belong to the Rio Grande City Border Patrol Explorer Post No. 735 and participated in the national competition alongside fellow members Glenda Araiza and Roel Villarreal.
“It’s a big eye opener because you get to see what it’s like at a Border Patrol Academy,” said Cantú. “You get a lot of years of training through this program.”
The Border Patrol Explorer Program works with the college and is for young adults aged 14 to 21 years old. However, the application process is the easy part. All potential members go through a rigorous background check and a full interview process in order to be accepted into the program. Recently, the RGC post received 139 applications, but Cantú and García said that only about 10 will make it.
“They show you what to do in various situations and it’s a lot of action, I love the program. It teaches you a lot of discipline,” explained García. “Whatever the military goes through, we go through. We have a PT program and it’s tough. It definitely separates the men from the boys.”
García joined the program when he was 14 and Cantú has been a member for three and a half years.
“Before I joined the program, I didn’t know what exactly it was that I wanted to do,” said Cantú. “I decided to try it out and I started seeing what it was that officers go through, and I liked it. You get to see the good and bad sides of law enforcement, and it helps you see if it’s for you. It’s a very different experience.”Best Schools in Delco

Replacing the firm of Kiffin, Kiffin & Orgeron
There is a new lawyer in Knoxville. He arrived just a few weeks ago and set up shop in the offices formerly occupied by the firm of Kiffin, Kiffin & Orgeron. The new lawyer is Derek Dooley. Born and raised in Athens, Georgia, Mr. Dooley attended the University of Virginia where he was a member of the Varsity Debate Team. He was also a walk-on member of the school's intercollegiate football team.
After graduating from the University of Virginia with honors, he matriculated at the University of Georgia Law School. Not only did he matriculate, he also attended classes, took exams, and obtained his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree.
And then he did something that proves he is really smart. He married a doctor.
After passing the Georgia bar exam on his first sitting, and after being approved by the Georgia Bar Moral Fitness Committee, he was sworn in as an attorney before the Georgia Supreme Court. On hand for his admission ceremony was his father, who had recently retired after a long career as an employee of the University of Georgia.
Thereafter, Dooley practiced law for two years as a litigator with the law firm of Nelson, Mullins, Riley & Scarbrough in their offices in Atlanta. In this capacity, he did the glorious work of a litigation associate, including answering interrogatories, Bates-stamping documents, and sitting next to old geezer partners at depositions and hearings.
After two years of private practice, Mr. Dooley decided to leave this glamorous lifestyle and pursue a new career in the field of education. Following in his father's footsteps, he obtained a position at Louisiana State University where he worked closely with a senior staff member named Nick Saban. His job title was "recruiting coordinator." In this capacity, he worked closely with Mr. Saban to try to persuade fine young people to enroll at Louisiana State University, provided they could meet that institution's rigorous admission standards.
He then left Louisiana State University after obtaining a senior staff position at the Louisiana Technical University. His work at "La Tech," as it's known to Cajun engineers, was similar to the work he performed for Mr. Saban at Louisiana State University, as he tried to recruit outstanding high school students (primarily very large young men) to matriculate at Louisiana Technical University and, perhaps, to engage in some of the fine extracurricular activities offered by that institution of higher education.
In January, a position came open in Knoxville, after the fairly rapid departure of the aforementioned Kiffin, Kiffin & Orgeron. Members of that firm reportedly fled Knoxville in the middle of the night, and headed to California. They even tried to take some of the firm's best clients with them. Attorney Dooley was then contacted by the noted placement firm of Hamilton & Haslam who persuaded him to move his practice. Hamilton & Haslam had contacted highly respected professionals in Austin, Texas, Durham, North Carolina, and several other cities before landing Mr. Dooley.
Mr. Dooley has been pretty busy since starting his practice in Knoxville just a few weeks ago. His first job was to contact a number of University of Tennessee students who had formerly been represented by Kiffin, Kiffin & Orgeron, to see if he could take over their cases. This was a difficult task given that the firm of Kiffin, Kiffin & Orgeron had called a number of these students, told them not to attend class, and suggested they move to California.
Mr. Dooley then had to quickly work to develop his own client base. In this regard, he faced stiff competition not only from the Los Angeles office of Kiffin, Kiffin & Orgeron, but also from the Saban Firm in Alabama and the Meyer Firm in Florida, although there were some reports that the senior partner of the Meyer firm was considering retirement.
As if all this wasn't challenging enough, Mr. Dooley now faces a very vigorous fall trial schedule. He currently has 12 trials scheduled in the three-month period from September through November. And he could have more if any of his clients get arrested.
I haven't met Mr. Dooley, but I am pulling for him. I even plan on attending several of his trials this fall.

The contemporary hut is in Brazil and designed by Fabio Galeazzo. I have no idea if it’s custom or how much it costs. I’m a sucker for bold lighting and once I started building I knew I had to find a way to recreate it. My major problem was the lack of resources. Had I been in Idaho I could have found large lanterns at a dozen stores. They needed to be quite big so shipping was out of the question.
Eventually I found these outdoor solar lanterns at Target. They measure 13.38 ” H ; x 13.38 ” W x 12.75 ” D and cost $30. I knew I would need quite a few which quickly added up but because I had tried using so many other things that just weren’t quite right I bought the four they had in stock. I bought three more as they got them. They come in brown and black and I bought both so I would have enough.
I wasn’t able to remove the “candle” from the lantern to paint it. So I molded tin foil around the candle and used a metallic gold spray paint to transform the mismatched lanterns. Tin foil works great for drawer pulls or door knobs too. To hang them I simply wrapped a aesthetically pleasing rope around the roof line beam and tied knots around the lantern handel.
As I mentioned before these were solar lights and since this was an indoor fixture and the solar panel was adhered to the lid of the lantern I couldn’t salvage that part. It was a little heartbreaking removing the solar batteries and drilling a hole through the actual panel but it had to be done. Next I bought some cool patio lights for $20 at Target as well and popped them through the holes that I drilled. I spray painted the cord gold so it would blend in with the rest of the fixture. Now all I had to do was place the now connecting lids on top of the lanterns.
I put and outlet box on the other side of the bedroom wall near the ceiling. I ran the patio lighting cord up to the beam and across the top where it plugs into the outlet. It works much like a 1970′s house where it was vogue to not have ceiling fixtures and everyone used lamps and the light switch powered the wall outlets. My outlet is just on the ceiling instead so the fixture is not hardwired but still plugs in. The light switch is above the nightstand so you can turn them off in bed.
Once I had them hung over the bed I didn’t like seeing the little screws and hardware so I found some little craft mirrors for a couple dollars and used liquid nails to adhere them to the bottom.
I’m so happy with the result. My total for the 7 lanterns, rope, patio lights, spray paint and mirrors was $251.00. Not really what I consider cheap but for such a unique statement fixture I think it was worth it. My cell phone camera can’t capture it but the way they light up the house at night is absolutely stunning!
I’m impressed!! Sometimes having the right look is worth the price!
Thank you for all the awesome information! I found the blog a few weeks ago while researching Big Island tiny homes!
Amanda in Oahu
Oh great do you plan on building one or buying?
I’m hoping to buy one. I’m undecided between a piece of land and a very basic structure I can sleep in or a small house that would suitable to rent on airbandb or vrbo.com
Both option have their pros / cons . I’m leaning more towards the land and ultra basic structure i don’t have to worry about keeping filled.
I get that. I travel for work for months at a time and people always ask why I don’t rent out my Idaho tiny house. I like having a space that is just mine filled with the things that I love and it’s very personal to me. So renting it just isn’t worth the money. I knew the Hawaii house was going to be less about me and more about having a place for friends and family and I designed it as such.
Are you currently renting the Hawaii TH??
It is for rent! I can’t wait to start having guests mid October 2014 you can check out the listing on airbnb here
Absolutely beautiful.
Thank you Amy
Will you give us a $. breakdown on your Hawaii treehouse ? also info on lessons learned etc?
Hey Brandi, I have an article in tiny house magazine next month I’ll be sure to post it.
I love the fixture and your Hawaii treehouse. I just found your blog from a post on facebook. I am trying to convince my husband to go tini or atleast small…..its a work in progress. Is your treehouse for rent? Perhaps with such a lovely example I would have a better shot at convincing him. Great Job.
Thanks Brandi! The treehouse is for rent starting this fall/winter at luck with the hubby its baby steps
Kristie, I love the Hawaii house!! I have a few questions, when you built did you need a permit? And when you bought the property how did you do the closing without going there? This is something I want to do but I have so many questions. Thanks
Hey Robin,
So in most of the country you don’t need a permit if your structure is under a certain size (usually 200 sq ft.). It’s considered a temporary structure. Mine is about that size however building unpermitted on the Big Island is a lot more commonplace than the mainland.
I saw the property on craigslist and called on it immediately. I ended up talking to the seller for quite some time and although I had a good feeling about him I checked out some things online to make sure he was real. He suggested using a law firm to make everything legal and I did my research on them too. It ended up costing several hundred dollars for them to do the paperwork but I felt better about the transaction that way. I should also mention that the seller wasn’t living in Hawaii he was in Illinois and I was in Idaho ha!
Thank you!! My goal is to move there within the next year, I found a lot in the Kaohe Homesteads that I would love to have. I would love to build a tiny house.ray, Rayeesa; Saleem, Sheikha; Afroze, Dilb; Yousuf, Irfana; Gulnar, Azharaa; Laway, Bashirc; Verma, Sawana
Introduction: Hypertension is a major health problem with widespread and sometimes devastating consequences. To confirm the role of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension, many studies have been conducted. As no data in this regard are available from our part of the world, our study focuses onestablishing the role of insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia in the hypertensive Kashmiri population.
Materials and methods: The study was carried out at a tertiary care hospital from December 2010 to October 2012. A total of 100 individuals aged above 18 years were recruited; 50 were newly detected cases of essential hypertension and 50 were age-matched and sex-matched normal healthy individuals. Serum insulin concentration was measured using an insulin electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Insulin resistance was determined by HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance). A comparison and contrast analysis of data was carried out using standard statistical methods.
Results: Statistically, the difference in mean fasting blood glucose between the two study groups was significant (P=0.0001). The mean fasting serum insulin level was 15.32±13.76 µU/ml in cases and 8.01±4.08 µU/ml in controls (reference range 2.6–24.9 µU/ml); the difference was statistically significant (P=0.001). The mean value of HOMA-IR in cases was 3.81±3.42 as compared with controls with a mean HOMA-IR value of 1.76±0.93. This difference was statistically significant (P=0.0001).
Conclusion: Essential hypertension is significantly associated with higher mean fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia has a possible role in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension with insulin resistance being the likely predominant mechanism.insulinemia, hypertension, insulin

What does it mean to be a Catholic and Dominican college? We invite you to explore this question and the distinctive mission of Providence College.
About Providence College's Catholic and Dominican IdentityBOSTON -- The Massachusetts Democratic Party filed a complaint with the Federal Election Com mission Demo cratic Party Chairman John Walsh. By law, candidates’ campaigns are not allowed to coordinate with independent groups aligned with them.
As evidence of that coordination Walsh pointed to a report in The Boston Globe that Brown met with Rove at a Tampa hotel restaurant during the Republican National Convention in Florida.
Walsh said the campaign’s explanation "doesn’t pass the smell test."
"Just as Brown starts slipping in the polls, Rove’s robocalls appear," Walsh told reporters Friday. "Even if they didn’t specifically discuss the robocalls, it’s still illegal for Scott Brown if he was materially involved in the content which coincidentally echo some of Scott Brown’s favorite false attacks on Elizabeth Warren."
According to FEC records, Cross roads GPS spent nearly $25,000 this week on the calls.
The FEC complaint included transcripts of two of the calls.
One says Warren was "hired to oversee" the "Wall Street bailout."
Warren headed the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, charged with monitoring the Treasury Depart ment’s handling of the bank rescue fund. The panel wasn’t involved in distributing the funds.
A second call says Warren supports President Obama’s decision to cut over $700 billion from Medicare spending that could "limit the availability of care seniors depend on."
The cuts don’t affect Medicare recipients directly, but rather reduce payments to hospitals, health insurance plans and other service providers..
The complaint says that a "mere four days after Ms. Warren and Mr. Trumka’s joint campaigning, the AFL-CIO announced that it would launch a direct mail campaign attacking" Brown. The complaint described the mailings as "a prohibited in-kind contribution."
One AFL-CIO mailing said Brown voted for corporate tax cuts, jobs overseas and benefit cuts -- charges that the campaign has called false.
Brown did vote against a Democratic bill that would have extended tax cuts for millions of Americans while ending them for wealthier taxpayers.
But Brown also voted against a GOP measure would have continued tax cuts for everyone, including the highest earners. Brown said he opposed the GOP bill because it would have let lapse tax credits backed by Democrats to help some large working families, families with children, and families looking for help covering college costs.
Democratic party spokesman Matt House called the Republican complaint an attempt to "attract attention away from Scott Brown’s potential coordination with Karl Rove."Locals I Love – Corinna ‘Coco’ Matthes
Locals I Love is back, this time I interviewed someone I personally know very well who has recently taken the plunge to move her whole life to Florence, Italy from Berlin, German. Have you ever met one of those souls who are just amazing and almost divinely meant to be in your life? Coco is one of those people for me, she has been there for me for all of my own Florentine ups & downs and even showed me around Berlin a few years ago, such a sweetheart! She took some time to answer my questions {and gave some great advice} and without further ado, let’s get to know my German schwester aka sorella.
Important details
Name: {Corinna Matthes (a name that I’ve nearly forgotten, because everybody accept my mum calls me Coco)
Nationality: German
Work: Receptionist (& more) in a very cute B&B, Villa Landucci.
How she describes herself: creative mind, photographer
Favorite Drink: Everything with Tequila and of course un bel Cappuccino 😉
How long have you lived in Florence and where are you from originally.
Let’s start with the easier part of your question: I’m originally from Germany, just refer to this famous quotation of J.F.Kennedy: “Ick bin ein BERLINER!”, I’m a 100%, a Berlin girl, from the eastern part of Berlin (for the ones who are interested in history) and it wasn’t simple for me to leave this beautiful city behind me.
My first time in Florence was in 2000 during a school trip… seven years later I decided to return to this little Italian town for my studies with the help of the ERASMUS-Program. This period changed my whole life…I met the man of my dreams, also fell in love with Firenze and the Italian Culture (including the divine FOOD & WINE) in general and after having finished my studies at Berlin I finally moved to Florence this year! So you could call me an “old Newbie”
I think many can relate to what brought you here and Berlin is such an amazing city, I can see why it would be hard to leave! What brought you to bella Firenze and why did you decide to stay?
I always wanted to live abroad, don’t ask me why but since I was 12 years old I was dreaming about that, sul serio! Why I have chosen Firenze was because of its beauty and history that is hidden behind every angle. My first impression of Florence was the breath-taking view from Piazzale Michelangelo and every time I go up there I fall in love again and again. I decided to stay because my future-husband lives here (after nearly 5 years of long-distance relationship, I’m so fed up with this ‘there and back’ lifestyle all the time, bastaaaaaaa!!!) and also because my Italian is at least at this moment better than his German 😉
I was there when you two meet, sweet memories! What are you up to in Florence? Work, daily life, passions?
How I just mentioned above, I work in a very cute Bed & Breakfast, Villa Landucci, in Florence for a fantastic woman Debora – the owner of this little gem. I started to work there only one month ago and I love it! You cannot imagine how much you have to do to run even a tiny B&B with only 5 rooms.
Everyday you meet new wonderful people from all over the world which are your guests for a few days and you could help them get to know Florence a little bit better. I love to help people, you can ask everyone who knows me, but sometimes I’ve learned – you have to be more selfish and care about yourself every once in a while.
When I need some time to myself, I just escape into the Tuscan hills with my camera in my purse and take a long walk with some hopefully beautiful views. But don’t think that I’m an antisocial person, I’m the opposite! I love to hang out with friends & my new italian family. I love to cook and especially I love to make desserts (like cakes, cookies, muffins, traditional italian dolci ecc.), you could call me the “Queen of Sweetness” 😀
I am so happy for you and I can personally attest to your ‘dolce’ making ability. Ps. My birthdays in July ;-). What annoys you about Florence? Tell me the truth!
I don’t want to claim that everything isn’t how I’ve expected it by comparing it to my experience in Berlin, because that wouldn’t feel right or fair! But there are still some things that I cannot manage with my German mentality. I will only say: Florentine bus drivers and the public transport in general, disorganization in all kind of situations and a lack of bicycle paths and wide sidewalks in the city. But don’t forget that I love ITALY, especially Florence!!
Do you think life in Italy is for everyone? Why does it work for you?
Starting a new life in Italy is definitely not for everyone. You have to have “palle” [Italian word for balls] and a lot of patience to survive here! When I first got to Florence, I experienced a total culture shock…I thought people on the streets were fighting just because they were talking to each other so loud that everyone could hear them, instead they were talking about the bad weather or about the annoying neighbour that doesn’t clean the stairs like he should. Another lesson I had to learn was to spend nearly 30% of my life running from one office to another because in Italy in general the word “organisation” isn’t part of the vocabulary. But however living in Florence does work for me because I love challenges and I’m very open-minded and also a little bit crazy…Which you kind of have to be
We are so alike its scary ;-). I thought my Italian ex-boyfriend parents were constantly arguing but instead they were just talking about food or whatever. Hilarious! What advice would you give a newbie?
I would say: Don’t have too high of expectations if you really want to live here because I’m sure you would be a little bit upset about the reality of italian life in Florence. It’s not always the famous “dolce vita”, instead it’s really hard to find a well-paid job, an acceptable apartment with an affordable rent that you don’t have to share with 5 other people. But if you really have the dream to live in Italy/Florence once, you can do it, you only have to go through a really hard-working process to fix everything in your new home-town and don’t forget that you will miss your family and friends that you leave behind…I know that all too well.
But don’t worry you will make new friends who will become your “family” in Florence!! Maybe the first time you could come to Florence try doing a language course. By the way, according to my experience, knowing ITALIAN is a very important aspect for your permanent stay in Florence, especially for finding a job and making (italian) friends 😉 So, what are you waiting for??
Three finds/places everyone should know about in Florence?
That’s a really difficult question, because there are so many places in Florence you should check out!
a) One of my favourite Cafés is “La Cité” in Borgo San Frediano, 20! Here I had the best Hot Chocolate in Italy and while sipping your hot or cold drink you could read a book out from their library, play any kind of game or simply listen to their chill music.
b) If you are searching for a breath-taking view far from the tourist crowds at Piazzale Michelangelo than take the bus number 7 directed to FIESOLE and have a 10-minutes-walk up to the monastery of San Francesco. It isn’t only a good work-out but the silence and peace you feel up there together with the wonderful view over Florence and the Tuscan hills are totally ‘affordable!’
c) One of my favourite places in Florence is “Piazza Santa Croce” and its beautiful church. Here you can sit on stone benches and have your afternoon snack while observing tons of people crossing the piazza and taking pictures. I love to do that all the time, especially when the sun is out and shining.
Brava Brava Brava, couldn’t have said better myself! What’s the weirdest thing you have seen/experienced in Italy?
My only answer is: an invitation for a glass of red wine that ended up in a weird foot-massage…if anyone wants to know details…just…please…don’t ask…I don’t want to remember myself.
I think you just made my day {and week} with that answer, I love you Coco! What can you do here and nowhere else?
You can decide at 11p.m. to eat a delicious ‘bombolone’ or ‘cornetto alla crema’ if you know the secret bakeries in town which work all night long 😉 — in fact, I would work there too, if I could take my 10 pastries for free at home to have a long breakfast.
How did you make friends and assimilate?
My first year in Florence I made many international friends through the Erasmus-program, going to parties, events or even by searching for a room! I get to know my better half on one of the best birthday-parties hosted by a crazy but very nice English guy (A big “Thank you” to Ben for the invitation!!!). In addition I have to recommend the events of YELP (the community-manager of Florence is our wonderful Kristina), a very interesting organisation in Florence where you can meet wonderful people from all over the world and try so many new locations (pubs, restaurants, gelateria, shops etc.), just check out their homepage!
I also started to take part of a very nice GOSPEL CHOIR directed by the fabulous Nehemiah H. Brown and met so many wonderful people who love to sing, like me, and transport a message to the crowd through their music. By the way, we are desperately looking for locations where we can organize our concerts without paying any kind of contribution or rent, so don’t hesitate to contact me, also if you want to join us à our rehearsals are every Wednesday starting at 8 p.m. at a small ‘circolo’ in the area of Firenze Rifredi.
Favorite food {or recipe}.
I love food in general…and that’s also one reason why I’m in Italy because here you have the best food in the world referring to the favourite phrase of my future father-in-law: “Come si mangia in Italia, non si mangia da nessuna parte!”.
Besides Italian food (favourite: FAGIOLI ALL’UCCELLETTO) I also love Indian dishes (Favourite: CHICKEN CURRY with Naan bread), the spicy Thai Cuisine (Favourite: TOM KHA GAI) and sometimes also SUSHI, especially the California Roll, yum!
If you had to make up a tagline for the city – what would it be? 😉 be creative!
My dear Florence, you might be tiny, but you have sooooo much to offer!

Great sweater.
On a side note – I like how he photos his prints – On his last print, the leaving music, he photographed it the same. I then went a sorted a frame (thank you American framers for saving me $$$) that was the same to the photo- the wood surround in a light grain…. it looks great.
I bought a poster of him, but have not received it.
he is ignoring my emails and when I “contacted” him by posting a comment on his flicker account he just deleted it.
others are having the same problems, and i would strongly advice people to not buy anything from him, as you may very well not get it..
Same problem as Print Monkey. Me and a guy at work both purchased from his store on his website on July 10th. No print. Will not return emails. Lame.
same problem. i ordered back in june and have yet to receive anything. ive emailed a bunch of times but he generally doesnt respond. he responded once a few months back, and said the poster was on its way. but still nothing, and he hasnt returned subsequent emails. really lame considering the fact that he managed to deduct money from my paypal account very quickly and efficiently.
come on Felix….speak up man. You are taking peoples money and giving them nothing. You respond right away when someone emails you to order something. So I know your email is still up and running. But if we email about placed orders you ignore it. You sent an email saying it was being shipped like 1 1/2 months ago. Dudes, karma is gonna get you. You make great art and steal from people. You have a website with a store. You deduct cash from paypal super fast and send no product. And stangly enough the transaction mysteriously disappeared from my paypal history.

CMS, accreditation organizations and state boards of pharmacy continue to focus on medication order review by pharmacists before medications are administered to patients to ensure safety. Hospitals are challenged to provide this prospective pharmacist review because of limited pharmacy hours and the reallocation of pharmacy staff to training programs for meaningful use technologies.
To address this situation, remote pharmacy services provide a cost-effective and practical alternative to ensure pharmacists’ prospective clinical order review. As remote medication order processing services have evolved, various remote models are now available for hospitals to evaluate. At the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists Mid-Year Conference in Las Vegas, Cardinal Health will sponsor “Positioning Remotely Delivered Pharmacist Care in Small and Rural Settings” on December 2, 2012, from 1:40 to 2:40 p.m. This session will address the remote order processing models used today and strategies for evaluating how to position each model to meet the pharmacy’s needs while meeting regulatory and state board compliance requirements, which vary state to state.

The move toward integrated, multidisciplinary cancer centers is one of the most notable trends in cancer care today. A study from the University of North Carolina, for instance, showed that, when reviewed by a multidisciplinary tumor board, 38 percent of 269 consecutive patients with an outside diagnosis of GU cancer had changes made to diagnosis or treatment plans.
Radiologists and radiation oncologists increasingly collaborate across the continuum of care—from diagnosis to treatment. Listen to Dr. Charles White and Dr. John Sue as they provide an overview of the advantages of taking a multimodality and multidisciplinary approach to cancer care and identify the many ways these two disciplines are collaborating to more effectively design and deliver individualized care. Watch the on-demand webcast, “Radiologists & Radiation Oncologists: A Multidisciplinary Approach,” presented by John Suh, MD, Gamma Knife Center, Brain Tumor and Neuro-Oncology Center, Cleveland Clinic; and Charles S. White, MD, University of Maryland School of Medicine.
By all accounts, integrated care holds the promise of better outcomes, improved patient quality of life and lower costs. However, with the cancer patient population expected to grow by some 1.6 million new cases in 2012 in the U.S. alone, clinicians and administrators face not only the task of integrating care, but the need to expand facilities and services—all while improving quality and containing costs. Clinical advances alone are insufficient to confront the challenges of providing and managing value-based oncology services. These are daunting challenges, even for organizations with ready access to financial and professional resources.
Based on these insights, Philips has partnered with leading oncology solutions providers and created the Cancer Center Program to address both the clinical and business challenges of multidisciplinary care.
If you are planning a new cancer center or expanding existing service lines, you can learn more about how this powerful coalition of alliances and services can help you in the areas of cancer center strategic planning and development, business model alignment, operational and legal structuring, capitalization, financing and more by contacting Randy Sklar, vice president, Cancer Center Program, at (561) 596-5808.

The Power of ConvergenceChildren's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.—a 303-bed, Level 1 pediatric trauma center serving a three-state area—found itself with many state-of-the-art systems that could not communicate with each other. In fact, after investing significantly in a new human resources (HR) system, hospital leaders realized they could optimize their investment and make strategic strides forward if the new technology could connect to other systems within the hospital.
Children's National Medical Center turned to its long-time partner Ingersoll Rand and its Nverge Enterprise System Manager to bring convergence to the hospital’s disconnected technologies. Ingersoll Rand worked with Children’s National Medical Center management, physical security and IT teams to implement Nverge and optimize the connection between the organization’s new HR system, its existing access control system, and the time and attendance system.
For Children’s National Medical Center, one of the major benefits of the Nverge implementation has been the reliability and integrity of data. Because the flow of information is automated, the possibility of error and duplication that results from manual data entry is drastically reduced.
With its enhanced connectivity, Children's National Medical Center has realized costs savings while increasing staff productivity. In fact, system integration using Nverge has reduced data entry hours by 50 percent and data entry errors by 70 percent.

“While the long-standing Gallup trend shows biblical literalism as ebbing, the new question indicates that the percentage of Americans taking the Bible literally is even lower, at 22%, when respondents are offered more alternatives. Still, the 78% who agree with one of the three statements linking God’s word to the Bible using the four-part question nearly matches the 75% choosing one of the two statements affirming God’s role in the three-part question — underscoring the validity that three in four Americans consider the Bible holy to some degree.”
Protecting Faculty Records.”
Saying that high-quality scholarship is a “collaborative process” involving peer review at every level – not just at the finished product – the statement continues: “These onerous, politically motivated, or frivolous requests may inhibit the very communications that nourish excellence in research and teaching, threatening the long-established principles of scholarly research.”
Carole Goldberg, a professor of law and vice chancellor of academic personnel at ULCA, is co-chair of the joint Academic Senate-Administration Task Force on Academic Freedom, which drafted the statement. She said that no particular incident at UCLA had inspired the statement, but that faculty and administrators wanted to “get ahead of the curve” on academic freedom and scholarly communications, in light of several high-profile incidents in at other public institutions in recent years.
The University of Virginia, for example, in 2010 faced records requests over the work of a former professor, Michael Mann, now a distinguished professor of meteorology at Pennsylvania State University. The requests were filed by Kenneth T. Cuccinelli Virginia’s then-attorney general, regarding Mann's research on climate change. Cuccinelli, a Republican, repeatedly expressed doubts about Mann's research and about climate change. The Virginia Supreme Court has upheld the professor’s privacy, but many academics felt that the query was an attempt to intimidate scientists involved in controversial research, not a legitimate request for information to protect the public interest, as intended by various public information laws at the state and federal level. Emails, they said, don’t paint the full picture of their work and can easily be taken out of context. The American Association of University Professors, the Union of Concerned Scientists and other civil liberties groups backed the University of Virginia as it attempted to deny the attorney general’s probe. (Additional higher education groups supporting Mann released an amicus brief against forced scholarly disclosure last month, in a separate but similar query into Mann’s research brought by a conservative group. The case was heard last week in Virginia Supreme Court.)
Also, in 2011, a Republic operative in Wisconsin requested all emails concerning certain key words, such as “union,” and “recall,” sent by William Cronon, a professor of history, geography and environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Cronon had been publicly critical of Gov. Scott Walker, an anti-union Republican who faced a recall election, and the professor’s supporters said that the request for information was an attack on his academic freedom.
Like the University of Virginia, Wisconsin publicly supported a professor who said he was under threat from politically-motivated public information requests (it said it would not release “private email exchanges among scholars that fall within the orbit of academic freedom and all that is entailed by it.”) But neither university had a standing policy on such requests.
Most recently, in November, 30 faculty members at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill signed a letter in support of their colleague, Gene Nichol, director of the UNC School of Law's Center on Work, Poverty and Opportunity, as he faced a request to review all email correspondence and other communication records during a six-week period this fall. "Surveilling a professor's communications is a really troubling approach to protecting liberty," they wrote in response to the request from the Civitas Institute, a private organization promoting liberty and conservative ideals in North Carolina, according to its website. Nichol had recently been publicly critical of the state's then-governor, Pat McCrory, a Republican.
Goldberg said the UCLA statement is meant to proactively address what’s public and private information, in the interest of preserving academic freedom (She denied that statement was drafted in response to public information requests from animal rights groups that historically have targeted UCLA for criticism for research concerning animal subjects). It’s the first in the nation to release such a statement, she added.
The task force document lists five principles essential to that collaborative process, and therefore meriting protection: “frank exchange” among scholars; ongoing peer review; that topics “relevant to society” may elicit “strong reactions” (its lists climate change as an example); inter-institutional collaboration; and that teaching and research are carried out according to discipline-specific professional and ethical commitments.
It says that clarity as to what is and is not a public record is “essential” to the academic enterprise, and that the university must – consistent with the “letter and intent” of public records law – do its “utmost” to protect:
- The system of peer review “at all levels.”
- The right of faculty to choose topics and research areas based on “intrinsic criteria,” even those which are potentially controversial or unpopular.
- Academic freedoms for UCLA faculty that are afforded to academics working at private universities or corporations.
- “Longstanding” traditions of ethical and professional codes of conduct.
“The threat to faculty of forced disclosure of scholarly communication through [public information] requests can damage intellectual freedom and interfere with robust scholarly communication,” the statement concludes. “The proper forum for evaluating and vetting academic research is through the time-honored and rigorous process of peer review.”
The statement also notes that such requests can be time-consuming for faculty and other personnel; requests can often yield thousands of applicable documents, containing requested key words. UCLA did not immediately respond to a request for how many public records requests regarding scholarly communications it has received in the last year.
Along with its statement, released to faculty Monday in an email from Chancellor Gene D. Block, the task force published a faculty resource guide for dealing with public information requests. It says that UCLA, as a public institution, is a subject to the California public records act and must disclose written records “relating to the conduct of the public’s business,” with certain exemptions. But it cautions faculty against responding to such requests on their own and directs them instead to an on-campus records office for assistance. Goldberg said the resource guide is meant as a practical supplement to the principle-driven policy statement.
In his email to faculty, Block “wholeheartedly” endorsed the statement, calling it a “compelling affirmation of our peer review system and the right of faculty to conduct research and scholarship on controversial topics free from political interference.”
Outside experts on academic freedom also endorsed the document.
Hans-Joerg Tiede, a professor of computer science at Illinois Wesleyan University and member of AAUP’s Committee on College and University Governance, said was “a very positive contribution to the defense of academic freedom,” in that it articulated central principles of academic freedom and originated through shared governance channels.
Tiede said via email: “As the UCLA statement notes, ‘these requests have increasingly been used for political purposes or to intimidate faculty working on controversial issues.’ Thus, it is highly appropriate for institutions to adopt statements of principles that can provide general guidance to university officers charged with evaluating individual requests for records.”
AAUP’s standing Access to University Records policy says that “considerations of privacy, academic freedom, and the desirable insulation of the university from outside pressures, as well as considerations of efficient operation of the educational enterprise, argue in favor of a strong or even compelling presumption against access to university documents [from outside of the university] for which a reasonable claim of confidentiality has been made.”
The “presumption of confidentiality” is strongest with respect to individual privacy rights, personal notes and files, and ongoing research, “where the dangers of external pressures and publicity could be fatal to the necessary climate of academic freedom.”
Robert O’Neil, former president of and professor of law at the University of Virginia and author of Academic Freedom in the Wired World: Political Extremism, Corporate Power, and the University, said UCLA’s statement was “congenial” with AAUP policies, and noted its strong similarities to the statement Madison's then-President Biddy Martin released during the query into Cronon’s emails, “which essentially shut down the partisan quest for politically sensitive material.”
“Without a zone of privacy within which to conduct and protect their work, scholars would not be able to produce new knowledge or make life-enhancing discoveries,” Martin, who is now president of Amherst College, said in that statement.

But reading in the novitiate what St. Thomas Aquinas has to say about the religious life in his Summa Theologiae really helped me to see why that is the case. I thought it would be fitting, then, for us to take a brief but multi-post adventure into the thought of the Angelic Doctor.
When delving into a small part of a larger work, it is always good to look first at the bigger picture in order to make more sense of our reading. It also helps us to see the author's deeper motivation. Why is he writing this? How does this part fit into his project? From where is this part coming and to where is it going?
In this post we will cover the “big picture” of the Summa and find out how the religious life fits into it.
After devoting the first question of the Prima Pars (First Part) to investigating the nature and extent of sacred doctrine, St. Thomas says the following by way of introduction to the rest of the Summa: ."
For the sake of completeness, this is how St. Thomas introduces the Prima Pars: "In treating of God there will be a threefold division: For we shall consider (1) Whatever concerns the Divine Essence; (2) Whatever concerns the distinctions of Persons; (3) Whatever concerns the procession of creatures from Him." So, we have (1) God as One (Essence), then (2) God as Three (Persons), and finally (3) creation's procession from God. I must say that, in my years of theological study here at the Dominican House of Studies, I have rather enjoyed my study of the Prima Pars - I would highly recommend it - but this is all we have time to say about it for now.
In introducing the Secunda Pars, St. Thomas says this: "Since, as Damascene states,."
In the Secunda Pars, then, St. Thomas will focus on man, who, because he is in God's image insofar as he shares in the faculties of intellect and will, is also (i.e., along with God) the principle of his actions. The religious life is treated by St. Thomas as something that assists in the realization of God's image in us, something by which man as a rational creature advances toward God.
The answer to that question and more will be found in the next installment, in which we will take the grand tour through the first five questions of the Prima Secundae as well as the other 291 questions of the Secunda Pars that precede St. Thomas’s discussion of the religious life. Then we will be ready to settle down for the main course: the meat and potatoes of the religious life according to the Angelic Doctor.

Chris Olson arrives at Poplar Ridge, a rambling Virginia plantation house, for a visit with her best friend, Judith Cameron. During the Civil War, the mansion had operated as a Union hospital. Chris soon discovers that a mystery and ghosts from that era still haunt the mysterious mansion and its residents. During her stay, Chris develops a strong attraction to Judith’s brother, Geoff. She also begins to experience visions of the past that include an angry woman named Margaret and a black stallion with a star on its head.
As Chris and Geoff grow increasingly fond of each other, more secrets are revealed. The ghosts of a one-eyed scout and a Confederate soldier with a strong resemblance to Geoff become more and more persistent. Chris and Geoff fall deeply in love, but Chris is faced with a dilemma: can she give up her life as a Boston attorney to move to rural Virginia? Gradually, through the ghost of Margaret, Chris unravels the dreadful mysteries and secrets of the plantation house’s dark past.
The author has skillfully woven this dangerous love triangle with elements of the paranormal and the brutality of America’s Civil War. Although the story is more contemporary than historical, it is well written and captures the reader’s attention from the very start. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who is an aficionado of the Civil War era or who enjoys a gut-gripping, heart-wrenching ghost story.

I'm not very inspired to write here, and when I do it seems to take forever.
Meanwhile, I love my tumblr. I can collect pretty things I find on the internet, post very short tidbits, and hell, even call in and ramble on my birthday. I like the way it looks, and often I am looking for things to make it look even nicer. My tumblr doesn't have comments, but I get feedback via the little liking heart..
I don't really know what logical conclusions to make from this, but the possibly convoluted ones I come up are along these lines:
1. People don't like reading what I write and would rather look at pretty pictures of my choosing.
2. People don't like reading bloggy type blogs in general and would rather look at pretty pictures. (And hey, I am quite honestly one of those people.)
3. This has nothing to do with me, but rather Tumblr is just a much more active and social site which encourages participation amongst followers.
4. Maybe the issue is just promotion, and I should promote this more, but really, this is only the eighth time this year I've updated. What is there to promote?
5. I should probably just move this entire operation to tumblr and call it a day., tumblr is not your blog! It's where you post things you enjoy with little or no commentary! But maybe this idea is wrong, as I guess this whole internet thing evolves or something.
There are places that can juggle this whole blog versus tumblr thing. Such as bits and bobbins. The site is mostly text, with some pictures of course. The tumblr is pictures and quotes, with very little additional text. A perfect website marriage, but can I really pull that off? Not so sure.
8 comments:
Peronsally, I think Tumblr is what we make it (cliche not intended). But seriously, I've used to for such a variety of things lately that I can't honestly say I know what it's "for" just yet. I say keep this blog around for a little while. I still haven't figured out how I'm going to keep mine going, and I've only had it for a few short months! But the important thing is that you have a place to go when you're feeling long-winded, and don't have to feel guilty about putting it here verses Tumblr. Then, when you feel like getting the instant gratification of likes and reblogs, you have it with Tumblr. Does that make sense? I hope so. Anyway, I'm glad you exist on the internet! <3
I think you could merge them very easily onto Tumblr. You're getting, though, into a problem I have with Tumblr: the social/"like" aspect of it can get a little oppressive, a little peer-pressurized. Instead of writing things you like, you start targeting towards getting "likes." I've noticed that a little bit with me.
On the other hand, you shouldn't feel like you have to keep Tumblr posts short. I know of a few that use it for longer-form pieces (Auteurasaurus , Mills), and they do just fine. In fact, the most reblogged piece I ever had was the field guide to hailing taxi cabs, and that was 1,000 words, the length of a short essay. Your stuff here isn't that long, or so long that people would be annoyed. I mean, I wouldn't. And I've loved PoC for yeeeeeears!
Thanks bizzy! I am also glad you exist internettly. Heh, new word.
Andy, I think the like thing is more of a problem for you because you're like...more popular. Though, I know what you're saying. I might try integrating more text heavy posts into the tumblr to see how it goes...
I like your blog, for what it's worth. Like when you update here with your various projects and thoughts.
Well thanks, as always! It might be moved. I will keep things updated...
what's a tumblr? i read this.
Tumblr is this blog type place that's not particularly for full length blog posts, but isn't as small as twitter...so more like for posting links, pictures, videos, songs...stuff like that. But part of the problem is that it's not super clear what it is for, hence my issue of what to post there versus here.
But, a photo blog like yours would work very well there. And it seems like it's easier to get people to follow there, but maybe not. I don't know.
so halfway between a twitter and a blog? i could use some followers, i don't post to mine every day anymoreThis Ramadan, Let’s Finish What We Started
Last year, Zaytuna College met a monumental milestone when we purchased the flagship building for our campus atop Berkeley’s “Holy Hill,” a center for faith and higher education. We had found ourselves a home—a permanent academic address for Islam in America.
Now we need to make that home ours. We have already moved our administrative offices there, but we need to prepare the campus for our students and faculty. We need to craft classrooms, study lounges, a library—and a serene space for worship and reflection.
For this, we need to raise $4 million for renovations. “Muslims have always ensured that beauty and learning walk hand-in-hand,” says Waheed Rasheed, our Vice President for Administrations and Operations. “We want our students to experience a campus that inspires them to learn and grow—and we want the American Muslim community to experience a campus that inspires them about the future of their faith in this country.”
This Ramadan, you can help us finish what we started.
Last year, we unveiled our Brick by Brick campaign to raise money for the new campus. Many of you came through, dedicating bricks in your name and the names of your loved ones for each gift of $1,000. This builders’ wall, once displayed at Zaytuna, will be an enduring testament to the pioneers who made our vision a reality.
You can still be one of them. Join our Brick by Brick campaign this Ramadan.
Scholar Studying American Islam’s “Crisis of Authority” to Headline Zaytuna Convocation
Dr. Zareena Grewal, an emerging Muslim scholar who teaches at Yale University, has been named to deliver the keynote remarks at the 2013 Convocation (Aug. 27), where we welcome our newest freshman class. This year will mark the first time that all four cohorts—freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors—will be represented at the Zaytuna Convocation.
Currently, Dr. Grewal is completing a major work, Islam is a Foreign Country, about American Islam’s “crisis of authority.” In the book, she “follows the journeys of American Muslim youth who travel in global, underground Islamic networks” to seek a religious home. Her publisher, New York University Press, continues: “By examining the tension between American Muslims’ ambivalence toward the American mainstream and their desire to enter it, Grewal puts contemporary debates about Islam in the context of a long history of American racial and religious exclusions.”
Dr. Grewal, a historical anthropologist and documentary filmmaker, teaches courses at Yale on Muslims in America, U.S. cultural and political interests in the Middle East, and ethnographic and documentary film. In 2004, she directed and produced By the Dawn’s Early Light: Chris Jackson’s Journey to Islam, a film that explores the scrutiny American Muslims face about their patriotism toward their country.
Previous speakers at the Zaytuna Convocation include James A. Donahue, then the president of the Graduate Theological Union; Sherman A. Jackson, the King Faisal Chair in Islamic Thought and Culture at USC; and Sulayman S. Nyang, professor at Howard University.
“Even Your Dreams Should Be in Arabic”
Dr. Fadi Elhin sees the effects of seven weeks at Zaytuna College every day. He sees it in the student who arrived in June and did not know the Arabic alphabet. Now, that student challenges himself by striving to access the Qur’an and hadith. For Dr. Elhin, the director of the eight-week Summer Arabic Intensive, these past seven weeks have been a revelation.
“I have some students who basically had no idea what Arabic even looked like, whether it starts from right to left or left to right,” he says. “But now, we have many of them being able to read, write, and speak—not at the highest level, but they can communicate.”
This Friday, Aug. 2, the Arabic Intensive will hold a graduation ceremony for the 57 students who completed the summer program. Zaytuna has held the program each summer for the past six years, and this year’s program has been the largest to date.
It’ll also be Dr. Elhin’s first graduation with Zaytuna, and he’s looking forward to it. He studied Arabic and Islamic Studies in Jordan and, after stops in New York and Montana, arrived at Zaytuna this June .“Zaytuna,” he says, “gives you freedom if you want to learn the language. You have it in the very beautiful conditions for these students to study here.”
Under his leadership, meanwhile, the program has already made subtle changes—everything from reducing extracurricular activities to adjusting for a more Ramadan-friendly schedule—that have significantly improved the learning experience.
“To succeed in seven or eight weeks,” says Elhin, “students should have nothing to do except Arabic this summer. We limit all other things, except for studying. That’s why if you leave everything to spend eight weeks to focus on the language, even your dreams should be in Arabic.”
Spread the Word: Zaytuna Seeks Controller
As Zaytuna College continues to grow by leaps and bounds, its operational and administrative needs are also growing. Now, we have an immediate opening for a Controller to oversee our accounting and finance functions. We ask you to spread the word to anyone who may be interested in applying.
The Controller reports to the VP of Administration and Operations and is responsible for the overall management of accounting functions and the provision of financial data and guidance to the Zaytuna Operations, including the monthly closing process and production of actual financial results, cash flow management and reporting, purchase order control, budgets, cash management, and other processes and internal controls.

He is starting to read and has been having fun reading all of the Mo Willems books with me. He took his favorite one to class earlier this week and read it out loud. Apparently he did so well and made everyone laugh so much that they sent him next door to the Pre-K class to read it to them! Yesterday he read it to the first grade class. He seems to thrive on performance and loves to make people laugh.
This past July we went on a family trip to Yosemite where we met my parents, my Sister and Brother-in-law and their kids, a couple of my Aunts and Uncles as well as a cousin and her family. It really was a special trip and we want to try and make it up there again in the future.
We have been settling in to our new rental house and there have been some great things about it and some not so great things. We have more room to spread out. A new couch that comfortably seats the whole family and a front porch to enjoy the cooler evenings. Anders has had some fun playing in the hose and we have enjoyed the fantastic walking path right near our house. We have central air (lovely) and doors that shut. A washer and dryer plus a dishwasher make me feel down right wealthy.
On the downish side the back yard is filthy dirty with all of the owners stuff stored back there. There have been ongoing fix it projects since we moved in and things are still unfinished. Our main bathroom which is beautifully tiled has wires and open vents coming out of the ceiling and the outlets don't work.
One other tricky thing is that there is not much storage except in the kitchen. There is one closet in our bedroom plus some office cupboards that Chris is using for his various wires, cables and such. The house also came with a large armoire that I am getting good use out of. We are trying to pair down our things but it has been a challenge.
Mostly we are just THANKFUL for the good things in our lives! Chris has a good job, we have more comforts than we've had in a while and we have two great boys. I am so thankful for my family and friends, the good weather in California, all of the fun things to do in our area, a great local library with a really great selection of books.... Life is good.

I really love the story about Anders reading his book to three different classes! It sounds like they know how to capitalize on kids' strengths at his school. I can see the idea of reading to other people being a big motivator for him to keep learning. That's great.
I also totally feel your pain on the storage issues!!
Nice update! Fun to see recent pictures of everyone. :)
I loved the part about Anders reading to three classes! Agree with Ariana about his teacher finding how to motivate him! Great!
Many kids do not know much about reading with inflection or enthusiasm. Anders did a good job with his book. Fun to hear that others enjoyed it. :)
Such a nice post! I'm so impressed with Anders reading to three classes. He'll never forget it! Love the update... it's nice to reflect on all the good things in your life. :-)
Gigi. Thank you for the pictures and your thoughts. Love, DadRicky Ponting has been dropped from Australia's One-Day International squad for the next Commonwealth Bank series matches to make way for the return of Michael Clarke and Shane Watson.
Clarke is fit again after a hamstring injury ruled him out ot the previous two matches and Watson is back in action for the first time since the tour of South Africa in late 2011.
With Peter Forrest, David Hussey and Michael Hussey all scoring runs in the middle order, the selectors have been left with little option but to leave Ponting out of the side, despite the fact that he captained the team in Clarke's absence.
"Ricky Ponting has been dropped from the squad due to his lack of form in the five Commonwealth Bank Series matches to date in this series," National Selector John Inverarity said.
 team-mates and there is no higher accolade than this."
Also back in the squad is fast bowler Ryan Harris, who replaces Mitchell Starc as the selection panel continues to rotate their bowlers and with Matthew Wade's continued inclusion over Brad Haddin, Inverarity confirmed that the Victorian is now their preferred choice in limited overs cricket - Haddin having retired from Twenty20 Internationals.
"The NSP made the decision that Matthew Wade is now the preferred ODI wicket-keeper for the Australian ODI team. The intention at this stage is to have both Matthew and Brad Haddin in the West Indies together for the duration of the tour," he said.
Australia ODI squad: Michael Clarke (captain), Shane Watson (vice-captain), Daniel Christian, Xavier Doherty, Peter Forrest, Ryan Harris, Ben Hilfenhaus, David Hussey, Michael Hussey, Brett Lee, Clint McKay, Matthew Wade, David Warner

She just the girl who laughs, jokes, and flirts all day long, but if you were to see the look in her eyes, it'd give it all away. You'd see the girl that hides behind the static of the television of life in her eyes. Static infidelities trouble her, cheated and accused, battered and bruised; she never deserved her punishment.
Don't lie to her, she can see right through you. Don't lie to me.
She's the definition of courage, everything you could want and more. But she is overlooked. No one pays a second glance in her direction; no one needs her enough to remember her. No one. Nobody hears her screaming inside, but the sound shatters her eardrums. She is the girl, who will smile, and say she is ok, even though she's not; just so everyone else can be happy. The one who will take the fall for people she cares about.
She's just a girl…I'm just a girl.
She fell in love at age fourteen, spent two days with the man of her dreams before he was ripped away. She fell like an angel with her wings ripped off, she landed. She landed broken, bruised, battered, and destroyed. She begged the world for mercy, to leave her fragile heart to beat her to the end of her days, but the world did not comply.
We're really not that different, her and I.
She's so scared of everything. She needs you to feel secure. She says she likes you, she says she loves you, but she only needs the warmth of your arms. She's using you. I'm using you. I hate her for hurting you, for not telling you.
She loves you, but so do I.
She loves the smell of sunflower in the morning, and douses herself with the scent of vanilla. She goes to school everyday. Everyday it's the same routine, fake smile, fake happy, fake laugh, real tears.
She is human, she can feel. I am human, I can feel. I want to be treated human. I am human.
She hides behind static lullabies, and cries at the girl in the mirror. The voice in the back of her head tells her she's so beautiful, but he doesn't want to listen. All she knows is that she will never be good enough, or so she thinks. So she becomes someone she is not. She wears a little more make-up, dresses a little more flattering, and flirts with all the boys. Sometimes she wishes she knew who she was. Sometimes she wishes she could change the channel in her eyes to see beyond the static, to the clear blue skies.Services for Rev. Deal H.

The New College of the Humanities doesn’t have its own syllabus or library – instead, it will tutor students through a University of London external degree, with students paying to use Senate House Library – piggy-backing on the work done by University of London staff in the Library and the International Academy.
But of more concern is the fact that NCHUM comprises both the high-profile college and a separate arm – a for-profit company called Tertiary Education Services Limited. This is a shared services company – basically, a company which expects to make money by taking over outsourced services in higher education, everything from admin to library services.
At the University of London we’ve already seen that outsourcing our facilities, maintenance and catering services doesn’t work – it squeezes the workers’ pay and conditions and delivers a worse service for everyone. As other institutions in UK Higher Ed struggle to survive against aggressive privatisation, it’s vital that we fight every attempt to privatise within our sector in order to preserve jobs and working conditions for all of our members.
Please join the protest on Monday if you can.
Monday 24 September at 1pm, Bedford Square (just round the corner!).Miami Archbishop: Immig reform isn’t just about immigrant communities, it’s about our values & identity as a nation thehill.com/blogs/congress…—

‘Allo
Congrats. . .
It’s hidden in or near L.A. today!
The Millionaire strikes!
I assume 7 PMish is local time. . .
Reminds me of someone else using the ish. . . ;)
Hello TOD ;)
……..
Just heard a ring, not staying. . .
😎 ;)
Au for LL, Congrats. I came in 0.01 seconds behind earning Vapors from your Golden Medals…… ;)
Congrats to you both. :-)…..
I saw where Google blamed their sad number of female employees on public schools. What???
And in other news—‘how ’bout them Pacers?’ Do or die, and they did.
I went to the game last night with no expectations…..the whole city had already gave up on the series…. I got awesome 3rd row half-court seats for $35 bucks!! We will see how they do when Lebron James doesn’t have 5 fouls with 1 3/4 quarters(20 minutes) of the game left….fingers crossed! Hey the BlackHawks pulled off a win in OT under the exact circumstances last night as well :)
I was checking on both—–have fam members interested in both—–granddaughter wears her Pacers cheerleading outfit on game days—–think she hit the sack before the victorious end though—–she’s only 7 mo. so—- understandable. She heard the good news this a.m. tho and celebrated with milk! Lately they both seem to win or lose together. Blackhawks game was a real barnburner also—-double OT. Daughter and son in law are fans—–saw her tweet “Phew!” with the winning goal.
lucky, lucky, lucky you!! 3rd row seats at a playoff game. OMG
Indiana fans are fair-weather fans, Vicki! Any sign of despair they abandon ship……. My dad got two floor seats to the 2000 NBA finals against the (Kobe & Shaq) Lakers for $150 bucks when I was in high school….
Was waiting for a fresh thread, not contaminated by the rattlerattlechatter to tell you of my day: I learned today, the sports ortho I had been referred to last October, and for whom I have developed considerable trust and respect happens to be Seahawks doc; not only, he flew out to the White House with the team last week, and shook hands with President Obama!! Yes. Woot! And today, those hands very capably injected some weird and hopefully beneficial serum into my poor tired knee. After shaking hands with PBO. One degree of separation, and I am quite enraptured by it all!!! He was happy to indulge my inquisitiveness after the work was done: said it was a bit surreal, like being on television, but PBO is just what he expected him to be. We agreed that PBO has always been consistently who he seems to be, no faking, enormous aura. We also agreed he is setting the presidency bar so high, it will be a major task to fulfill the seat going forward. We shared our great admiration and respect, and said, see you in a week!! :) Now, isn’t that a fine tale to bring home?? :)
” We also agreed he is setting the presidency bar so high, it will be a major task to fulfill the seat going forward.”
Sad reality – after attacking PBO for 8 years, the media will scream of his greatness – after the event.
“contaminated by the rattlerattlechatter” :???:
(not meaning to hurt anyone, just some topics squeeze all the breathable air out of a post. I do understand. <3) I'm feeling decidedly weird, it seems like a good idea to go for a rest. Bbl.
Ah, okay – that’s what I love about TOD, we talk about everything!
me too. I feel like this truly is a village. You learn something different every day.
:-) Feel the same Nospin, I even know about geeky things now thanks to Dudette and her fellow, well, geeky people.
Thanks, Chips, not that I’m guilty of “talking about everything.” :) (Love ya.)
Huh, yeah – I’ve yet to see you contribute, in a substantial way, to the ‘Manchester United are the one true footballing faith’ debate. :roll: (Love ya back!)
I can’t even tell you what “side” of that debate I’m “supposed” to be on, without getting railroaded outta here. #AthleticsAnonymous :)
I was going to tell you that by the time I’m done with ya, this will be your avi:
But what’s with the apostrophe after the ‘I’? :???:
Your wish is my command. (At least for this evening.)
I am DYYYYYYYYYIIIIIIIINNNNNGGGGGGG!!!!!! :lol: I love you girl!!!!!
At least you’ll love me this evening! I miss my Joe avi already! :)
It is kinda weird, you’re like a brand new non-Jacqueline person!!

A fine tale indeed MP, Congrats on both you knee and your awesome 1 degree of separation !
‘your’ knee ;)
:) :) :) :) :)
“After shaking hands with PBO. One degree of separation”
But…but…but had he washed his hands after this encounter and before giving you the injection? Because, you know if he had then the degrees of separation have increased. You do know *that*, right? :)
Seriously – happy to hear you had a promising treatment, and hoping it has the desired outcome+!
Well, VC, I would surely hope a full week later Dr. had indeed washed his hands, even countless hundreds of times!! But it’s not the superficial touch, it’s the energy, it’s the dynamic, that stays within the etheric body for a long time, perhaps as long as energy (which cannot be created or destroyed) exists. That is in large part what astounds me about POTUS and FLOTUS, they do not seem to suffer or lose any part of themselves even when being touched or hugged by far more people than I can imagine (I wouldn’t care to have so many people touching me, thank you very much!)
Well, since I already get the Obama energy right through my laptop screen, I must say that I’m going after the ‘superficial touch’ for myself. :grin:
Lovely story!
Agreed! Saying it loud and clear to anyone within earshot.

Nothing but love and happiness. Of course, this was all staged by Pete Souza. All of those hugs and smiles just can’t be real. I am sure this image is driving the media and the haters to distraction.
It’s probably photoshopped Ladyhawke, bet they were actually an angry bunch of kids shouting “BENGHAZI1!1!” :-)
Sorry, have to vent. I made the mistake of turning on Tweety, he is demanding The President do something now! He never served in the military, by his demands he has no idea of the scope of this issue. Another mess The President has to clean up that was caused by those who came before me. If he really is concerned he should have a panel of Veterans, not a bunch of talking bobble heads like himself. I see none, nada, leadership qualities in the Tweety Bird, nor any understanding of leadership. This does it for me, never turning that idiot on ever again. Thanks for listening.
Was just coming here for a similar reason … watched 10 mins. of that bloviator’s show and that’s further confirmation that I’ve been right not to watch much cable news for days. They are all bobble heads, as you said. Tweety and his duo of fools from today’s show need to STFU. Even when they are complimenting the President on the one hand, they are trying to take him down in the next freakin’ sentence.
I didn’t last 10 minutes, not even close……probably 2 minutes and I changed channel. Jeopardy: If the current champion wins tonight, she will be the highest winning woman ever. Think I have that correct. I caught an interview/report about her this morning, but missed the beginning where most of the info was given. Anyway, I wanted to watch tonight anyway so Tweety helped me remember. :)
He came in handy for at least that! :)
Didn’t he demand that the pres Do something during BP oil spill, the 1st debate in 2012, the attacks by the Clintons during 2008, the Debt Ceiling debates in 2011 and 2013, during the Healthcare.gov glitches…….Matthews wanted Sebielus fired, he wanted people fired during the IRS, etc.
Screaming is Not a sign of Smartness 24/7 and that is what Matthews does. He wants to micromanage this president…..challenging him to do what Matthews wants. It frustrates him that this POTUS doesn’t and has never danced to this type of Screaming matches.
Then Matthews would turn around and say that the right hates and wants to make pres Obama’s presidency as an ****** asterisk. Has Tweety mate his mouth and his words lately? They sound just as disrespectful….. many times as those coming of the Haters themselves.
I used to watch Chris Mathews, and Ed Schultz, but have witnessed enough crazy rants from both of them that “…with friends like this who needs enemies” comes to mind.
What is this about?!?!?!?
Fact……his ratings are no longer up……..here are the numbers:
Good! He must have said something particularly outrageous one day. Back to yelling the next.
Chris Matthews puts the “GAS” in gasbag.
NW – I look forward to your tweet compilation each time and enjoyed it tonight, in particular, having just watched 10 mins. of Tweety, and feeling ready to slash and burn! Thanks, sugar. #SanityCheck
jacquelineoboomer, I haven’t watched Tweety in months but is it possible he was more unhinged than usual today because Hillary is going to Fox for her interview?
You may have something there—–I always think that so much of the buttering up from these hosts is their attempt to snag interviews—–it’s all about them—–another notch in their belt—-and Tweety has been going overboard with his Hillary Hype. And then —–all that fakey praise for naught—-might have made him testy.
Maybe but I’m sure Hillary will be interviewing with everybody sooner or later to sell books and pretend she doesn’t know if she’s running.
Meta, that is 100% guaranteed.
Too funny. I hope so. After all, he’s practically declared her victory and HE is measuring for drapes at the White House for the Clintons. You could be right!
Thanks, Ms. J’OB!
Good Evening TOD Family!
Returned last night from a “road trip” to the San Fernando Valley to visit my sister. Had a great time seeing family and meeting a year old great nephew for the first time.
In the city of Belen NM is a horrible sign on I-25. It’s the OFA logo with the message “Worst President Ever.” It made me physically ill when I saw it a couple of years ago and if I ever have to go that way again, I’ll have to find an alternate route. Bastards.
HOWEVER…on our way out to Cali, somewhere between Grants and Gallup NM, there is a big billboard with a smiling President Obama that says, “Greatest President of All Time!” I was so elated when I saw that and somewhat shocked because, of course, I didn’t expect to see that! We were in Native American country, maybe near the Laguna Pueblo. I’m almost certain the billboard was erected by their nation because of the friend and supporter the President has been to them. Wonderful to see.
Wow, that’s a trip. Glad to hear it all resolved itself in the balance. PBO has indeed been a great friend and supporter of Native Americans. He’ll be visiting another tribe again soon.
Hi meta. I hope he visits one near me in NM. He hasn’t be here in a while.
Some people feel compelled to expose their hate, even though they are in the minority. After President Obama has won two elections, surely these haters have some idea that they aren’t holding the popular position? I feel sorry for them. So thrilled to hear about the positive sign down the road, though!
If true….that is an over-priced Team.
Kind of disgusting—–more than kind of……
Lincoln in the mid 1800s wanted to buy slave owners out.
It is over-paid, yes. To tell the Sterlings that his racism is Not acceptable is how I see it. The Sterlings are damaged goods not LA Clippers.

NBC’s Richard Engel: ‘Hard Pressed’ to Name Country with Which Hillary Improved Relations
The Affordable Care Act in Kentucky: It’s Working
By GOVERNOR STEVE BESHEAR
————————————————
Now comes Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell’s amended election-year promise, delivered as he’s fighting for his political life: To rid the state of the ACA even while keeping all the good that “kynect” does.
At best, of course, his promise represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the ironclad link between the ACA and “kynect.” At worst, it’s a blatant attempt to mislead Kentucky families for his political benefit.
While that is fun to ponder, the salient point is this: Even critics are acknowledging that the ACA is bringing health care to those who desperately need it. In short, it’s working.
I see the ACA’s positive impact first-hand in my home state, a place whose collective poor health has long been jeopardizing the lives and financial security of hard-working families who can’t seem to get ahead.
—————————————–
I do sometimes wonder if all these stories about children doing the shooting are true?? Maybe I’m paranoid – but is it that easy for a child to do something like this? I just wonder.
And if it is true – everyone who gives a child access to weapons should be charged with the crime of absolute stupid!
Trish. Are you gonna be around for a bit? I got a vid for ya.
I be here – recovering from the b.s. day that was yesterday
Okay. I’ll post it now. I think it’s hilarious.
Too late. It’ll be near the top of the new thread.
We watched PBS newshour tonight……excellent interview of SOS Kerry by Gwen Ifill. Her questions were good…..some a little toward the “gotcha” but Kerry handled them with grace and clarity. Everything from Snowden to Ukraine to Syria to Iran, to President Obama’s reputation in foreign policy. She started that question with “Some say…….” Boy did Kerry take that one and tell her what’s what. Named all of PBO’s successes, and said frankly that the President doesn’t take enough credit for what he does. Said NO, he’s not giving up on the Middle East, and this problem is of 40 or 50 years’ duration, and there’s not going to be a magical, overnight solution, but he is going to keep working.
He was so clear and coherent…….I still grieve over the 2004 election. We saw him in February of that year, and never understood what people said about him: stiff, boring, tedious…….in person he was vital, alive, knowledgeable and funny.
8 years of Kerry followed by 8 of President Obama, wow, what a different country, world we would be living in.
Pundits love “some say” or “multiple sources say” – what they mean “I wish it were so”
“Some say” is just a way for the MSM to ask any question no matter how ridiculous and blame it on the some.
Here’s Jay on 5-29-14 WH presser:
Will it never end?.
Bottom line folks ….
I listen to a little bit of Chris Matthews, but I had to turn the channel. I get so dam tired of listening to these pundits telling POTUS what he should do and they really get piss if he does things his way. I think POTUS is handling the Shinseki matter the way he choose to handle it. And if he comes to the conclusion that Shinseki should go, then he will go. But how dare John McCain and that other Arizona Senator act so upset, after all what were they doing? Isn’t Phoenix in Arizona, the state they are senator represent. Why didn’t they fix the VA problem in Phoenix? Surely some of the veterans contact McCain for help. If Shinseki goes, shouldn’t McCain go too.
This obsession of “Shinseki should be fired” is nothing else but revenge for him having condemned the Iraq adventure. Republicans have hated him for years and now have the opportunity for revenge.
There have been some mistakes, but if there is someone who has to pay it’s within the local VA in Phoenix. Not Secretary Shinseki.
The business of hyping polls:
Shortage of drs. at the VA. “Harder to attract physicians to care for more challenging patients while paying them less.” Drs. there are already seeing over 2000 patients each, an overwhelming number. VA sure could have used that new funding bill which the GOP shot down.
:shock: !!!!
Probably a parody account like Goldman Sachs Elevator talk or something?
Wow, that is ultra hideous.
That is a joke. PBO NEVER talks or spills beans, and Hillary is also closemouthed. This is someone’s joke account, or idea of a joke. After what Colin Powell did getting us into Iraq?????????NO WAY. The President would not do that.
Chat on!Lawsuit: Bronx Woman Died In Hungary After Airlines Said She Was Too Fat To Fly
FILE – Delta Air Lines (File Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — The husband of an obese Bronx woman who died from kidney failure in her native Hungary has filed a lawsuit against two airlines claiming his wife was forced off of three flights because of her weight.
Vilma Soltesz and her husband Janos flew to Hungary on vacation in September as they did nearly every year.
The couple had booked two seats for Soltesz on her return flight to New York last month but Delta and KLM airlines said they couldn’t accommodate her because of her size.
The 56-year-old woman, who weighed 425 pounds, suffered from kidney disease and diabetes.
“I think there’s something wrong,” attorney Peter Ronai said. “They took on the responsibility to get her to Hungary, it’s their responsibility to get her back. I don’t understand how she makes it there but she can’t come back. It’s completely illogical to me.”
Soltesz was apparently given the run around for nine days trying to find a flight home so she could resume her medical treatment.
“She was first waiting in the airport for five hours, they then told her they wouldn’t accept her on the plane but that she should drive to Prague. She drove to Prague and they put her on the seat and they couldn’t belt her in so the captain came out of the cockpit and made her get off,” Ronai said.
By the time the couple found a flight that would accept Soltesz it was too late.
“They finally found a flight in Vienna,” Ronai said. “Her husband went in to get her but she had already passed away in the bedroom.”
In a statement, Delta said the airlines were “physically unable to board” Soltesz.
“Delta and KLM did everything possible to assist the family,” the statement read. ”.”
Janos Soltesz is suing the airlines for $6 million.>

While Tubby Smith didn’t advance to postseason play in his first year as Texas Tech head coach, the future Hall-of-Famer took his talents to New York City where he served as an analyst for CBS Sports.
“It was great,” Smith said. “I’ve was an experience that I’ve done some in the past. ... We tried to give some exposure to our program, and it went pretty good I thought.”
Smith said that he felt as though he wasn’t as prepared as he should have been, and while he wasn’t familiar with many of the teams he was commentating on, he has coached against 18 of the 68 schools in the past two seasons.
While at Minnesota, he coached against the six Big Ten schools that made the Tournament.
This year at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders played five tournament teams in the nonconference, as well as the seven schools that made it from the Big 12.
“We played everybody,” Smith said.
Upset alert
The parity of college basketball was put on display in the opening rounds of the NCAA tournament, providing 12 upsets and five overtimes while No. 11 Dayton, No. 10 Stanford and No. 11 Tennessee are trying to prove the slipper fits.
Arguably the biggest upsets of the first day of play were Dayton over Ohio State and Harvard over Cincinnati.
But the biggest upset in the Second Round was No. 14 Mercer over No. 3 Duke.
“Dayton was no surprise to me” Smith said. “They beat us two or three years ago. When Texas Tech was in a tournament in Florida, Dayton did a good job there. Harvard also wasn’t a surprise for me. They’ve been playing well. They’ve been to
the dance before. It’s even more impressive what Mercer did. The parity of college basketball is amazing.”
What did surprise Smith, however, was how Syracuse played to finish the season.
The Orange started the year an impressive 25-0 going 3-5 the rest of the season, including a three point loss to NC State in the quarterfinals of the ACC Tournament.
“Syracuse was playing so well,” Smith said. “It’s been a struggle for them down the stretch.”
Another team started out this season with an impressive unbeaten streak – Wichita State.
However, Kentucky sent the Shockers packing with an overall record of 35-1 after the Wildcats came out on top in the round of 32 by a bucket.
“They did a fantastic job there,” Smith said. “It’s hard to go undefeated nowadays with the parity of college basketball. There are so many good players and programs. I thought Gregg Marshall did a good job there, keeping the guys focused all year long.
They were put in a tough bracket. It’s very tough having to go against Kentucky in that second game. Kentucky is an eight-seed but a very talented eight-seed. I know they wished they had been in a different bracket. It could have been a different story.”
Close calls
Over a quarter of the first 48 games, not counting the First Four, were decided by five points or fewer while almost half were decided by as much as 10.
“The intensity level is always great, but there have been some very good games that have come down to the wire like North Carolina vs. Iowa State (on Sunday),” Smith said. “That’s the best thing. That’s usually the best thing about this tournament every year. It excited me and other people.”
The game he mentioned was one of the most exciting games in the Third Round but ended in one of the strangest ways as officials called head coaches Roy Williams and Fred Hoiberg together to tell them it was over.
After North Carolina junior James Michael McAdoo sank both his free throws, Iowa State senior DeAndre Kane brought the ball down with 15 seconds to go, hesitated behind the perimeter, attacked the paint and scored what would be the winning layup for Iowa State.
With 1.6 seconds left on the clock, the North Carolina players inbounded the ball quickly and Nate Britt, who saw his coach frantically trying to call a timeout, called it himself once he crossed the half court line.
The only problem was the clock hit 0.00.
Smith has been in that same situation during his 23 seasons as a head coach.
He even tried it this season after Kansas took the one-point lead over Tech with two seconds left in the game.
“You train players to call a timeout right away in that situation,” Smith said. “But in the heat of the moment, guys just grab the ball and throw it in so quickly. North Carolina just didn’t get the timeout called.”
Impressive performances
Michigan State senior Adreian Payne dominated with 41 points, including netting 17-of-17 from the free throw line, in his team’s opening game against Delaware.
Connecticut senior Shabazz Napier is averaging 24.5 points per game throughout two tournament games.
The young Wildcats of Kentucky are putting the pieces together at the right time.
It’s safe to say the opening rounds of March Madness have had their share of shining moments and Smith would agree.
Throughout the interview for this piece, he named three different teams he thinks could cut down the nets come April 7 – Florida, Louisville and Michigan State.
With an experienced coach in Billy Donovan at the helm for the Gators, Smith likes that one individual hasn’t emerged but that the young men are playing together as a team.
Smith also mentioned that he liked the play of Russ Smith for Louisville while Michigan State is healthy and playing well at the right time under head coach Tom Izzo.
As for the Big 12, Smith has been impressed with the play of Iowa State senior DeAndre Kane and Baylor.
“I was impressed with DeAndre Kane (against North Carolina),” he said. “He’s running the show. He’s been a great addition to Iowa State. And I think Baylor hasn’t been a surprise but has been impressive.”
Of the nation-leading seven Big 12 teams to be selected to the tournament, only those two remain.
No. 6 Baylor battles No. 2 Wisconsin at 6:47 p.m. on Thurs., March 27 on TBS.
“I coached against Wisconsin quite a bit,” Smith said. “If Baylor can stay awake and handle the physicality and the defense of Wisconsin, I think they can pull it out and win the game. Baylor has length and is playing extremely well right now. Wisconsin is such a good outside shooting team. Baylor has to get out there in their zone and work to get out and challenge those shots and contest. I like Baylor. I picked them as a dark horse that could make it. If they get past Wisconsin, they have a shot against someone like Arizona.”
No. 3 Iowa State faces No. 7 Connecticut at 6:27 p.m. on Fri., March 28 on TBS.
“I think Kevin Ollie has done an excellent job at UConn of taking over for Jim Calhoun and picking up right where he left off,” Smith said. “I like Iowa State and how they’re playing. I’m concerned about them without (Georges) Niang. With him down, this is where you miss a guy of his caliber and his ability especially going against a healthy UConn team. It could be tough.”

Words & Sounds Volume 1 Words and Music by Jill Scott & Keith Pelzer Copyright © 2000 Hidden Beach Records Published by ??? Transcribed by Gavin Chart (contactus@gartfrets.net) NOTES: Jill Scott's classic song about her former husband Lyzel Williams. It IS in Eb, so if you want to play along, you'll have to flatten the four chords by a semi-tone (i.e. Ebm7, Abm7, Bmaj7, Bb7). As they can all be played as barrés, that's not too difficult. Lianne La Havas plays a cool version of this at her live shows. VERSE: Chords: Em7 779787 or 075700 Am7 575555 Cmaj7 8 10 9988 B7 797877 Em7 Am7 Cmaj7 B7 Em7 You love me especial- -ly different every time Am7 Cmaj7 B7 You keep me on my feet happily excited Em7 Am7 Cmaj7 B7 By your cologne, your hands, your smile, your intelligence Em7 Am7 Cmaj7 B7 You woo me, you court me, you tease me, you please me Em7 Am7 Cmaj7 You school me, give me some things to think about B7 Ignite me, you invite me, Em7 Am7 Cmaj7 You co-write me, you love me, you like me B7 Em7 Am7 You incite me to chorus, ooh, ooh... [ad libbed ooh oohs over VERSE chords] [x2] VERSE: You love me especially different every time You keep me on my feet happily excited By your cologne, and your hands, your smile, your intelligence You woo me, you court me, you tease me, you please me You school me, give me things to think about Invite me, you ignite me, co-write me, you love me, you like me Incite me to chorus Am7 Cmaj7 La, da, da, da, da, da, da, dum B7 Da, da, da, da, da, da, da Em7 Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, Am7 Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, Cmaj7 Do, do, do, do, do, B7 Do, do, do, [Spoken over VERSE chords:] You're different and special Ah...
This is the Lianne La Havas version. Jill Scott version has a different 3rd chord - should be
Ebm7-Am7-Fm7b5-Bb7 with a few variations chucked in (it is nice with Ebm9 and Bb7sus to Bb7)
Can someone pretty plz chart out "Bedda at Home" by Jill Scott? It's such a good song with a funky vibe. zzzanya@aol.comThe Shakespeare Conference: SHK 12.1713 Sunday, 8 July 2001 From: Marcia Eppich <This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.> Date: Friday, 6 Jul 2001 12:27:49 -0500 Subject: Macbett Hello all, I just finished reading Eugene Ionesco's Macbett, and I thought it was great. Does anyone know of any video productions that may be available. Yes, I have checked Poor Yorick's catalog, but to no avail. I'll be checking with some local universities too, but was just wondering if anyone had seen it. I'm sure that it is probably funnier in a live audience, but I laughed outright several times when I read it. I thought that one of the most wonderful parts of Macbett was the witch/Lady Duncan/Lady Macbett doubling. What a great concept. When writing a paper about Macbeth, I had contended that in Macbeth that Lady Macbeth was, herself, a great witch, but my thesis advisor dismissed this idea as somewhat childish, since women of nobility would not have been accused of witchcraft during the Renaissance. But when I first read Macbeth, Lady Macbeth immediately reminded me of the bad queen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Again, a childish reminder, but the conjuring scenes in Snow White and in Lady Macbeth's "come spirits of the night" certainly seem similar to me. Also of interest in Ionesco's play are the small references to other Shakespeare works. "Brave new world" appears in there, as well as, I think, a reference or two to other plays. Very interesting read. Ciao, Marcia. _______________________________________________________________ S H A K S P E R: The Global Shakespeare Discussion List Hardy M.

"Did The Bachmann Family Clinic Violate Its Agreement Not To Engage In ‘Religious Based Counseling’?"
As ThinkProgress reported yesterday, Rep. Michele Bachmann has not been fully truthful about the government earmarks her family benefited from through her husband’s clinic. That’s not her only problem, however. A review of the government contract reveals that the clinic might have violated a provision in one of its grants, an infringement which could open the door to civil penalties.
When signing the contract, Bachmann & Associates, Inc. agreed to the following provision:
XXIII.3 “GRANTEE agrees that no religious based counseling shall take place under the auspices of this grant.”
On August 23, 2007, Tim Johnson, who Dr. Marcus Bachmann had authorized to represent him, signed this contract. Bachmann & Associates, Inc. agreed to devise and implement a plan to utilize a certain treatment with patients suffering from both a mental illness and a substance-use disorder. In return, the clinic received $24,401 between 2008 and 2009 for both clinician training and the administrative costs associated with the project.
But in its bid to receive a separate government contract that also targeted patients with dual disorders, Bachmann & Associates, Inc. described the treatment program that the clinic offered as “faith-based.” The proposal even warns that “clients will need to be comfortable with counseling and education emphasizing spiritual growth utilizing Christian language concepts.”
The program plan included a section detailing just what the faith-based aspect of the treatment would look like:
It will be utilizing Christian concepts and language that some non-Christians might be uncomfortable with…Church involvement will be encouraged and clients will be encouraged to utilize their church as a source of support and accountability. Local members of Christian recovery groups will routinely share their recovery process and be available as mentors. Groups will include short opening and closing prayers. The concept of God or HP will often be referred to in a Christian manner by both staff and clients.
The treatment plan should come as no surprise when compared with the clinic’s self-promotion. On its website, the Bachmann counseling center presents itself as “providing all clients with quality Christian counseling.” And just last year, Dr. Bachmann said his clinic employs “twenty-six Christian, pro-life, pro-family, pro-marriage counselors” who are driven by the belief that “the undeniable truth and the godly principles of truth in God’s work should direct our path.” In his personal mission statement, Bachmann wrote, “I believe my call is to minister to the needs of people in a practical, effective, and sensitive way. Christ is the Almighty Counselor” (emphasis in original).
Out of 19 counselors listed on the website, twelve counselors mention God, Christ or the Lord in their personal mission statement. Four others include the role of spirit or faith in their counseling processes. Six employees quote Bible verses. If the clinic, its staff, its programs and its owner, Dr. Bachmann himself, are emphasizing that Bachmann & Associates, Inc is a Christian-based counseling center, what evidence suggests that the clinic did not offer Christian-based counseling when dealing with the patients specified under the state grant?Few magazines get me going like Self Service, the bi-annual Parisian fashion magazine. The fall book (literally, a hardcover book) landed on my desk a good month ago and from the start, the cover had me: Charlotte Casiraghi, shot by Mario Sorrenti, all pouty lips and Brooke Shields brows (not to mention some refreshingly un-retouched pores), and sporting a seriously gorgeous glitter smoky eye. Inside, a filmic series of moonlit glamour shots showed the gunmetal shimmer that enveloped her whole eye, top and bottom, and sprinkled across her cheeks as if she’d been out all night. Of course, we don’t all have Aaron de Mey, the whiz behind the look, on speed-dial, so I set out to find the perfect shadow that would mimic that almost wet-looking shimmer, one that builds and layers and breathes, and looks cool and not cheesy. Because any beauty buff worth her salt knows that glittery makeup can go very, very wrong.
Well, that shadow exists. It’s called Infallible, it’s by L’Oréal, and it’s under ten bucks (!). And, if you buy it in Eternal Black, whip out a few cotton swabs, and set aside 1-5 minutes (depending on whether or not the rest of your face is in okay shape, or if you’re starting from scratch), you, too, can look like a pretty good “street” version of the Princess of Monaco. Here are my tips: use your fingertips, not a brush, to rub the shadow across your upper lid, stopping at the crease. Don’t extend it too far out. This stuff is slippery and saying it’s messy wouldn’t be an understatement; it’s better to concentrate on centering the product just above your lashline, and sort of smudge/smooth out hard edges from there. Go in underneath with the cotton swab dipped in a bit of shadow and rim your lower lashline. You can stop here—let’s call it a 60% “wash” of color—or you can do another round, adding more shadow to kick up the intensity and opacity.
Sometimes (like in this video), I’ll work a black pencil into my top lashes and along the waterline for more drama, before applying mascara. Whether you're at 60% or 100%, take a cue from Charlotte and Aaron and keep the rest of the face bare: spot-conceal redness or blemishes, but skip foundation and go easy on the blush. In fact, use a bit of sheer pink lipstick on your mouth and blend a bit on your cheeks for a dewy sheen. I like to top off the look with a bit (a BIT) of clear, shiny lip gloss for a little sexiness and dab some highlighter on the tops of my cheeks to look fresh. And don’t worry when the whole thing gets all hot and bothered—perfection is overrated.

Participants work on community projects and in return receive food from WFP.
A recent evaluation of food-for-assets activities in the Kyrgyz Republic showed that this intervention helps build a foundation for sustainable improvements in food security, particularly for vulnerable households.
“The Russian Federation has consistently shown its readiness and commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder with WFP in the Kyrgyz Republic to help the poorest and most food insecure people in the country,” said WFP Kyrgyz Republic Representative and Country Director Ram Saravanamuttu. “This contribution will help WFP to further strengthen social safety nets and build the resilience of the most vulnerable, food- insecure, populations to mitigate the impact of shocks such as high food prices.”
Since the launch of the food-for-assets programme in the Kyrgyz Republic in mid-2010, about 230,000 people from food-insecure areas – where people struggle to produce or buy enough food to live a healthy life - have benefited from WFP activities ranging from disaster mitigation to vegetable growing.
The Government of the Russian Federation has been providing food assistance to vulnerable communities in developing countries since 2003. From 2009 to 2012, the Russian Federation contributed over US$20: firstname.lastname@wfp.org):

Documents show that sale report submitted by Gulf Coast Broadcasting Co. for WBZR-AM 1000 and FM 105.9 was accepted by the Federal Communications Commission.
The deal was closed as 68-year old Robertsdale resident Walter John Bowen, the previous owner of the stations formerly known as WNSI, was sentenced last week to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty in Baldwin County Circuit Court to child sexual abuse.
According to FCC spokeswoman Janice Wise and agency records, the FCC on Sept. 29 accepted an ownership report signed by Gulf Coast Broadcasting President R. Lee Hagan and dated Sept. 28, one day after Hagan said that sales transactions were completed.
"We’re happy to have this completed and move forward with operating (the stations) as a group," Hagan said.
Hagan said he bought his newest stations out of bankruptcy court in November, having bid $220,000 for WNSI-FM 105.9 in Atmore and $190,000 for WNSI-AM 1000 in Robertsdale.
Hagan said he has been operating the stations since mid-December after Bowen’s arrest and changed the call letters shortly after taking over.
"Normally, we wouldn’t have taken over until we closed (on the sale), but (Bowen) was arrested and the stations were sitting there empty," he said.
According to Hagan, it typically takes about six weeks to get FCC approval on a sale. But this sale took longer because the stations had been in bankruptcy and because, after Bowen’s arrest, the licenses had to be transferred to a trustee, Hagan said.
The acquisition brings the Gulf Coast Broadcasting’s holdings to four stations, according to Hagan. Other stations in the group include WABF-AM 1220 in Fairhope and the flagship operation, WCSN-FM 105.7 in the Orange Beach/Gulf Shores area, he said.
Hagan said he had owned the Robertsdale station before selling it to Bowen nearly a decade ago.Belkin announces a cornucopia of iPhone 3G/3G S cases

It isn't exactly true that every time Prince Fielder moves, the entire earth wobbles. But it's 100 percent true that when Fielder signed his monstrous nine-year, $214 million deal with the Tigers last week, the entire sport of baseball felt the reverberations.
We'll be feeling those aftershocks for a long, long time, too. So let's take a look at just some of the ripple effects of The Prince Deal:
Something's Brewing
Life in Milwaukee will go on after Prince. But it'll be a lot less, well, Prince-ly.
If the Brewers were just subtracting Prince and plugging in Aramis Ramirez across the infield to replace his thunder, it would be one thing. But they're also looking at potentially losing Ryan Braun for 50 games. And if Braun can't get his suspension overturned, the Brewers may not recover -- not this year, anyway.
"Without Braun, they have no real impact player in their lineup, except for Aramis," one NL executive said. "So their pitching is going to have to keep them afloat."
Now any rotation that starts with Zack Greinke, Yovani Gallardo and Shaun Marcum has a shot to keep its team in a lot of games. And this is still an incredibly confident group. But we've done the math, and it isn't real uplifting.
According to FanGraphs, Fielder was a 5.5-win player last year. Braun was worth 7.1 wins. So if you subtract Prince for a full season and Braun for 50 games, that's a seven-win canyon this team would have to climb out of before it played a game.
If we go by WAR alone, Ramirez is only about a 2.5-win upgrade over Casey McGehee and Jerry Hairston Jr. at third. Alex Gonzalez is about a half-win upgrade over Yuniesky Betancourt at short. So that's three wins they get back at those positions.
But over at first, Mat Gamel projects as a 1.0-WAR kind of guy -- a gigantic step down from Fielder. And if the Brewers are looking to Ramirez to be their centerpiece offensive figure while Braun is gone, they should keep in mind that April and May have always been the two worst months of his career.
So if Braun's suspension is upheld, this team is really going to have to scramble, or play over its head, to survive those 50 games. Nearly half those games (24-of-50) are against teams that had a winning record last season, by the way.
"I know they got Aramis," another NL exec said. "But those first 50 games might just take them out of it."
Central Recasting
Quick now. Name the four most dominant figures in the National League Central last year.
OK, pencils down. If you nominated Albert Pujols, Tony La Russa, Prince Fielder and Ryan Braun, you just aced this quiz.
All right, what do those four guys have in common now that we've charged into 2012? You got it. Albert, Prince and La Russa are all gone. And Braun could very well join that missing persons list for the first 50 games.
So has any division in baseball changed its face more than the NL Central? Not by our computations.
"It's changed the whole landscape," one NL Central exec said. "Without Pujols, Prince and maybe Braun, this division is more up for grabs than it's ever been."
Well, we might not go that far. The only thing the Astros may be grabbing for this season is the emergency brake. The Cubs are just starting a long-term urban-renewal project. We've already recapped the Brewers' issues. And while the Pirates are finally beginning to stabilize, they still have a few flights of stairs to climb to reach this penthouse.
But let's not lose sight of the big plot line here. This is suddenly a division with an identity crisis. Wherever it's heading in 2012 and beyond, it can't possibly resemble where it came from during the Albert-and-Tony era in St. Louis and the five seasons in which Braun and Fielder were inflicting middle-of-the-order terror in Milwaukee.
"It's a different division," another NL Central executive said. "You figure two of the five best sluggers in the league are now out -- and one of the other three might get suspended for 50 games."
Meanwhile, the departure of La Russa -- not to mention his longtime genius of a pitching coach, Dave Duncan -- doesn't just reshape the Cardinals' world. It alters the face of the entire division.
For the last decade and a half, the manager of the Cardinals was the place where all conversations about the NL Central began. La Russa's presence was that powerful. His teams were put together with an eye toward the kind of roster he loved to manage. And there wasn't a day that went by all season in which everyone in the division wasn't profoundly aware of who was managing the Cardinals -- and what he was up to.
Now, without him or Duncan to put his stamp on the season to come -- and a replacement (Mike Matheny) who has never managed a game -- everything has changed. Over and over this winter, for instance, people have pointed to the Reds' aggressive moves (Mat Latos, Ryan Madson and Sean Marshall) and shared the same theory:
Their GM, Walt Jocketty, and their owner, Bob Castellini, didn't miss what was happening in St. Louis and Milwaukee. So they "saw an opportunity," one of those observers said, "to go for it."
Maybe they'd have done that anyway, with Joey Votto's free-agent clock ticking. But let's just say that it sure doesn't LOOK like a coincidence.
A League of Their Own
The National League may have won three of the last four World Series. But the developments of this winter tell a different story of the shifting of the baseball earth.
There were two $200 million contracts handed out this offseason -- to Pujols and Fielder. Both of them had spent their whole careers in the National League. They now figure to spend the rest of their careers in the American League.
There were four other free agents who cost their teams at least $77.5 million this winter: Yu Darvish, CC Sabathia, Jose Reyes and C.J. Wilson. Only one of them (Reyes) wound up in the National League.
Get the picture?
There's a metamorphosis of power in baseball taking place before our eyes. And to keep track of it, you just need to follow the dollar signs -- not to mention the first basemen.
TRIVIALITY
Over the last four years, five All-Star first basemen have signed deals worth at least $150 million: Fielder, Pujols, Mark Teixeira, Adrian Gonzalez and Miguel Cabrera. All five landed in the AL.
Expand that picture, and nine active position players -- at any position -- have signed contracts worth $150 million. The only one who got those mega-millions from an NL team was Matt Kemp. If you'd like, you can add Troy Tulowitzki, but in reality he signed two separate extensions totaling $157.75 million.
So it's clear what we're seeing. The American League is becoming the league of the super-teams. That club isn't just confined to the Yankees and Red Sox anymore.
The Angels and Rangers have monster TV deals on the way, and exploding nine-figure payrolls. The Tigers have an owner (Mike Ilitch) willing to reach into his personal piggy bank and drive his team into that territory.
So that's five AL teams that are loaded -- with talent and dollars. Meanwhile, the only NL team in that payroll bracket is the Phillies, at least until the Dodgers, Cubs and Mets get ready to rev up their engines again.
"What we're starting to see," one AL executive said, "is a shift toward market size and away from attendance. And it's the largest markets that are better able to capitalize on the TV dollars that are out there. In a world where the only TV programming that people are still watching live is sports, that's where the money is now -- in television rights."
Eventually, of course, this may well even out. Eventually the Cubs, Mets, Dodgers and Nationals could have payrolls in this same range. But we can't tell you when "eventually" will roll around. Until then, there's one thing you don't need to be Fielder's accountant to understand:
These days, you sure wouldn't want to be an American League pitcher for a living.
Ready to Rumble
• Is there anybody outside of the 313 area code who thinks Miguel Cabrera can play third base? If there is, we can't locate him. Here's a sampling of not-especially-upbeat opinion:
From an NL exec: "Why are they even going through the charade that he's going to play third base? My theory is they want him to lose weight and this is one way to motivate him to do it. And then, after four days of watching balls go by him, they'll say, 'Let's DH him.' If he's really going to play third base, any value they get from signing Prince goes right out the window because of the defense they'll lose in the infield."
From another NL exec: "They might say they'll play him there every day, but I don't see how you can. It's fine when the big guy [Justin Verlander] pitches, because nobody hits the ball, anyway. And maybe you could do it when [Max] Scherzer pitches. But that's about it. You put him over there, and the whole league will be bunting on him. He can't make that slow-roller play because of that girth around his middle."
From an NL scout: "I'm not buying into it at all. I think Jim [Leyland] is saying exactly what he has to say. I saw this guy play third base as a kid. I even saw him play shortstop in the minor leagues. And his body control as a youngster was pretty good. But the build he's got now creates long actions. Everything takes a long time, and that's not good at that position. So I don't think it's going to happen. In fact, I'll be shocked."
From another NL scout: "They might try it, but that's not going to last long. When's the last time he had to make an acrobatic throw going in the hole or on a ball down the line? It's been a long time. He might have arm strength, but it takes more than arm strength to make those plays. I also want to see Prince catch those throws from third base. That's the other part of this. They're putting a guy over there at first who isn't going to help him much."
• Since Cabrera arrived in Detroit in 2008, he has piled up 74 intentional walks. Not only is that the most in the American League in that time, but only one other player (Ichiro Suzuki, with 53) is even within 30 of him.
Those four years happen to be an exact match for the time Prince has spent hitting behind Braun in the cleanup hole in Milwaukee. And how many times was Braun intentionally walked in that same span? Exactly 11 -- with just six of those 11 coming in the last three years combined.
So here's an interesting question: As great as Braun is, is Cabrera such a superior hitter, even compared to the reigning NL MVP, that teams will still work around him to get to Prince?
"If I had to set the over/under, I'd set it at 15," one advance scout said. "They'll still walk him. If they're facing a left-hander, they'll be walking Cabrera because he's better than Braun. You can pitch to Braun. I don't know where to pitch to Cabrera."
• One AL executive's assessment of the Tigers' chances of trading Victor Martinez next winter: "They'll have to eat a lot of money. After the guy misses a full year, nobody can take that contract on." For the record, Martinez is guaranteed $25 million in 2013-14. Insurance is expected to cover about half of the $13 million he has coming this year.
• The Phillies are so worried about avoiding the prestigious Luxury Tax Club that they traded their most reliable bench player, Wilson Valdez, last week to save a half-million bucks. But one baseball official who has crunched their numbers says that if they're just getting the memo that they may have to pay that tax, "it's a little late."
Preliminary estimates place the Phillies' likely Opening Day payroll, for luxury-tax purposes, at approximately $180 million. The tax threshold for this year is at $178 million. So what's the only way they can avoid paying their taxes? By trading somebody who makes at least $2 million, of course. An exec of one NL club told Rumblings the Phillies have sent signals they could dangle pitcher Joe Blanton this spring if he proves he's healthy and they like their other rotation options.
"Here's a prediction you can take to the bank," one NL executive said. "Michael Bourn will be the center fielder in Washington a year from now."
Bartlett
•. As we've seen all winter, the Red Sox are pushing hard to get under the luxury-tax threshold by 2013 at the latest. So they've been telling teams that if they add an infielder, it's more likely to be somebody who works cheaper than Jason Bartlett.
• Scott Kazmir still wants to pitch this year. But teams that have watched him throw this winter report they clocked his fastball at 84-85 mph. Once upon a time, this guy's average velocity was 94 mph.
Zimmerman
• Not signing Fielder might turn out to be the best addition the Nationals never made. They can now turn their attention to wrapping up an extension with Ryan Zimmerman, which could happen any time now. And next winter, they can charge into the free-agent center fielder market full speed ahead, since Prince won't be forcing them to play Michael Morse in the outfield.
• The Marlins and Indians find themselves powerless these days to take any control over the fate of their two favorite players to be named later -- the artists formerly known as Leo Nunez and Fausto Carmona. The Dominican Republic will have to determine whether it's inclined to approve these two men for visas. Then, the State Department needs to assess their situations for homeland-security reasons.
And even if they make it past those hurdles, every indication is that both players will then be disciplined by the commissioner's office for falsifying their identities. So they're likely to have to serve some sort of suspension weeks or even months from now. In other words, don't expect to see either on a big league pitcher's mound any time soon.
Jimenez
• If Ubaldo Jimenez has a big bounce-back kind of season, remember this name: Nelson Perez. He's one of the Indians' strength coaches. And while you may have heard that he's been working with Jimenez in the Dominican this winter, what you probably haven't heard is the behind-the-scenes story of how that came about.
The Indians aren't one of those teams that sits back and hopes its players stay in shape over the winter. They try to be as proactive as possible. But Perez took proactivity to a whole new level, by actually volunteering to move his family from Puerto Rico to the Dominican Republic to work with Jimenez and several other players. Now, all reports are that Jimenez is in fabulous shape after an offseason of working on his core and lower half.
His season disintegrated last year, when he showed up for spring training with a hip injury then lost his delivery and never got it back. The Indians were determined not to repeat that saga this year. But Perez went above and beyond most folks' definition of the call of duty to make that happen.
TRIVIA ANSWER
• Bud Selig remains convinced that adding a wild-card team in each league this year is as inevitable as the seventh-inning stretch. But sources say there are "still major hurdles" in the way. And it isn't just the Players Association that's skeptical.
We've heard that owners, GMs, TV executives and folks in Selig's office have told the commish it's nearly impossible to cram tiebreaker games, a wild-card round, division series and league championship series into the three-week window between the end of the regular season and the start of the World Series. But Selig remains determined, no matter how much travel or TV-scheduling havoc this might wreak.
So MLB's scheduling committee and union officials are meeting again this week, with a March 1 deadline now only four weeks away. Chances are, they'll wind up yielding to the commissioner's wishes -- and then praying that the worst-case scenarios don't turn into real-life nightmares. But stay tuned.
The All-Unemployed Team

Moro East is definitely a current favorite cookbook around my kitchen. Every recipe I’ve made has been utterly delicious. And pretty much every single one I’ve thought sounded a little weird. Pumpkin Pistou? F-ing amazing. So I know nothing and this is why it’s good to get new cookbooks from time to time.
I actually bought it in Australia, at this lovely little cookbook store (yes! a whole store of only cookbooks!) on Gertrude Street in Melbourne. And while you can order it from the comfort of your own computer via Amazon, I felt compelled to buy it IN AUSTRALIA as a souvenir of a delicious dinner we had at Añada. Apparently one of the co-owners is also involved in Moro (in London). Good enough connection for me. I’d had my eye on the book for months before our trip so, you know, all I needed was a teeny push in the right direction and the credit card was out.
I digress.
The point of this post is the beet dip. And like some of the other recipes I’ve tried from this book, I was a teensy bit skeptical. Beets with tahini. Hmm. Sounded at least more interesting than Whole Foods hummus. The first time I made it was for Melanie’s shower and it turned out to be the culinary rage of the party. Serve it with crudite and maybe some toasty flatbread and cheese. Oh my.
Beet dip with tahini
(From Moro East, with a few additions/changes by moi)
Preheat oven to 400.
600 g raw beets (i would say that’s like 6-8 medium beets? I didn’t weigh mine, but eyeballing it seemed to work. If you’re anal, the kitchen scale is your friend)
1 garlic clove, coarsely chopped
6 T extra virgin olive oil
2 T tahini
3-4 T chopped fresh mint (depending on how minty you like your dip)
2 t red wine vinegar
Juice of 1 medium lemon
sea salt and pepper
The actual recipe calls for boiled beets. I’ve never boiled beets before and I do love them roasted so I decided to roast mine for this recipe. I’m sure you could boil them with great success, but I’ll proceed with the roasting.
Actually, I’m not going to type out the roasting instructions again. You can see them in my Beet Salad post last month. So… roast and peel the beets.
Coarsely chop them and transfer them to the food processor. Add garlic, olive oil, and tahini and whiz in the processor until you have a nice semi-smooth puree. Then add the mint, lemon, vinegar, salt and pepper and whiz for one moment more. You can probably do it all at once, but I like to imagine that the fresher tastes bubble to the surface when you separate the whizzing. The Moro recipe has you mix the mint, vinegar, salt and pepper in by hand, but I say if you have the processor out, use it for everything.
Taste. (You will die). Add more salt, pepper, or lemon if you like. And voila!
The lemon is my addition, so if you’d like to stick to the real recipe, leave it out. And I added more mint than they call for, but I love mint and herby tastes.
My favorite souvenirs are books! And I always use the reciept as my bookmark as a little reminder of exactly where I found it.
Going to try the recipe this weekend – my little crumb loves hummus, so this will be a beet bonus!
Great timing- I just came over to your site to get that other beet recipe you posted! Now I am in a predicament!
Yum! I cannot wait to try it!
mmmmmm…just made the beet dip. and yes, almost died. is sooo good!
*amanda
Thank you for these delicious beet recipes. I hope you don't mind, but I had to write about them myself. Seriously, so good:)
I had a beet dip similar to this as a child that I grandmother used to make in late summer and oh how I've longed to make it again! *Thank you* for sharing! I plan to buy the cookbook too!
And an entire store of just cookbooks? What a fantastic idea. And I too love to buy a cookbook on vacation of a lovely reminder of my holiday. So glad to read that I'm not the only one to do that.
I made this and everyone LOVED it!! Yummy!!
I heart a beet. Cannot wait to try this!
I heart a beet. Cannot wait to try this!
That beet dip sounds amazing and I plan to try it. Thanks!
A thousand thanks – this is DELICIOUS! Love your blog, and all the great food & wedding inspiriation.5/18/2015

Benitez turned his attention to Reina after failing to sign Julio Cesar from Queens Park Rangers. Reina was Benitez's number one keeper at Anfield when the Spaniard was in charge.
Liverpool signed Belgian international goalkeeper Simon Mignolet last month, in a deal worth £9 million and he now looks set to be the number one 'keeper at Anfield.
Reina joined Liverpool from Villarreal in 2005, however he will now be part of a Napoli side that can provide Champions League football next season - something which Liverpool cannot offer next campaign.
In addition to Mignolet, the Reds have 'keepers Brad Jones and youngster Danny Ward to keep competition for places at a high at Anfield.
Mignolet has shown how capable he is between the sticks last campaign for Sunderland, which caught the attention of Liverpool prior to signing the Belgian.
Now, it seems that Reina's time at Anifled is coming to an end, as he seeks a new challenge 91 - 100) 2871 items

It was alleged that he had smoked a joint with some friends sometime within 48 hours to the time he competed. He allegedly explained that he was in the room but did not consume any. It is scientifically said that you can get it in your system through external exposure. There were also variations in the proven amount in his system. In the end, the snowboarder was allowed by the IOC to keep his gold medal due to insufficient findings.
The funny thing is that marijuana has been scientifically proven to HINDER performance in higher energy sports and slightly relax judgment for some. The same effects do not happen to everyone and marijuana has been shown to assist in health issues as well as concentration and relaxation. The chances that it helped him win his run are close to ZERO. If anything this would have made him less agile, slower to respond physically to the quick movement needed for orientation through the course. He would have a lag feeling and uncomfortable paranoia if anything. Most competitors will not use this as an enhancement and especially not before a chance like competing in the Olympics.
The thing is that training high or competing high will hinder your awareness plain and simple. What you do on your own quiet time is up to you and marijuana has been shown to help in recovery from exercise but used during exercise it is definitely not beneficial and with weight training can result in injury.
The bottom line is that there is no athletic enhancement in general by utilizing this drug prior to working out or toward the Olympics for that matter!! Of course there must be rules and regulations to Olympic sports. There must be a code of conduct regardless of your personal feelings toward political issues such as this. Being a competitor in a sport is not the time to debate the rights or wrongs of what a drug is or how it challenges activity. If you choose to compete in a certain sport then you are agreeing to play by the rules handed to you, even the political rules and even the unsaid. Part of being a good sport is showing your ability to follow rules regardless of your opinion and if your opinion is strong enough in conflict then you would choose not to compete.
You can be rest assured that lifting weights at full mental, conscious awareness is the smartest idea. If you are serious about wanting results then you will want to put your full mind into your workouts and forgo the use of drugs or alcohol prior to training. Alcohol is detrimental to your fitness results and has been proven so where as pot has not. Part of muscle building depends on your ability to bring mind into body; the best way to achieve this is ‘straight’.i'll leave a man dead merked like bin laden,

Stock Up, Stock Down
Stock Up
Patrick Sharp, Chicago Blackhawks: Sharp returned to the Blackhawks' lineup after missing 16 games with a knee injury and had two goals and an assist in Chicago's 4-1 win over Los Angeles on Sunday. The win snapped a five-game losing streak for the Hawks (0-3-2) and vaulted them back into fourth place in the Western Conference and what would be home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs.
Stock Down
Mikko Koivu, Minnesota: The Wild's top scorer went down with a knee injury during Sunday's 3-0 victory over Edmonton and his availability against the New York Rangers on Tuesday is doubtful. Through Sunday's games, the Wild, who are in a life-and-death struggle to qualify for the playoffs, are tied for ninth place, one point out of the last playoff berth in the Western Conference.
-- Scott Burnside
1. When will you join the ranks of those caterwauling about the Detroit Red Wings' goaltending?
OK, here's the deal. I can't in all good conscience suggest the Wings are as good between the pipes as everyone else in the Western Conference, but I also refuse to suggest a team that is going to be among the top three teams in the NHL, a team that is the defending Stanley Cup champion, is anything but an elite squad capable of doing it all again. And the more you talk to Chris Osgood and Ty Conklin, the goalies whom many will question in the coming days, the more we think the Wings are in for the long haul once again.
"We've got a good team," Osgood told ESPN.com this week. "Even last year, everything wasn't going perfect. We were struggling to score some games last year, like February we barely scored.
"This year, our goals came so easy and we scored so much, I think all of a sudden we forgot that we had to play defense too and it kind of caught up to us in a few games, which it's better now than later. We really were hit-and-miss. We'd be good in our own end for two games, then terrible for two. Probably the worst I've seen us since I've been here. Lately, we've been a lot more patient and we've figured out that we've got to get back to how we played last year."
In fact, the Red Wings are 7-1-1 in their past nine games and have given up three or fewer goals in all but two of those contests. They also established an NHL record last week when they hit the 100-point mark for the ninth straight season.
On a personal note, Osgood had a mini leave of absence a few weeks back and has returned with renewed focus, winning four straight starts and allowing three or fewer goals in all of them.
"I feel good," he said. "That was the longest struggle ever, that whole first half of the season more or less. Since Christmas, I've felt pretty good. I've got to work with [goaltending coach] Jimmy Bedard for three days, which was really good, just on my foot speed and just doing subtle movements in my crease. I came back and my mind was clear and I felt real good.
"At the start of the year, we weren't playing good defense, but I wasn't playing good either or I wasn't making the saves when I had to. Then, when you start letting in goals, I don't care who you are, you start to overthink it or thinking a little bit too much, probably more than I should have, instead of just playing and enjoying it.
"I was kind of expecting to pick up where I left off last year against Pittsburgh," Osgood added. "In reality, that's just not going to happen because that was like a two-month zone. In that aspect, I put too much pressure on thinking I've got to be that guy throughout the whole year instead of just playing game by game and being me."
As for who will get the nod in the playoffs, look to Osgood, who carried the Wings to their fourth Cup since 1997 last spring with a 14-4 record.
"I know our guys look forward to it," Osgood said. "I mean, at the start of the year, we looked and it's like we're at the bottom of this mountain and we've got to go all the way to the top to get back to the playoffs again, and I think now you're really seeing us playing the way we're capable of playing. I'm noticing way more focus than we ever have been all year long, so that's a good thing."
2. Do the Ottawa Senators have a chance at sneaking into the playoffs?
Well, technically, yes. Realistically, no. Still, the resurgent Sens have put the lie to the notion that teams not in the playoff mix will tank to gain a better draft position. Clubs like Atlanta and the New York Islanders refute the notion the NHL should revamp its draft lottery system given the way they've played down the stretch.
But back to the Senators. After beating the Rangers at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, the Sens began the week seven points out of eighth place in the Eastern Conference. In Ottawa's favor is the fact the Canadiens are continuing their nuclear meltdown and their hold on the last playoff berth is tenuous at best. The two teams between Ottawa and Montreal -- Florida and Buffalo -- are both struggling and the Sens have both Florida and Montreal on their schedule. The problem is both those games, along five others remaining on their schedule, are on the road. That's not good for a team that will likely have to go 8-2-0 in its final 10 to get into the postseason. It's a lot to ask.
3. What about the Anaheim Ducks? Too little, too late, or realistic playoff team?
Like a lot of teams in the bottom half of the Western Conference, the Ducks are like that character in Monty Python's "Holy Grail" flick: "But I'm not dead yet!"
The Ducks are fascinating because they still have a strong core of players left over from their 2007 Stanley Cup win, including future Hall of Famers Scott Niedermayer, Teemu Selanne and Chris Pronger, not to mention one of the top money goalies of this generation, Jean-Sebastien Giguere.
They began the week on a three-game winning streak and have won four of five. They were tied with Minnesota in ninth, one point out of eighth with 10 games to go. They play in Nashville on Tuesday in a huge game and have two more dates with Edmonton, another team on the playoff bubble. One thing is for sure: Teams like Detroit and San Jose are hoping the Ducks falter, because Anaheim is a team that could provide more than a stern test in the first round.
4. So, could you identify Bryan Little if you saw him on the street?
Funny you should ask that. After sitting down with him the other day at the Atlanta Thrashers' practice facility, the answer is, yes we can. The other way to identify Little is to start at the top of the NHL's goal-scoring leaders and go down a smidgen until you get to 14th. Little has 31 goals, tying him with Jarome Iginla and putting him ahead of players with more familiar names like Patrik Elias, Henrik Zetterberg, Sidney Crosby, Vincent Lecavalier, Pavel Datsyuk and Jonathan Toews.
So, has he been following his exploits in the standings? Not really, he told ESPN.com recently.
"I looked at it at the start of the season when I was even doing better and that's when it seemed like a couple of games later I went on kind of a 10-game slump," said the 21-year-old Little, who was the 12th overall pick in the 2006 draft.
Little, a natural center, was moved to the wing at the start of the season by rookie coach John Anderson. It's a move that has paid huge dividends.
"I think the biggest difference for me this year is I'm more confident handling the puck and I'm more confident and patient when I do get it in front of the net instead of last year, when I'd kind of just grip my stick tight and just try and get a shot on net," Little said. "I just feel more comfortable this year."
Anderson had Little for part of last season in the AHL with the Chicago Wolves, for whom Little managed just nine goals in 34 games. Is the Thrashers' coach surprised by the blossoming young forward?
"I believed that he could do that. This quickly? No. I wouldn't have thought that," Anderson said. "It just goes to show you how quickly it can turn around for a guy. And I'll tell you, conversely, it can turn the other way, too. Next year, we have to make sure he comes in the same shape and with the same thought process.
"Knowing Bryan as I do, I'm not totally inside his head yet, but I think that he's not that type of person," Anderson added. "He's got there because he works hard and he's one of those guys that wants to score so I don't think I'll have to get in his kitchen too much, hopefully."
Former NHL goalie and current national analyst Darren Eliot said Little's 30-plus goals may be the quietest in the NHL, but it bodes well for a team that historically hasn't drafted and/or developed players well. "He's completely remade himself," Eliot said of Little. "You can see him doing this every year for the foreseeable future."
Little is tied for seventh among all Canadian goal-scorers this season; only Dany Heatley (34) has more goals among those players who aren't likely to make the playoffs. It explains why Little is on Canada's short list for a spot on its World Championship team this spring in Switzerland.
In the long term, with Zach Bogosian enjoying a strong rookie season on the blue line and netminder Kari Lehtonen having a strong second half, the Thrashers believe they may have turned a corner.
"All of a sudden, it's a young core that gets to grow together," Eliot said.
And maybe the emergence of players like Little may even convince captain Ilya Kovalchuk to hang around.
5. Who do you think will end up coaching the United States and Canada at the World Championships this spring in Switzerland?
Interesting issues for Doug Armstrong and Pierre Gauthier (Canada) and Brian Burke (United States) as they put together teams that in many ways will serve as warm-ups for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.
The Americans will hold a conference call Tuesday to discuss their coaching staffs and may make an announcement later this week, ESPN.com has learned.
The obvious choice would seem to be Peter Laviolette, the former coach of the Carolina Hurricanes and the U.S. entry at the 2006 Torino Games. Ron Wilson, Burke's bench boss in Toronto, will also be available, as will Mike Sullivan, an assistant with Tampa Bay.
The Canadian picture is far murkier and a decision may not come until close to the end of the regular season. Expect former New York Rangers coach Tom Renney to get a look, but there are top coaches in the Western Conference who will also be on the Canadian radar depending on how the ultra-tight playoff race finishes up. Dave Tippett in Dallas and Andy Murray in St. Louis are both hoping to be unavailable, but both would be stellar choices if their teams falter. Craig MacTavish in Edmonton and Barry Trotz in Nashville would also be nice additions if their teams stumble down the stretch.
"We're going to allow it to play itself out for another 10 days or so," GM Armstrong told ESPN.com on Monday.
Although Hockey Canada officials will reach out to Wayne Gretzky to gauge his interest, don't look for the Phoenix Coyotes coach to be in the mix, given his desire to take a step back from international hockey.
On the player front, one thing to watch for with the Canadians: Armstrong et al may bring players to Switzerland and ask them to play out of position, specifically centers. Why? Armstrong said top centers will likely have to play the wing in Vancouver given the terrific depth at that position among Canadian players.

Selective Urgency
In this administration Heaven can't wait -- except in Afghanistan.
In the long run, we're all dead. -- J. M. Keynes
Unless you happen to be a soldier in Afghanistan. Over there, it can happen a little sooner.
Contrary to the immediacy that has followed every single mantra of the Obama administration, the focus on the Afghani battlefront seems to be marching to the beat of a very different and disengaged drummer.
On matters of domestic policy, the short-sightedness illustrated by Keynes' impetuous statement set a droning pace for the Democrats' agenda: we cannot wait for a stimulus; we cannot delay passing legislation on climate change; we must overhaul health care now: the time to debate is over. Never one to let crises go to waste, Mr. Obama and his administration have squeezed out every last drop of every crisis in order to make gallons and gallons of crisisade.
And it's beginning to taste really bad.
The stimulus was pushed through as the answer to our economic ills. We had to act with swift severity to avoid the pangs of an 8.5 percent unemployment rate. We had to get money in the system now or the banks would collapse, manufacturing would misfire, and the housing market would further implode. We just needed another tank of financial fuel. That would give us the confidence to drive our parked economy down a treacherous turnpike. We just needed more money and all the hazards would disappear.
Well, here's the thing about the economy, people won't buy, they won't borrow, and they won't make long-term investments unless they have faith in the path that lies before them. And as the unemployment figures rise beyond the threatened 8.5 to the current 9.8 percent -- even after the $787 billion stimulus -- people fail to see what they were supposed to be so confident about. Moreover, most of the stimulus has still not been injected into the market. Yet, now seven months after the stimulus was passed, and with 49 out of 50 states losing, not gaining jobs, the administration we hear that the stimulus has worked. Just what did we stimulate? Contrasting the heated rhetoric that surrounded getting the stimulus with the laissez-faire manner of its application, it's very hard to tell. Perhaps the stimulus was more about an administration than a nation. Too cynical? Well, perhaps, but where are the fruits of the stimulated labors? Where is the state bird of industry -- the crane? Where are the bulldozers? Where is the rubble? Where are the orange barrels? Where is the stimulus in action?
What we're seeing is the embodiment of something our grandparents taught us; haste makes waste -- unless you can convince people against their better judgment that in the long run, they'll either suffer more, or fail to reap the benefits so "apparent" in immediate gratification. As someone once told me, the difference between a child and an adult is the willingness to forgo something good now for something better later. In other words, the long run does matter -- alive or dead.
Nevertheless, we're pushed down the slippery slope of an agenda based on haste.
On climate change, we were told that the time for languishing legislation is over. We need cap and trade to anoint the earth, mend the melting, and flush out the fossil fuels. The earth might not last 50 years -- maybe not even past the 2016 Summer Olympic Games! Dire stuff! And the green jobs, ah the green jobs. Like the square wheel, the linen helmet, and the dog sweater, they await our impatient ingenuity. One can only imagine the efficiencies and economies of scale that come from adding artificial organic flavor to the unnatural industry of green jobs. Nevertheless, the believers push an environmental euphoria on our market-based democracy, banging the drum of dispatch. We (with allowances for India, China, Eastern Europe, and, gosh, pretty much the entire Third World) have no time to lose. Now is, indeed, the time.
And then there is the third rail of this disorient express is -- health care. First there were 47, then 46, now maybe 30 million uninsured. These nameless and faceless individuals were given a story and a quick narrative. They are suffering unspeakable things and they need to be rescued. They will reap immediate benefits of Government's hand on the scales of health care. It's a matter of, if not life and death, health and sickness. Moreover, while saving the health of the 30-47 million, Congress and Mr. Obama will fix the economy. That's why it needs to be done now. That's why immediate action is required. Because it will improve the health care system and the economy. It's an infinite good. Like a band-aid that cures disease with no side effects. CBO numbers showing the massive expenses associated with such a plan are a nuisance to the pace and must be disregarded for the sake of expediency. Forget "slow" -- swift and steady wins the race.
The president is undaunted by town hall meetings and democratic dissent as he scolds his detractors through his myriad speeches and ministers -- dissent is a distraction to reform. He will not be distracted -- not on health care. After all, this affects the immediate safety and well-being of Americans. There is no "in the long run" on health care reform. In the short run, we're burdened by medical bills that someone else should pay. There is no time to discover why some people seem to fall through the cracks of the insurance industry through a bipartisan, healthy debate. The insurance industry is on Obama time, now. We all have a destiny with a legacy -- the Obama legacy. And there is only one way to reform health care -- with all deliberate speed.
Long, pregnant pause.
But on Afghanistan, silence. On Afghanistan, inertia. On Afghanistan, deliberation. On Afghanistan, wait and see. No lofty speeches, no altruistic arguments, no righteous reverberations. Afghanistan is the squeaky wheel that is grinding to a rusty and uncomfortable halt.
General Stanley A. McChrystal, the man hand-picked by Mr. Obama to lead the fight in Afghanistan, has called for reinforcements, dating back to August 30 of this year. According to the General, the need is urgent and a failure to enact swift and decisive action risks putting our troops on a march toward an irretrievable "failure." General McChrystal even used terms central to the Obama stimulus/health care/cap and trade talking points: inadequate, crisis, and serious. These are terms that Mr. Obama should be very familiar with. Depending on how Mr. Obama responds, very soon, these terms could describe the state of his presidency.
General McChrystal's report was nearly two months ago. In Obama terms, it was one trip to the International Olympic Committee, one national student address, one address to a joint session of Congress, and five Sunday talk shows ago -- and counting. Yet, in all of those opportunities to address the "crisis" facing our troops, there is a stark absence of leadership from the Oval Office. Rather than familiarizing himself with his favorite pejoratives, Mr. Obama is crouching behind one of President Bush's -- stay the course. Staying the course in Afghanistan won't cut it. Staying the course will get an increasing number of troops and civilians killed, and with staying the course, winning is out of the question.
Mr. Obama has slowed his electoral sprint to a screeching halt. His self-ascribed "war of necessity" rings hollow as the General's pleas go unrequited. But this battle has needs. Like the economy, like cap and trade, and like health care, it has a lot of needs. It needs stimulus. It needs a better environment. It needs health care.
General McChrystal has asked for more troops and the evidence that action is needed piles up -- as do the bodies. In Afghanistan, people aren't getting sick, as much as they are getting dead. We hear excuses of unseemly elections and voter fraud as justification for the Obama delay. But would a friendlier regime allow us to root out insurrection with even greater impunity? Doubtful. Is a friendlier regime than the Karzai administration even realistic? How and why would a regime change -- if that is the outcome of the pending runoff -- be relevant to our fighting this battle? It wouldn't change the identity of the civilians, the insurgents, or the troops on the ground. It's hard to understand how an election, fraudulent or not, has anything to do with our mission in Afghanistan -- unless we're anticipating an even more hostile regime. In which case, we have even more reason to get on with the business of winning, now.
As the days pile up, so does the economic difficulty of the Afghan people. As the silence continues, so does the exploitation of environmental resources in the fight for Afghan liberation, and as the days pile so do the health care problems of troops and civilians who are suffering the indelicacies of battle.
Maybe we are placing this war in the wrong context. Perhaps we need to look at it in terms of economic stimulus, environmental policy, and health care. Certainly that would get the attention of our Commander in Chief. Certainly that would present an opportunity for him to give Americans and Afghans some hope.
In the meantime, Keynes pithy statement will become increasingly prescient.

RESHAPING AMERICA
In 1966, two sociology professors, Richard Cloward and Francis Piven, outlined a plan calling for the overloading of America’s welfare system to precipitate a crisis that would perpetuate a new social scheme of guaranteed minimum income.
The “Cloward Piven Strategy” is still alive and well today and at work at our southern border.
With border patrol ordered to stand down, the floodgates have been opened and the mass influx of illegals will surely be utilized as an additional cog wheel for the strategy. It also goes without saying that the “border crisis” will eventually serve as extra fuel in the drive toward open borders and the advancement of the U.S. into a North American Union.
While visiting Brownsville, Texas, Nancy Pelosi stated that “this is a community with a border going through it” and that “what others are calling a crisis should be viewed as an opportunity.” But an opportunity for what or whom, exactly? Further integration, more spending, the propping up of a voter class that is subservient to the welfare state?
Huge problems should be foreseen when someone like David Petraeus (former CIA head and U.S. military commander) says “after America, there is North America.”
It seems as though an insidious agenda is unfolding as Obama reshapes America. People who are supporting amnesty and calling for open borders are ultimately supporting the end of America. What is a country without its borders? How much money can be spent on what number of people until we finally collapse into a third-world cesspit not unlike those from which the so-called “migrants/refugees” are trying to escape?
Speaking of which, Guatemala’s first lady, Rosa Leal de Perez, is on record stating that violence isn’t the reason kids are heading north, but rather kids are primarily traveling to the U.S. in order to reunite with family.
There is more than just a humanitarian crisis going on at the border. America better wake up before there is no longer an America left to wake up in!

EXCUSING THE INEXCUSABLE
It seems to me if corporations continue to be granted rights similar to those of the individual, they should also be subject to the laws and penalties regarding individuals.
If a corporation like Citigroup defrauds consumers, robbing millions of people of billions of dollars in life savings, someone should be brought up on charges of felony theft, complete with hefty prison sentences, rather than fines and/or penalties.
If “corporations are people, too,” then why do the rights of some (corporations) outweigh the rights of others (employees, consumers)?
If Hobby Lobby was owned by a Jehovah’s Witness, would it be able to deny its employees insurance coverage for blood transfusions, as it is now legally allowed to deny coverage of certain forms of birth control, claiming religious freedom?
Corporations are not people, they are institutions steered by groups of individuals who sometimes excuse inexcusable, immoral, and unethical behavior on the basis of a finely-tuned mob mentality.
If all are to blame, none is held accountable. We, or a majority of us, like to call ourselves a Christian nation, but our actions belie that notion.
God is not our chief deity, Mammon is.

FINDLAY HAS TOO MANY EYESORES
Having moved from Findlay earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit family and friends there a couple weeks ago. I was amazed at the “new happenings” that are taking place, like Marathon’s “little city” being built, among others.
What really was disheartening, if there is such a word, is that abandoned properties along U.S. 224 and Ohio 12, better known as Tiffin Avenue, have grass that is growing tall and the properties themselves are really an eyesore.
Some of these have real estate agent signs in the yard and some are probably in a banks’ hands. Those in charge of those properties should be responsible enough to keep the grass trimmed and the property presentable even for those who drive by.
This not only happens in that area but also in areas all over the city. I went back into the neighborhood (Dayton Avenue) where I grew up and was sickened by a property that has been vacant for a long time and is decaying slowly. The owner has thrown tarps over the dilapidated roof, and the property itself is deplorable.
Property values of the homes around it would probably be lessened due to the condition of this property. Why has this been allowed to happen?
I love the city but let’s not allow properties, whether Realtor-owned or bank-owned, to put a bad taste in our mouths.

BOARD SHOULD ABIDE BY RULING
I just read the update (Page A3, July 16) regarding Liberty-Benton school board voting to appeal the judge’s ruling in the Mark Badertscher firing case.
It’s time for the school board to stop throwing my tax money down this rathole. They should have listened to the arbitrator’s ruling.
I was going to vote in favor of the levy to build a new school, but because of this poor example of financial stewardship, I will be voting no and I urge everyone in Liberty-Benton School District to do the same.
I guess we’ll have to vote these clowns out at the next election.

Tea Party Ceramic Vase
A lovely centerpiece for a tea party or just to set in your windowsill for everyday decor, this ceramic vase takes some direction from the Mad Hatter in its design with a charming little bird and teacups stacked together.Oh boy, where do I begin. Honestly, I dreaded writing this review. At first glance, the premise seems like it has potential. A mafia boss and his family under the witness protection program are relocated to a sleepy town in France for snitching on the mob. Even under the surveillance of CIA Agent Stansfield and his men, things quickly go awry as The Manzonis, er The Blakes as they’re now called, have a hard time fitting in. Can’t teach old dogs new tricks they say, especially when those dogs are a Brooklyn mob family who are so set in their ways in dealing with problems.
Now, add a dream cast, well dream trio really: Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Tommy Lee Jones, naturally I expect at least a decent dark comedy. Alas, this turns out to be THE biggest dud I’ve seen on the big screen so far. I was pretty close on walking out a few times as the movie seemed to go on forever with barely a single laugh coming out of my mouth. Saying this movie is contrived is putting it mildly. Every single scene is seething with bad taste and every Mafia clichés imaginable, not to mention every French and Italian/American stereotypes. What’s worse, you can figure out the plot from miles away. Even the way the Brooklyn mafia clan find out where they live is so predictable it’s downright irritating.
It’s really quite painful to watch great actors in something this terrible. Y’know, sometimes I don’t mind ridiculous, heck, I’d even tolerate absurdity. But a comedy that’s entirely unfunny — especially with THIS cast — is excruciating. Trust me, I wish I didn’t have to be so harsh but I kept hoping for one redeeming moment, but nope, that moment never came. Ok, there is one scene towards the end but it’s so self aware at its own joke that it feels so forced and exploitative. That scene too, was entirely predictable! I could tell the whole theater wasn’t enjoying it as I didn’t hear much laughter from start to finish, maybe a chortle or two… or perhaps a snicker?
De Niro has done similar comedic role that’s poking fun of the mob in Analyze This. To be honest with you, I’m kind of tired of that shtick, it’s only fun for maybe two seconds. Now, De Niro and Pfeiffer didn’t exactly phone it in here, I give ’em that, but I’d think they’d recognize a bad script when they see it by now? I’m a big fan of Tommy Lee Jones with his deadpan delivery but here he looks bored the entire time, like he couldn’t be bothered. Hmmm, perhaps that should be a warning to moviegoers?
Tonally, it’s all over the place, Besson just can’t seem to get his footing on what kind of movie he wants to make. I think he aims for a dark comedy but his approach is more like ‘shooting in the dark and see what hits,’ resulting in a misfire no amount of talent could save. It’s astonishing to read later on that Martin Scorsese is one of the executive producer, wow!
The subplots involving the Manzoni’s kids are so uninspired, but not exactly the fault of the young actors. I think John D’Leo and Glee actress Dianna Agron were serviceable enough, D’Leo is especially believable as a sly kid who learned everything from his wiseguy dad. Agron’s role as a principled virgin who takes pleasure in beating people up is so oddly-written though. In any case, the family’s German Shepherd still made more of an impression to me than those two.
His expression just about sums up my sentiment about this movie
There are violent scenes and profanities abound here, which warrants the R-rating. Perhaps people who are into mob movies might dig this one more than I did, but, really fans of any of the main stars here deserve better. Sorry to De Niro fans out there, but I think this Screencrush reviewer said it best: Robert De Niro‘s name on a film project is now more a red flag of warning than a sign of quality. Same with Luc Besson I guess, so don’t expect this to be remotely as shrewd as The Professional and Transporter/Taken film. If you want an action comedy from Besson that’s actually watchable, I guess just rent or rewatch The Fifth Element. By the third act, I was hoping someone would actually take a hit at the whole Blake family and spare us from our misery. I use the word complacent in my review of The World’s End and that’s a word I could use for the major talents involved here, too. :(
It pains me to see such great actors involved in such a mess. You’ve saved me some money with this Ruth. Thanks! :)
It pains me too Chris! The trailer sort of warned me it’d be bad but I still held out hope… but alas :( It’s not even worth a rent to be honest.
Oh, Lord. Ruth you’ve taken the bullet for your readers by giving us the heads up. We shan’t forget you for this ;-)
Ahah, I felt compelled to write this review for that reason Michael! Even though I really want to forget that I watched such a stinker :( ;)
Whatever Tyson. But don’t say I didn’t warn ya! I don’t think any acting *god* could save this film, to be honest.
Haha! Exactly, man. It’s DeNiro for heavens sakes! He’s the man!! ;-)
You guys are too blinded by your love for De Niro, ahah. Fine, watch at your own risk ;)
Fine, we will! ;-)
Hope you get more out of it than I did then Mark :D
I certainly hope so Ruth. Like I was saying on your Ronin post, though. I don’t always automatically enjoy DeNiro’s movies. I’m hoping I can take something The Family but I do have reservations, if truth be told. :-)
Hmmm, if you didn’t like Ronin, I can’t imagine you like The Family. What didn’t you like about that one? I think De Niro’s very good there, an intelligent action guy :D! :D. ;-)
Ooo, you got me intrigued now Mark! Ok, let me know when that idea is up ok. I kind of have a feeling who you’re collaborating with ;)
We’ll be posting and going live very soon. I’m sure you won’t miss it. :-)
Wouldn’t miss it for the world, Mark! You know I always comment on every one of your post ;)
Very true Ruth. You have been my top commenter for a very long time now. Can’t thank you enough. :-) :(
The banter between De Niro and Jones are pretty enjoyable but it still won’t save this movie.
Damn, I really wanted this to be good! Nice review, though :). :D
Ahah, well at least it was free though time is too precious to be wasted on such a stinker!
Yikes! This looks like a forgettable film, but I won’t rule out the possibility of renting it. ;) :)
Malavita?? That makes no sense, I don’t know what that means either. Ahah, well watch at your own risk Akbar :D :D) |>>.
Next week, the U.S. government is going to sell almost $300 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds. I don’t recall the exact numbers or the mix of short and long term. Who is going to buy them? The biggest purchasers historically have been Japan and China. Japan is now going into a economic dive even worse than ours; two of their biggest banks have been found to have invested with Madoff. China has expressed worries about its bond investments, asked for guarantees, and is considering spending the money instead on imports and business investments. With stock markets crashing around the world, private investors such as, particularly, retirement funds may jump to the ostensibly safer bonds with guaranteed yields.
If the yields of bonds sold next week are high and the emphasis is on short term ones, we will have two nearly certain markers that the economy and government are in deep trouble, that investors are jumping ship. These markers would likely be associated with a dramatic fall in the U.S. stock market as investors jump to supposedly guaranteed high yield short term bonds.
There is a small hitch in this argument. The Federal Reserve is fighting high interest rates. The Fed is a private organization owned by ten or so large private American and European financial organizations. Since the Fed is privately held, it need not report ownership details. The Fed alone is permitted by the U.S. to print dollars and does so independently of U.S. government control. Thus, the Fed may and does print money in order to buy U.S. Treasury bonds as it sees fit to control the money supply, but presently owns only about 7 percent of the national debt. In the past few months, it has been printing money by the many billions, some say as much as 10 trillion, of dollars and loaning them out at no interest to both American and foreign financial institutions. The shareholder banks are paid a fixed 6 percent dividend on earnings; any additional revenue is given to the U.S. Treasury.
The Fed has announced that it is prepared to save the U.S. Treasury bond market by buying as many bonds as necessary, of course with their bogus money. Conservative economists are deeply afraid that the piles of money the Fed is printing and scattering around will destroy trust in the enduring value of the dollar; on the other hand, some liberal economists have concluded it will require trillions more to restart the economy than anyone is discussion, but they also fear this would bankrupt the country. In fact, during almost all of the past thirty years, the dollar has been falling with respect to other currencies and now continues in decline. One problem with that is that if I consider loaning you (from Dubai), say, $1,000 today, perhaps by buying bonds with 5 percent return over 5 years, and project the dollar will sink that far or farther in that time relative to my national currency, I must conclude this would be a foolish, stupid, investment. An old rule: anything in excess will lose value and the dollar is providing an example.
If the Fed gets into the U.S. Treasury bond market in a big way to save it, it will likely unnaturally drive down yields and make bond sales uninteresting to private investors while making the Fed the dominant U.S. creditor; i.e. we’ll be owned by the Fed. Funny stuff going on here. Wall Street, the Fed, and the U.S. Treasury Department are so entangled, its difficult to se what is happening, but it appears they are, it is, fighting for survival. But there is no there there except for a lot of phony money. The country has been robbed blind, so they are trying to finish striping the world out there and the world out there is objecting.
There are other bond classes of interest as well: Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac and Municipals, those issued by state and local government entities. The first two may be seen as secure as U.S. Treasury bonds, or not depending upon housing prices and foreclosure rate – Asian investors are now saying they aren’t interested unless these bonds are entirely guaranteed by the U.S. government. On the other hand, Municipal bonds are selling only at very high yield rates, if they can be sold at all.
Note that the U.S. government is only able to pay the interest on its bonds by selling more bonds, at least for the foreseeable, some say imaginable, future. In other words, this is all a Ponzi scheme began by the Bush administration almost 8 years ago and now being continued by Obama’s. Though Madoff had a good run, Ponzi schemes are assured to ultimately fail. In this case, it will be when bonds can’t be sold for any yield (except to the Fed), at which point no one will accept dollars as payments for anything; Zimbabwe is now issuing currency in 10 trillion face values and that will hardy buy a loaf of bread. Of course, Obama assures us that the economy will eventually grow and revenues will become sufficient for yield payments and maybe to reduce the national debt, but he counsels patience, that it may take several years. Investors must make the call as to whether this will happen or not and no economist on Earth is qualified to advise them. Indeed, it appears most economists are scared to death. We are living in extraordinarily interesting times.

The political world in Colorado was abuzz the last few days amid word that GOP political consultant Dick Wadhams may be returning to the state to run for chair of the state Republican Party. It's a job you couldn't pay me to do, which is good, since it doesn't pay. But more on that in a minute. The reason Wadhams' name is of such interest is because he is a seasoned pro who has directed more big political wins than most (including Sen. Wayne Allard's two campaigns and the 1988 gubernatorial race for Gov. Bill Owens). He shot to national prominence in 2004 by guiding John Thune to an upset victory over then-Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle in South Dakota. But Wadhams quick rise came to a grinding halt this year when his latest candidate â€“ Virginia Sen. George Allen â€“ was upset in his bid for re-election by Democrat Jim Webb. Allen was poised to run for President in 2008, which is why Wadhams was there, before he self-destructed as a candidate in August (you may remember the "Macaca" racial slur that Allen used). Nobody really blames Wadham for that loss, because Allen's gaffe was really impossible to recover from, but now he's a consultant without a candidate, which is why he may come back to Colorado to head up a decimated Republican Party. If I were Wadhams, I wouldn't do it. I say this because I don't think running the state Republican Party would be a lot of fun. The GOP is fractured in Colorado because of a rift between the conservative and moderate wings that was ripped open further with the Bob Beauprez/Marc Holtzman (almost) gubernatorial primary. Conservatives save their worst venom for their own fellow Republicans, whom they call "RINOs" (Republicans In Name Only) and work to defeat at the cost of general election victories. Meanwhile, the moderate candidates aren't very good (Beauprez and Rick O'Donnell, for example), and there aren't a lot of up-and-coming candidates to push for higher office. Two of the state's three Republican congressional representatives â€“ Marilyn Musgrave and Doug Lamborn â€“ are so far on the fringes of the conservative side that they will never advance beyond their current posts, and the highest-ranked Republican in the state (Allard) is probably going to retire rather than run again for re-election. As if that wasn't bad enough, the state legislature and the governor's mansion belong to Democrats, and the Republicans who are still around at the state capitol are largely a silly bunch who spend their time sticking their foots in their mouths. Being a party chair is never a glorious job anyway, and even if you win you can lose; the 2004 Democratic Party Chair, Chris Gates, was ousted the following spring even though the Dems won back the legislature under his watch. With the rise of outside political groups, most candidates don't pay much attention to the Party's directions anyway. And for all that, you get to take home a salary of zero. That's right - the job doesn't pay anything, unless the GOP changes its Party bylaws, which it may do to accommodate Wadhams. Wadhams was in line to head up a Presidential campaign until his candidate imploded, and now he's apparently considering running the Colorado Republican Party. Maybe he's gotten tired of winning races and raking in big salaries and decided it would be fun to bash his head against a wall â€“ for free - for two years. It would be a big boost to Republicans if Wadhams did decide to take the job, because he's one of the better political minds out there, but I sure as hell wouldn't do it. When you've climbed nearly to the top of your profession, why would you want to go back down?Latest News

Scorpion Solitaire.Texas books from '09 worth looking at
SAN ANGELO, Texas - Each year around this time, I go back and look at the Texas books I’ve written about in the past 12 months and try to pick my favorite 10.
Of course, it is a subjective list. The 10 books are ones I particularly liked, for one reason or another. They are not necessarily the 10 most significant Texas books of the year, or even the 10 “best,” whatever that is.
But they are my Top 10 books I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to you. I do try to include a variety of topics and interests in my list, some fiction as well as nonfiction, maybe a children’s book or a cookbook, some elegant coffee table volumes.
Here they are, in no particular order, my Top 10 Texas Books of 2009.
“Historic Texas from the Air” by Gerald Saxon, David Buisserer, Richard Francaviglia and photos by Jack W. Graves Jr. (University of Texas Press, $45) is a colorful and informative coffee table book that focuses on 73 historic sites. Graves’ aerial photographs are the highlight of the book, but each photo is accompanied by a page or two of text explaining the site’s significance. This one deserves a place in every Texan’s library.
“Lovin’ That Lone Star Flag” by photographer E. Joe Deering (Texas A&M University Press, $29.95) is a wonderful collection of photographs of the many creative ways that Texans display the Texas flag.
“Time of the Rangers” by Mike Cox (Forge, $27.95) is the second volume of his comprehensive two-volume history of the Texas Rangers, 10 years in the making. “Sex, Murder and the Unwritten Law” by Bill Neal (Texas Tech University Press, $29.95 hardcover), the third in his frontier justice series, is a lively read about — well, just what the title says. “The Color of Lightning” by Paulette Jiles (William Morrow, $25.99 hardcover) is a novel based on the true story of ex-slave Britt Johnson, who settled in Comanche territory in West Texas in the 1860s. “The Big Rich: The Rise and Fall of the Greatest Texas Oil Fortunes” by Bryan Burrough (Penguin, $29.95 hardcover) focuses on the oilmen who became known as the Big Four — Roy Cullen of Houston, Sid Richardson of Fort Worth, and Clint Murchison and H.L. Hunt of Dallas. “Batty About Texas” by J. Jaye Smith (Pelican, $15.95, illustrated by Kathy Coates) was my favorite children’s book about Texas published this year. It is an informative and entertaining look at the Mexican free-tailed bat, the type that lives under the Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin.
“Other Men’s Horses” by the late Elmer Kelton, the beloved Western author from San Angelo who passed away in August (Forge, $24.99). Kelton completed two more novels in his Texas Ranger series before he died, and this is the first of them. It is one of my Top 10 favorites, both for sentimental reasons and because it is a very good read.
“Looking for Lucy Gilligan & Other Stories” by Murray Edwards ($22.95 trade paperback), a delightful self-published collection of 19 short stories and one of my personal favorites of the year. “Music in the Kitchen” by Glenda Pierce Facemire (UT Press, $34.95) is a very different kind of cookbook, a collection of favorite recipes from musicians who have performed on “Austin City Limits.” It includes recipes from dozens of well-known entertainers such as Willie Nelson, Robert Earl Keen, the Dixie Chicks, Los Lonely Boys and B.B. King. Color photos of the singers, rather than the food, accompany the selections.
Honorable Mentions
Two new series of biographies for children about Texas heroes were launched by Bright Sky Press in 2009, one for children ages 5-7, the other for ages 8-11. Veteran children’s author Mary Dodson Wade is the principal writer for both series.
“Historic Photos of Texas Lawmen” and “Historic Photos of Texas Oil,” both by the aforementioned Mike Cox, are great collections of black and white photos tracing the history of Texas law enforcement and oil exploration. Each book is $39.95 (Turner Publishing).
“Jon Bonnell’s Fine Texas Cuisine” (Gibbs Smith, $30) is an upscale Texas cookbook by a Fort Worth chef and restaurateur. Gorgeous color photographs and recipes for such exotic dishes as Rocky Mountain Elk Tacos, Quail Raviolis and Texas Ostrich Fan Fillet.
“Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde” by Jeff Guinn (Simon & Schuster, $27) is a well-researched and well-written profile of the famous crime couple published on the 75th anniversary of their death.

Annotation
This its camp is populated by about 20,000 people who live under economically exploitative and impoverished conditions. The boy seen here works as a quimbalatero, or stone crusher, who quarries ore from gold-bearing rocks by striking them with a heavy hammer.
The image was taken as documentation of child labor by a photographer for the International Labour Organization (ILO) for its International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) project. According to ILO definitions, unacceptable types of child labor are those that can be harmful to physical and mental development, to children’s dignity, and of a kind that “deprives children of their childhood.” Such child labor should be eliminated if it is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children; if it interferes with their schooling by preventing them from attending school, obligates them to leave school prematurely, or requires excessively long and heavy work so as to compromise children's ability to attend school or learn effectively. Mining work such as this meets the criteria as harmful because it exposes child workers to hazards of extreme cold, is physically demanding, and provides no protection for their eyes and hands. Children in mining camps are routinely exposed to mercury poisoning in so-called “artisanal mines,” family mining operations in which whole families are employed, sometimes including toddlers. Such operations often produce tiny amounts of gold by quarrying flakes from large quantities of rock, bringing in very little income for the expense in time and toxic exposure.
A recent ILO Global Report "The end of child labor: Within reach" published in 2006 showed that Latin American and Caribbean countries have experienced declining numbers of child laborers. Projects such as Bolsa Familia in Brazil offers families financial incentives to send their children to school, in addition to citing employers who exploit children, and educating parents and older children on the hazards of child labor. The number of children at work in the region has fallen by two-thirds, with just 5 percent of children now engaged in unsatisfactory child labor. The IPEC project in La Rinconada works to help families access health, education, and nutrition services, and to address working conditions for adults in the mines.

Abstract:ABSTRACT
Recent years have witnessed a concern among theological bioethicists that secular debate has grown increasingly “thin,” and that “thick” religious traditions and their spokespersons have been correspondingly excluded. This essay disputes that analysis. First, religious and theological voices compete for public attention and effectiveness with the equally “thick” cultural traditions of modern science and market capitalism. The distinctive contribution of religion should be to emphasize social justice in access to the benefits of health care, challenging the for-profit global marketing of research and biotechnology to wealthy consumers. Second, religion and theology have been and are still socially effective in sponsoring activism for practical change, both locally and globally. This claim will be supported with specific examples; with familiar concepts like subsidiarity and “middle axioms”; and with recent analyses of “participatory democracy” and of emerging, decentralized forms of global governance.

:)Oh hi guys. I know I wrote three months ago that I probably wouldn’t be touching my blog again for two years. And yet, here I am. Here is the explanation.
I was diagnosed with high anxiety levels about a month ago. Since then, I’ve been on antidepressants and started behavioural therapy. However, the high anxiety levels have probably been around for a while – at least a year, I’m guessing – and they probably contributed to me not wanting to write here. Meanwhile, the antidepressants have been working very well, and I’m much more enthusiastic about blogging as well as work, and all my other projects – so if this state of affairs continues, blogging should become regular again. Yay for sertraline!
Also, my pyschologist has told me to blog as part of my therapy. Whatay.
If I’m able to get over the anxiety and improve my time management skills, there should probably be a podcast about really awful books starting here soon.
And now, back to regular programming.Civil Liberties Watch: First Amendment Under Pressure
Although it is becoming more clear by the day that the embassy attacks in the middle east last week were not merely the result of an inflammatory movie, but a planned and well-orchestrated attack, the voices seeking to weaken the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution are becoming more shrill.
A professor of religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania, Althea Butler, wrote that the maker of the film should be imprisoned. Hilariously, she even touts her status as a tenured professor to trot out the obligatory, “yes, I support freedom of speech, but…” (There’s always a “but,” isn’t there?) Journalist Mike Barnicle said that the preacher Terry Jones, who had merely promoted the film, should be arrested. Naturally, his fellow journalist Donny Deutsch was quick to agree. Many supposedly liberal celebrities called for the filmmakers to be punished. The White House confirmed that it had requested Youtube to remove the film, which, to their credit, they refused to do.

My question is a little off topic and rhetorical. How is it that at all of the protests that we see on CNN and other networks coming out of the middle east all of the signs are in english?
@bkgreenfeet Get out your barf bag before reading this:
@SEAN SPOONTS Right, and I beT her type would be the first to have a conniption if someone wanted to limit freedom of the press!
@Icegator Agreed. But look at the reaction of Ms Eltahawy to free speech she doesn't like; censorship, vandalism and denounciation. She has no idea what free speech is. She's a garden variety fascist.
@SEAN SPOONTS That was a flippin hilarious video. I felt bad for the lady who got her sweater trashed, but, WOW! That Mona-Lisa chick was off the scale. I could hear the voice of my dad saying, "Steve, A little knowledge is a dangerous thing." My old man gets smarter all the time.I'm back with another post! Over the summer I've done a bit of traveling. With that, comes ways to pack as efficiently as possible, especially when it comes to my makeup. I want something that is roomy, organized and affordable. I recently found a great option from Target. I also shoot an entire video showing you all the makeup I packed from the NY Makeup Show. Check it out!
I got this travel makeup bag from Target for about $20. I love how you can fit A LOT in it! Even when you pack it full, the metallic snap easily shuts closed.
In this section I keep all my face products.
I put all of my lip products in one of the small pouches since that takes less room. This two middle pouches can snap out if you want, but I found it was a little hard to snap them back in, so they'll stay attached.
This small pouch carries all of my travel sized makeup brushes. It's the perfect size to securely hold my smaller handled travel brushes without squishing them. Most of these brushes are from Sigma or bdellium tools. I also throw in tools like tweezer, scissors, and q-tips.
I love that you can hold a lot in here, I packed a bunch of makeup for the NY Makeup Show and had a lot of room. When you have less makeup to pack, you can use the other compartments for toiletries. I just wish it had some kind of hook to hang it from a bathroom door if necessary. But I guess since you need to open it flat it doesn't need one because everything would fall out lol.
You can find this at your local Target in the cosmetic bag section near the makeup aisles. Hope you have a great weekend, Ciao Bellas!

Two Become One
met
Through shaded eyes the room is muted into greys and gentle shadows; its harsh, antiseptic light grows softer in the dimness. On the bed, the other stirs, his body battered close to death, his mind fogged with disorientation eased by nurturing smile. Playing the hallucination, the non-existent fantasy, his fresh newborn perfection grows surreal by the reality of weathered flesh and seasoned bone. He sees him, impossible phantom, like a dream just out of reach; struggles to grasp and comprehend the foreign self-extension, but he slips away in silence to leave him in tender mechanical care.
spoke
Rope whipping the ground in cruel snapping strokes of his frustration; bottled hate unleashed on patient floor, worked muscles straining to feel real its bodied identity. The other shuffles by, his dazed gaze trailing across the features on his face, over his stubborn physical exertion. He takes on the role of ghost now, and steals, in puzzlement, away.
The pound and thwack of feet and rope take on a deadening rhythm. He's an automaton; man-made; inhuman; robot; a program housed in a parody of human form-
The other is back. He drops the rope, throws punches at a bag. Resentful fists fly in angry blows. The other tries to speak. Lost in routine, he barely hears. He doesn't want to hear. An invisible barrier stands erect in cold avoidance borne of tension. Words fall limply on deaf ears. He tries to block the intruding voice, the pleading voice, familiar voice. Drops short replies with perfunctory curtness and wishes he would go away.
Handshake: denied.
played
Ball traces path from him to him; from practiced hand to amateur counterpart. Adjusting nets and boundaries. Drawing lines, setting limits, carving selves.
touched
Teeth grit in violent anger, fingers digging deep in shoulders. Forceful grips with sudden strength in desperate struggle for control; from new perspectives he makes contact with his arms, his back, his hair. They are both his and yet a stranger's, both so known and yet unknown. Wrestles back his own identity from a weakened, ageing self. Delivers slamming blows, cathartic throws; the other falls, defeated.
discovered
Mortality.
knew
Packaged selves in subterranean metal boxes laid in rows. Slumbering in static rest: do clones dream of repeated sheep? Personal belongings sealed in bags: attachments manufactured, built to order, uniqueness churned out by machine. Life stories written in duplicate. Shared pasts, shared lives, shared destines,
shared
Outdated pain of love now lost, homes not to be re-entered. Kin rendered stranger; imagined kin, by-product of false fantasy. Lives out of sync sunk in illusion; willing delusion, reinforced. Thoughts of green grass and rays of sun, of rich soil moist with morning dew, of buildings yearning for the sky and people living out their lives in heterogeneous paths alone. Unreal, the shifting mindscapes lead him deeper in the known deception. The moon is all he's ever known; the moon is his, his native home.
felt
Warm skin against his brushing fingers, soft concern in anxious voice. Together in unspoken thoughts they ponder their existence. What is death, and what is life; what is love, what's sacrifice.
died
Memories entwine in bottled air in the quiet of reminiscence. The other's time comes to an end; his laugh grows dim, his smile grows faint within his suit of foreign skin.
And two
become one.
departed
He does not stir the newborn's sleep. His journey is his own.
"We're not programmed," he tells the face of eager emotion writ on screen. "We're people. Understand?"
The naive smile is hard to read; he knows not if it understands.
But for himself: he hopes he does, he hopes he has, as his transport speeds towards the Earth, that magic place he knows from dreams, that alien land soon to be home.

Semi-insulating semiconductor heterostructures: Optoelectronic properties and applications85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
This review covers a spectrum of optoelectronic properties of and uses for semi-insulating semiconductorheterostructures and thin films, including epilayers and quantum wells. Compensation by doping, implantation, and nonstoichiometric growth are described in terms of the properties of point defects and Fermi level stabilization and pinning. The principal optical and optoelectronic properties of semi-insulating epilayers and heterostructures, such as excitonic electroabsorption of quantum-confined excitons, are described, in addition to optical absorption by metallic or semimetallic precipitates in these layers. Low-temperature grownquantum wells that have an arsenic-rich nonstoichiometry and a supersaturated concentration of grown-in vacancies are discussed. These heterostructures experience transient enhanced diffusion and superlattice disordering. The review discusses the performance of optoelectronic heterostructures and microcavities that contain semi-insulating layers, such as buried heterostructure stripe lasers, vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, and optical electroabsorption modulators. Short time-scale applications arise from the ultrashort carrier lifetimes in semi-insulating materials, such as in photoconductors for terahertz generation, and in saturable absorbers for mode-locking solid state lasers. This review also comprehensively describes the properties and applications of photorefractive heterostructures. The low dark-carrier concentrations of semi-insulating heterostructures make these materials highly sensitive as dynamic holographicthin films that are useful for adaptive optics applications. The high mobilities of free carriers in photorefractive heterostructures produce fast dielectric relaxation rates that allow light-induced space-charge gratings to adapt to rapidly varying optical fringe patterns, canceling out environmental noise during interferometric detection in laser-based ultrasound, and in optical coherence tomography. They are also the functional layers in high-sensitivity dynamic holographicmaterials that replace static holograms in Fourier imaging systems and in experimental Tbit/s optical systems. Semi-insulating heterostructures and their applications have attained a degree of maturity, but many critical materials science issues remain unexplored.

Constant height scanning tunneling spectroscopy using an alternating voltage signal85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
A method of performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) at a constant height while maintaining feedback control is described. By using sinusoidal voltage oscillations the ac tunneling current can be separated from the displacement current present in current–voltage measurements. The method allows statistically well averaged spectra spanning both occupied and unoccupied states of the sample to be obtained from a continuous set of curves. The unoccupied state on graphite is observed using the technique described, and the utility of the technique is further demonstrated by the detection of several bulk states on and two transition metal dichalcogenides. A weighting towards k perpendicular states is seen in the STS spectra. These results show that the fast alternating current form of STS is suitable for probing low amplitude electron states on metal surfaces within 2 eV of the Fermi level.

When the intensity of one arm of an interferometer changes from greater to less (or less to greater) than that of another, a phase jump of will take place if the phase difference between two arms is prefixed at π. We call this phenomenon phase jump. To demonstrate phase jump, a modified differential heterodyneinterferometer has been setup. The intensity of one arm is modulated as the arm is scanning across an edge. Both theoretical and experimental investigations are conducted in detail. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that the phase slope of the phase jump is infinite and the amplitude of output signal is zero when a phase jump occurs. Meanwhile the position of phase jump is very sensitive to the displacement. Therefore, both phase and amplitude signals of phase jump are suitable for precise position index and may find wide potential applications in the fields of edge detection, alignment, optical storage, and so on.
Xenon–neon gas proportional scintillation counters: Experimental and simulation results85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
When gas proportional scintillation counters (GPSC) are used to detect very low energy x rays, the addition of the light noble gas neon to the usual xenon filling improves the collection of primary electrons that originate near the detector window. However, xenon–neon mixtures have lower electroluminescence yields than pure xenon. Increasing the scintillation electric field jeopardizes the energy resolution because of the additional fluctuations introduced by electron multiplication. In this work we investigate the effect of a limited amount of charge multiplication on the electroluminescence yield and the energy resolution R of a xenon–neon GPSC using both Monte Carlo simulation and experimental measurements. We consider xenon–neon mixtures with 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% Xe at a total pressure of 800 Torr. Comparing the experimental and Monte Carlo data for 5.9 keV x rays, we conclude that optimum value of R is reached in a region of weak ionization with a charge gain of less than 2. By extrapolating the experimental results for R to infinite light yield we obtain the intrinsic energy resolution for 5.9 keV x rays in all mixtures. From these results we can predict Fw values, where F is the relative variance in the number of primary electrons (the Fano factor) and w is the mean energy required to produce a primary electron. From a comparison between Monte Carlo and experimental electroluminescence yields, F and w values are estimated for 5.9 keV x rays in the various mixtures.

Two-plane focusing of high-space-charge sheet electron beams using periodically cusped magnetic fields85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
Numerical and theoreticalanalyses show that stable, two-plane focusing of finite width, elliptical cross section, sheet electron beams with high space charge (low voltage, high current density) can be accomplished using periodically cusped-magnetic (PCM) fields. Magnetic field strength requirements for focusing high-space-charge sheet beams are within technological capabilities of modern permanent magnettechnology. Both an offset-pole PCM stack and a PCM stack combined with a periodic quadrupole magnet (PQM) edge array are shown to be effective for two-plane sheet beam confinement. The PCM-PQM hybrid configuration offers inherent advantages for independent adjustment of confinement fields to achieve beam matching (minimum ripple) in both transverse dimensions. The offset-pole configuration offers the advantage of open-side access for applications such as vacuum electronic microwave devices. It is also shown that PCM-focused sheet beam envelope stability obeys criteria equivalent to that previously identified for round-cross-section electron beams in periodic permanent magnet focusing.
Noise and coupling in magnetic super-resolution media for magneto-optical readout85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
Interfacial magnetic coupling, transient thermal response, and carrier and noise levels are investigated for two central aperture detection magnetic super-resolution disks. In one of the disks, the two magnetic layers are exchange-coupled, while in the other the coupling is of magneto-static nature. For the exchange-coupled disk, the coupling between the two magnetic layers is fairly strong, and the Kerr loop of the readout layer does not have a square shape. For the magneto-statically coupled disk, the strength of coupling depends on the nonuniformity of the magnetization of the storage layer. The readout layer has a square Kerr loop, but its perpendicular magnetization in the hot region under the focused spot has random orientation if the stray field from the storage layer is weak. This random orientation of magnetization within the readout layer gives rise to a high level of noise during readout.
Laser-frequency mixing in a scanning tunneling microscope at 1.3 μm85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
The radiation of two single-mode diode lasers at 1.3 μm is focused into the tunneling junction of a scanning tunneling microscope, and gigahertz difference-frequency signals radiated from the tip are detected. Simultaneous measurements of the bias-voltage dependence of the mixing signal and the tunneling current for different surface samples show that the mixing process is due to the nonlinearity of the static current–voltage characteristic of the tunneling junction. The coupling of the laser radiation into the junction conforms to antenna theory. The experimental results are compared with previous measurements at a laser wavelength of 9.3 μm. Surface images produced by means of the difference-frequency signal show the chemical contrast between micron-sized Au islands and a graphite substrate.
Near-field optical microscopy of thin photonic crystal films85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
Near-field optical microscopy is used to image the light propagating in a -on-silica film with a strip of deeply etched submicron holes in the center. Fringe patterns created by interference between incident and diffracted guided modes are observed in the smooth waveguide surrounding the large air-hole photonic film. Observation of the fields in the photonic crystal regions indicates that out-of-plane scattering at the smooth/periodic transitions and leakage caused by grating coupling play major roles. The effects of different air-hole sizes and lattice pitches are also explored.
Ultrasonic pulse compression with one-bit time reversal through multiple scattering85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
We present experimental results that demonstrate the feasibility of one-bit time reversal even through high-order multiple scattering. A short ultrasonic pulse is transmitted and propagates through a random set of steel rods. The scattered waves are recorded on a 128-channel array, time reversed, and retransmitted through the same medium. The time-reversal mirror takes advantage of multiple scattering to compress the scattered waves into a pulse and focus it back onto the source. Paradoxically, we show that the results are even better when the scattered signals are digitized over one bit. Both temporal and spatial resolutions remain unchanged, while the compressed pulse is amplified by 12 dB, and the signal-to-noise ratio is lowered by 1.2 dB. A statistical model is developed, and its predictions are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.
Detection efficiency of microparticles in laser breakdown water analysis85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
Polystyrene and silica particles in pure water were successfully detected to a size as small as 0.04 μm by the laser breakdown method. In conventional experimental conditions, detection efficiency has been extremely low, since breakdown occurs only when a particle happens to be present in a narrow focal region during a short laser pulse duration. Through the use of a long focal length lens, which expanded the high power density region without inducing water breakdown around the focal point, efficiency was notably enhanced. Ultrasonicaggregation of particles was also observed to enhance efficiency.
Ion energy distributions in inductively coupled radio-frequency discharges in argon, nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, and their mixtures85(1999);

We report ion energy distributions, relative ion intensities, and absolute total ion current densities at the grounded electrode of an inductively coupled Gaseous Electronics Conference radio-frequency reference cell for discharges generated in pure argon, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, and in mixtures of argon with , , and . Measuredcurrent densities are significantly greater for pure argon and for mixtures containing argon than for pure , , and . For all three molecular gases, the ratio of molecular ions to the fragment ions decreases when argon is added to the molecular gas discharges. A possible destruction mechanism for the molecular ions involving metastable argon is discussed.
Ion energy distributions in pulsed large area microwave plasma85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
The energy and the flux of ions impinging on surfaces exposed to low pressure plasmas are important factors which determine the chemical structure and the physical properties of the surfaces and of the thin films. In the present work, we use a large area microwave (MW) plasma reactor in which a grounded sample holder is exposed to a MW (2.45 GHz) discharge excited in different gases, such as Ar, and He, at a pressure ranging from 50 to 200 mTorr. A three-grid, differentially pumped ion energy analyzer is used to measure the ion energydistribution functions (IEDF). The use of a pulsed plasma gives rise to a structured IEDF in which the mean ion energy values vary between 2 and 10 eV. The pulse frequency and the duty cycle were found to strongly affect the IEDF and the ion flux. The evolution of the IEDF is analyzed in terms of the pulsed plasma global model, used to derive the characteristic time constants of plasma ignition and plasma decay. It is shown that the ions in the low energy portion of the IEDF originate from the time period between the individual power pulses, and their relative contribution increases with decreasing the duty time. Controlled pulsing thus allows one to selectively adjust the ion energy, and thereby the surface phenomena in materials processing which are primarily influenced by ion bombardment.
Numerical analysis of shroud gas effects on air entrainment into thermal plasma jet in ambient atmosphere of normal pressure85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
A numerical analysis of the influence of air entrainment into the plasma jet on the thermal plasmacharacteristics is performed to provide a design basis for nontransferred plasma torches operated in an ambient air of atmospheric pressure along with shroud gas injection. The assumption of steady-state, axisymmetric, local thermodynamic equilibrium, and optically thin plasma is adopted in a two-dimensional modeling of thermal plasma flow with an annular shroud gas shell. A control volume method and a modified semi-implicit pressure linked equations revised algorithm (known as SIMPLER) are used for solving the governing equations, i.e., the conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy along with the equations describing the so-called model for flow turbulent kinetic energy (K) and its dissipation rate (ε), and the mass fraction equations for gas mixing. The two-dimensional distributions of temperature and flow velocity of the thermal plasma jet as well as the air mole fraction mixed with the plasma are found in an exterior jet expanding region outside the torch, and they are compared for the two cases with and without shroud gas injection. As a result of calculations, the flow rate of the injected shroud gas and the location of its injector turn out to be major parameters for controlling ambient air entrainment. The calculations also reveal that the annular injection of shroud gas surrounding the plasma jet reduces air entrainment into the plasma jet remarkably while it does not significantly affect the plasma temperature and velocity. The present numerical modeling suggests the optimum design and operating values of an argon shroud gas injector for minimizing air entrainment into the thermal plasma flame ejected from the nontransferred plasma torch operated at normal pressure in the ambient atmosphere.
Computed electron oscillation inside the duct of a vacuum arc source85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
A three-dimensional numerical model has been developed to simulate the motion of electrons inside the duct of a vacuum arc metal source. It is found that electrons will travel back and forth along the center axis inside the duct tube. This phenomenon of electron oscillation can be explained by the combined effects of the electric and magnetic fields. The electron oscillation will increase the charge state of the positive ions and the ions will gain more energy. Due to the influence of electron oscillation, the plasma throughput of the duct will be different from that of a duct under the influence of only the magnetic field. This finding should be taken into account when designing metal arc sources and optimizing their performance.
The effect of magnetic field configuration on plasma beam profiles in curved magnetic filters85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
Curved magnetic filters are commonly used with cathodic vacuum arcs to remove macroparticles from the plasma stream, making it suitable for the preparation of smooth, dense, and defect free films. Although a variety of filters have been investigated experimentally, the influence of the magnetic field configuration on the shape and position of the plasma beam at the filter exit has not been recognized. In this work the magnetic field configurations for a wide range of filter designs have been calculated and compared with measured beam profiles. The results show that the field configurations can be used to predict the dimensions of the plasma beam and in-plane off-axis shifts at the filter exit, as well as identifying regions of high loss. Magnetic field configuration calculations are shown to be a valuable design and optimization tool for curved magnetic field filters of various designs.

Does plastic deformation proceed near thermodynamic equilibrium? The case made for shear-strained lamellar diblock copolymers85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
Observations on kink bands in lamellar diblock copolymers (SEP 40–70), caused by unidirectional or oscillatory shear strain, are interpreted in terms of the low-energy structure(LES) hypothesis, to wit: “In a material subject to mechanical stresses, that structure will be approached which has the lowest free energy among all structures which are in equilibrium with the tractions and are accessible to the system.” This is the generalization of the low-energy dislocationstructure (LEDS) hypothesis applicable to dislocationstructures in crystalline materials. In agreement with the LES hypothesis, moderate fatigue cycling of initially disordered material establishes an order such that the plane of the lamellae is parallel to the plane of shear stress application, being the orientation of lowest shear modulus and, hence, for fixed fatigue amplitude, of lowest strain energy. At fatigue strain amplitudes above about 40% the material develops kink bands on account of the compressive stress along the body diagonal of the samples. The geometry of these kink bands shows that the plane parallel to the lamellae serves as preferred slip plane with the lowest resistance against sliding among all possible directions. Also the kink band morphology conforms with the LES hypothesis. Specifically, on average the ratio of kink band length (L) to the square of kink band width (W), i.e., is nearly constant as expected from the minimization of kink band boundary energy and the elastic strain energy on account of the strain discontinuity at the ends of the bands. Subsequent experiments on a different copolymer in a range of temperatures additionally verify the LES hypothesis through establishing that, throughout, large-amplitude cycling causes the lamella orientation of lowest shear modulus.
Amorphization of Zr–Al solid solutions under mechanical alloying at different temperatures85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
The effects of temperature on the amorphization of Zr–Al solid solutions have been investigated by ball millingpowder blends at different temperatures. At low milling temperatures, the Zr–Al solid solutions amorphized under the polymorphic constraint imposed by intensive external forcing. At elevated temperatures, the solid solution and the amorphous phases coexisted in an obvious two-phase region, signaling a transition approaching two-phase metastable equilibrium. The Al concentration needed for the complete amorphization of Zr–Al increased with increasing milling temperature. These observations, and in particular, the apparent reentrant liquidus, can be explained in terms of the temperature dependence of the external forcing effects brought in by the nonequilibrium milling process in this dynamic driven system.
Simulation of void and oxygen precipitation processes during high temperature annealing of silicon wafers85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
The kinetics for dissolution/growth of defects in Czochralski silicon wafers during a 1 h high temperature annealing at 1100 °C has been investigated. The size and distribution of point defects such as vacancy, self-interstitial and oxygen interstitial, are simulated for oxygen and hydrogen ambient annealing. The boundary conditions are analyzed separately for hydrogen and oxygen annealing. A deterministic homogeneous model is used for describing the defect kinetics. The self-interstitial injection rate during oxide annealing is calculated from the Deal-Grove model. Simulated void and oxygen size distributions are compared to B- and C-mode capacitor failure distribution functions. Experimental and theoretical data show that voids can be dissolved during either oxygen or hydrogen annealing, while oxygen precipitates are dissolved during hydrogen annealing and only partially dissolved during oxygen annealing.
Effects of laser mode and scanning direction on melt pool shape85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
A three-dimensional quasi-steady-state mathematical model is presented for laser heating with a multimode beam. The effects of laser beam scanning direction on the melt pool shape are investigated through the conduction analysis without phase change. The maximum temperature is found to be behind the center of the focal spot due to advection. The isotherms ahead of the focal spot bunch together and spread apart behind the focal spot on the surface of the workpiece due to the same effect. The temperature profile shows four distinct peaks as a result of four intensity peaks. Scanning direction affects the melt pool shape which needs to be considered for high precision cutting applications such as integrated circuit cutting. The melt pool shape is found to be symmetric about the x axis in the plane and z axis in the plane for the scanning angles and −90°, however it is asymmetric for other scanning angles.
Measurement of elastic modulus, Poisson ratio, and coefficient of thermal expansion of on-wafer submicron films85(1999);
View Description
Hide Description
A bending beam method has been developed to measure the elastic modulusE, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and the Poisson ratio ν for on-wafer dielectric films with thicknesses in the submicron range. The method was demonstrated for 0.5 μm thick silicon dioxide films made from tetraethylorthosilane (TEOS). First, the biaxial elastic modulus and CTE were measured on blanket TEOS on Si and GaAs substrates and found to be 77 GPa and 1.0 ppm/°C, respectively. The Poisson ratio ν was determined by combining the finite element calculation and the experimental result of the thermal stresses of TEOS fine lines on the Si substrate. The Poisson ratio of TEOS was determined to be 0.24 and, as a consequence, the Young’s modulus was 59 GPa. Fourier transforminfrared spectra were obtained for TEOS films on the Si and GaAs substrates to ensure that the chemical structure of the film is independent of the substrate.

Dear Dr. Rateliff,
is it possible to buy a copy of your PhD dissertation, and if so, where? I've been a big fan of Dunsany for years and have recently started to collect works about him too. Your dissertation sounds very interesting!
Yours
Martin Andersson (klarkash (at) spray (dot) se)
Dear Magister
Well, back in the day you simply looked up the relevant dissertation in DISSERTATION ABSTRACTS (which every college library stocks) and then sent off an order to University Microfilms (U.M.I.).
Unfortunately, when I tried searching online I find that they've been bought out by a company that doesn't seem to list older titles like mine, at least not through its website. An attempt to find out more than a university library reference desk proved a comedy of misunderstandings and, ultimately, futile. I'll look into it some more and post the results, if any.
For the record, I only know of three copies: one at Marquette (in the Special Collections, like all dissertations granted by that university), one I gave away as a gift, and one on my shelf. But I've been thinking of returning to this project at some point and seeing if it might make a good book, or the core of a full-scale book on Dunsany.
If it helps, the full title is BEYOND THE FIELDS WE KNOW: THE SHORT STORIES OF LORD DUNSANY (1990).
--JDR
Thanks for looking into it! :-)
I was intrigued by your references to Dunsany's influence on Tolkien in THE HISTORY OF THE HOBBIT -- it felt as if this is an area that needs to be explored in depth. Sometime this spring, I'm giving a lecture on Dunsany for the local Tolkien Society, and it seemed that your dissertation would have made a nice work of reference.
I applaud your thoughts on turning it into a full book on Dunsany; there are too few of those around. (I also wish to see, someday, a better biography than the one published in '72.)

A chairman’s draft of legislation on climate change released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee spells out no clear role for agriculture in providing carbon offsets for industry.
Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, D-CA, on May 15 posted his 932-page bill, a chairman’s “mark” that will be debated for changes and possible passage by his committee. The bill has few mentions of agriculture throughout the legislation, with no role mentioned regarding whether agricultural land would be eligible for carbon sequestration.
People familiar with the situation who spoke to DTN said that doesn’t necessarily mean Waxman sees no role for agriculture, but that Waxman may leave agriculture’s role in the bill to the House Agriculture Committee to add to the legislation.
An amendment for agricultural offsets also could come up in Waxman’s full committee debate this week. Agricultural groups have been spelling out ways that farm ground can be used to offset carbon dioxide emissions in various industries.
Forestry and cropping practices such as no-till have been shown to sequester more carbon than agriculture’s actual emissions. Agricultural groups want to see farmers rewarded for those practices and want to ensure that USDA plays a role in implementing any greenhouse-gas emission program that involves agriculture.
The chairman’s mark only mentions agriculture in relation to studies regarding the impacts of climate change in different circumstances.
USDA and the Department of Interior would also participate in a land and water conservation fund under the bill to buy private land as well. A spokesperson for Waxman’s committee did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
Rep. Frank Lucas, R-OK, ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, issued a statement May 15 saying cap and trade effectively amounts to a national energy tax that will affect the cost of fuel in tractors, fertilizer for crops, and delivery of food to grocery stores. Lucas also noted that the bill mentions “agriculture” just six times.
“It appears that in return for drastically higher input prices, our farmers and ranchers will get a report every four years and a new federal program to purchase private property,” Lucas stated. “It is imperative that Congress conduct hearings and study this legislation and its implications for production agriculture carefully.”
The House Agriculture Committee has created a survey for ag groups and is holding some staff meetings on carbon sequestration and climate change, but has not set any hearings. Last year, when a similar bill was debated in the Senate, there were floor amendments that would have allowed agriculture to play a role in offsets.
Waxman’s bill would exempt companies that emit less than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide or an equivalent amount of other gases per year from being required to reduce emissions further. Agricultural lobbyists have been assured that all agricultural operations will remain excluded from the emissions cap. On the same day, the House Energy and Commerce Committee also posted a “proposed allowance allocation” for distributing carbon allowances, which would give away up to 85 percent of the initial allowances for greenhousegas emissions.
An allowance is a value of pollution a company or major emitter is given or purchases from the government for their greenhouse-gas emissions. An allowance can be coupled with offsets, which are purchased on the market by polluters from those who have stored carbon or reduced their pollution lower than their allotted allowances.
The emission allowances are being distributed to industries to help mitigate the potential increase in consumer energy costs that Republicans and business groups state will be the true impact on consumers.
Allowances are being spread in a lot of areas. Allowances will go to electricity and natural gas companies, home heating-oil and propane, and even low-income families. They will auction 15 percent of the allowances, and the revenue will be distributed to help offset energy costs for lowincome families.
Allowances will be given to states for investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Allowances also will go to help offset or prevent tropical deforestation in other countries. Then there are “investments in carbon capture and sequestration.”
That section states 2 percent of allowances from 2014 to 2017 and 5 percent of allowances thereafter would go to “help electric utilities cover the costs of installing and operating carbon capture and sequestration technologies.” — Chris Clayton, DTNWelcome 2014-15 Students

In mid-August, NJSBA reported that salary increases in 73 districts that reached agreement since the first of the year averaged 2.03 percent.
Out of 586 local school districts and educational services commissions, 431 have teacher contracts in place for 2010-2011, while 155 are still in negotiations. (The 155 districts still in negotiations include 125 where the previous contracts expired June 30, 2010, and 30 school districts in which former agreements expired the previous year.) At this time last year, 141 school boards were still negotiating with their teacher unions as school began.
[smartads]
NJSBA’s reported settlement rates reflect total salary increases, including the incremental (or step) raises provided for an additional year of experience. They do not reflect changes in benefit levels, including the recently required 1.5 percent-of-salary employee contribution to health insurance coverage.
The latest settlement rates are the lowest since NJSBA began collecting data 30 years ago, according to Association officials. The rates are affected by 43 contracts in which teachers agreed to a wage freeze for 2010-2011.
No impact on school opening Parents and students should not be alarmed by the number of unsettled contracts, according to Marie S. Bilik, NJSBA executive director.
“It’s not unusual for more than 100 school districts to begin classes with the school board and teachers union still in negotiations,” she said. “The status of negotiations should not affect the opening of school. That’s because teachers in New Jersey never work ‘without a contract.’ All of the salary, benefits and protections of the previous contract remain in place until a new agreement is reached.”
Other issues In addition to salary, other issues at the bargaining table this year include:
- Measures to control the cost of health insurance, such as increases in deductible and co-pay levels, changes in health care providers, and additional employee contributions toward health insurance costs.
- Freezing stipends provided to teachers for work outside the classroom, such as operating clubs or sports.
- Constructing salary guides to enable school boards to attract and retain new teachers and to reflect the current economy.
- Controlling the cost of tuition reimbursement.

I’m the busiest slacker there ever was. I’m not even kidding.
My publishing contract decreed that my deadline to turn in my manuscript was March 1. I’ve known this since the end of 2013. And all I wanted to do was go through the book a couple more times, fine-tune it even more, and apply some “house style” and coding. It wouldn’t take long, right? I’d get down to business once I had a month to go, right?
And then my February proceeded pretty much like the picture above.
- I blogged. A lot. Fifteen blog entries in the month of February, plus a blog interview on another blog.
- I laughed it up on Twitter. (Mostly on my author account.)
- I read. Not much reading got done, but I finished Dance of the Dissident Daughter and am almost finished with Austenland.
- I baked cookies for my brother-in-law’s birthday.
- I did a ninety-minute talk at Princeton University’s IvyQ Conference.
- I chatted on Skype (and in other ways) with my critique partner from Pitch Wars. I kind of spent a bunch of January helping him get an agent and stuff.
- I made a couple videos. I did one on education for writers for my writing channel and one where I read an ignorant letter and laughed at it on my asexuality/personal channel.
- I did a bunch of karaoke on the Internet. I do it every week. Performed “Disarm,” “Back in Business,” “Luka,” and “Taylor the Latte Boy.”
- I posted some rants and arguments and conversations and silliness on Tumblr.
- I submitted some short stories to magazines. I’m not good at short stories. Maybe these magazines will disagree with me.
- Funny how I’m willing to edit other people’s books, letters, pitch materials, and correspondence, but I’m procrastinating on my own editing, eh?
- I go out to dinner and hang out with my friend Jeaux once a week. He gets Wednesdays.
- I watched some American Idol. I’m still very far behind, but what do you expect?
- I started putting some reviews on my author account on Goodreads, finally, and I started with the books from my childhood. I seem to have reviewed 60 books so far, and I haven’t gotten past the stuff I read in 1986.
- As you can see, I drew this comic. I also draw Negative One, and did so every Friday of the month.
And I edited my book twice, applied the necessary coding, created a style sheet for it, and compiled footnotes. Sent it off to my editor shortly before completing this comic.
I swear I’m usually good with deadlines. . . .
Sounds like you had a busy month. I’m insane since I tend to do daily blog posts at more than one location. I’m still waiting for my head to fall off.
Yep. I blog on my own blog at least four days a week, but I also do a weekly update on LiveJournal, update my main author site whenever there’s big news, add new things to my Right Now page as they pop up, and post on Tumblr most days of the week (though sometimes they’re not full blog posts, just replies or answering questions), and tweeting on two accounts, and trying to keep up with the blogs I read too. I went through a period where I blogged every day for more than a month, and I could have kept doing it, but I felt like it might be overkill since I don’t really have a huge audience. Oh, I also highlight some of the stuff I do that might be of interest to others by using both a personal and an author-oriented Facebook account.

Good post.
Not a damn thing wrong with barbarians. Count me among them.
Count me in! (Good Article)
Unfortunately, some of our brother barbarians have gotten cushy jobs shilling for Capital One Visa cards. (LOL)
Outstanding!
it’s = it is, therefore “it’s defenders are now viewed” in the second sentence is “it is defenders are now viewed”. What does it mean, please, before I proceed to the third sentence?
I am proud to be counted among my relatives! After all Attila beat the hell of Rome in the past. Long live the Barbarians!
I tell people, stop being a consumer of culture and stop waiting for the culture to reform itself.
Build the culture you want to live in.
Build it at your address, build it within your family, your church, your circle of friends, the people who do business with you.
Stop consuming the propaganda that passes for news, find sources of information you trust or build it yourself. Stop consuming the swill that passes for entertainment media, and for heaven’s sake stop letting your kids consume it. Make your own music. Play your own sports. Build a boat, write a story, sing in a choir, catch your own fish.
Teach your kids to shoot and to make things in the garage.
Get your family into church or at the very least make your peace with your Maker. You’re going to need him as you rebuild the culture and you’ll need him if you mean to save your kids and your self from getting sucked in by the soulless.
Fear not. We don’t hang by their thread. We have our own.
First, good post. Second, I’m Eastern Orthodox and we get to hear about the great Byzantine Empire, with the double headed eagle, constantly. We hear about the great, Christian empire where faith and piety was a joint part of the society with the state.
When we leave church, I explain to my boys what happened. For most of the Empire, the emperors supported heresies that made as many (or more) saints than when the empire was pagan. I explain how the tax system became more and more complex and how it was so difficult to operate in the legalistic society, that we started calling any overly complicated system “Byzantine.” I also explain what happened to this empire and why.
Then I give them the history of the Scots, Irish, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Danes, etc.
I know who my cultural and political forefathers were, and they weren’t Byzantines or Romans.
Sorry, I won't teach my kids to shoot in the garage!
Jus' kiddin'. I like your ideas and have been practicing some of them at least. But what you're gonna? Note the interest in Hollywood's propagandistic entertainment vehicles even on this very site. Not many are willing to withdraw from the mainstream culture.

>>IMAGE.
Before we can get to the end, we need to start at the beginning. And this episode picks up (literally!) where the last one left off, with the most disgusting mess in the history of broadcast television being cleaned up by our meth-cooking "odd couple." Honestly, I'm not sure if these two will be able to work together after these events, nor do I really have any idea where the show will go from here.
It could be just as compelling if they completely give up their ideas of cooking meth for cash because they've still got all this crap they've already done to keep covered up. With Walt's brother-in-law Hank and his DEA goons already hot on that trail, there'd still be plenty of meat left for a show. I like that I'm not sure where this show is going and find that I don't really care because the ride-along is so damned great. In a way it reminds me of The Shield in that we're following some, let's face it, pretty bad dudes now and you still find yourself rooting for them.
I'm not sure that the flashback sequence to a younger Walt and some unknown girl writing down the chemical makeup percentages of the human body worked. It was a nice juxtaposition during the cleanup scene at the beginning, as we saw how all those chemicals could turn into a gooey sludge, but this is the first flashback the show has given us, and I'm not sure I see the overall significance, unless the mention and question of a missing component in the scientific equation being a soul will speak to an impending spiritual crisis.
When Pinkman leaves Walter for the day to finally take care of the Krazy 8 situation; remember the guy strapped to a pole in the basement with one of those horseshoe bike locks, we finally get to see what Walter is made of. Walter gets to see what Walter is made of, and it's tougher stuff than I would have imagined. Again, Cranston shined throughout this episode as he wrestled with his conscience and reason on what to do about Krazy 8.
The climactic sequence where Krazy 8 manages to convince Walter that the only right thing to do is set him free, followed by Walter's epiphany regarding the broken plate was a brilliant piece of writing for the show. The plate was broken when a coughing fit knocked Walter unconscious as he was bringing a plate of sandwiches to Krazy 8 in the basement. What an incredibly clever piece of storytelling, and a brilliantly executed resolution to the problem by White. In fact, what Pinkman comes home to find in regards to the state of the RV and his house speaks volumes about where White is psychologically, and gets me psyched for what's coming next.
HIGHLIGHTS
- DEA Agent Hank's wife swiping a pair of heels from a shoe store, under the watchful eye of a way-too-typical disinterested sales clerk on the phone no less
- Hank's "scared straight" talk outside a dilapidated motel where he lectures Walt, Jr. about pot being a gateway drug because he mistakenly believes he's doing pot. Bonus points for Wendy the meth-head hooker showing her teeth and then going off to bang Pinkman after Hank dismisses her. Walt, Jr.'s clueless reactions throughout this sequence are priceless.
- Walter making a Pros and Cons list of the benefits on either side of the "to kill or not to kill" Krazy 8 situation. Reasons to kill him: "He'll kill your entire family of you let him go."
- The aforementioned revelation to check the pieces of the plate, reassembling it like a puzzle, and the subsequent method by which White "handled" the Krazy 8 problem.
- The end where, finally, Walter confronts his wife and tells her: "Skyler, there's something I have to tell you."

January 4, 2013 at 1:24 pm |!There is just something about winter and soups that warms the soul.
The cold weather does start to wear on me after a few months, but soups somehow make it all a little more enjoyable.
I made this soup a few weeks ago on a cold, snowy night. The kids and I loved it. Kyle was out of town so he missed out.
I love our view and the colors we get to see dance across the sky each evening.
This soup is very simple and easy to make. It is easy to change or adapt to your liking and is loaded with vegetables! Something I try really hard to incorporate in as many meals as I can!
Ingredients:
1/2 pound of mushrooms (crimini or baby bellos)
1 large onion,
2 tablespoons miso paste
3 cloves garlic crushed (or more if that's your thing!)
1/2 tablespoon coconut oil
1 can light coconut milk
1 teaspoon paprika
4 large carrots
1 bunch kale
1 tablespoon red pepper flakes
broccoli florets
1 can chickpeas
tofu (optional - I didn't use)
1. Chop all produce ingredients.
2. Cook the mushrooms, onions, broccoli, and garlic in the coconut oil, just until slightly soft. Add the coconut milk, paprika, red pepper flakes, and several cups of water or rice milk.
3. After 10 minutes of simmering add the carrots and cook 3-4 minutes. I like crunchier carrots, so feel free to cook a little longer if you want them softer.
4. Right before serving add your kale and stir until it wilts but stays bright green
You had me at miso and coconut milk! What a gorgeous dish. I hope Kyle has the opportunity to try it soon!
Thanks for dropping by my blog. Your beautiful comment was very encouraging as I have been unwell recently. Much love .

If it's for a life partner, it's the result of a gross misconception. Your profile in dating sites is supposed to restrict your responses to those from people you might get along with, not to maximize responses. Of course you want to maximize responses from people suited to you, so you might want to refrain from posting pictures in unflattering lighting or of, say, your penis being inserted into a meat grinder (even if well lit). Unless it's really important to you that your would-be partner approves of that kind of thing, I suppose - in this case, it might be justifiable.

“I just want to go as fast as possible,” I calmly told my driving instructor, Donnie, through my headset. “But ask me again in five minutes.”
He humored me from the passenger seat, his laugh echoing through the radio static in my helmet.

He flipped a switch igniting the car, and its massive 600-horsepower engine began to rumble beneath me.
And then my memory went black.
***
A month ago, I stood at the edge of the wall on pit road at Charlotte Motor Speedway, close enough to feel the exhaust from Kevin Harvick’s car balloon and burst its fiery heat in my face. His tires squealed as he and his car burned out and went screaming down the apron, a plume of smoke and rubber wafting lazily in its wake.
I started shaking before his front tires even pulled onto the track.
It wasn’t out of fear. It was my body’s natural reaction to the adrenaline spiking and coursing through my veins.
Even with two feet solidly planted on the ground, my heart fluttered as the potential energy reverberated throughout my body seeking an escape.
That was the moment I knew I had to write this story.
PHOTOS: Kami's NASCAR driving experience
I’ve never been a NASCAR fan, despite living nearly equidistant to both Dover International Speedway and Pocono Raceway as a kid. In fact, I even share a last name with Joseph "Doc" Mattioli, the founder of Pocono Raceway, though not any close family ties.
But early on this particular Saturday morning, I found myself at Charlotte Motor Speedway checking in for the Richard Petty Driving Experience.
I joined a group of a dozen grown men casting sideways glances at each other, no doubt wondering why I was here and why I was alone.
I don't blame them. I was wondering that myself.
After signing four pages worth of legalese, I lined up to be fitted for my firesuit.
“Sorry sweetie, these aren’t really made to fit women,” the attendant said while handing me a massive armful of quilted sleeves and pantlegs.
That wasn’t an exaggeration. The suit’s sleeves extended approximately three inches past my fingertips; its bulky shoulders giving me a linebacker’s silhouette.
Wearing a firesuit feels like being swathed in a pillowy, quilted cocoon — by all means not an unpleasant experience, save for the fact that the outside temperature was 94 degrees.
***
“Have you ever driven a stick-shift before?” our crew chief asked each one of us as we filed into the auditorium to watch Petty’s orientation video.
“Never tried,” I told him, then promptly forgot about this particular exchange.
After a 20-minute orientation video about each car’s safety features and the Driving Experience’s commitment to driver safety, our group was ushered out of the auditorium and headed toward pit road.
Many of us in the group were first-time racecar drivers and, truthfully, I expected a little more guidance about driving lines and the track’s guide markings.
One-by-one, we posed in front of a racecar for the obligatory photo opportunity before heading to a tent and meeting our instructors. Pit crew members flitted around in the background preparing our cars: checking tires, opening hoods, revving engines.
Our crew chief announced the lineup, with each car’s availability dictated by the driver’s height.
Petty’s experience has about 150 cars in its rotation, all of which are built to real racecar specifications, but altered to be more durable than the ones the pros are driving.
As the shortest driver in our heat, I was assigned to the No. 3 car, a Chevrolet Impala with Austin Dillon’s decals. Unfortunately, I was 12th in line to start out of 14 drivers. Only two cars are allowed on the track at a time for safety reasons, so I was in for a little bit of a wait.
I’m impatient by design. Couple that with being wrapped up in flame-retardant material baking in the late morning sun while surrounded by strangers striking up nervous conversation, and the wait felt like years.
***
“Kami Mattioli, please come over to be fitted for your helmet.”
Finally, I thought.
Someone handed me a spandex skully to tuck my hair into and then I squeezed my head into the massive silver helmet. The helmet was rather heavy. I joked that I felt like a human bobblehead.
I still wasn’t nervous.
I just felt ready, laughing and dancing around as the pit crew prepared my car.
“Feet first, and be careful with your head.”
For the first time all day, I appreciated being just 5-5. Trying to climb into the car through the driver’s window requires a little bit of grace and lot of twisting and maneuvering.
The window’s clearance is maybe 15 inches tall at best, and the driver’s seat is so cramped by harnesses and instruments that there’s little wiggle room.
Oh, and you’re not only wearing a cumbersome space helmet — you’re also fitted with a neck and shoulder brace called a HANS (Head And Neck Support) device.
The HANS is a U-shaped brace made out of carbon fiber that rests on a driver’s shoulders and is anchored to his or her helmet. In the event of a sudden stop or crash, the HANS prevents a driver from whiplash by distributing torsion and energy to the driver’s chest and shoulders rather than exerting that energy on the neck.
It’s relatively lightweight, but wearing a helmet and a HANS very much restricts your range of motion, making it difficult to do much but look straight ahead.
A NASCAR driver’s seat is a claustrophobic person’s hell.
***
As soon as you plant your butt behind the wheel, a pit crew member begins buckling what feels like a dozen seatbelts and harnesses.
One came over and reached in through the window, popping the steering wheel onto the steering shaft.
All around the car, crew members buzzed in a flurry of preparatory activities.
Because I was strapped in to the HANS and the helmet, and tethered to look in one direction, I couldn’t see what they were doing, but I could feel the intensity of their activity ramp up significantly.
When one hooked in all four corners of the car's mesh window, I was officially committed to my decision.
I don’t know at what exact moment I began to realize that this was real — that I was in control of this massive structure of sheet metal and electronics and fuel and was about to steer it around a mile-and-a-half track at a high rate of speed — but I remember it felt as though someone had flipped a switch.
And, well, that’s because my instructor did.
We were off. Kind of.
***
Remember the conversation I told you I had forgotten about earlier? The one where the crew chief asked about my experience with manual cars?
I stalled trying to get off of pit road.
“I thought I was getting a push-off,” I said to Donnie, who was seated next to me in the passenger seat talking me through shifting.
“Nope, we’re gonna get you through this,” he replied with a lot more faith in me than I had in myself.
“Okay, just talk me through it,” I replied, feigning confidence.
And Donnie, who must have been a saint or an otherwise very patient person in another life to repeat this experience 80 times in one day, calmly detailed a step-by-step tutorial.
We rumbled our way down the apron and then slid up the bank to the right, bumping up onto the track.
***
White lines and traffic cones. That’s all I remember seeing.
Double cones meant to press the gas to the floor smoothly and evenly, to await the jolt of energy throttling us forward.
A single cone, to let off slowly and gradually, as we entered into a turn, the car tilting at a 24-degree angle to the track while banking corners.
Two small dashed lines — the guide markers through which I was to guide the car at various spots on the straightaways — flashed by so quickly I wondered if they were a mirage.
Except there wasn’t a lot of time to do much wondering behind the wheel.
I spent the first four laps locating the markers, trying to navigate the speedway’s four turns and guided by Donnie’s voice on the radio piped into my helmet.
I weaved across lanes as I was told — a seamstress behind the wheel stitching some sort of controlled madness on top of the asphalt whose pattern only Donnie could understand and translate.
We got close to the wall at times but I couldn’t see how close we were. I had to trust Donnie’s judgment.
“Right, right, more to the right,” he told me often, making me force my steering wheel to the right, toward those walls.
***
The beginning of the experience was disorienting.
I had no concept of time or speed; if I was lucky, maybe a brief and distorted concept of space every now and then.
The dashboard, full of gadgets and gauges may have been helpful if I were able to see it, but it was just out of my peripheral vision.
If I had any hopes of going as fast as I wanted to, I didn’t dare take my eyes off the road for any fraction of time.
The turns all looked the same, and the laps began to bleed together. I didn’t know where one ended and another began. I forgot the last time I crossed the checkered line. I felt lost, trying my best to focus and follow the instructions I was hearing over the radio.
Though Donnie was less than six inches away from me, it was hard to gauge the situation because I couldn’t see him. Were it not for his hand gestures entering the outer fringe of my sight line every so often, I would have forgotten he actually was in the car.
But on the fifth lap, the car began to drive itself as if suddenly fueled by its own mechanical muscle memory. I didn’t have to fight to understand anymore.
We were one. I was simply guiding it.
I gunned it, pedal to the floorboard coming out of a turn as the straightaway materialized in front of me. I didn’t know it in that moment, but I had hit my top speed of 130 mph.
It didn’t feel fast, relatively speaking, but it felt faster than any of the other accelerations.
Then I had to come from the wall down to the base of the turn in three seconds and accelerate as soon as I got to the white line. The force knocked me back in my seat, pinning me down as if I was in an airplane taking off. I shrugged it off, gripping the steering wheel to pull myself forward.
I was revved up after that burst of speed whet my appetite, ready for Donnie to tell me to shift into fifth gear and really let me fly.
But instead, he reeled me in.
My eight laps were almost done, and as much as I wanted to zoom onto pit road with my tires squealing and maybe do a doughnut or two, that wasn’t going to happen.
I coasted back to our starting point at pit road, the car popping and grunting like a despondent teenager at the slow speed.
I wanted to go faster, too, I thought, coaxing the car to a stop.
***
The flurry of activity around me as the pit crew removed the mesh window, swiftly released me from my harnesses and led me back out the window seemed more intense than all 134,000 empty seats whizzing by at 130 mph.. It’s impossible.
The constant motion is numbing and the attention to detail required to function at such a high level is exhausting. Trying to find equilibrium between the two is a battle.
***
As promised, Donnie asked me again how I felt.
Sweaty and overwhelmed while trying to process what just happened in the previous 12 minutes, I only had one word to offer him.

The Moonstone
by Wilkie Collins
The Moonstone First Period, Chapter 14 Summary
- Cuff walks out into the garden with Betteredge to ask him a few questions.
- He wants to know whether any of the servants acted strangely since the diamond disappeared – unexpectedly got sick, that kind of thing.
- Betteredge doesn't want to get Rosanna into trouble by telling Cuff that she had, in fact, gone to her room with a headache for the whole afternoon after the diamond disappeared. Betteredge is trying to figure out what to say, when Cuff shushes him.
- Cuff hears something in the shrubbery at the edge of the garden.
- He hears footsteps going back up to the house, and they see Rosanna's skirts disappearing in the door.
- Was she eavesdropping?
- But Betteredge knows that Rosanna was probably just hoping to catch a glimpse of Franklin Blake, since he likes to walk in this part of the garden.
- Betteredge tells Cuff that Rosanna has a crush on Franklin Blake.
- Cuff promises to keep the secret, and then repeats his first question: were any of the servants acting strangely?
- Betteredge lies, and says "no."
- Cuff probably realizes that Betteredge is keeping something back, but he seems to like Betteredge even more because of it.
- Cuff lets the matter lie.
- Cuff then says that he wants to interview the servants, one at a time, in private.
- Betteredge agrees, and sets it up so that the interviews can take place in his own private office.
- Rosanna, Lady Verinder's maid, and one of the housemaids remain longer in their interviews than anyone else.
- Betteredge knows that Lady Verinder's maid and the housemaid were the two servants who most dislike Rosanna, so he's afraid that they told Cuff something bad about poor Rosanna.
- Betteredge asks the two servants what they told Cuff, and they were more than happy to tattle to Betteredge, too. They said that they didn't believe that Rosanna was really sick the previous afternoon, so they had each snuck upstairs once or twice to knock on her door and to listen at the keyhole. They didn't believe she was in there! She must have slipped out of the house in secret!
- Betteredge takes a walk in the garden with Franklin Blake, and tells him that it seems that Cuff now suspects Rosanna Spearman.
- Franklin suggests that they go tell Lady Verinder.
- Sergeant Cuff comes up just then, and asks them to keep the information to themselves, because Lady Verinder would probably tell Rachel.
- Franklin Blake is offended that Cuff thinks Rachel shouldn't be told – they don't say anything more to each other about it, but Franklin Blake stomps off, leaving Betteredge and Cuff together.
- Cuff asks Betteredge to refrain from doing any more detective work on his own, and asks a few questions about the different country paths around the house.
- He asks if there's a path that leads down to the shore, and Betteredge tells him about the path to the Shivering Sands.
- They walk down that way together.Executive will oversee global marketing, branding

The entrenched leadership of the school system is all about test scores and little else. The Danielson frameworks are being turned into checklists and the “talent coaches” are pushing hard for the “gotcha” mentality that is the hallmark of all educational reform since No Child Left Behind. (See the NYTimes piece on the Bumpy Start for the New Teacher Evaluation system where only the talent coach is critical of a minor detail in practice that may or may not be applicable to the students in that class).
The real issue as Ed in the Apple points out is changing the culture. This requires reform above (changes in the evaluation process) and reform below. Principals should be empowered and required to begin working with teams in their schools to rewrite the Danielson rubrics to make them more objective and clearly focused on teacher behavior and not so much on student responses. Principals need to be required to provide SAVE rooms and establish meaningful discipline policies in every school so that we can reach the students who are failing and acting out in class. Guidance services need to be in place for students as well as families that are struggling.
The best way to shake up the culture in the schools may be to disempower principals. We can move away from the nineteenth century model that currently describes principals as all knowing and all powerful and move to a professional system where schools are run at the local level by a team of parents, teachers, and administration who must work together by consensus and receive help from the central bureaucracy. This is what SLTs were supposed to do before Klein imposed his corporate model (Every principal a CEO, see William Ouchi, “Making Schools Work“). Empowering school teams also empowers parents and teachers and brings more expertise to bear on the problems in an individual school than any top down management system can.
The question is does deB have the courage to try a truly progressive approach to remake the system?
Working as a professional team does not dis-empower principals! It empowers them to give their staffs the support and guidance they need tio perform at their best. Having so called ‘power’ over the busget– is giving a false sense of empowerment such that principals have no where to turn when they are really challenged to do more with less. Educators are not competing businessmen, we are in it together! Lets make that real!.
The more authority you share, the more influential you become.
Oh God, Oh God! Why does Eric speak this way when on the outside, while when on the inside he was such a killer?
The only possible reason is that when trolling for a job, he says what others want to hear. I KNOW ABOUT THAT!
Present and in charge when so many of the current know nothings were placed as Principals, and so many schools were closed, and the vocational/technical programs disbanded ( try and put THAT Humpty back together) , how can he possibly type the comment?
The last thing we need in leadership now is another chameleon. A clean house is in order, and some attention paid to trying to gather up all the broken pieces of what used to be, throwing out what was not effective, and restoring what was effective and useful.
It’s going to be a real “bitch ” of a time, combatting all that money Bloomberg, Gates, Broad, Walton’s, etc and all the others threw, and are still throwing, around.
Bill D sure has his work cut out.
Watch out for the latest State tricksters-the Regents Fellows-if I have that correct.
Citizens United has unleashed a torrent of cash contributing, politician buying, folk that have the potential to kill the system of public ed that is already on its knees.
And the educational carpetbaggers are afoot ( ERIC, SHAEL, SANTI, ETC).
In most communities in the world, parents want to know who their childs leader is in school. Who makes the decisions, how are those decisions reached/ Im all for team work and committee work, but Im all for accountability, and that accountability can onle be via The Principals Office..Even Pres Obama would agree with that stand..This is not Reconstructionism, it is at some level a from of anarchy.
I have numerous disagreements with the man Eric Nadelstern has become. But let me tell you, he was the best principal I ever had (of around 11, plus those I worked with as a coach.) It was at the International High School at LaGuardia Community College, of which he was the founding principal. The entire program was based on collaboration, which included shared decision making and empowerment of faculty and students. Collaborations were teacher to teacher, student to student, teachers and students, parents and faculty. All the students were immigrants and over 90% went on to college. As a supervisor Eric initiated a peer review system designed by the teachers. Although he had the ultimate legal authority, he always honored the recommendations of the teachers. Likewise, he had the teachers do the hiring, believing that it would give the faculty more of a vested interest in helping their colleagues succeed. Instead of pointing out and harping on weaknesses, he identified people’s strengths and encouraged them to develop those strengths. He delighted in his faculty participating in professional organizations and facilitated their attendance and participation as presenters. He encouraged them to bring along students as co-presenters, even at out-of-town conferences. The school still thrives today amongst 16 international high schools in New York City, founded by the Internationals Network for Public Schools led by Claire Sylvan. There are 2 in California and one in Virginia, plus numerous consultancies. The schools emphasize interdisciplinary studies, language development through content (all content teachers are expected to be language teachers as well), heterogeneity and collaboration, experiential education, localized autonomy and responsibility. This was real education reform, not what later developed under the business model of education fostered by non-educators who have been running the largest school systems in the United States. For the first time in 16 years, our incoming mayor in New York has promised to hire a schools chancellor who is an educator, not one who requires a waiver from the Board of Regents for lack of educational experience and credentials. Let’s hope for a happy New Year in education.
I heard those stories, and was so happy to have him as a Deputy in D72, Bronx High Schools. When the opportunity came to get some seed money for a different approach in high schools, and the Superintendent and the UFT District Rep agreed to not disadvantage the borough by singling out a few schools but to try a a District wide approach. I was thrilled to have THAT Eric. The deal—pure and simple–was to start these new schools with nothing but TENURED staff, and put all the resources into instruction without the overburden of training brand new staff. THAT WAS THE DEAL ERIC AGREED TO. THAT DEAL WAS NEVER CARRIED OUT.
New principals, brand new staff, hand picked kids, and BS galore was the result, and Nadelstern rocketed downtown. Devastation was wreaked upon the existing schools as the kids were ‘centrally assigned’, and the “failing” schools, bereft of the normal mix of students, slid into unfair closings.
Sporting a new lead of black hair, and remembering nothing of his past (described above), a new monster was born. And all the Bronx High Schools died, even those that, in the face of having the poorest kids in the city, were doing right by many kids, and giving, in the good old days, vocational training as well as college preparation to many others.
A generation of kids, mostly from poor families, less well educated than could have been the case otherwise, was pushed through schools by Principals desperate to have good numbers. Many of those kids were sent off to college so poorly prepared that all they have to show is $10-20,000 in college loan debt.
May G-D exact retribution from those like Nadelstern, Klein, Suransky, and the Rhee types, and also those who take public resources to enrich themselves while operating Charter schools, and those who foster the testing mania.
David
I agree with you completely. Eric Nadelstern brought in the many policies that failed the schools. Leadership Academy Principals, fair student funding, and the near useless Children First Networks.
Eric Nadelstern was the problem and his kind has no solutions when it comes to what’s best for the students. Let’s hope the new Chancellor never listens to an ed deformer like Eric who believes his ideas are more important than the education of the students.
Eric Nadelstern has spent decades in education in New York City. During that time, he has worked to actualize a vision of public education in which students leave high school prepared for success in college and life. Among his achievements are those detailed by Nancy Dunetz.
When I worked with him at The International High School, I found him to be a supportive and demanding principal, an interesting and available conversation partner, and an idealistic leader when it came to envisioning a better life for the young people we served.
As powerful a position as Deputy Chancellor is, it is not free from the state and federal constraints imposed by NCLB, Race to the Top, and Core Curriculum. These include legal mandates, and sets of criteria to be met in order to obtain the financial support necessary for the city’s schools.
Finally, in all my discussions with Eric over more than 25 years, he has never engaged in deriding people as “. . . those kind. . .”, or used hair, ethnicity, religion, etc., as a means for communicating his ideas. He focused on the education of the city’s young.Teulon RCMP are seeking the public's help in finding 16-year-old Tiffany Williams, currently of the RM of Rockwood.

Love my H2O Audio case for my Shuffle!
By Max Swimmer
from Los Altos, CA
About Me Avid Listener
The H2O audio case for the Ipod shuffle is GREAT! I love to use my Shuffle while swimming. Now, do be careful, I flooded my first 1gb because I didn't use the silicone grease every 5 openings. So now I have a 2gb! :) I still love to swim with my Ipod! Anyways,the controls on the outside of the case work well enough, but I have to stop my laps if I really want to adjust something. Comes with an armband and headphones. Note, I still get water in my ears with the headphones, which can alter the music volume, but this doesn't bother me... Overall, this takes the boredom out of my laps when swimming 1 and 2 kilometer distances...

NEWS RELEASES.The United States has expelled two Venezuelan diplomats, the State Department said Monday, a diplomatic tit-for-tat following the Latin American oil giant’s expulsion of two American military attachés last week.
The two mid-level diplomats left the country Sunday, one day after the State Department notified the Venezuelan Embassy that each had been declared “persona non grata,” State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.
Nuland would not say whether the explusions were delayed until after the funeral of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s long-serving and stridently anti-American leader. Chavez’s recent death has complicated the already difficult diplomatic dealings between the two countries. Embassies are open in both capitals, but without full ambassadors in charge.
The two expelled officials are second secretary Jose Orlando Montanez Olivares and consular officer Victor Camacaro Mata. The State Department gave no information on the length of the men’s service in the United States or their specific duties, but said their expulsion was a commensurate response to Venezuela’s action, not a reaction to specific actions the two might have taken.
Chavez’s March 5 death was the impetus for Venezuela’s expulsion of the two Americans. Chavez’s leftist backers have, at times, accused the United States of poisoning him or causing his cancer.
The Obama administration has said it wants to repair badly frayed relations with Venezuela, but Chavez’s death is unlikely to provide much of an opening. Venezuela will hold a presidential election next month, and Chavez’s chosen successor is firmly anti-American.
“Clearly, when you have an incident that you consider unjust, and then you need to take reciprocal action and make your point,” Nuland said. “We do hope for better relations with Venezuela. There is work that we would like to do together, particularly in the areas of counterterrorism, counternarcotics, economics and energy relations, but it’s going to take a change of tone from Caracas.”Annuals

I think the timestamps shouldbe measured from reset. The kernel timestamps start not at zero, butfrom the time the kernel starts. This guarantees a consistent timebase across the data. Also if there is a pre-boot program (such as aNAND loader) then its time will be counted also.A good timer would be an accurate monotonic wall clock, notnecessarily related to time of day.

The Shrine Game is often where teams find their late-round draft gems.
The Seahawks have drafted or signed one player from the Shrine Game in each of the four years under general manager John Schneider, including defensive end Dexter Davis in 2010, safety Jeron Johnson in 2011, offensive guard Rishaw Johnson in 2012, and running back Christine Michael in 2013.
While the game has significant meaning to NFL teams and the players involved, it can be difficult for fans who aren't familiar with the players. While there are a few players from FBS schools, like Arizona State and Texas, most of the rosters are populated with players from small schools like Coastal Carolina, Lindenwood and Valdosta State.
The Seahawks have some clear areas of focus for their roster this offseason. They especially need to find additional depth at wide receiver, the defensive line and in the defensive backfield. With that in mind, here is a brief scouting guide of players who the Seahawks will likely be watching during Saturday's game:- Printable Coupons | Deal Seeking Mom™ - -

On the Bay - Join us on May 19 and June 2 to plan for the future of Malletts Bay village. Colchester has long envisioned transforming the West Lakeshore Drive neighborhood into a recreation and tourism oriented village center on Mallets Bay, but the lack of infrastructure has stymied those plans for decades. With efforts to address infrastructure needs moving forward, the town will be updating the zoning and development standards for the Malletts Bay village area. Please attend one or both of these sessions to help refine our vision for the future of Malletts Bay village. Read more info about the sessions here (PDF format)

-If you’re thinking of recommending a target-date fund to an individual or small-business client, or if any of your clients already own one—and considering their burgeoning popularity, they probably do—you better take a good, long look under the hood.
These one-size-fits-all funds, which are allocated and rebalanced according to an individual’s retirement date, have been widely criticized for being too pricey. But there’s another problem: They’re too heavily allocated to equities and fixed income, some analysts say.
Indeed, a new white paper from JP Morgan Asset Management entitled Ready! Fire! Aim? suggests that most target-date fund allocations do not manage market risk effectively enough—particularly considering that most participants contribute too little and borrow and withdraw too much from their 401(k) plans: 20 percent of participants borrow an average of 15 percent of their account balances; participants typically withdraw over 20 percent per year at or shortly after retirement; and contribution rates generally don’t hit 10 percent until an individual is 55, according to the study.
JP Morgan’s report suggests that to remedy the problem, target-date fund providers need to be less heavily weighted towards equities: ,” says the paper.
Joe Nagengast, founder of Turnstone Advisory Group, which is conducting a study on the underlying asset allocations, fees, expenses, performance and risk in target-date funds, agrees. “The reliance on traditional asset classes has been too great,” he says.
Only a handful of asset managers, like Principal Financial Group, seem to be putting more creative asset allocations into place. “There is at least some indication that they are getting more creative. Everybody is talking about how they’re using real estate now; some people are using commodities. At least they’re exploring that.” According to a previous version of Turnstone’s study, Principal is one of the most diversified of the target-date fund providers, and the firm itself says: “Our portfolios include dedicated exposures to real estate, TIPS, high-yield bonds, preferred securities and emerging-market equities.”
Nagengast says hedging strategies (though not necessarily hedge funds themselves) would also make good additions to target-date funds. “In DC plans in general, it’s very rare to see alternative investments,” he says, because it wouldn’t make much sense economically for most 401(k) participants to invest in alternatives individually. But the scale of a target-date fund could make it more economically feasible.
Daniel Lucey, an analyst with Cerulli Associates, says other types of funds that incorporate mostly index funds could also make sense for participants. Despite their flaws, target-date funds are booming. Assets in these funds totaled $82 billion at the end of 2005, the latest date Cerulli has data for, up from $34 billion at year-end 2003. Meanwhile the number of funds has rocketed to 898, with 173 distinct portfolios, according to Nagengast.
JP Morgan conducted the study using its own retirement services database of 1.3 million participants. The 401(k) participants examined in the study had an average salary range of $30,000 to $70,000, and the analysis covered the period between 2001 and 2006.This weekend one of the biggest nightclub names in the whole wild world returns to Miami, and there’s not a dance fan in all of South Florida who isn’t giddy with glee. Yes, we’re talkin’ about Ibiza’s legendary Amnesia, where the throngs have been at it for decades. But our town’s branch won’t be some simple island offshoot; in fact, it promises to out-wow the original. Superstar French DJ Joachim Garraud explains.
This weekend marks the Miami return of the legendary Amnesia -- wanna tell us a bit about it? Yes, Amnesia Miami will be having its grand opening this weekend. On Friday night, Bob Sinclar will be kicking things off and I’ll be bringing my new live Invasion set that I designed specifically for this event on Saturday night. Should be a great weekend!
Will Saturday’s spin be the first in a series if regular appearances? Saturday will be the launch of my Amnesia residency. Other than the show this weekend, I’ll be back one more time in December and then two or three more times within the next year.
Word is spinning isn’t the only part you’re playing in the venue -- care to fill us in? Sure! Amnesia Miami is home to a one-of-a-kind, custom LED system that I designed for the new venue. Amnesia has five big LED panels, three are moving and the other two are fixed. Amnesia will be the only club in the US with this state-of-the-art technology. I also have designed graphics for the Invasion set that I’ll be playing on Saturday, and the moving LED panels create amazing visual illusions that you have to see to believe!
Didn’t you also help design an in-house recording studio? Yes, this was an idea that I was very much behind. Having a recording studio inside of Amnesia will be a fantastic feature that I hope artists playing there will take advantage of. If artists get into town a day early or early in the day that they play, they can come in to Amnesia and work on music in a fantastic studio with everything provided for them. It’s the extra features like these at Amnesia that will really set it apart from other clubs in Miami.
All-in-all, what can dance fans expect at the new Amnesia? For those who have been to any other Amnesia nightclubs, they know that the Amnesia brand has always been all about good music and a great overall club experience. With the LED system and great sound in the new venue, dance fans will experience a sensory overload that they might not get in other Miami clubs. They’ll have to come out and see for themselves!
Amnesia opens this weekend.

The best thing about this programme is how it has allowed me to expand on some of the things I only touched on in my undergraduate studies, and to pursue an area of great interest with my dissertation.
When going to study economics you think of LSE because of its reputation and the quality of its academic staff, but what swayed my decision was the prospect of studying in the heart of such a fantastic city and the diversity of the people I would meet. Being in the centre of London means there is always something to do and certainly no time to get bored. I have had the chance to meet some of the leaders in the field of economics and politics thanks to the excellent programme of speakers at the university, and it has been wonderful to get a flavour of what London has to offer whilst I have been here..

Just wet roads in immediate metro region
* Saturday sun, Sunday rain: Full Forecast into next week *
* Radar, temps & more: Weather Wall | Traffic | Get There *
Another batch of mixed precipitation has developed over the region as an upper level disturbance pivots through the region. Over much of the immediate metro area (inside the beltway), the precipitation is in the form of rain. As you head north and west outside the beltway, the rain mixes with and gradually changes to sleet. Some snow has also been reported around Frederick county in Maryland.
Through mid-afternoon, light precipitation will continue. The precipitation type forecast remains challenging, but where it's sleeting now precipitation may mix with or change to snow. Places getting rain may experience a changeover to sleet (with just a slight chance of some snow mixing in) before the precipitation tapers off. With temperatures holding in the mid-to-upper 30s in the immediate metro region, only wet roads are expected (with just a 30% chance of a coating of sleet or snow, mainly on grassy areas). North and west of the beltway, a light slushy accumulation of sleet and a little snow is possible with amounts increasing the further north and west you go.
See our full forecast through the weekend into next week.

The Winter Weather Advisory was never in effect for Fairfax County, as surface temps there are expected to stay too warm for any frozen precip to cause much trouble.

Rain/sleet/snow grossness falling in McLean as of right before noon. I hate this kind of winter storm more than anything. At least we have a nice day tomorrow to look forward to after all this clears out?

Lol, so I leave my house in Reston, with no rain at 7:30AM. I run into rain near Dranesville, then it's wet in Sterling (At the DMV), but not raining. I spend forever there, only to find out that I need to hit up another place for written documentation (To renew my license), and as I walk and drive between places, I go from completely dry conditions, to being inundated in rain, to being pelted with sleet (All within an hour). Then I run into a downpour just down the street from my home (While at a business), but when I finally make it back to the house this afternoon, it's all dry just as it started out when I left there this morning lol.

The Sterling radar makes it look like you guys are going to wash away or something, it looks like almost solid red from Stafford to Rockville. What's going on up there? Is that all extremely heavy rain or is the radar just detecting sleet and making it look worse than it is?
BTW -- It's going to be 70 degrees and sunny down here today. =PA number of years ago, while searching through a postcard dealer’s stock, I came across a group of postcards reproducing many works of art, some by the most significant artists of the 20th century. Normally that wouldn’t be a very remarkable find, except that the cards had an imprint of a little-recognized art organization based in New York. The usual slog through hundreds of mundane New York City postcards finally resulted in something interesting!
The Société Anonyme, a group made up of some of the most avant-garde artists of its day, can rightfully claim to be New York’s first museum of modern art. The Société was the vision of Katherine Dreier, an early patron of modernism in the arts, and an artist in her own right. She was one of the first American abstractionists and one of the few female artists in the modern art movement. Before establishing the Société she spent much of her time in Europe, befriending many of the most avant-garde artists and art dealers.
Dreier was born in 1877 and came from a prominent and politically active Brooklyn family that instilled the value of education and civic responsibility in their children of both genders. She drew on her spiritual and philosophical beliefs and her social idealism to attempt to influence American attitudes towards contemporary art at a time when it was generally ill regarded and unappreciated by the masses. Unfortunately she is rarely credited with the enormous influence she had in establishing modern art in America.
In 1920 Dreier and her friend and infamous fellow artist Marcel Duchamp decided to form a new organization devoted to exhibiting and promoting modern art to Americans. (Duchamp was one of the most provocative Dada/Surrealist artists of his time. He is best known for his Cubist/Futurist-inspired painting Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 which scandalized the American audience at the 1913 Armory Show in New York City, and the urinal that he found and exhibited as the sculpture Fountain by the artist “R. Mutt”). They invited Man Ray, a Dada/Surrealist artist and avant-garde photographer to join them in their efforts.
It was Man Ray who came up with the name “Société Anonyme,” which he thought literally meant “Anonymous Society” in French. Duchamp informed him that in French the true meaning is equivalent to the English word “Incorporated.” Drier liked the name because it had the ring of impartiality – it put the focus on the art, not the individual artists and puts a capitalist spin on an anti-materialist art organization. Drier rented two small rooms at 19 East 47th Street in New York City for the exhibit space and the library of the fledgling organization. When it was officially incorporated in New York, it became more Dada joke since it now meant “Incorporated, Inc.”
On April 30, 1920, the Société Anonyme, with the now-appended title “Museum of Modern Art: 1920” had its first exhibition. Duchamp designed the space with a neutral, industrial look. The floor was ribbed rubber and the walls and woodwork were a pale blue. The exhibit featured the European artists Jacques Villon (half-brother of Marcel Duchamp), Alexander Archipenko, Juan Gris, Heinrich Vogler, Vincent van Gogh and the sculptor Brancusi. American artists included Joseph Stella, Patrick Henry Bruce, James Daugherty, and works by New York Dadaists Duchamp, Man Ray, Morton Schamberg and others.
Dreier had hoped to raise enough money to establish a permanent space to exhibit modern art, but wasn’t successful. She gave up the 47th Street space after a year but the Société Anonyme continued to function as a museum-without-walls by holding exhibits, lectures and symposia in other galleries, clubs, workers’ centers and rental spaces. The Société also produced publications and had an acquisitions program. It continued to draw on the talents of international artists including Cubists, Dadaists, Futurists, Expressionists, Constructivists and other progressive artistic genres.
Drier’s real hope of founding the first permanent museum of modern art in the United States was eclipsed when the Museum of Modern Art (now commonly referred to as MoMA) in New York City was established in 1929 by a more diplomatic Alfred Barr, the museum’s founding director, with very substantial financial backing from its most prominent supporters.

The postcards shown here are all from the Société’s first year on East 47th Street. Oddly enough these postcards are all real photo postcards that can hardly do justice to some of the most colorful and exciting artworks of that time. Other artists whose work is shown on the postcards (and are not already mentioned above) are Louis Eilshemius, Pablo Picasso, Kurt Schwitters, Heinrich Campendonk and R. Villon-Duchamp (brother of Marcel Duchamp).
On one hand, these can be thought of as mere “museum” cards in that they are simply reproductions of artworks on postcards. In the postcard world this type of card is rarely given much notice, let alone monetary value. However, here we have evidence of the original visionary efforts to promote some of the most significant artists of the 20th century from an organization that was instrumental in fostering the recognition and appreciation of modern art in America. As such, in my opinion, they have a status of their own.
Despite the establishment of the Museum of Modern Art, Dreier still maintained hope of a permanent museum, even planning to open “The Country Museum” at her West Redding, Conn., home, which would feature her own collection and the Société’s. Again she could not get enough backing and in 1941 the Société’s collection was sent to Yale University. Through the 1940s she continued to lecture and acquire art on behalf of the Société. On April 30, 1950, the 30th anniversary of the first exhibition of the Société Anonyme, the Société was dissolved at a dinner given by Dreier and Duchamp. Dreier died in 1952.SIP/VoIP Technical Support Expert

- At Damascus 37-40 AD
- First Journey 45-47 AD
- Second Journey 51-53 AD
- Third Journey 54-58 AD
- Imprisonment in Judea 58-60 AD
- Voyage to Rome 60-61 AD
- Imprisonment in Rome 61-63 AD
- Post-Imprisonment Journeys 63-67 AD
- Chronology
The crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ occurred in the spring of 32 AD. The the day of Pentecost occured (Acts 2), then the stoning of Stephen, which Saul (St. Paul) participated in before his conversion (Acts 7:59). In about 37 AD, Jesus Christ speaks to Saul (St. Paul) on the road to Damascus. St. Paul is led blind to Damascus (Acts 9:8). After the visit by Ananias, St. Paul then goes to Arabia and returns to Damascus where he spends 3 years (Galatians 1:17-18 and Acts 9:22-23). In 37 AD King Aretas took control of Damascus when Emperor Tiberius Caesar died. St. Paul departed from Damascus at night, being let down from the city wall in a basket (Acts 9:25 and 2 Corinthians 11:32). This could not have been after 40 AD, the year that King Aretas died.
St. Paul met with Barnabus, Peter, and James in Jerusalem (Acts 9:26 and Galatians 1:18-19). St. Paul then goes to Caesarea and Tarsus (Acts 9:30) and St. Peter goes to the house of Cornelius (Acts 10). Barnabus gets St. Paul and they stay in Antioch (Syria) for one year (Acts 11:26). This must be between 41 AD (beginning of Claudius Caesar’s reign) and 44 AD (Acts 11:28). The Disciples are called Christians for the first time at Antioch (Acts 11:26). James, brother of John, is killed by Herod Agrippa I (Acts 12:2). Herod Agrippa I dies in 44 AD (Acts 12:23).
The first journey of St. Paul begins when St. Paul, Barnabus, and St. Paul met Bar-Jesus the sorcerer (Acts 13:4-6). Then they sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, which is now southern Turkey. From here, St. Mark returns to Jerusalem. At Antioch in Pisidia (not to be confused with the one in Syria), St. Paul and Barnabas turn to the Gentiles (Acts 13:46). Then it was on to Iconium, where they abode a “long time” (Acts 14:3), Lystra, where St. Paul is stoned, but lives (Acts 14:19), and Derbe. Then they retraced their steps back through Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch (in Pisidia) (Acts 14:21). St. Paul and Barnabas went throughout Pisidia, Pamphylia, then to Perga, Attalia, and sailed back to Antioch in Syria (Acts 14:24-26) The first journey ends in Antioch, Syria, where St., St. Paul and Barnabus go to the council in Jerusalem 14 years after St. Paul’s conversion (Galatians 2:1-9 and Acts 15:2). Judas and Silas return to Antioch (Syria) with Barnabus and St. Paul where they continued some days (Acts 15:35-36), possibly in the winter of 50-51 AD. The second journey begins, possibly in the spring of 51 AD. St. Paul takes Silas through Syria and Cilicia (now southeastern Turkey). They came to Derbe and Lystra, where they find Timothy, who goes with St. Paul taught for 3 weeks. After teaching some in Berea, St. Paul departed ahead of Silas and Timothy, southward into Achaia (now southern Greece), to Athens, possibly for the winter of 51-52 AD (Acts 17:14- 15). St. Paul then makes his first visit to Corinth where he stays a year and a half (Acts 18:5). This may have been from the spring of 52 AD to the fall of 53 AD. Here, St. Paul met Aquila and Priscilla, who had just come from Rome, from which Claudius Caesar had banished all Jews. Silas and Timothy rejoin St. Paul. First Thessalonians was written from here in about 52 AD (1 Thessalonians 3:1-2, 6). We know that it was written from Corinth, and not from Athens, because Silas and Timothy had already rejoined St. Paul (1 Thessalonians 1:1 and Acts 18:5). Second Thessalonians was also written from Corinth. We know that it was soon after the first letter, because like the first letter, Silas was with St. Paul when second Thessalonians was written. After St. Paul leaves Corinth, there is no further mention of Silas traveling with St. Paul. St.). St. Paul sails on to Caesarea and then goes up to Antioch in Syria, where the second journey ends. St. Paul stayed a while (Acts 18:23). This may have been the winter of 53-54 AD.
The third journey begins with Galatia (central region of Turkey) possibly in the spring of 54 AD and then Phrygia (Acts 18:23). Then St. Paul arrives at Ephesus where he stayed for 3 years (Acts 20:31) probably from the fall of 54 AD to the fall of 57 AD. St. Paul meets disciples of John the Baptist. He preached in the synagogue for 3 months (Acts 19:8). He disputed daily in the school of Tyrannus for 2 years (Acts 19:9-10), so that all that dwelt in Asia heard the word. St. Paul sent Timothy and Erastus ahead into Macedonia, but St. Paul stayed in Asia for a season (Acts 19:22). St. Paul wrote 1 Corinthians near the end of this stay in Ephesus (1 Corinthians 16:8,19), probably in 57 AD. It was not written with Timothy, who St. Paul had sent ahead into Macedonia (Acts 19:22). St. Paul foresaw his route of travel for the next four or so years in Acts 19:21-22. This agrees with his plans in 1 Corinthians 16:1, 3, 5, 8-10. Note how the “great door” opened to St. Paul and “many adversaries” in verse 9 compares with the events in the Ephesian amphitheater in Acts 19:23-41. In 1 Corinthians 3:6 St. Paul says “Apollos watered”. This refers to Apollos teaching in Corinth when St. Paul was at Ephesus, (Acts 19:1).
St. Paul had rejoined Timothy when Second Corinthians was written (2 Corinthians 1:1). St. Paul had come to Troas and continued to Macedonia (2 Corinthians 2:12-13 and 7:5), which seems to correspond to Acts 20:1. St. Paul also talks of a third visit to Corinth in 2 Corinthians 13:1 and 12:14. So Second Corinthians was most likely written in the fall of 57 AD from somewhere in Macedonia (northern Greece), possibly Philippi. In 2 Corinthians 12:1-4, St. Paul says 14 years ago I ascended into heaven. From 57, going back 14 years to 43 AD, this puts us back before St. Paul’s first journey, probably when he was at Antioch in Syria. After going through Macedonia (northern Greece),ans 15:23-26 and 1 Corinthians 16:1-3). Going back to Macedonia (Acts 20:1), they were at Philippi (northeastern Greece) in the spring of 58 AD in the “days of unleavened bread” (Acts 20:6).
Then they sailed to Troas, where a young man fell out of a window, and St. Paul raises him from the dead (Acts 20:7-12). Then St. Paul went to Assos, Mitylene, Chios, Samos, Trogylium, and Miletus (now in southwestern Turkey). From here, St. St. Paul goes to Jerusalem, where the third journey ends.
Here let us pause to look at the question: When was Galatians written? Galatians was written when St. Paul was not in prison and when neither Silas or Timothy were with him (Galatians 1:1). It was written after the council in Jerusalem (Acts 15:1-32 and Galatians 2:1-10) and after St. St. Paul was alone in Athens in the winter of 51-52 AD, which would make it St. Paul’s first letter. But this is unlikely, since St. Paul was only in Athens a short time (Acts 17:15). Or it could have been written from Antioch between St. Paul’s second and third journeys in the winter of 53-54 AD (Acts 18:22-23). But this is also unlikely because St. Paul would have probably mentioned that he would be coming to them soon on his third journey. It could have been written from Corinth in the winter of 57-58 where St. Paul wrote Romans. But most likely, it was written from Ephesus during St. Paul’s 3 years there from 54-57. St.. St. Paul is beaten by the Jews, preaches to them (Acts 22:1-21), and is brought before the Sanhedrin. Jesus Christ tells St. Paul that he will go to bear him witness in Rome. Many Jews vow to kill St. Paul (Acts 23:12). In 58 AD, St. Paul is taken to Governor Felix (reigned 53-60) at Caesarea, “many years” (Acts 24:10) after 53 AD and 2 years before the end of Felix’s reign. St. Paul then spends 2 years in prison in Caesarea in Judea. In 60 AD, Governor Portius Festus’s reign begins. St. Paul appeals to Caesar (Acts 25:11). Some days pass, then Herod Agrippa II hears St. Paul.
The voyage to Rome begins – St. Paul, still a prisoner, sails to Sidon with Luke and Aristarchus (Acts 27:1-2) on the way to Italy. They sailed to Myra (now southern Turkey) and on to Lasea, a large island of Crete, 50 miles southeast of Greece, where much time was spent (Acts 27:7-13). In the fall of 60 AD, they reached Melita, a small island south of Sicily. St. Paul was bitten by a poisonous snake but lived. St. Paul healed the father of Publius and others. St. Paul (still captive) spends the winter of 60-61 AD ). The voyage to Rome ends – St. Paul spends 2 years in his own hired house (Acts 28:30) as a prisoner in Rome from 61-63 AD. During this time he wrote Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon. In about 62 AD, St. Paul wrote Ephesians before Timothy came to him (Ephesians 1:1) while in prison in Rome (Ephesians 3:1, 4:1, and 6:20). Also in about 62 AD, St. Paul wrote Philippians from prison (Philippians 1:7) in Rome (4:23) with Timothy (1:1). St. Paul wrote Colossians from prison (Colossians 4:18) in Rome in about 62 AD with Timothy (1:1) and fellow prisoner, Aristarchus (4:10). St. Paul, with Timothy, wrote Philemon from prison in 63 AD (Philemon 1:1).
St. Paul after the imprisonment in Rome – We know that the book of Acts, so all of our information comes from various statements that St. Paul makes in his letters. In them are clues that St. Paul may have traveled to some or all of the following places: Colosse, Spain, Corinth, Miletus, Troas, Crete, Nicopolis, Philippi, Italy, Judea, Ephesus, and Macedonia. This allows for the possibilities that St. Paul traveled to more about as many diverse places as in all of his previous journeys combined. There are probably several possible ways that one could reconstruct the sequence of these travels which would not disagree with scripture. Since we do not know which one would be correct, we will just list what we know about the journeys. Thus, the references below are not intended to be chronological, although they all occurred after St. Paul’s release from prison in 63 AD.
In Philemon 22, St. St. Paul wrote to those in Philippi that he may be coming to visit them (Philippians 1:26). In Romans 1:10, 15:24 and 28, and 16:1, 3, and 5 St. Paul speaks of aspirations of eventually going to Spain. Did he ever do this in his final years? The Bible does not say whether he did or not. We do however have the account of the century author, St. Clement of Rome, regarding St.” may be Spain. We do not know for sure.
At some time after being released from the prison in Rome, St. Paul went to Corinth and Miletus (2 Timothy 4:20). He also went to Troas (2 Timothy 4:13), Crete (Titus 1:5), and Nicopolis for the winter (Titus 3:12). St. Paul leaving Titus in Crete must have been during a period of liberty after St. Paul’s imprisonment in Rome ended in 63 AD. St. Paul did not go there during the first 3 journeys. There is no mention of Titus or of any preaching on Crete in Acts 27:7-13, on the voyage to Rome. St. Paul says he will send Artemas or Tychicus to Titus. He tells Titus to come to Nicopolis where St. Paul has determined to winter (Titus 3:12). The letter to Titus was probably written around 64-65 AD. There are three cities called Nicopolis: (1) in Achaia (southern Greece), most likely the one to which St. St. Paul. St. Paul was apparently at liberty as well, since they planned to then go to visit the Hebrews. This could have been in Judea, as St. Paul says, “… for you had compassion of me in my bonds …” (Hebrews 10:34). This must have been in reference to St. Paul’s imprisonment in Caesarea from 58-60 AD. Hebrews was probably written around 64-65 AD.
St. Paul had told Timothy to stay and teach in Ephesus when St. Paul went to Macedonia (1 Timothy 1:3). During the third journey, St. Paul had done the opposite, staying in Ephesus himself, and sending Timothy with Erastus to Macedonia (Acts 19:22). So First Timothy was written around 64-65 AD during a period of liberty after St. Paul’s Roman imprisonment of 61-63 AD. St. may have been written from prison (2 Timothy 1:8) with St. Paul ready to die (2 Timothy 4:6-8), possibly about 66 AD. Yet he asks Timothy to come to him before winter (2 Timothy 4:9 and 21). St. Paul was probably martyred sometime around 67 AD.
May the blessings of this missionary Apostle be with us all.
Hello,
Thank you for the article.
I think (AD means after the death of Christ) is incorrect. It should be after the birth of Christ. It even contradicts with what is written down as …The crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ occurred in the spring of 32 AD…
Yours in Christ,
Yabibal the Ethiopian
Dear Yabibal,
Thank you for your comment. The abbreviation A.D. is short for Anno Domini or “Year of the Lord” in Latin. It refers to a rendering of the calendar beginning with the conception and birth of Christ in 1 A.D. and is not necessarily tied to His lifegiving death.
May God be with you.The U.K. Royal Society is holding a two-day Workshop on Handling Uncertainty in Weather & Climate Prediction, at which Dr. Judith Curry will be one of the presenters (and also chairing one of the sessions).
As he has in the past, the inimitable Josh has been live-cartooning for the edification, amusement and benefit of all.
Herewith two of my faves that I hope he won’t mind that I’ve snipped from his virtual sketchbook. Brighten your day by checking out the rest of Josh’s brilliant sketches … Enjoy!
3 thoughts on “Uncertainty Royale”
Haven’t (and won’t) read far into the material offered, but my impression so far is that the hidden agenda is to come up with a way to sell/impose the same-old/same-old by merging Uncertainty once again with the Precautionary Preposterousness Principle.
Good luck with that!
Not.
I like “Uncertainty Royale”; it sounds rather exciting and James Bond. Josh is as brilliant as ever. Re the climate models, The Economist once had an interview with Sir Brian Hoskins, Director of the Grantham Institute (the video now seems to have disappeared from the web), which had the following bit of dialogue:
Interviewer: Tell us the war story. How bad were the climate models when you started out?
Brian Hoskins: Ah, they were pretty lousy, and they’re still pretty lousy, really. They were terrible.
Royale is a brand name of a fairly high end toilet paper here. I’m told the UK hasn’t seen the like.The world that created Breivik
ANDERS BEHRING Breivik was born in London the year that Margaret Thatcher became British prime minister and one year before Ronald Reagan was elected to the presidency of the U.S.
He was 11 years old when the U.S. and U.K. led the charge into Kuwait in the first serially televised war, the war in the Persian Gulf (dubbed "Operation Desert Storm" by the U.S. military).
The 1980s in the U.S. and England were marked by the rise of radical neo-conservatism, attacks on trade unions (Reagan fired the air traffic controllers; Thatcher went to war with British miners; Rupert Murdoch destroyed the print unions at Wapping) and the so-called "culture wars" in which feminists, people of color, gays and lesbians were targeted as the "welfare queens" dragging down capitalism's otherwise unearthly ascent.
In the meantime, "Operation Desert Storm" became a hugely successful video game, Sadaam Hussein became temporarily America's best friend as it began its so-called "war on terror," and Anders Breivik spent lonely teenager hours playing World of Warcraft before graduating to study the writings of American Islamphobe Robert Spencer, author of, among other books, The Truth About Muhammad: Founder of the World's Most Intolerant Religion.
In 2001, the American Twin Towers went down in flames, George W. Bush evoked a "crusade" against Islam, and, in addition to the war in Afghanistan, the U.S. went to war again in the Middle East--this time in Iraq.
Since 2001, led by the assistance successive British governments, the U.S. has waged war on or military actions in at least four countries with large Islamic populations: Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. The U.S. and Britain have also backed successive right-wing Israeli governments as they have pushed Palestinians further off their land--standing idly by in December 2008 when Israel slaughtered more than a 1,000 innocent Palestinians in a bombing campaign in Gaza.
Meanwhile Bush and Blair continued the neoliberal policies of Reagan and Thatcher: undermining labor, cutting taxes for the rich, promoting privatization, and deploying an apocalyptic rhetoric--"You are either with us or against us"--to defend their stance of free trade, anglo-hegemony, and the increasing militarization of the West in a real and cultural war deemed by American right-wing ideologue Benjamin Barber "Jihad Vs. McWorld."

ANDERS BREIVIK is, in every way, a child of this world. A would-be computer entrepreneur; a lover of simulated wars; a lay imperial historian of Islam's role in world history; a man who shoots first and asks questions later. He is a copycat Islamophobe and imperialist--a man who has seen the U.S. and British response to Islam and "Marxist multiculturalism" as a template to lead Norway and Europe out of what he perceived to be the Dark Ages.
Fascism has not historically been widespread on U.S. soil. Yet, especially since 9/11, U.S. thinking on the nexus between Islamophobia and neoliberalism has taken deep root in Europe's far-right-wing traditions, watered and nurtured by conservative and even centrist politicians like the U.K.'s David Cameron, France's Nicolas Sarkozy and Germany's Angela Merkel.
Since his arrest, we have learned for example that Breivik intended to weaponize anthrax for use in his "counter-jihad," a comic book derivation one of the "subplots" of 9/11 and an indication of just how deeply imprinted in his lunatic mind are the rationalities of neoliberal capitalism and its war on Islam.
As several commentators, including Vijay Prashad, have pointed out, the young people at the Workers' Youth League camp that Breivik gunned down were, in many ways, also the "children" of history--but a far different history. The Workers' Youth League is rooted in Norway's social democratic history; the group is pro-labor, mixed race (unlike much of Norway's population) and representative of social-democratic progressivism in Europe.
According to Prashad, for example, nearly half of Norway's citizens are supporters of an academic and cultural boycott campaign in Palestine, and the Norwegian Trade Union Federation has divested from several Israeli firms. Prashad also reports that Eskil Pederson, leader of the Workers' Youth League called for stronger measures against Israel in an interview with a tabloid newspaper just days before the shootings.
In picking up a gun to slaughter these progressive innocents, Breivik was merely carrying out the laws of the right-wing fathers and mothers of his age. He is perhaps the world's first entrepreneurial fascist, packaging his genocidal ideas on-line, networking the right-wing corners of the planet, from the English Defense League to India's Hindu nationalist National Volunteer Organization.
The 150,000 Norwegian citizens who took to the streets of Oslo against Breivik's politics, and those who will gather in the streets of England September 3, led by United Against Fascists, merit our support and solidarity.
We need a street demonstration here, and now, against capitalist racism. No more copycats. The world is ours to make and win.
Tithi Bhattacharya and Bill Mullen, West Lafayette, Ind.Texas Higher Ed Coordinating Board bill goes to Governor without controversial amendment
Updated at 3:49 p.m. on May 26: The House passed the coordinating board conference report with a vote of 135-5. It will now go to the governor for final passage.
Original item at 5:51 p.m. on May 25: After whittling more than 40 amendments, and amendments to amendments, the Senate accepted the committee report on the Higher Education Coordinating Board bill minus one provision in particular.
“We’re hoping people are happy with what’s left in the bill,” said Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, the House chair of the committee.
Missing from the final bill is the contentious amendment by Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, that would prevent the state, with help from universities, their governing bodies and the coordinating board, from making any rules that would mandate student organizations allow all students to participate in the groups, regardless of race, gender or beliefs.
Anchia said the conference committee tried to narrow the scope of the bill from amendments that went on it to the ones that were critical to the organization’s operation.
The Senate voted unanimously in favor of the report. It now goes to the House which can choose to accept (or not) the conference committee’s report as of 3:50 p.m. Sunday.
Left on was an amendment limiting the coordinating board’s powers to those expressly granted in law, and others that changed the allocation basis for B on Time Loans, remove community colleges from the TEXAS Grants program, and expands the pathway to allow more transfer students to qualify for the grants. It created the Texas Competitive Knowledge Fund and expands reporting requirement for institutions on the common course numbering to a yearly update of numbering systems and caps the hours for an associate’s degree.
The bill also strips the board of the ability to approve or deny facility expansions and of the power to close or consolidate programs, a move which Anchia said would neuter the organization.
During the House debate of the bill, many representatives expressed distrust of the coordinating board and governor’s office on higher education issues and the bill got caught up in that.
“There’s a perception by institutions that the board and governor were being heavy handed on higher ed issues, and seeing it play out very prominently on the [UT Austin President] Bill Powers situation,” Anchia said, referring to allegations that some members of the UT Board of Regents were trying to micromanage or force Powers’ removal.
He said results of the controversy were manifested in the bill.A.

"I'm pleased that the Police Corps have also requested cooperation, as our goal is to make sure that all people in Partizánske will remain safe, and primarily those taking part in the decent march," said Božík. The petition has been organised by mayors of three towns – Božík, the mayor of Handlová (also in Trenčín Region) Rudolf Podoba and the mayor of Žiar nad Hronom (Banská Bystrica Region) Ivan Černaj. The petition includes four demands: 1) the introduction of tougher legislative measures against the violation of the constitutional rights of decent people perpetrated by anti-social individuals; 2) the payment of social welfare benefits only on condition that the recipient undertakes a certain amount of work; 3) a reduction in the age of criminal responsibility from 14 to 12; and 4) the prosecution of parents for the crimes of their underage children.
The Petition for Decent People is anti-Roma, insists the Roma Parliament. The leadership of the Roma advocacy movement met to discuss the petition at a special session on September 8, and presented the results on Monday, September 10.
"We consider the petition launched by people holding mayoral posts in towns and villages [to be] anti-Roma and [something which] escalates the tense crisis of relations in society between the majority and the minority," says a press release from the session as quoted by the SITA newswire. The Roma Parliament is convinced that those in power are unable to perform their functions and do not sufficiently apply Slovak laws. The party also slams many of the mayors for having used certain tools in the elections to win the votes of "indecent people" and now they are turning their backs on them and publicly declaring that they are unadaptable. When announcing the initiative, Božík refuted any allegations of racist motives behind its launch.
The office of the government proxy for Roma communities says that towns and villages should seek rational solutions and preventively treat problems of socially unadaptable citizens. Municipalities might partly restrict several extreme forms of such behavior through systematic work with problematic inhabitants that would no longer result in the serious escalation of tensions between people, Iveta Duchoňová of the office told SITA.

I carry way too much stuff in my pockets, even more in my bag. However, I do it because it’s handy to have these things. I use them every day. So, when you see me digging around in my left front pocket (the right one is phone-only) you’ll know something cool is about to emerge.
Since my pockets are already crowded, I am very picky about what goes in there. I only want the smallest, lightest and best of things in there. The things I will need every day at anytime of the day or night. Whether its your pocket purse or bag, the things we carry weigh us down so we all only want what’s really necessary and what really works. Just in case some one is looking while you dig through your things it’s also nice to have cool, nice looking things as well.
Pocket tour
The things we keep in our pockets are the purest reflection of our own personal technology. Whether it’s pens and pencils, Chapstick, knives, or an IR thermometer and an EM field evaluator (yep, you caught me), what we carry says a lot about our expectations about interacting with the real world. If we carry an $800 Montblanc Diplomat that is saying we expect a calm and genteel world. If we’ve got a loaded derringer in there, our expectations are quite different. Take the time to study what people carry with them and it will tell you quite a bit about them and their lives. However, don’t go through their pockets without asking, and if you do – I’ve never even heard of you. Pockets are very personal.
5 things everyone should carry
That being said I do think there are at least 5 things that belong in your pockets, bag or purse, besides money and identification. If you have at least these things, you will always be the “prepared one.” The one people will come to rely on.
Swiss army knife
The one universal tool that I carry is a Swiss Army Knife. Not the “piano-sized” one with 560 flip out gadgets weighing 7 pounds, just a simple 4 or 5 blade one that is slim, light and very handy. There are hundreds of models, from lots of makers. If I had to recommend a favorite it’s Victorinox, the original. It should have a bottle opener, a flat blade screwdriver, and at least one strong knife blade. This is the handiest tool to carry and probably the most versatile ever invented. You will use it every day. They can be beautiful to the point of true art or rugged and indestructible like a stone axe.
Something to write with
Never be without a writing instrument you trust and like and never lend it to anyone with out being sure you’ll get it back. We live in a world of written communication, you should be armed for it. I favor pencils, because I like to be able to erase what I’ve written but I carry a combination writing tool that has pens and a pencil. Simple, small and elegant.
Something to write on
There is always new information to collect, notes to take, things to remember and pass on. There is nothing so handy as a notepad to do it with. Small notepads are easy to carry and make a big difference in your own personal organization. I use them for grocery lists, ideas for work, addresses and phone numbers and just about anything else I want to save. It’s very handy to get something that has removable pages so it’s easy to leave notes or pass on information.
Something to light the way
It gets dark on this planet and it does it every day. Carry a light and you’ll always have a remedy. A good light is one that is light and easy to carry, and as bright as is technically possible given it’s size. With LED lights getting brighter, smaller and cheaper every day there is no excuse not to have one close when you need to look under that bed or cabinet or get across the dark parking lot after closing. Get a light that is faithful and will always work when you need it. If you can find one that has a small laser built in, that will be even better. Laser are excellent for finding little things dropped on the floor (Put it flat on the floor and sweep the beam around) or putting a bright light at the bottom of some dark stairs. Green or blue is better than red for lighting things up.
Your phone
It’s a no-brainer, but It’s amazing that when we finally have the most powerful communications tool ever invented, so many of us leave them at home when we go out. It is your “get out of jail free” card, or at least “not spend the night trying to flag down a tow truck” card. Most phones come with cameras now to record anything you see, recorders to catch anything you hear and email and data plans to send those findings anywhere you want. Your phone is your personal “key to the world” and every bit of information available. Very soon your phone will be your wallet and your identification, put it in your pocket!
The argument can certainly be made that a good phone replaces most of the items above, except the knife. Opening a bottle, turning a nut or cutting packing tape is tough with just a phone. Of course, you could just “Phone a friend” to do it for you.

Goat Hunting in Alaska
Tips on Sexing Goats in the Field
For a most people, determining the sex of goats in the field is a difficult task. It is legal for hunters to harvest a goat of either sex, but for management reasons the Alaska Department of Fish and Game urges hunters to target males. If fewer females are harvested by hunters the productivity of the goat herd can be maintained. A stable or increasing herd means more hunting opportunities in future years. The following information can help you learn ways of distinguishing the sex and age of goats by using several different characteristics.
Using Body Size to Judge Sex and Age
Body size can be used to sort kids, yearlings, and adults. Kids are easily recognized by their small size, weighing only about 35 lbs. and standing 20'' at the front shoulder. Yearlings weigh about 60-70 lbs. and stand about 27'' at the shoulder. Once an animal is older than two years they are extremely hard to discern from other adults. Adults billies average about 150 lbs., but may weigh up to 300 lbs. They can also be distinguished from a distance because they are larger and stockier than nannies. Adult females average about 125 lbs. and can reach a maximum weight of 250 lbs. Body size alone can not be a reliable indicator of a goat's sex, since in some groups of goats an old female can be the largest goat in the herd.
How to Judge Sex and Age by
Horn Size and Appearance
Horn lengths are approximately the same in male and female goats of the same age. Kids have only short buttons up to one inch long during their first fall. By the time a goat reaches the yearling age class, it has attained over half its expected horn length. Most yearling goats have horns about six inches long, which at a casual glance look much like adult horns. Although goats live to be ten years old or older, the annual horn growth increments are frequently less than 1/10 inch after the fourth year.
It is extremely difficult to estimate a goat's horn length in the field, since in most cases we are talking about an inch. In the Boone and Crocket Club record book the top ten record billies all had horns longer than 10 inches. One tool a person can use to compare the length of a goat's horn to the length of the ear. Generally an adult goat's ear is about six inches long. So, an ear length and one half should equal a 9-10" horn length. Goat's two years old and older will have horn lengths longer than their total ear length.
Brooming will also affect the total length of a goat horn. Most billies that are four years old or older show evidence of brooming (or the wearing down of the tip of the horn). Two eleven year old billies which were harvested on Kodiak during the 2000 fall season differed by over an inch (8 ¾ inches versus 10 ¼ inches) because of the wearing down of tips of the horns.
Since horn length is essentially indistinguishable from a distance, other horn characteristics can be used to distinguish the two sexes. Males have thicker horns, with a greater basal diameter and greater diameter along the entire length of the horn. Female horns are thinner and more spindly.
Horn curvature also differs significantly between most males and females. Males exhibit a smooth, even curvature throughout the entire length of the horn, while females exhibit the greatest curvature near the tips. Most female horns seem to make an abrupt curve about 2/3 of the way to the tips.
Comparing the width of the base of horn with the width of a goat's eye, probably provides one of the best ways to distinguish the sex of mature goats. Mature billies will have bases which are greater than the width of his eye. Even the oldest nanny will have horn bases equal to or less than her eye width.
You can practice your sexing technique by looking at pictures of hunters with their trophies on the web or in hunting magazines. Before reading the fine print on the bottom of the picture, guess whether it's a billy or nanny by comparing horn characteristics.
Most seasoned goat hunters agree that horn characteristics are an excellent way to tell the difference between nannies and billies, but all hunters agree that getting close to the animal is key to confirm ones observations.
By getting close enough to use horn characteristics to identify a goat's sex you accomplish two things; first, you reduce the chance of taking a female by mistake and second, you will greatly increase your chances of a clean kill because you have reduced the range. Impatient hunters that take long shots have a higher risk of wounding loss, carcass and horn damage from falls, and self injury from trying to recover a kill from steep terrain.
Behavioral Characteristics
Provide More Clues to a Goat's Sex
Goats are frequently seen in groups of varying sizes. Groups larger than three or four animals are usually made up of kids, adult females, and immature goats of both sexes. The likelihood of adult males being with these groups increases in November as breeding season approaches. During most of the year adult males are more frequently found as solitary animals or in small isolated groups. If you see a lone animal bedded on the edge of a 2,000 foot cliff, chances are good it's a mature billy. If adult males are found with larger groups of goats, look for them on the edge of the group. After a few minutes of careful observation, it usually becomes apparent which are females and which are males.
Goats usually have only one kid, but twins sometimes occur. If you see a nanny with three or more kids you can bet that the rest of the group is on the other side of the ridge. Although either sex may be legally taken, hunters are encouraged to select animals other than females with kids. Biologists suspect that orphan kids have a significantly reduced chance of survival during their first winter. Mountain goats generally have lower productivity than other game animals because of high mortality of kids and yearling animals. Maintaining a high number of mature females is desirable for good management of goats.
Another way to distinguish the sex of a goat is the urination posture. Males stretch their hind legs backward, slightly flexing and barely splaying their legs to the side. Billies often will have a yellow stained patch of hair on their hindquarters. The patch becomes more evident around the end of September and can be observed clearly from a good distance away. Females squat to urinate, partially raising their tails and usually do not any stains on their hindquarters.
Patience is Key
The longer you watch a goat the better your chances for gathering enough clues to determine its sex. Mountain goats use cliffs as escape cover much like a deer running into thick brush when they are spooked. A hasty decision to shoot may result in wounding or losing an animal because you can not retrieve it from the bottom of a crevasse. Once a billy is identified, most seasoned goat hunters will wait until the goat is away from any dangerous terrain in which the animal might hang up or fall after the shot. Goats are creatures of habit and if a hunter is patient to observe a goats feeding habits they will find out that goats generally come off of the cliffs to feed early in the morning and late in the afternoon. By not rushing your shot, a hunter has an increased chance of taking a large billy, which sometimes have a reputation of appearing when you least expect them.

This propriety liquid medical device consists of a sulphated, high molecular weight polysaccharide in a physiological salt solution. PERIDAN® Concentrate is administered at the end of a surgical procedure immediately prior to the final closing of the surgical site. PERIDAN® Concentrate has been shown in clean and clean-contaminated foal and horse surgical studies to safely reduce the number and strength of post-surgical adhesions. Visit.
PERIDAN® Concentrate is in early preclinical testing for the human market.
ARC’s product has two competitive advantages:
PERIDAN® Concentrate has been shown in preclinical animal models to be a safe, effective, easily administered, liquid medical device that flows throughout the surgical site, preventing surgical adhesions from forming between those tissues that are handled by the surgeon and those that form distant from the surgical site.These advantages result in decreased surgery time and reduced risk for patients and surgeons. Consequently, Fucoidan based products have the potential to become the standard of care in nearly all surgeries in which surgical adhesions are an important complication.
The mechanism of action of PERIDAN® Concentrate in the prevention of the formation of adhesions is thought to be due to the products’ physical form. These medical devices provide a barrier and prevent adhesions from forming. These products separate the tissue surfaces during the early stages of tissue repair with a coating of polymer (PERIDAN®) remaining on the surfaces.

Radically.“The Quest” feels like a personal movie for Van Damme in two different ways: It pays tribute to the action-adventure movies he had enjoyed watching as a boy growing up in Belgium, and it also pays homage to the martial arts that have made him an international star. Van Damme plays Chris Dubois, an honest, idealistic street criminal who embarks on an odyssey of self-discovery that literally spans the globe, from the slums of New York City to the mysterious magic of Tibet’s Lost City. Beginning in ’20s New York, in darkly lit scenes that are meant to evoke “Oliver Twist,” Dubois is forced to leave his surrogate family of orphaned children, but vows to come back to take care of them. Flashbacks from his own painful childhood inform how he was deserted and left to his own devices. Dubois is then kidnapped and enslaved by gun smugglers, rescued by pirates and finally forced into the turbid underworld of gambling and kickboxing. Kidnapped and enslaved by gun smugglers, Dubois is rescued by a classic rapscallion pirate, Dobbs (Roger Moore), and his fat right-hand man, Harry (Jack McGee), who in turn sell him in servitude to Khao (Aki Aleong), Muay Thai Island’s master of kickboxing, who trains him in the martial arts. Moore plays his role with characteristic cool but with a tad of over-the-top campiness; introducing himself, he says “the name is Dobbs, Lord Dobbs.” A beautiful blond reporter, Carrie (Janet Gunn), is thrown into the mix to provide romantic interest for Dubois; for yet another hue, the humdrum tale brings in Maxie (James Remar), the world heavyweight boxing champion, who’s both a threat and a challengefor Dubois. As the movieish quintet make their way across exotic deserts, jungles and mountains via elephants, horses and trains, yarn’s imagery borrows heavily from numerous Hollywood adventures of yore, including “King Solomon’s Mines,””Around the World in 80 Days” and “Hatari!” Culminating in the Lost City, Dubois’ odyssey becomes a test of honor and manhood in the mythic “Ghan-gheng,” an ancient winner-take-all competition, in which the best fighters from all over the globe aggressively compete for the coveted prize, the Golden Dragon. Audiences may get restless during a whole reel devoted to karate, kung-fu and Western boxing, but the U.N. will be proud, for Van Damme’s cross-cultural perspective offers glimpses into the flamenco-like stance and acrobatic leaps of the Spanish fighter, the wildly unorthodox style of the African, the slower movement of the kilt-dressed Scottish, and so on. The climax, which provides Van Damme a suitable showcase for his specialized gifts, pays homage to the famous — and far superior — John Wayne-Victor McLaglen brawl in “The Quiet Man,” with the combatants bursting out of the indoor arena and fighting all the way through the Lost City. Having choreographed his own battles and stunts for years, Van Damme’s move into the director’s chair is not a surprising development. Framed by a contempo prologue and epilogue, “The Quest” is not badly directed or executed. David Gribble’s lensing is often visually pleasing and Randy Newman’s score is melodic in a way that befits the time period. Nonetheless, this richly costumed epic represents such naive, retro entertainment in the style of a bygone era that it’s doubtful whether modern audiences, including Van Damme’s devoted fans, will embrace wholeheartedly an insipidly innocuous yarn that revolves around brutish gun smugglers and slick, cynical pirates.

The Tunisian authorities operate a Solidarity Fund to help the poorest families and there are health and social security schemes too. Tunisia has already achieved all the Millenium Development Goals. So is in many ways it is a model for the region and for Africa. Yet this success carries a price-tag; freedom of expression and association is limited. But for most Tunisians the trade-off is a good one and poverty no longer an issue.
How different from my last overseas posting in Sudan where poverty is an immediate threat to millions. Lillian and I remember in 1998 meeting an emaciated woman in Southern Sudan holding a baby - barely skin and bones - to her withered breast. With difficulty she squeezed out a tiny drop of milk. "Cok, cok" she said in Dinka, "hungry". She stumbled off in search of something, anything, to eat. After our visit the late Derek Fatchett, a great FCO Minister of State for the Middle East, spent two days in Nairobi and Khartoum and patched up a limited humanitarian cease-fire between the Sudanese government and the rebel SPLA, which lasted for two precious years. After a great deal more effort Britain helped achieve a peace agreement in south Sudan in 2005 and a Darfur peace agreement, which was not signed by all the rebel groups, the following year. But the former is fragile and the latter needs reinforcement and/or renegotiation. Millions of people remian displaced and in desperate need.
The international community is of course doing what it can to help. But why is peace so elusive? Why do governments and warlords indulge their appetites and economic interests at the expense of the poorest among their own peoples? Listen to two Sudanese women: "Men want power: women want peace." And, "We tell the men to make peace for the sake of our children. They say that we can have more children. And we say that we do not want more children; we want to bring up those we have already."
Peace - or at least a cessation of fighting - is of course a precondition for a serious effort to eradicate poverty. So is empowerment of women and the provision of opportunities for education, health and employment. We can all play a part in this however modest our means. As I write Lillian is in Darfur - her 21st visit to Sudan since her expulsion in the wake of the breach in relations occasioned by the ill-starred US bombing of the Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum North in August 1998. (The Sudanese know how to forgive). She directs an English charity, Together for Sudan, which provides university scholarships for over 200 disadvantaged Sudanese women, pays for schooling for HIV-AIDS orphans, organises women's literacy classes including in Darfur, conducts AIDS outreaches in displaced camps around Khartoum and provides eye-care to thousands of needy Sudanese, both the displaced and in the Nuba Mountains, with no access to medical services.
All this and more is but a drop in the ocean of need. But if we work together, each giving what we can of funds or our own time, I believe we can make a difference. After 40 years of diplomatic service I am convinced that our very modest contribution in Sudan is more significant than anything else we have attempted. We retire from government service next month and frankly should like a rest. But how can one rest from attempting to relieve poverty, not only in Sudan, but across the globe?'

Posted by Jihed Ghannem on October 22, 2008 at 07:25 PM CEST #After one of the biggest sci-fi blockbusters ever endured constant jokes and won few awards on Oscar night, it seems that quite a few blogs and entertainment industry articles are abuzz with one question. Is the Academy avoiding the science fiction genre, imagining sci-fi movies as little more than trivial popcorn flicks devoid of all important or political themes? For example, if someone were to re-imagine Heinlein’s tale of idealistic rebels becoming the very kind of authoritarian rulers they despised, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, would it be a less worthy movie than a historical biopic or an adaptation of another famous book? Does a film set in the future or using laser canons instead of guns immediately designate it as B-level pulp unworthy of critical attention?
Here’s the thing. I’m not saying that Avatar should’ve won an award for Best Picture since, as was said before, the story was an exercise in contrasts, pitting amazing visual effects against a painfully simplistic parable that relentlessly pounded every viewer over the head with an environmental message containing all the depth of a Captain Planet rerun. Sure, some cool transhumanist ideas were left in the final product because there was another chance to stuff something about unity with nature, but it was definitely not a serious contender for the title. It wasn’t the only science fiction movie however, and the far more dramatic and politically charged District 9 was also on the docket. It was thought provoking, inspired by real and brutal events, and had an ending that spoke volumes in just a few minutes of screen time. But of course, it couldn’t win against another politically inspired film based on real and very current events.
Giant shrimp eating cat food in decaying slums vs. bomb squads in Iraq? That’s an easy one for the Academy. The aliens and their shantytown were a metaphor? Yeah, whatever. Nerds. And that’s the problem. It’s hard to believe that in over 80 years of the Oscars being awarded, not a single science fiction movie has ever won an award for Best Picture. Even a fantasy movie managed to barge its way into this category after hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars poured into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy to the delight of fantasy lovers across the world. Are science fiction tales really that sub-par compared to war movies and drama? Considering how the votes have been going so far, I would think it’s safe for any filmmaker who decides to explore themes that aren’t on the Academy’s approved list of award worthy genres and looks into the future for an allegory of today, to abandon hope of ever being rewarded for the effort, no matter how well the movie turns out.
[ illustration by Tomasz Miazga, some images may be a tad NSFW ]Development of cable industry in Indonesia.
The country's cable industry was badly hit by the 1998 crisis. Until 2004, utilization of the production capacity of the industry was only around 25%-30% of installed production capacity. The industry began to revive only in the past three years starting 2006. In 2007, the country's cable production totaled 300,000 tons or 65% of the installed capacity of 445,000 tons. Brisk developments in the power sector and growing exports have also boosted the industry lately.
The fast growing demand for electricity has forced the government to launch am ambitious plan called crash program to build coal fired power plants with a total capacity of 10,000 megawatts to be completed in 2010-2011. The program is to be followed with a second phase with the same capacity. The first program is in progress pushing up demand for electric cable.
Demand for cables has increased not only n the domestic market but also in export market such as Middle East. The oil rich region, which earned windfall profit with the soaring price of oil since 2006, is safe from the impact of the global financial crisis. Property and infrastructure development continue to be brisk in Middle East. The projects need large supply of electric cables including transmission and distribution cables.
The revival of the cable market in 2007 and 2008 was reflected by the financial performance of listed cable producers. PT Sumi Kabel reported sales at only Rp.976 billion in 2004. In 2006 it sales shot up to Rp1,914 billion. Similarly, sales of PT Supreme Cable (SUCACO) surged to Rp2,281 billion in 2007 from Rp1,483 billion in 2006.
A setback, however, came toward the end of 2008 when sales began to sink including in export market. As a result of the global financial crisis.
Increase in the prices of basic materials like copper contributed to the problem faced by cable industry lately. Many cable producers suffered losses on foreign exchange as they bought the basic materials in US dollar the value of which surged facing the rupiah.
Despite the gloomy outlook lately, the prospects for cable industry are still encouraging in the country with the big plan of the government in the electricity sector.
Types of cable
Cable industry in Indonesia has expanded and could produce various types of cable electric cable, telecommunication cable, control cable, fiber optic, etc.
Electric cables consist of different types by voltage High Voltage (HV), Medium Voltage (MV), and Low voltage. Electric cables could also be divided into Bare Aluminum Conductor and Bare Copper Conductor. Generally bare cables are aerial cables having extra high, high and medium voltage.
Almost all large cable producers such as PT Sucaco, Sumi Indo Kabel, Voksel elektrik, produce all types of cables both electric cable, telephone cables, and fiber optic.
Each cable has an identity showing the type of conductor, type of isolator, types of insulator, etc. Cable with NYY code is cable with copper conductor (using the code of N), PVC isolator, in two layers (YY code)
Cable could have several types of conductors and isolators and with toughening material or protector from steel tape. For example, high voltage underground cables are apart from a number of layers of isolator, are also given steel tape protectors to protect them from being damaged from possible impact of hard or sharp material. See the following table.
The cable products of Sucaco include low voltage, medium voltage and high voltage. Apart from electric and telephone cables, Sucaco produces enameled wires, which include Polyvinyl Formal Copper Wire, Polyester-imide Copper Wire, Polyester Copper Wire, Polyurethane Copper Wire, Polyester Nylon Copper Wire, and Polyester Amide Imide Copper.
Standardization of cable
The government has determined 11 national standards for cable such as SNI determined by the industry ministry including SNI 04-2697-1992 and SNI 043234-1992. SNI 04-2697-1992 is used for electric cables using XPLE as isolator and electric cable having voltage raging from 1 kV to 30 kV. SNI 043234-1992 is used for flexible cable isolated and sheathed with PVC having nominal voltage of 500 V (low voltage) that is the type of NYMHY
The SNI was determined in 1988 through a decision of the industry and trade minister No. 407/M/SK/10/1980 on the application of Indonesian industrial standard (SII) and the use of SII for six types of low voltage standard electric cable and in 1988 had through a decision of the Minister No. 74/M/SK/2/1988 required the use of SII and the SII mark for 5 types of flexible electric cable : SII.2256-87; SII.2257-87; SII.2258-87; SII. 2259-87 and SII. 2260-87.
Starting 1992, SII was changed with Indonesia National Standard (SNI) base don a decision of the Industry and Trade Minister.
Cable producers and production capacity
After the 1998 crisis, there was almost no addition in the number of cable factories and installed capacity. The member of the association of cable producers (APKABEL), which groups almost all cable factories in the country did not change much. In 1997, there were 35 members of the association and 2006, the number slightly declined to 34 companies.
Base don official data at the industry ministry, among 48 registered cable factories in 2005, only 33 were in operation.
Number of cable factories grouped in Apkabel
* 1974 = 5 companies
* 1997 = 35 companies
* 2000 = 35 companies
* 2002 = 36 companies
* 2005 = 33 companies
* 2006 = 34 companies
The production capacity of the country's cable industry has not changed much since 2004. Base din data at APKABEL the production capacity is around 445,000 tons year for all types of cable.
Most cable factories date back to year before the 1998 crisis. Low demand caused factories to operate much below their production capacity. Increase began only in 2005 to peak in 2007. New investment began in cable industry that year including for capacity expansion. A Malaysian company, PT Wonderful Wire and Cable, built a factory in Medan. Another foreign company PT Prysman invested for capacity expansion.
Currently there are 15 major cable makers in Indonesia. Most of them are old companies like PT Tranka Kabel that came on line in 1952.
PT Sumi Indo Kabel Tbk (Perusahaan) was established on 23 July 1981, with the name of PT Industri Kawat Indonesia. The name of the company was changed with PT IKI Indah Kabel Indonesia in 1982.
PT Voksel Electric Tbk was established in 1971. Later its status was changed into a foreign investment (PMA) company after establishing cooperation with Showa Electric Wire & Cable Co. Ltd from Japan. There are six publicly listed cable makers--PT Supreme Cable Manufacturing and Commerce TBK (SUCACO), PT Sumi Indo Kabel, PT Kabelindo, PT Voksel Electric, PT KMI Wires and Cables and PT Jembo Cable.
Cable producers operate at high capacity
The country's cable industry was hit hard by the monetary crisis in 1997/1998 on falling demand. Capacity utilization was only 25%-30%. The condition improved only in 2004 and 2005, when the country's economy began to recover from the crisis. The growth of the industry peaked in 2007 when the government launched its 10,000 megawatt crash program in the electricity sector pushing up demand for electric cables. Demand also rose in export market notable in Middle East where the construction sector was brisk amid the soaring oil prices. Strong demand in 2007 resulted in an increase in capacity utilization of the country's cable industry to 65%-70%.
The capacity utilization was expected to scale up further in 2008 to around 90% of the total installed capacity of 445,090 ton, if the crash program in the electric sector ran as expected.
A faster growth was recorded in the production of electric cable to follow the brisk development in the electric sector.
Meanwhile, almost all telephone operators including state telecommunication company PT Telkom Tbk use fiber optic cable in their new projects. All producers of metallic cable could produce fiber optic cable.
The government has a big telecommunication project, Palapa Ring, using fiber optic cable.
Toward the end of 2008, demand for cables began to decline as a result of the global economic slowdown and crisis. Many large property projects including development of new cities in Middle East have been shelved.
Profile of main players
PT Supreme Cable Manufacturing & Commerce (PT Sucaco)
This company was established in 1970 with the name of PT Supreme Cable Manufacturing Corporation. In 1996, Sucaco became a public company selling part of its share at the Jakarta Stock Exchange. In 1997, it was renamed PT Supreme Cable manufacturing & Commerce (Sucaco). Sucaco is the pioneer in modern cable industry in Indonesia.
PT Supreme Cable Manufacturing & Commerce Tbk reported sales valued at Rp2.3 trillion in 2007 or an increase of 53.85% from Rp1.5 trillion in the previous year. The sales in 2007 included exports valued at Rp537.6 billion or an increase of 413.45% from Rp104.7 billion in 2006. Most of the exports were to Middle East.
The company, however, reported only a slight increase of 4.97% in profit to Rp54.2 billion in 2007 reflecting a sharp competition in the market.
In 2008, PT Supreme Cable Manufacturing & Commerce Tbk posted only Rp11.23 billion in profit, down 79.3% form the previous year. Its sales fell 6.8% to Rp2,127.03 billion from Rp2,281.70 billion.
Sumi Indo Kabel
PT Sumi Indo Kabel Tbk was established on 23 July 1981, with the name of PT Industri Kawat Indonesia. The company was renamed PT IKI Indah Kabel Indonesia in 1982.
In 2006, PT Sumi Indo Kabel Tbk. recorded the largest sales among publicly listed cable makers. However, in 2007, its sales fell when other companies recorded an increase. Its sales in 2007 fell 16.93% to Rp1,590 billion from Rp1,914 billion after it stopped in 2006 selling copper wires and copper rod produced by its subsidiary PT Karya Sumiden Indonesia.
The company did not sell the two types of cable as the profit margin was too low. The copper cable produced by PT Karya Sumiden is then used to feed only cable factory of PT Sumi Indo Kabel. As a result, PT Sumi Indo Kabel reported an increase in operating profit despite a decline in income as it sales and operating costs declined also decline.
A significant decline was also recorded in non operating cost from Rp19.076 billion to Rp4.573 billion resulting in a sharp increase of 74.58% in net profit to Rp77.467 billion.
PT Voksel Electric Tbk
The company is a producer and distributor of electric cables. PT Voksel Electric Tbk showed in its financial report for 2007, a 48% increase in sales to Rp 1,358.64 billion from Rp 919.53 billion in 2006 with net profit surging 51 % to Rp 53.7 billion from Rp35.59 billion.

Company sources said PT Voksel Electric had a 30% share of supply of electric cables for the 10,000 MW crash program.
In 2008, PT Voksel held a number of contracts to supply electric cable to a number of power generating projects. Voksel supplies high voltage cable for the projects. The company has expanded its production capacity from 800 ton per month to 1,300 tons of for aluminum cables, from 130 tons to 180 tons of medium voltage cable and from 100,000 tons to 120,000 tons of fiber optic.
PT Jembo Cable Company Tbk
Consolidated sales recorded by PT Jembo Cable Company Tbk. rose 64.2% or Rp287.6 billion from Rp448 billion in 2006 to Rp735,6 billion in 2007. The sales exceeded its target of Rp 496 billion.
The net profit of the company rose Rp22.3 billion from Rp600 million to Rp 22.9 billion in the same period.
Increase was recorded in the sales of low voltage electric cable with copper conductor which rose from Rp150 billion in 2006 to Rp407 billion in 2007. The sales of medium voltage electric cable rose from Rp91 billion to Rp 121 billion. The sales of metallic telephone cable rose from Rp39 billion to Rp51 billion. Decrease was recorded in the sales of low voltage electric cable with aluminum conductor falling from Rp140 billion in 2006 to Rp124 billion in 2007 and sales of fiber optic cable from Rp 20 billion to Rp 11 billion.
Kabelindo Murni
In 2007, PT Kabelindo Murni Tbk recorded a high increase in sales--up 175% to Rp 499.50 billion from Rp285.40 billion in the previous year. The surge was recorded especially in the demand for electric cables and telephone cables. Sales of electric cable on the domestic market reached Rp460.695 billion in 2007 and sales of telephone cable Rp36.72 billion.
Its profit rose 20% to Rp12.60 billion in 2007. Its sales in 2008 were estimated to rise still but not as sharp as in 2007. In the first half of 2008, its sales were valued at Rp 263 billion.
KMI Wire and Cable
PT GT Kabel Indonesia Tbk, now known with a new name of PT KMI Wire and Cable Tbk (KBLI), was estimated to chalk up an increase in income to Rp1.4 trillion in 2008 as it already secured a potential contract of Rp 961 billion on the domestic and export market.
Based on its financial report in 2008, PT KMI Wire and Cable Tbk recorded Rp 26.644 billion in net profit in 2008 or up from 2007. The increase in profit was attributable to a sharp increase in net sales to Rp 1.731 trillion from Rp451.483 billion in 2007.
In 2008, the company reported a loss of Rp 17.311 billion on foreign exchange, up from Rp8.912 billion in 2007

The potential contracts included from PT PLN (persero) valued at Rp463 billion, from buyers abroad valued at Rp255 billion, distributors Rp181 billion, and from spot market valued at Rp62 billion.
KBLI also secured contract to supply cable valued at Rp560.3 billion with delivery on June 30, 2008 including Rp275.1 billion with local buyers and Rp282.2 billion with buyers abroad. The company sells cables mainly to Africa, Middle East and Australia.
In 2009, PT KMI hopes to post Rp48 billion in net profit with income totaling Rp1.5 trillion from the sales of copper electric cable valued at Rp949 billion and aluminum electric cables valued at Rp472 billion.
Cable exports up
The slump on the domestic market in the wake of the monetary crisis of 1997/1998, forced cable makers in the country to seek to boost exports to offset a decline in sales on the domestic market. Exports, therefore, began to rise in 2000 and the trend continued until 2007. In 2004, exports totaled 66,600 tons valued at US$ 287 million, up to 111,600 tons valued at US$ 917 million in 2007 or an increase of 20% a year.
Previously exports were made mainly to Japan, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, but in the last two years, the Middle East has become the main export destinations. The construction industry marked with rising property buildings is brisk following the oil boom in the oil rich region. New cities have been built or being build requiring larger supply of cables mainly electric cable and telephone cables.
Currently cable makers are more oriented to export market. PT Sumi Indo Kabel, for example, exports most of its cable production. In the first half of 2008, the company exported 83% of its production leaving only 13% for domestic market.
PT KMI Wires and Cables Tbk
PT KMI has recorded an increase in its exports although most of its production is still disposed of on the domestic market. In 2007, sales on the domestic market made up 84% of its total sales with exports making up only 16%. In the first half of 2008, its exports rose in contribution to 25%. Its export markets have expanded to South America, Africa and Europe.
PT KMI said demand for cables have increased in Middle East in the past two years especially before the financial crisis in 2008. Large property projects and construction of new cities pushed up demand for cables especially electric cables.
In 2007 and 2008, around 70%-75% of exports by PT KMI were to Middle East. Other export regions accounted for the remaining 25%-30% of its exports. Growing exports have boosted production by the company prompting it expand production capacity. It plans to expand its capacity by 25% by phases until 2010.
PT SUCACO
PT Supreme Cable Manufacturing & Commerce Tbk recorded sales valued at Rp 2.3 trillion. That year its exports were valued at Rp537.6 billion or an increase of 413.45% from Rp104.7 billion in 2006. Middle East is its largest buyer.
Other cable makers such as PT Voksel Electric Tbk also increased exports. Voksel exported cables valued at US$3 million to Middle East in 2007.
Indonesia exports various types of cable. The largest in volume is electric cable with voltage of more than 1000V (HS. 8544.60.000) totaling 33,000 tons in 2007 and telecommunications cable (HS 8544.49.39000 totaling 25,200 tons.
The largest exports in value were wiring harnesses for motor vehicles (HS 8544.30.1000) valued at US$ 338 million in 2007.
Imports
While exporting, the country also imports cables. Imports have increased in the past four years in line with the growing demand in the country. Imported cables are mainly fiber optics and industrial cables
In 2004, imports of cable reached 20,772 tons valued at US$ 83,428,000 up to 50,003 tons valued at US$ 222,186,000.
Consumption growing
A fast growth has been recorded in the country's consumption of cables in the past four years peaking in 2007. In 2004, consumption totaled 65,400 tons, up to 227,700 tons in 2007 or a three fold increase from the previous year.
The increase in consumption in 2007 came with the launching of the government's crash program in the electricity sector. Under the first crash program state electricity company PLN is to build coal-fired power plants with a total capacity of 10,000 megawatts. Outside the program a number of power plants have been built in Java and other regions to cope with shortage in power supply.
In 2008, consumption continued to scale up as indicated by growing production and sales until the first half of that year. In the second half of that year demand began to fall both on the domestic and international markets as a result of the global financial crisis that caused the shelving of many construction projects. In addition, rising prices of copper resulted in higher prices of cables.
The condition, however, is expected to improve in the coming years especially in the country as the government continues the crash program in the electricity sector.
Cable prices down 5%
A decline in the prices of basic materials like copper and aluminum in international market, brought about a decline in the price of cables by the end of 2008. The price of copper in March 2008 hit the level of US$8,680 per ton, but by the end of that year the price sank to US$ 6,000 per ton.
The price of aluminum also dropped from US$ 3,200 per ton to US$ 2,100 per ton. As a result the prices of cable were estimated to fall by 5%-6%.
A cable producer said if it already cut its selling price of its cables by 5% since last September as the price of cables in the country depends much on the prices of copper and aluminum.
Prospects of Cable Industry
The domestic demand for power is forecast to grow more than 9% annually in the next 10 years. Meanwhile, the government hopes to be able to meet 95% of household power requirement in 2018, up from 60.8% in 2007.
Currently PLN's supplying capacity still falls short of the requirement, marked by the frequent crisis in power supply in various areas.
The government has launched a crash program to be carried out by PLN in the electricity sector to cope with growing shortage in power supply in Java and other regions. Under the crash program PLN is building coal-fired power plants with a total capacity of 10,000 megawatts to be completed in 2010-2011.
The projects to be built include 10 units of power generating plants with a total capacity of 6,900 MW in Java and 25 power generating plants with a capacity of 3,100 MW outside Java to start in mid 2006.
The program is now in progress starting 2006. Currently completion is about 60%. The project will need large supply of electric cables both for transmission network and distribution systems. The tender for the procurement of transmission cables for the entire power plants is valued at around Rp6.1 trillion. Procurement of cables for transmission network include Rp1.2 trillion in Java, Rp1.3 trillion for the southern Sumatra system, Rp2.4 trillion for the West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) system, and Rp1.2 trillion for North Sumatra system. There are still tenders for the procurement of cable networks for main electrical relay stations.
The crash program is to be followed with a second phase which will include construction of coal-fired power plants to make up 26% of the total additional capacity, hydropower and geothermal power plants to account for 60% and gas fired power plants for 14%.
Investment needed for the second phase is around US$ 17.3 billion including US$ 15 billion for power plants and the rest for transmission and distribution systems.
Demand for electric cables, therefore, will remain strong in the coming several years though slowdown is expected in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis. In 2010, the electric cables demand is predicted to grow again not only in the country but also in export market such as in Middle East.
With production capacity at around 450,000 tons per year at present, more investment will be needed to build new factories or expand the capacity in the next five years.
Conclusion
* In the past five years, the country's electric cables industry has expanded fast and recovered form the 1998 monetary crisis. In 2008, cable production was estimated to reach 85% of the country's production capacity or 378,000 tons.
* The increase in production has been boosted by growing demand especially from PLN's project of 10,000 MW coal-fired power generating plants. Consumption of electric cables in 2007 rose to 227,000 tons in 2007 and to 295,000 tons in 2008.
* Indonesia has also succeeded in expanding market abroad. In the past five years exports surged from 66,000 tons in 2004 to 111,000 tons in 2007. The largest market has been Middle East, but the main buyer of automotive cables is Japan to which exports have also increased from year to year.
* Until mid 2008, demand for cables on the domestic and international markets continued to increase, but toward the end of that year there was a slowdown. Many large property projects abroad including in Middle East were shelved on funding problem. Demand for electric cables, therefore, declined.
* However, the market is expected to be normal again in 2010. Construction of property projects in the country and in Middle East is expected to brisk again.
* Based on the trend in the past four years and taking into account the impact of the global financial crisis, demand fro a cable in 2009 is forecast to rise only slightly from 295,000 tons in 2008 to 310,000 tons. Stronger demand is expected in 2010 and by 2012, domestic consumption of cables is forecast to reach 513,000 tons. Additional capacity of the country's cable industry will be needed to meet the requirement that year.

Reader OpinionHow to install and get the PC software working for an Exceed CT6A or CT6B Transmitter. Turborix, Exceed are re-branded Flysky Transmitters so this install page works with all of those.
CT6B is available at
HOBBYPARTZ
,
XHELI
,
NITROPLANES
(looking for info on the new T6 radio with LCD screen?
)
NOTE: There are 2 types of Transmitters/Receivers. CT6A and CT6B. Although the software and USB cable drivers dont' care, the Tx and Rx are not compatible with each other. If you have a CT6A, you can't buy an Rx that works with a CT6B.
Install Cable Driver FIRST:
Get your USB cable driver working first. Both the SILabs and Prolific drivers are contained in the T6Config download file below. SILabs is the driver currently shipping with the CT6B. You want to install the driver for the cable before plugging it in. If you don't know which one you have, you probably have an SILabs if it is a new purchase. Work on the USB cable install first, before moving on.
Once you install the driver, it will appear in your Windows Device manager as a USB to Serial COM PORT.
To view this you do click the following sequence :
Start
Control Panel
System
Click Hardware Tab
Click Device manager
Click the + next to PORTS
There you will see an SILabs CP210 or Prolific USB to serial device. Note the COM PORT it is on.
Note that T6config does NOT like any serial port ABOVE Port 9 (
Digital Radio
does not care). To change the port, within Device manager, Right Mouse Click the Prolific or SILabs USB to Serial port then select Properties. Now click Port Settings Tab and then the Advanced button. Change the COM port to a lower Number. It's ok if it says its being used on this list, but don't pick a port that is CURRENTLY in use within the Device manager Ports list. Some PCs will change the serial port if you plug into a different USB connection, Try to connect to the same USB connection on your PC or USB hub.
T6Config
Install T6config.exe from the downloaded T6install.zip file. NOTE: Some People reported that T6config does NOT work with Windows 7 64 bit, Other people report it works fine (NOTE:The
Alternative programs
are better than t6config )
Plug in your cable and turn on Tx.
Select your com port (a new com port would have been added during the driver install)
Make sure it's communicating and click GETUSER BEFORE you make any changes.
Save your settings to a default file so you can come back to it.
Do not keep saving the same file name, you want to be able to revert back to a previous file if you mess something up. Name them incrementally Blueray1, Blueray2, etc.
My default file is particular to MY helicopter, Your Endpoints and Subtrims are likely to be different.
If you have an airplane, change the TYPE to ACRO instead of HELI 120
MODE is your stick mode. USA uses Mode 2 typically.

Change polarity (add - sign) to CH 1 or CH2 Swash AFR to make swash follow cyclic sticks.
Level the swash using the
trueblood method

Note that the knobs and switches will operate as per the operational video below
Info on the Power Meter LED
Voltage levels (tested by someone else) of the LED power indicator
LED steady green : SupplyVoltage > 10.8 Volt
LED steady orange: 9.4 Volt < SupplyVoltage < 10.4 Volt
LED steady red : SupplyVoltage < 9.1 Volt
It is ok to run NiMh batteries into the orange category but once it gets down to the red you should replace IMMEDIATLY!

One suggestion about the podcast for the future. Last episode did a fantastic job at setting up multiple scenes for each suggestion, which not only gave the show an exciting pace, but stacked funny on top of funny. While this episode had good moments, and I know that the nature of improv is being spontaneous and not forcing the issue, I do think changing things after a couple minutes would ensure a scene doesn't go overlong.
-
For example, in the first episode with the museum curator scene played by Andy Daly was so dynamic and funny because the improvisers kept changing up the scene and adding to the overall story, which in an audio medium is great to listen to. It's fun to hear the performers dealing with a challenge at breakneck speed, and that was absolutely reflected in that episode. Matt and the gang don't have the luxury of feeling out the audience to know when to move on from a conversation or add to what's going on, so perhaps building more scenes based on the opening discussion would fix that problem.

Later in life, Mason remained politically independent, refusing to sign the 1787 Constitution because he disagreed with several of the document provisions including a lack of a bill of rights.
George Mason teamed with George Washington first in 1769 when both were members of the Virginia House of Burgesses. Looking for a way to protest British tax policies, the two drafted a document which came to be known as the Virginia Resolves. The measures called for a boycott of British luxury goods imported into the colony. To ensure enforcement the Resolves organized local committees to police for strict compliance. Mason and Washington wanted the associations to ensure the boycott would aid in placing economic pressure on Great Britain. In that same year, Washington acquired 100 acres of land from Mason, adding to the growth of Mount Vernon lands.
Several years later, Mason and Washington corroborated again in response to the 1774 Coercive Acts passed by Parliament. A meeting chaired by Washington in Alexandria, Virginia during the summer adopted what became known as the Fairfax Resolves. Authored by Mason, the resolutions warned that a conspiracy existed in British halls of power bent on making the colonists second class citizens. The Resolves also suggested a meeting of a continent-wide congress to once again organize a boycott of British imports. Mason showed off his skills as an adroit political thinker in his authorship of the Resolves, repeating the notion that only the elected representatives of a province could pass binding laws on its people.
Mason attended the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia participating in several debates concerning the various powers entrusted to the new government. However, he ultimately refused to sign the finished document, protesting—amongst other shortcomings—that the new blueprint lacked a bill of rights.
In the months that followed, Mason continued to voice his concerns at the Virginia Ratification convention. Joined by Patrick Henry and Edmund Randolph, Mason and the anti-federalists nearly derailed ratification of the Constitution in Virginia. Though the anti-federalists lost the battle, they won a greater victory. A deal was struck by both sides to adopt suggestions for writing protections of individual rights when the first Congress convened. James Madison would later lean heavily on Mason's earlier work when he drafted the Bill of Rights.
Mason was constantly plagued with health issues during his life, and remained out of the spotlight after the inauguration of his old friend George Washington. Mason retreated to his home at Gunston Hall, remaining a vocal critic of the new government and many of the policies initiated by the Federalist Party, including Alexander Hamilton's financial plan. Weakened by recurring gout, Mason passed away on October 7, and is buried on the grounds of his beloved Gunston Hall.

Simplified Shopping: How Costco Tricks You Into Buying More
By January 27, 2014Awhile back, I got word that the Secretary of the Army, the Honorable John McHugh was going to give the US Army a very welcome birthday present on June 14th, in the form of an announcement of the selection of a new family of camouflage patterns for our Soldiers. I now believe this is not the case.
The first thing that led me to believe that this was not going to actually happen was that the Army still has not notified the contenders of whether or not they were selected. The Army would have needed to do this by the beginning of June, at the very latest, to give the companies time to receive their technical outbriefs and lodge a protest if they felt that the selection was unfair. That didn’t happen. The Secretary still could have announced, but he may have ended up with egg on his face had a protest action been substantiated.
The second thing, or should I say things, that clued me in to the announcement being stalled once again, were sources. Reliable sources (plural) contacted me over the past week and told me that the Army was going to delay the announcement for new camouflage. Some said until next fiscal year, and others mentioned AUSA time frame (both in October).
Now some of you are going to say that the Army’s delay is due to the Enyart Amendment to the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act but that’s not it. In fact, the delay is in spite of it. If anything, it should have lit a fire under the Army. For those of you that were off planet last week, the Enyart Amendment was introduced as an amendment to HR 1960 by Rep William Enyart (D-IL) who happens to also be a Retired Major General and former State Adjutant General of the Illinois Army National Guard. In a nutshell, it requires all US military services to adopt a common camouflage uniform by 2018. At the time, I opposed the notion that Congress should tell the military how to dress. But if the Army has in fact, delayed the announcement of their selection and subsequent fielding, then I was wrong. It looks like the Army’s leadership is letting its troops down and Congress needs to step in and force them to reprioritize. The top priority should be the Soldier.
The reason I was given for the delay in announcement is laughable. Once again, this comes from sources (plural). I am told that the Army does not want to face negative perception by starting a new acquisition during sequestration. Seriously. That’s what I was told. Apparently, Congressional interest in camouflage isn’t enough. Apparently, negative press from the main stream media for issuing an ineffective camouflage pattern isn’t enough. Apparently, wasting money by continuing to purchase camouflage it will have to replace after the announcement isn’t enough. And apparently, disgruntled troops who have to deploy in the poorly named Universal Camouflage Pattern isn’t enough. Negative perception they’ve got. What the Army needs is some positive perception. And they aren’t going to get that by wasting money and continuing to place their most precious asset; the Soldier, at risk.
I ignored the recent media blitz by the main stream media because I knew that the Army was working to correct the problem and field a real solution. And, with a 14 June announcement, there was light at the end of the tunnel. Now it seems like that light of hope has been extinguished. The Army has acknowledged that UCP is ineffective. Yet, it will continue to purchase, field and use it for the foreseeable future. Last time I checked, inaction was not a course of action.
While the final decision and announcement sits with the Office of the Secretary of the Army, I’m not giving GEN Raymond T. Odierno, Chief of Staff of the Army or SMA Raymond F. Chandler III a free pass. The Honorable Mr McHugh is a civilian political appointee. He just isn’t going to have the connection to the troops that they do, or the same moral imperative to do right by them. I know the CSA and SMA are good men and are the Army’s true leaders. They should show some leadership and get this taken care of. Morale is sinking. Showing some interest in the Soldier by fixing the uniform is a great way to show them that they matter. The Army uniform identifies a Soldier on multiple levels. It gives the Soldier his own connection to the Army and it displays who he is to everyone else. And, it can make a serious difference where it really matters. A proper camouflage will him more effective on the battlefield.
I realize that this decision is budget driven but there’s more to running an Army than dollar signs. Even then, this delay is pound foolish. The longer the Army delays, the more it buys what it doesn’t need.
I did try to reach the Secretary of the Army’s Public Affairs Office prior to writing this story and actually held off publishing it in the hopes that they would come through and return my calls. They didn’t. In what seems to be status quo for this Administration, regardless of department, the Secretary of the Army ignores requests for information, no matter who asks. I get it. If Congress can’t get subpoenaed documents and witnesses plead the 5th Amendment, why should I expect them to talk to me?
We all may wake up on Friday morning to Christmas in July. A day filled with unicorns and rainbows, and the announcement of a new family of effective camouflage patterns for the US Army. But then again, don’t hold your breath.
Paralysis of Analysis: A state of over-analyzing (or over-thinking) a situation, so that a decision or action is never taken.
Sounds like it applies in this case…
Damn and I was really looking forward to it being announce this weekend
Exactly. I was hoping for a nice Father’s Day surprise.
oh well SNAFU
Yep. FUBAR.
Looks like the Army is getting the big green weenie, again.
I see this way to often in the Army day to day…no decisions made, people will allow a window to close so they don’t have to decide a matter.
Doesn’t surprise me at all. When something makes sense the Army will shy away and explore less intelligent COAs. The past decade’s decisions in uniforms have collectively been embarrassing. The only thing any of them got right was Multicam for OEF. Oh well a few more months of BS is a drop in the bucket when compared to the past eight years.
All the more reason to just go with OCP and be done with it. It is already fielded by the Army and Air Force. Less stir than an adopting a completely new pattern and an improvement for the troops.
Just when I was getting ready to place bets… Camo-blocked again.
I REALLY hope you are wrong!
Other than changing DOD purchase orders and contract wording I dont see how this would cost any money in a time of sequestration.
Agreed. But if the rationale SSD laid out is really the reason, it’s a fear-based argument. They’re worried about an inflammatory journalist saying “At a time of constricting budgets, the Army has elected to spend $X million dollars on new uniforms!”, and then neglecting to mention that the army would have spent that $X million on uniforms anyway, just in a different camo pattern.
Which, admittedly, is something that some inflammatory journalists do.
Some?
Mick nailed it.
BOHICA!
The Sequestration arguement goes deep. The idea that we can’t afford to fly aircraft or stay combat ready but we were able to go out and secure a new camo and purchase all the gear to replace the old stuff really won’t sit well with a lot of people. It’s counter-productive in my opinion.
Your service has its own issues and how it spends its money is its business. The vast majority of Airmen could wear casual civies all day and it wouldn’t matter one bit. The Army is about Soldiers. Soldiers that close with and engage the enemy. They should be in proper clothing for that mission.
Yet we’ll still be providing ACUs in UCP to new privates entering the Army….
Fear-based is right. Who knew big strong Army was so chicken? Dopey Generals should hire a PR consultant.
They need to anticipate potential muckraking of inflammatory journalists by talking about the costs of delaying a decision because it would mean exposing more troops by continuing to field them in an ineffective camo uniform AND the cost of continuing to need to purchase said ineffective camo uniforms.
Seriously, take the journalists into a forest, give them UCP uniforms and tell them to play hide-and-seek. They’ll see how stupid UCP is and realize how vulnerable our troops are.
then tell them how fast uniforms wear out and that they need to be replaced regularly, this is just a new camo pattern.
Gee, wonder if they’ll still make the other uniform announcement….
I would predict no… by the sequestration logic, buying more new PT uniforms would cost money, too…
You’re implying logic is involved though.
Have well said
Haha*
I know. The Army announces a new PT uniform, over a new combat uniform. Because, that makes sense to a lobotomized field grade officer.
That was not me…but um, I feel the same way
%^&*($#(*&^%!^&*())(*#&^%#$~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I really hope you’re wrong.
So do I
Not as much as I do.
I’ll even be happy if Brookwood wins if it means I toss my UCP gear a few months sooner.
It’s a shame, it really is. Great article though, very professional.
I keep hearing a song playing…’I got you babe’…must be Ground Hog Day!
Really, this is passing from the laughable stage into the tragic.
Hmm… based on that logic, they won’t announce anything… no camo announcement, and no new PT uniform announcement, either.
Argh. I’ve been wanting to spring for a new assault pack, but intended to buy it in the new transitional camo, whatever was selected. I sure as hell am not going to buy a UCP one… maybe just coyote tan?
That’s what I did for all my gear when I was is, and deployed to Afghanistan using UCP. Everything I used, sans uniform, was coyote.
SSD, you’re right. I wish I could expect the CJCS adn CSA to do the right thing, but in the current Administration the right thing only gets you thrown under the bus and forcibly retired.
Instead, we do the political thing. I hope you’re wrong and we get a surprise.
Just a thought: Maybe SSD is to blame for this sudden change of events.
“This unscientific poll will remain open until Wed evening at 2359Z so that we can announce the winner on Thursday morning, just in case it might sway the Army’s decision.”
Way to sway the Army’s decision, SSD. If a delay means Kryptek is picked after all (because it’s leading in the poll), then I’m okay with it.
Yet another bullet point on the long list of failed aquisitions of new super equipment.
Its 2013. What happened to all the Land Warrior clad, OICW wielding super-soldiers I was promised as a teenager?
“All right, super soldiers! Get in line to draw your gear!
Today, you’ll be issued your rifle based on a 60-year old design, your ineffective camouflage, and your radios, which are bigger, heavier and less capable than the iphone in your pocket!”
“Don’t forget to pick up your 200 lb. case of batteries, either.”
Right, because going with commercially available, more advanced, proven effective technology would make too much sense.
If it makes sense you’re wrong.
My point was that after wasting so much time and money on developing new gear, the army always seems to scrap everything at the last minute due to financial concerns. If they want better gear, there are readily available commercial products that can do a better job than most issued items. If they just bought off the shelf, there wouldn’t be as much of a need to waste our time and money trying to build better mousetraps. The list of failures from our broken aquisition process is disgusting.
I don’t miss carrying those batteries…
No matter. The winner will get leaked within days. Protests will be lodged and hue and cry will amount to nothing except a really long delay in the final decision….which will be a common pattern for all US forces, except for extremely well-heeled and tac-fashionable SOF who get what they want 99% percent of the time.
With this news, I wouldn’t be surprised if the winner is leaked by COB Friday. I think the only reason it hasn’t been fully leaked yet, was because it was supposed to be announced.
Son of a bitch
Sequestration??? They act like with a decision being announced; the uniform will be worn next week. What is wrong with announcing it now since the uniform will be issued in the next fiscal year anyway? People need to get on the SMA’s facebook page and request an answer. This is ridiculous. Oh, I bet they will announce the new PT uniform and ASU changes.
Eric with all those sources and hints of knowledge in previous articles, I am convinced you know the who the winer is. If they dont announce it on Friday (give them a chance to do right) why not just come out and let us know? Force them to move!
Ok, I’ll tell you who won.
UCP
Unfortunatly you are right. And everyone lese looses….
Funny how this week’s Army Times has on its main page that the ACUs are now has cross hairs due to Congress decision.
Scroll down to the bottom
Same as (or close to it) SCAR – Innovation followed by stagnation.
Spot on
…And the IC, and XM8, and OICW, and ACR, and…….
Maybe… They’re going to make one big uber announcement: New PT uniforms, new combat camo, new dress uniforms, new rifles/carbines, new sidearms, and we’ll use Ospreys for combat transportation with F22 escorts.
I feel like you’re about to tell me there’s no Santa Claus next. To quote some Blazing Saddles “I am depressed.”
I’ve made a big business order for the Kryptec Mandrak, and Highlander Camo patterns from Vertex. This has been delayed for months due to this decision. Now I will be getting my large order tomorrow. Strange??
Thats probably because they didn’t get selected.
Doesn’t seem like a consperacy to me. Vertex’s website for the time i’ve been following it has said that the lizard camo will be shipped in June. And I have seen the pants available from other retailers before that.
I was hedging on buying a set now since its the only one of the finaliests you can purchase now. Since we have no announcement, I’ve lost the urge to rush…..
How about this for bad press. Balloon goes up today and we all deploy in ACUs again. Sounds familar…You dont go to war with the uniform you want you go with the one you have (which is a piece of crap).
SSD with all the leaks out of Natick why was there never an investigation into who approved the ACUs?
It was the PEO Soldier himself at the time, BG Moran. He was given the ACU/ UCP pitch with no science to back it up.
His response was something to the effect of “that looks futuristic and high tech. we’ll go with that!” then came the PEO Soldier media blitz. Several months went by and then someone said, ‘hey wait a minute, Natick’s got this great camo that they actually tested in environments with spectrum analyziers and stuff.”
PEO, Big Army, et al – “yeah, we made the decision already, lets save face. (even though that stuff is better.”)
Then the NCO at PEO Soldier who modeled all the ACU UCP in the press releases and had his face splashed all over Army Times retired and got a contractor job with the company running RFI fielding.
Graft and corruption all around, everyone wins.
Except for Soldiers.
HD, that’s not true about that NCO. He serves as a civilian at PEO Soldier.
1. Who pitched the idea for those colors in the first place. I have a hazy bit of info about removing and chosing certain colors, and that was how it came about, it was based strictly on NIR performance and conducting mostly night raids. Or, did someone come up with the UCP colorization on some whim?
2. How could ANYONE involved stand behind the colors as universal/standard issue? If it was just for IRAQ/urban fighting, that is one thing, but to call it UCP and issue it as standard is crazy. That is what puzzles me the most and causes me to get sucked into this issue. It is like a ghost walking around.
3. It is like the Navy going off to do gunnery sea battles in bright target orange paint.
F**k it! If we go to blows with North Korea I’m dying my ACUs green just to make a point.
This is getting regoddamndiculous!
Awesome! I don’t need to buy new uniforms again. Saves me another $800-$1000.
I can understand to a small extent as a tax payer. But as a Soldier it reenforces the notion of “How much is a Soldier’s life worth?”. This goes to show that in spite of the countless pats on the back and what have you, our Congressional leaders do not have the best interests of the US Soldier in mind.
Why is Congress to blame?
Because they caused sequester in the first place?
Either way, SSD, if they won’t make the announcement on Friday will you? Obviously you can’t say what the army will do, but the results of the competition are long over due to be published.
If Congress does mandate that DoD will choose a common uniform across all the services, that pretty much means SecArmy has to wait for a consensus from ALL the services on which pattern to go with, otherwise, you DO run into the sequestration issue.
What if Army decides to go with one pattern this year, but between now and 2018, all the services unite around a different pattern? That would be seen as terribly wasteful.
Logic would dictate the Army says “Hey other branches, look at this huge test we did, look at all these comparison charts, look at this data. We recommend (winning choice).”
Of course, again, we’re assuming that logic will drive the decision…
Since when does logic ever play into these decisions?
That is what makes contractors the most money, so… Yes! Probably so!
Not only did UCP win, but ‘they’ plan to force all services (including SOF) to adopt it by 2018! The runner ups were the Naval Blueberry Digital and Air Farce Blue Tigerstripe.
Wouldn’t the money for this reserach and testing have been earmarked prior to the cuts taking place, since it’s been ongoing for some time?
Sure, the funds to actually roll it out may not yet be available, but what would it hurt to at least let the Soldiers know what to expect?
On a positive note, June 14 will bring the announcement of the new and improved PT belt, to the glee of Sergeants Major everywhere. To save funding, it will be in the UCP. That shit stands out better anyway!
Seriously, if you look in the SSD camo archives, the GAO put out a report back in September 2012. It recommended a joint camouflage uniform for all services. So, this common uniform idea isn’t news at all…it’s at least 9 months old. I’m willing to bet that members from all services were in on the testing of the ‘final four’, knowing the winner would apply to all services, eventually. If they were not, the other services already have had plenty of time to be briefed on the results of the testing and make a joint decision within the framework of the September 2012 GAO report. What are they going to do, run the most extensive camo testing we’ve done all over again for each service? Now that would be a waste.
They already have egg on their faces from the media. Letting it slip away would mean less publicity, possibly. It all depends on the media. But the Army could just come out and explain the reasons, including: getting everyone in the safest uniform asap; the actual cost is relatively small because it is only a one time sum for the right to print; the costs and the study already being conducted; the costs for replacement would be incurred anyway. they could ensure that UCPs are specified as the major issue and is a seperate from from adoption by all services, which would still use the pattern, as recently mandated, on the timeline specified.
You guys should show up to formation on Friday morning in RealTree…..With your hands in your pockets.
Find me real tree in current uniform cut/ design, name tapes, and patrol cap – I’ll do it.
When the CSM goes nuts, I’ll just tell him its part of the Army camo study field wear testing.
SEALs?
A lot of people in the industry seem to know what the test results showed, and which pattern family the Army is going to select.
But just like the wide-spread knowledge of the story behind the adoption of UCP, they’re being good servants and keeping Schtum.
If all of those people talk it does nothing to get the kit to you, unfortunately. If they want the powers that be could write a new report and disprove the leaks. Lots of leaks.
[...] So, Congress wants the services to all move to a “common” camo pattern. Eh, I can think of other places to save money. I mean, sure the UCP pattern the Army has now is awful, and should be replaced. But the very idea of a universal pattern is flawed. So we’ll move to a joint pattern, and eventually, we’ll be operating someplace where it isn’t suitable, and we’ll end up having to buy more patterns. [...]
CHA-CHING!
Fire the Flag officers.
Think of the savings that could be had by laying off a few hundred General Officer Weapons Systems and zeroing out their billets. Replace them with Colonels and voila! plenty of funds for uniforms and new carbines (if needed).
Why don’t we just call up the Chinese and ask them what the new Army camo pattern will be?
I’m sure they were the first to know anyway….they already know all our other secrets.
Our top “Leaders” need to have some backbone or the NCO Corps is just…shit. NCOs train and lead Soldiers. SGM/CSM’s are senior enlisted advisors. Someone needs to start advising. I think it’s embarrassing when a brand new Private can point out the obvious and we have people with 30+ years in uniform that don’t have a clue.
01 February 2013: SMA on budget: ‘Priority to warfighters’
hypersteath said theyll announce in OCT
I said they’ll announce in October.
oh didnt see that sorry ssd
Argentina, Chile, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Peru, Serbia and Tunisia all wear UCP camouflage. We stop production, sell existing stockpiles to these countries at a discount rate.
Then we use our $400+ a year clothing allowance to buy the new camouflage. Obviously they will not give us the camouflage…so just authorize us to purchase it and set a wear-out date.
Does this make sense? I’m honestly asking. Where do all these HUGE costs occur? I know PPE, but that stuff needs to be replaced from wear and tear anyway.
You’d better watch it! Making sense is not to popular with the powers that be.
30 years from now our Soldiers will still be wearing UCP and firing an m16/m4 weapon chambered in 5.56
Sadly, I wouldn’t be shocked.
I’m not shocked or surprised.
Look at Benghazi. Risk aversion, letting people hang and rationalizing it,
Somewhere over the rainbow.
So, SSD, since the Army is giving us the stiff one (…again), are you going to reveal the rumored winner that you have been hiding for weeks now?
Heck yeah SSD, let’s put it out there! Who won? ADS or Crye?
Crye has the contract with our UCP, British, and Australians. Plus, IF UCP is their transitional camo, it is already being made in the ACU.
ADS has more of a military style, works better, and was developed as a proper camo family not a variant of Multicam. it’s also a big distrobution company that works with the military.
Stick the ADS camo on the Marines uniform, minus the globe and anchor, bingo fills the federal government’s 2018 requirement. It’s also much more functional than the ACU crap!
However, I won’t be surprised at anything the Army does. They recently admonished a Sergeant for reading Sean Hannity Books and eliminated the Fiancial Peace program that the chaplains brought to the Army due to it’s mentioning of tithing!

Tim Pawlenty come to San Diego for more than a salad and an iced tea?
During his remarks Thursday at the Republican National Committee Summer Meeting in San Diego, Pawlenty sounded a lot like a politician testing the waters, saying Republicans should reach out to conservative Democrats and independents to rebuild the party's clout in the Barack Obama era.
Some wags in the blogosphere -- and the national news -- are wondering if Thursday's speech was a test of the presidential waters for the two-term governor from the Land of 10,000 Lakes who took over from Jesse "The Body" Ventura and has reportedly said he's not running for a third term.
Pawlenty recently boosted his national profile by taking on the role of vice-chairman of the Republican Governors Association. His speech Thursday was decidedly wider in scope than the issues facing his home state, though, and ranged from health care to foreign policy to government spending.
"The only thing growing faster than the federal deficit is Chris Matthews' man crush on Barack Obama," Pawlenty told the crowd of 200-plus.
Pawlenty shared the blame, however for the ballooning deficit, saying that it had trended upward despite who was sitting in the seat of power.
Still, the bulk of the governor's criticism was reserved for President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress, saying that efforts to control health-care costs by spending more was "a scheme that would make Bernie Madoff blush" and arguing that "pretty speeches don't defeat tyrants."
With Republican numbers shrinking in many states, the governor on Thursday told members of the Republican National Committee the party must not turn off voters who might disagree with the GOP on some issues.
Pawlenty said the party "needs room" for conservative Democrats and independents, as in the days of Ronald Reagan. During his noontime speech in the Elizabeth Ballroom at the Manchester Grand Hyatt, he repeatedly spoke about the need to "welcome others who are not yet Republicans." It was hard not to think of candidate George W. Bush's "compassionate conservatism" when Pawlenty encouraged Republicans to perform "individual acts of kindness and love."
Pawlenty acknowledged after his speech that it has been a tough time for his party, saying "we got our tails kicked in 2006 and 2008."
“Pawlenty isn’t exciting, and in another year, he might not attract much attention,” Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, told CBS News. “But the GOP doesn’t have a lot of good choices on the table for 2012.”
Paul Bruno, a contractor from Monterey, Calif., who attended the luncheon, said he welcomed Pawlenty's visit.
"Always good to have a governor come to our state and ... tell us how things should be going," Bruno said.
Calls for comment to two local congressional representatives -- Rep. Susan Davis (D-Calif) and Rep Bob Filner (D-Calif.) -- have yet to be returned.
The Republican summer meeting continues through Saturday. meats/cold cuts
