Congratulations Mari Linamen
November 2011 HCAHPS/Employee of the Month
Helping keep our hospital clean and tidy is one of our hospital’s top priorities. Mari Linamen, Environmental Services Attendant, and November HCAHPS Employee of the Month makes this significant priority appear simple.
“Mari is one of the hardest workers we know,” stated one employee. “No job is too big or too small for Mari. I have never seen anyone clean our Emergency Department as thoroughly and with such a positive, upbeat attitude as Mari. The outpatient waiting area isn’t even her area of responsibility, but she scrubs every chair and goes the extra mile to shampoo the carpet. She really has a terrific work ethic and is a real asset to WCA!”
“Mari has positive attitude toward work responsibilities, coworkers, and our customers,” said Christine Reynolds, Director of Hospitality Services. “She displays a commitment to quality in carrying out job responsibilities and is an asset to WCA. She takes initiative and accepts and carries out additional responsibilities beyond regular job assignments for the good of our hospital.”
There is no doubt that Mari is a very dependable and hard working employee and it shows in all that she accomplishes. Thank you, Mari, for your wonderful service excellence on behalf of our patients!An Airdrie woman says court delays led to sexual assault charges against the man she accused being dropped.
The case was brought up in the legislature Thursday by area MLA Rob Anderson of the Wildrose Party.
He claimed a shortage of Crown prosecutors was to blame for the delay.
"Premier, I want to know what kind of pathetic excuse for a justice system charges an individual for violating an innocent girl for eight years and then denies that victim her day in court," said Anderson.
Premier Alison Redford responded by saying it's an appropriate question for an MLA representing their constituency to ask.
"I won't make political hay of this," she said. "I won't respond at this point in time. We'll look into this matter and provide appropriate comment back."
Anderson replied by saying, "You better start thinking about the girl instead of your political skin."
Alleged victim speaks
The woman, who cannot be identified, says the sexual abuse started when she was nine and went on for eight years. She didn't tell anyone about it until she was 23 years old.
The woman says she found out last month the charges were being stayed after three years.
"I was just shocked," she said.
"If I even knew that this was a possibility that something like this could happen, that wasn't even explained to you. I would have done anything I could have to get it through as fast as I could."
The woman feels the system failed her.
Alberta Justice says the stay of proceedings was not because of a shortage of Crown prosecutors.
Assistant deputy minister Greg Lepp says he's looking into what caused the delay.
Review to take place
"A review will be conducted in detail of this particular matter and we'll go through step-by-step to see what happened to ensure that appropriate steps can be taken in the future to prevent these occurrences from taking place again," he said.
Lepp says staying a case because of delays is unusual in Alberta, especially for charges as serious as this.
He says a preliminary trial was held and a date set for trial, but the judge determined it had taken too long and issued a stay.
"And that doesn't minimize what happened in this particular case," said Lepp.
"It was terrible that we couldn't proceed with this case in court, but if you put things in perspective — fortunately for Alberta — we don't have very many of these cases at all on an annual basis, just a small handful."Quality Assurance Specialist

Lyra Rembrant Polycolors vs./ Sanford Prismacolors
So side by side we have an example of a Mo Manning image colored in with both Lyra Rembrant Polycolor pencils and Sanford Prismacolors. (Just click on any of the pictures to get a real close, close up of the coloring) I have tried to stay true to the color families to make them as similar as possible for an accurate comparison.
At first glance you can see that the Lyras on the left are made up of more muted colors (noticable on kraft cardstock) wheras the Prismas are brighter.
Each one has its benefits and drawbacks.
Lyra Pros
* Lyras are oil based so they resist breakage as well as prevent "wax bloom" (common among wax based pencils)
*The pencils leads are smooth and soft. They blend like butter but retain their point exceptionally well.
*Pigment application is "thin", transparent even, allowing you to layer multiple colors and achieve an even, flawless, almost airbrushed look.
*Color names are based on traditional oil paint colors. No "cotton candy pink" here, you'll have ochres and red madder lake etc, very useful for someone familiar with oil painting and wanting to broaden their scope to include pencils
.
* 72 color range as well as 12 Skin Tones, 12 grays and some metallics sold separately (There are adequate skin tones included in the 72 but some find that the skin tone set is a very useful addition for coloring hair and fur~ not just skin)
*Available in sets or individually
*Lightfast
Lyra Cons
*limited range of colors in comparison with other brands.
*not as readily available in the USA in shops, but widely available through online sources like
Ebay
Amazon
Prismacolor Pros
* A wide 132 color range
* Super soft leads make blending a dream
*Available in sets or individually
*pigment application is somewhat thick and opaque , allowing almost oil pastel effects
*Lightfast
Prismacolor Cons
*Prismacolors break notoriously easily. Even when using a Prismacolor pencil sharpener and careful handling.
* Pigment goes down thick and soft which is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The disadvantage is that you need to keep a sharpener at hand at all times for frequent sharpenings.
*Prismacolors are wax based.
* For some reason Prismacolor doesn't put much energy into making storage tins that work well. From the first day I bought my set I have not been able to replace the lid without a large rubber band. (from what other artists tell me this is a common complaint.) If you have the money, invest in their super duper wooden set like the ones below: (beauties, aren't they?) A click on the picture will take you to Dick Blick Art Supplies where you can purchase them.
OK, so back to the picture comparison:
Lyra:
Prismacolor:
If you notice, the Lyra pencils give a somewhat darker hue even though I used the same family of colors as the Prismacolors.
This is because the first layer of color I aply when doing skin is CREAM, which, in Prismacolors is a much whiter, opaque cream but Lyra's cream is slightly transparent with more yellow tones.
This can be remedied if you first put down a layer of WHITE when using Lyras and continue as normal. See below the result when you do this. It's much brighter.
It all depends on what look you're going for; skin tones come in all hues~ but it's nice to know that most likely you can achieve the look you want if you want to be bothered to work it out.
Bottom Line:
I am no expert but I would have to say that Lyras have the upper hand in both durability and performance. Sorry Prismacolor.
In saying that I will still be using my Prismas cos I do love them! Neither set displaces the other. Each has its distinct advantages.However, you may be seeing me use more of the Lyras from now on and probably, more frequently, a blend of both.
I hope this was useful for anyone contemplating a pencil purchase!

What a brilliant post! I'm pleased that I'm not the only one to suffer Prismacolor breakage!
Wow! This is wonderful information. I have actually been looking at the prisma pencils lately wondering if I should make the jump. You make a good case and I so take your advice because you are the Q U E E N of fabulous coloring!!!!
Thanks for your comments on my blog. It makes my day! :0)
Great post, my prisma's are always breaking, it's so annoying, I have Faber castells and caran d'ache pencils and these are fine, I might try the Lyra's now, thanks for the info, Gaynor :)
I love the results!! Thanks so much for this useful comparison. I've been looking at the skin tone Lyra set for-evah!
Thanks for providing this super information. Given how fantastic your colouring is I consider you in the expert category.
Hugs!
Cec
Thank you for such a thorough comparison! I have Prismacolors but rarely use them. Once I discovered Copics and their fantastic blendability I pretty much gave up on the Prismas. I like rich colors and deep shadowing so the wax of the Prismas made this more difficult. I'll have to give the Lyras a try, maybe in combination with the Copics as I've done with the Prismas. Your information was so helpful!
This is a really great post and super useful. I've been looking at those Lyra's but can't justify buying them until I use up my Prismacolors more. I will say I have always been a huge Rembrandt fan... I have used their pastels and they are by far superior to any others I've used... even though I can barely afford them, lol. Thanks for the info!!
Fabulous post Dorcas, thanks for helping us out.
Hugs Jacee
thank you, Dorcas, this is great! I have the Prisma box with 24 pencils, and I'm saving money to buy the biggest one! I really LOVE them, but after reading this post, I think I'd like to try the other ones too! I'll have to think about it!
hugs, Alina
oh super post hun really imformative as i use pecils a lot prefer them to pro markers,think the blends,work so much better I am using polychrome, pencils which i just adore,do have the prisma ones too but as you say oh how they break and they are terrible to sharpen,hugs cherylxxxxx
Hi Dorcas, Thank you for the great coloring tutorial. I do have prisma pencils and copics. That will have to do for now but you have given me some "food for thought!" I am impressed with your stamping on Kraft paper. I usually just stamp on white if I am going to be coloring faces. You have inspired me. I have mentioned you in my latest post:
Hello Dorcas,
I just placed my first card on Kraft on my blog. You inspired me so much with these cards that I wanted to try it myself. But it was not easy to find something on internet of coloring on craft and your blog was for me the only one with tips and trics. So I linked your blog in my post. Thank you so much for the explenation of this.
I think you help a lot of people with this.
Thanks again Marianne
Wow Dorcas that is one fabulous help, I use Karisma polycromatic pencils, I dont think you can get them anymore but they are gorgeous to use and they blend brilliantly. Hugs Shirleyxxxx
Cool comparison! This will be helpful to anyone shopping for pencils! I always look for sites that have pros & cons of both!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! That's the best comparision of these two products I've ever seen, in fact, the only comparision I've ever seen. I so needed that information. I've been trying some of the Derwent pencils bc Prisma are....whatever is becoming more of a problem. I've heard of the Lyra skin colors and now I'll look into them seriously. Mo has brought a wonderful community together. I love your work too.
Bernice
Hey sweetie!
I don't do pencil coloring but I love to sit back and admire you people. Pencil coloring seems to require some real drawing skills and quite some talent:)
In my opinion the Lyras are a bit brighter, maybe is just the picture; anyways, I'm maybe too unexperienced to see big difference. Both look great.
I shall send the card to you only next week because just then I get home. Sorry for that.
Big hugs, Iulia
Thanks for the comparrison, I have been thinking of getting some more pencils as mine are to hard and I've given up using them. I like the look of the lyra...partly because I wouldnt have so many to buy lol. Hugs lin
Just placed an order for 72 Lyra pencils Dorcas, I've been wanting to try pencils for some time, I usually use Promarkers but wanted a change, I did'nt know which brand to buy, your post helped me to decide, so thanks for the info and giving me the push to get some.
All I need to do now is learn how to use them!!! LOL
Hugs Jacee
I have looked at your blog an your kraft coloring is just amazing ♥♥♥
Thank you for making this! just a side note concerning how easily PrismaColor breaks. If you microwave the pencils for a few seconds (usually NO MORE than 15) the wax melts together getting rid of the air bubbles that cause breaking
Thanks so much for the fantastic comparison - I went out and bought a set of Lyras after reading your post as I am a Prisamcolor girl like yourself, but wanted to see the difference. Well I'm impressed! I made a card and used the Lyras which I blogged about tonight and linked to this post of yours. ()
I won't be changing brands but at least I have options when I want to colour something in, so thanks :)
Thanks so much for this post! I admire your coloring on your projects! Yep...I agree with Cec's comment...I think you are an expert! =)
I have Prisma and love them. But I may try Lyra if I can find them here in canada.
Thanks for sharing!
Debi
ooooh - someone who speaks my language & I'm not an expert either........ interesting about the Prismas for I've not got any but have a small set of Coloursoft which I believe are similar to Prisma. I have a few Lyra but they are not easy to get hold of in the UK (where I am) but I do have the whole range of Polychromos which are also oil-based. I did a summary of those
whilst doing the MCC Colouring Course as I was fascinated by the differences between oil/wax-based.
Glad to have found you. Thanks for taking the time to post such extensive info.

The Big eASY
eASIC Debuts 45nm FPGA Killer
What’s bigger, faster, cheaper, and lower-power than the biggest, newest 65nm and 40nm FPGAs?
ASICs, of course.
OK, I can hear you already –
“That’s not a fair comparison.”
“You need a team of 50 experts to design a high-end ASIC.”
“By the time you factor in NRE and mask costs, ASIC costs a lot more unless your volume is in the millions.”
“ASIC has very long design cycles.”
“ASIC is a high-risk game that only a small number of companies can afford.”
The list goes on and on. That’s why ASIC design starts have been on a steady decline for more than a decade.
What if there were an ASIC technology that didn’t have the usual drawbacks like high NRE, long design times, high risk, and complex tool flows?
This week, eASIC went a long way toward implementing that vision, announcing their new 45nm, “Nextreme-2,” “Zero Mask-Charge” ASIC family. eASIC has been around for awhile, and we’ve always been fascinated by their novel architecture. The devices use a logic cell structure that is analogous to the LUT fabric of an FPGA, but programming is accomplished by a “configurable via” that bridges between routing metal layers. Since this is a single mask layer, there is very little cost or risk involved in programming/customizing the devices. Furthermore, in early production, the via layer can be programmed via e-beam, allowing for very small (as in 1 unit) production runs. The company can easily produce a wafer with many designs from different companies, so there is no “minimum quantity” issue for setting up the fabrication process.
The benefits of the single-via metal customization go far beyond that, however. In an FPGA, all of the routing and look-up table (LUT) configuration is done via SRAM cells. This means that the majority of the transistors in a typical FPGA are involved with the configuration rather than the actual logic function. Any given design implemented in an FPGA will require many more active transistors (estimates are in the 5x-10x range) than that same design implemented in a metal-programmed technology. In today’s small process geometries (90nm, 65nm, and 45/40nm), oxides are so thin that these transistors leak – a lot. All those extra leaky transistors mean that your design will consume many times (5x-10x maybe?) more static power than its metal-programmed counterpart. Metal customization has benefits in speed and density as well, and those benefits are evident in eASIC’s new family.
The net result is a family of devices that ranges from 258K to a whopping 1.9 million eCells (an eCell is kinda’, sorta’ about the same as a LUT4). To get a rough comparison (albeit apples and oranges, or more like granny smith apples and crab apples) between this and Altera’s 40nm Stratix IV FPGAs (the only other 45/40nm devices that have been announced at this point) - Stratix IV tops out at about 680K logic elements plus a bunch of hard-wired IP. Therefore, eASIC’s Nextreme-2 is definitely higher-capacity than Stratix IV; we just can’t tell for sure how much. We’re not just picking on Stratix IV for sport, either. Stratix IV is by far the highest-density FPGA announced to date. 65nm and 90nm FPGAs currently offered by other vendors like Xilinx and Lattice Semiconductor don’t even come close.
Not surprisingly, eASIC is positioning Nextreme-2 directly against FPGAs. The rationale is sound. If you’re one of the well-heeled few that knows you need a cell-based ASIC and you have the resources and expertise to pull it off, you’re already on the ASIC channel (for the time being). Between that crowd and the high end of the FPGA rank, however, is a huge gap – a gap in unit cost, power consumption, speed, and actual logic density. If you need a custom device and can’t overcome the cell-based ASIC entry barriers, FPGAs have been your only reasonable alternative. You had to settle for the cost, power, and density compromises offered by those devices.
With Nextreme-2, eASIC is offering a wide span in that gap. Compared with FPGAs, the compromises are few – loss of in-system reprogrammability, 6-week device turnaround, and (possibly) slightly higher tool investment. The benefits are lower unit cost, lower power consumption, higher speed, and higher logic density. For many applications, this tradeoff will be attractive.
Perhaps the most direct comparison for Nextreme-2 would be with the cost-reduction offerings of Xilinx, Altera, and Lattice Semiconductor. All three companies offer a path to higher-volume cost reduction for FPGA designs. For Xilinx and Lattice, the cost reduction strategy amounts to buying FPGAs that were tested only for your specific design (therefore giving up reprogrammability) at a substantial discount (more than 50% unit cost savings – sometimes as high as 70-80%). Altera’s HardCopy is different. With HardCopy, you pay an NRE to get an ASIC fabricated that is a 1-1 match to the functionality and packaging of your FPGA design. (Again, of course, you’ve given up reprogrammability, but with HardCopy you’ve picked up better power consumption and potentially better performance.) Compared with all these strategies, Nextreme-2 has zero NRE, probably lower unit cost (based on early released data), similar turnaround time, and better performance, density, and power consumption.
By the numbers, Nextreme-2 (and its sibling, Nextreme-2T) comprise 8 family members. Nextreme-2 has 6 densities ranging from 258K eCells to 1.9M eCells, and Nextreme-2T has two densities – 1M eCells and 1.9M eCells (also boasting 48 and 56 6.5 Gbps Multi-Gigabit transceivers respectively). On-chip memory ranges from 4Mb to about 30Mb, and user I/O ranges from 464 to 1288. I/O support includes PCIe Gen 2.0, Interlaken, Double XAUI, SATA, SRIO, CPRI, OBSAI, HD/SDI, SFI-5, Fibre-channel, and many others.
The design flow for Nextreme-2 is remarkably similar to that of an FPGA. eASIC provides a suite of tools that assist with I/O design, memory design, and a host of other system-level issues. Physical Synthesis (including placement) is accomplished with Magma’s BlastCreate SA. Placement, routing and subsequent configuration are accomplished with proprietary tools from eASIC. Design handoff can be either at the RTL level or, for those of you that like the maximum control, after place-and-route. A formal verification flow is also available for those of you that don’t like to stay up nights worrying if your devices will come back working after six weeks.
In the IP space, many will question the absence of the usual FPGA-style DSP blocks and hard-wired multipliers. The answer to this is simple and intuitive. Since the logic fabric itself is hard-wired, there is almost no penalty to implementing multipliers in the fabric compared with hand-optimized hard blocks. The advantages to this approach are that you create only the number of multipliers you need, and you can create exactly the size and shape of multiplier your design requires rather than trying to shoehorn everything into 18X18 pre-fab units. If your design has some bizarre requirement for 7X22 multiplication – no problem, just build one.
Along with multipliers, most of today’s large system-on-chip designs involve a processor core. The story here is decidedly ASIC-like. Since the fabric performs a lot more like a traditional ASIC, the ASIC-grade versions of popular processors from companies like ARM and Tensilica can be used. If you have a pre-existing investment in software IP for a particular processor core, you can probably roll right into a Nextreme-2 device with little effort.
eASIC has obviously thought a lot about the power problem as well. Support is included for a variety of clock gating strategies, and a “standby” mode is also available for putting the device (or parts of it) to sleep. Additionally, all of the unused logic is automatically disabled so those transistors aren’t passively leaking while the rest of your design is running.
Based on the track record of eASIC’s 90nm offering (they are claiming over 120 design wins in 18 months), we’d expect a lot of traction for this new family. The company claims an application domain similar to that of high-end FPGAs, but with a decidedly higher-volume bent. This could spell bad news for FPGA companies in their traditional stronghold application areas like network switches, as eASIC’s parameters are a good fit for many parts of that market.
eASIC says that lead customers have designs underway now with tape-outs scheduled for Q3 this year (Hey, isn’t that this quarter?) and that general release of Nextreme-2 will be in Q4 of this year with the SerDes-transceiver- equipped Nextreme-2T scheduled for Q2, 2009.Brand service?

A Bangladeshi factory worker monitors the production of biscuits made from U.S. donated wheat. The donation was delivered to the World Food Programme, a Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) McGovern-Dole program participant that works to provide food assistance in more than 73 countries. The biscuits will be distributed to about 2,000 schools in the poorest areas of Bangladesh. (Photo courtesy U.S. Embassy New Dehli)
Approximately 350,000 school children in Bangladesh now have access to a daily snack after the U.S. government recently donated more than 10,000 metric tons of wheat to the country through the Foreign Agricultural Service’s (FAS) McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program.
The program – aligned with President Obama’s Feed the Future initiative – helps support education, child development and food security for school children in low-income, food-deficit countries committed to universal education.
The shipment of wheat was delivered to the World Food Programme, a McGovern-Dole program participant that works to provide food assistance in more than 73 countries. The wheat will be used to produce nutritious biscuits for children in about 2,000 schools in the poorest areas of Bangladesh.
During a ceremonial handover of the wheat in Chittagong, Bangladesh, U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh Dan W. Mozena said the United States’ support for Bangladesh’s school feeding program supplements the two nation’s partnership to build greater food security.
United States Ambassador to Bangladesh Dan W. Mozena (center) hands over a ceremonial bag of wheat to Bangladesh’s State Minister for Primary and Mass Education Md Motahar Hossain during a ceremony at a Bangladeshi port last month. The event marked the donation of more than 10,000 metric tons of wheat to the country through the Foreign Agricultural Service’s (FAS) McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program. The wheat will be used to provide approximately 350,000 Bangladeshi school children with a nutritious snack. (Photo courtesy U.S. Embassy New Dehli)
“Our celebration today is about more than a mountain of donated wheat from America. What we celebrate today is partnership between America and Bangladesh to nurture the children of Bangladesh physically and mentally and to build the nation’s citizens of tomorrow,” he said. Mozena also noted nourished school children in Bangladesh are more likely to remain in school, study, learn and ensure a brighter future for the nation.
The McGovern-Dole program has partnered with the World Food Programme in Bangladesh over the past decade to provide basic nutrition and to encourage parents to keep their children in primary school.
Currently, FAS funds 37 active McGovern-Dole Food for Education agreements with 16 cooperating sponsors in 26 countries, assisting more than five million beneficiaries. To date, the program has provided meals to more than 28 million children.Depending on clearance, he may feature in the squad for United for their game against Aberdeen on Saturday.

What are these?Duke Energy coal-ash task force to have proposals by year end
Duke Energy expects an internal task force, assembled to review how it handles coal ash, to complete its work by year end and report options for long-term solutions for plants across its six-state franchise.
The task force, which Duke first disclosed publicly earlier this week at a presentation to South Carolina regulators, will report directly to CEO Lynn Good.
In the short term, Duke says, it has engaged engineering firms to assess all of its coal ash ponds and report any concerns they find to the company by May 31. “Immediate action will be taken to address any identified issues,” Duke said in a prepared statement released Wednesday.
Bizspace Spotlight
Spokesman Dave Scanzoni says the work by the engineering firms is essentially a new look at Duke’s ash ponds in all six states to make sure there are no immediate problems Duke is unaware of. But he says the information from the reports could also inform what he calls the “comprehensive engineering review” being undertaken by the task force that will report to Good.
Kelly Martin, the state's senior representative for the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign, says she is "glad to see that Duke Energy is responding, but I fear that it could be too little, too late. "
"Pollution and contamination of our rivers, lakes and streams is still happening," she says. "North Carolina and communities in other states need long-term standards. We need these standards to be strong and protect our communities. "
Ramped up response
Duke (NYSE:DUK) is taking these steps in response to a massive coal ash spill on the Dan River last month. Duke appears to be ramping up its public response to the coal ash issue as it prepares to file formal responses to violation notices that N.C. environmental regulators have issued against several of Duke’s plants since the spill occurred.
Until now, Duke has said little about the violation notices other than that it will respond to them.
The first of those notices, which included allegations of a raft of violations that the state says led to the spill, are due by early next week. The N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources has cited violations at six plants in addition to the one where the spill occurred.
Duke has also put up a website outlining actions the company has already started or committed to improve operations at several of the ash ponds at Duke’s 14 current and retired coal plants across the state.
Lined landfills
The principal response to calls for Duke to change its ash disposal operations came in a March 12 letter Good wrote to Gov. Pat McCrory.
Good committed the company to excavate ponds along rivers and lakes at three plants and bury the waste in a lined landfill away from the water. The three are the Dan River Steam Station, where the spill occurred Feb. 2; the Riverbend Steam Station, adjacent to Charlotte reservoir Mountain Island Lake; and the Asheville Plant in Skyland on the French Broad River.
She also said Duke would accelerate its planned closing of the ash pond at the shuttered Sutton Steam Station, and she proposed a number of smaller initial steps to address the issue.
But Duke is looking more broadly ash storage and disposal at the 29 operating and retired coal plants at its regulated utilities across six states.
Risks, trade-offs
Duke also operates six wholesale coal plants in its Midwestern fleet that serves its Ohio operations. That fleet is currently up for sale.
Duke called the effort a high priority and said it is “moving aggressively to update, expand and accelerate our actions.”
It warned, however, that while the policies and plans will be developed as quickly as possible, implementing some of them will take more time.
“We will continue to pursue a combination of immediate steps and near-term actions that are part of an overall plan that will be fully implemented over the next few years,” the company says. “Each power plant site is unique, and the long-term solutions require analysis of trade-offs, risks and costs.”
The coal spill at Dan River occurred when a 48-inch stormwater pipe under the Dan River plant’s main ash pond caved in and spewed up to 39,000 tons of coal ash into the river.The last stage of the 2013 Cup of Russia, the Cup of the Governor of Ugra, was held from 27th November to 6th December in Khanty-Mansiysk.

LUKA Modric 's hopes of a Real Madrid transfer this summer from Tottenham could be at an end after the club said they would not pay his £40m transfer fee.
Luka Modric has had interest from Chelsea and PSG []
The Tottenham star has openly shown his desire to move to Real Madrid and has allegedly said it would be his preferred club.
But now the Spanish giants have cooled their chase, claiming they will not offer more than £30million for the midfielder.
Real Madrid is finding it tougher than expected to reach an agreement with Tottenham who are digging their heels in over the transfer fee.

Real Madrid is finding it tougher than expected to reach an agreement for Luka Modric
Manager Andre Villas Boas has previously said that Modric will not move unless their £40million fee is matched.
He said: "This can be resolved in one of two ways. One is that the teams pay what Tottenham is asking and the other is that the player continues with us next season."
According to Spanish sources, Real Madrid are unwilling to pay the huge fee set by Tottenham.capstone therapeutics corp

Colmes, 62, appeared at several New York radio stations, before his liberal agenda became the focus. He worked at WEVD and WMCA, along with the aforementioned WHN. His career reached new heights when he teamed with Hannity in 1996.
But radio was always his first love. He made a name for himself at a pair of powerhouse stations. Shortly after the 77 WABC Musicradio flip to Talkradio, Colmes was the station’s morning man. Later that decade, he had a brief stint at WNBC. That didn’t stop him from making history and becoming the answer to a trivia question, “Who was the last voice on 66 WNBC?”
At precisely, 5:30 p.m. on October 7, 1988, WNBC was no more.
“I’m Alan Colmes. Thank you, God bless you, and for the last time, this is 66 WNBC New York. Let’s do the countdown,” he told listeners.
Watch as Colmes discusses that memorable moment in New York radio. Plus, he reflects to FishbowlNY on his time at WABC and his “embellished” middle initial. Colmes also shares his earliest interest in radio.* Prices may differ from that shown
When I worked at my local Sainsbury's we took delivery of 3 of these sytems. I bought the last one and was pleasently surprised. for the amount I paid, this is a very good player with excelent quality in both the picture and the sound. There is an easy region hack for this so if you want to watch US disks than that will be no probllem. as a first DVD player it is Ideal and you won't be disappointed, although if you are expecting a high quality unit then my advice is to look elsewhere.
One day whilst I was Asda I saw this great looking black thing. Not sureabout dvds I asked the bloke about them. Well, he said that it is the new advanced technology of the future and that it played films on disc rather than vhs. On impulse I decided to buy one. I couldn't have done anythingbetter says the wife who now spends my wages on dvds. The sound is greatwith dolby digital surround and the picture is wonderful. Thankyou bush!!

Recipe: fried pickles with green goddess aioli
I bid farewell to spring last week with a 17-mile trail run chased by an Andrew Bird concert at the Chautauqua Community House (125 seats and we were *this* close to the stage!) on Thursday. Then my parents made an awesome feast of a Chinese meal for us Friday evening including some of Jeremy’s favorite dishes. The next morning we packed the pup into the car and headed southwest to Crested Butte on the first day of summer. I wanted to catch the early summer wildflowers (which are very different from the mid-summer wildflowers) and well – it’s Jeremy’s happy place.
wonderful things: kaweah, summer solstice, crested butte
wallflowers in bloom
lupine nestled under aspen stands
Being in Crested Butte is also a nice opportunity to change up my trail runs and keep track of which flowers are blooming where. The trails I ran last month are no longer mudslides, but hardpack dirt. As I increase my distances, climbs, and elevations, I’m learning to also manage things like chafing, hot spots, fuel intake, rate of water intake, sun exposure, pacing, what to eat pre- and post run. Next up is filtering water on the trail because we are reaching the limit of what we can carry. I was completely oblivious to these issues at the start. No such thing as a simple run anymore.
green has arrived in the mountains
a quick snappy of purple larkspur with mount crested butte in the distance
One thing I don’t have to worry about as much is my caloric intake. Actually, I *DO* have to watch my caloric intake, but mostly to make sure I get enough calories to balance a 2000 calorie run. Something like that. The point is that I’m not shying away from the occasional fried snack which is why I ventured forth to make these irresistible fried pickles. The first time I had them was at Oak in Boulder, served with a side of green goddess aioli. If you love pickles and fried things, this is the ultimate combination. I suggest making the aioli first, because you’ll want to eat the pickles while they’re fresh and hot.
chives, parsley, dill, mayonnaise, lemon, garlic, salt, pepper, anchovy paste
grate the garlic
chop the herbs
The recipe I originally followed had too little volume to blend properly in my blender, so I doubled the amount in the recipe below. That seemed to solve the blender issue. I used chives, Italian (flat-leaf) parsley, and dill as my herbs, but you can use any of your favorite fresh herb combinations for the aioli.
chopped herbs, mayonnaise, pepper, lemon juice, grated garlic, salt, anchovy paste
place the herbs, mayonnaise, garlic, lemon juice, and anchovy paste in the blender
purée until smooth and season with salt and pepper
Once the aioli is done, you can cover it and store it in the refrigerator for up to a week. Now on to the pickles. I’m particular about the crunch of my pickles. I like them crunchy if at all possible. Flavor is just as important. I used Claussen’s Kosher Dill pickles for this batch and the results were great. They retained their crunch and flavor nicely. Use what you like, but just be sure to pat dry the pickle slices to avoid splattering when you fry them.
pickles, beer, egg, baking powder, salt, flour
slice the pickles to 1/2-inch thickness
pat the slices dry
The batter is a straightforward beer batter. If you don’t want to use beer, you can substitute milk, but beer lends a nice fermented flavor to the batter. Which beer to use? I have no idea. I think any beer works. I knew I wouldn’t go wrong with a local brew, but Colorado is kind of obsessed with making great beer.
whisk the beer and egg together
mix the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl
stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients
Now you are ready to fry. I find the use of a candy thermometer slapped onto the side of my pot of oil helps tremendously when it comes to frying. Usually there is a target temperature to maintain, but between the flame on my stove and the drop in temperature when you add cold things (cold because it’s room temperature as opposed to 375°F) to hot oil, it can be a juggling act at best. At least the thermometer helps me stay in the ballpark of the target temperature and I can make adjustments accordingly. The pickle slices fry at 375°F for about 2 minutes a side until golden. If you like the batter coating thick, give it an extra 30 seconds per side.
dip each pickle slice
fried and draining on a cooling rack
These fried pickles are best eaten hot while the batter is crisp and fresh. If you want to make them ahead, I’ve had good results storing them in an airtight container in the refrigerator and then heating them in a 350°F oven until the batter crisps up again to your liking (maybe 10 minutes). Serve them along with the green goddess aioli and you have in essence created your own little party.

Fried Pickles with Green Goddess Aioli
[print recipe]
from this recipe and this recipe
1 lb. dill pickles (or less – the batter will support at least 1 pound)
1 egg
12 oz. beer
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
vegetable oil for frying
green goddess aioli for dipping (see recipe below)
green goddess aioli
6 tbsps herbs (parsley, dill, chives, basil, etc.), finely chopped
2 tbsps lemon juice, fresh squeezed
2 cloves garlic, grated
1/2 cup mayonnaise
2 tsps anchovy paste
salt and pepper to taste
Make the green goddess aioli: Place the herbs, lemon juice, garlic, mayonnaise, and anchovy paste in a blender. Blend until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste. Refrigerate until ready to use. Makes just under 1 cup.
Make the fried pickles: Slice the pickles into 3/8-inch thick slices – either crosswise (circles), lengthwise (long ovals), or on a diagonal. Pat each slice dry with paper towels (I gave each a good squeeze to reduce the liquid). Crack the egg into a large bowl and whisk to break up the yolk. Whisk in the beer. In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Stir the dry ingredients into the beer and egg mixture until smooth. Heat 2-inches of oil in a medium saucepan or a large pot to 375°F (I use a candy thermometer). When the oil reaches temperature, dip pickle slices one-at-a-time into the batter, let excess batter drip off, and place in the hot oil. Fry until golden (about 2 minutes per side). Remove from oil and drain on paper towels or on a cooling rack. Work in batches, but don’t crowd the pickles as they may stick together. Serve hot with green goddess aioli.

This looks delicious! I’ve always wanted to try fried pickles, and I would love to make this, but this time I’ll live vicariously through you since I’m watching my caloric intake in terms of consuming less. Maybe once I reach my goal weight, I’ll treat myself and make these :)

Wow! Good for you….I rather bike 17 miles than run it! You got some beautiful shots- love the picture of Kaweah with the backdrop of Crested Butte! Makes me thinking of Heidi and her grandfather somewhere in Switzerland. Don’t worry about counting calories. Just keep exercising and be consistent with your training, do a few VO2 max intervals, and keep HR low during easy days, and it will be all good. Here’s to fried pickles! :-)

Secretary of State John Kerry was expected to announce the new aid package, which would mark a recalibration of U.S. policy toward Syrian rebel groups at Saturday's meeting. Fresh U.S. humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees is also likely.

More than 70,000 have been killed in the revolt and subsequent civil war. But a military stalemate has set in and much of Syria is left in ruins because of a divided and ineffective opposition, a lack of action by foreign allies and Assad's ability to rely on support from Russia and Iran.

@JjKiam: The appeal of BBRY is that BlackBerry does not need to beat Apple or Samsung for the stock price to go up. It just needs to secure a niche position in the high-end smartphone market (say 5%). I think the new phones are very slick and are certainly competitive with top of the line iOS and Android devices.
It's quite possible that BlackBerry's smaller app ecosystem drives customers away, or that the integration of Apple products with one another creates stickiness that prevents customers from switching. However, I think it is beyond premature to call BB DOA. Nokia and BlackBerry previously seemed to have the market locked down, but when a better product came out (iPhone), customers adapted. There are plenty of reasons why people could find the BB10 user experience more attractive than iOS or Android.
AdamMike Swick lived up to his nickname of "Quick" on Wednesday on the UFC's Fight for the Troops card at the Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, N.C.
Swick connected with a perfect right hand on Jonathan Goulet's chin, then finished the Canadian off with 19 hard punches on the ground to earn the technical knockout victory just 33 seconds into their welterweight bout.
Welterweight contender Josh Koscheck, who lost a tough bout to Thiago Alves on Oct. 25 at UFC 90, didn't let Swick, his American Kickboxing Academy teammate, get all the glory. Koscheck hammered Yoshiyuki Yoshida with a pair of right hands and scored a knockout at 2:15 of the first round.
One-time World Extreme Cagefighting light heavyweight champion Steve Cantwell won his UFC debut when he put an arm bar on previously unbeaten Razak Al-Hassan at 4:04 of the first round.
Jim Miller was impressive in winning a unanimous decision over Matt Wiman in a lightweight bout. Tim Credeur stopped Nate Loughran at the end of two rounds of a middleweight bout. Ben Saunders stopped Brandon Wolf in just 1:49 of their welterweight bout.

Hey Steve, loved the video again. We passed each other on one of those early, brutal hills. I’ve stuck a link to your video on my blog entry (linked above) so maybe I’ll send some traffic your way.
Thanks for doing this!
I heard about the “nipple tape guy” and was hoping you still had that video in your archives. Can you send me a link or let me know where to find it? I would love to see it. Thanks! CherriNew camera to add to collection?
Suggestions please....
I now own the Olympus E5 and E510 plus some nice zuiko glass to use with them. I love the E5 and the pictures it produces but it is a heavy camera to carry around. Don't mind in certain situations but would like a lighter weight, smaller camera and lens to take to places where a lot of walking is concerned. I have looked at the Oly EM1 that will fit my lens with adapter but I am afraid it would still be heavy. I do not want to get rid of the E5, just supplement in certain situations.
I have owned a Fuji film before that was on the lower end of cameras and loved the pictures it produced even at 8 megapixels. I am looking at a Fuji.
Are there any other suggestions that you might be familiar with that gives good results and is smaller and more compact with interchangeable lens?
I shoot mainly people, some macro, wildlife and children's sports.
Thanks in advance for suggestions of camera suggestions to research.
Thanks, StelleI can comment thus: My personal interest in Benedict as a favorite is quite longstanding, but even my own fond feeling for it grew perceptibly when Cardinal Ratzinger became Pope (I am Catholic). In short, while I always liked it a lot, now I like it even more because of him. I have heard considerable chatter amongst American Catholics (and the smaller subgroup, American Catholic namenerds) to that effect as well. However, I am also a Labor and Delivery nurse in a fairly heavily Catholic part of Texas, and I have yet to see its actual use on newborns, despite increased discussion about its merits. That may yet come. His papacy is young, if he is not.

– Oprah Winfrey
After a truly incredible 25 years in the business Oprah Winfrey has said that’s enough. The now 57 year old black and in control role model has had one of the most well-known and powerful careers of all time. Starting out at just 17 years of age Oprah was always destined to exceed greatness, with major success in her day time talk show ‘The Oprah Winfrey Show’ the inspirational women has used her success, money and power to make this world a better place.
Oprah career began when hired at the local TV station and successfully became Nashfields very first black female news anchor. After a short period of time it was noticed Winfrey became too emotionally involved with her stories but was too good of a reporter to leave. Their Oprah went on to co-host the WJZ’s local talk show, soon after the young and rising star moved herself to Chicago took over the low rated WLS-TV’s and legendarily renamed it “The Oprah Winfrey Show” the network now worth 2.7 Billion. Oprah talk show has been watched by millions and broadcasted nationally since 1986, with such success and achievement Oprah’s debates on controversial topics, and own personal experiences shared on air such as weight loss, weight gain and her awful upbringing. Women have found it extremely easy to relate and use the strong independent black women not only as a role model but a hero too.
Not only has Oprah had one of the most famous careers in history, she has dedicated time, money and support to a mass amount of charities. Oprah has used her show to feature people who were the victims of poverty or unfortunate accidents to demonstrate her good deeds and values to the world. Oprah, simply being Oprah has set up three main charities including the ‘Oprah Angle Network’ ( supported by viewers) ‘The Oprah Winfrey Foundation’ (supported purely by herself) and ‘The Oprah Winfrey Operating Foundation’ ( set up for the leadership award in south Africa). The charities have managed to help millions of lives all over the world. Oprah has extended her arms far and wide in helping people purely for the benefits for others.
Oprah is motivated by her past of being abused and mistreated, Oprah growing up in what you and I would call a ‘no hope part of the world’. Her motivation came from not wanting to be like everyone else that grew up there, wanting a future and to better herself and the others around her. Oprah is currently 14th of the ‘Forbes’ most powerful women and 64th powerful person, all which is just unbelievable and an outstanding achievement to the dedicated women.
Overall Miss Oprah Gail Winfrey is a truly remarkable woman that not only uses her power for good but to assist and benefit many astounding people. Her money and motivation and generosity has made her the currently ‘Forbes’ 2nd most famous celebrity. This woman is unbelievably powerful among ladies all over the world she is simply an inspiration to all women no matter what size or raise. Oprah obviously fits perfectly into the categories of THE GOOD.

Why Buy a Fashionable Walking Cane
- To add style and show the world you are who you are!
- To accessorize your everyday or work wardrobe.
- For a special occasion like a wedding, graduation, black tie event.
- To add to or start a cane collection.
Fashionable Wooden Walking Canes
Our wide selections of fashionable wooden walking canes are made in Canada, the US, England, Germany, Italy, France and China. We have chosen to represent canes from very basic to colourful laminated ones as well as natural to hand carved walking canes. Our goal is to help everyone find a fashionable cane to match both their need and their personality.
Derby Fritz Patterned Laminated Western
Exotic Woods and Hand Carved Canes
Walking with a cane for a few months is very different from walking with a cane for years. Once a cane becomes a part of everyday life, purchasing one becomes more personal. A wooden cane made from chestnut or maple is very common but finding one made from an exotic wood or that is personalized with a special carving adds to the appeal. We have many woods available to us to make walking canes from like amaranth, cocobolo, rosewood, bocote, paduk, bloodwood, cherry wood and ebony. Our hand carved wooden canes are usually made from Rocky Mountain Juniper but can also be made from Black Walnut and Mahogany.

Amaranth Ebony Hand carved
Metal Handle Canes
We offer an assortment of cane handle styles made from brass with some chrome plated (plated on metal or hard plastic) as well as ones made from Sterling Silver, German Silver or Alpacca and 14K Gold. Most people like to use a metal handle cane when dressing up. There is nothing like an elegant cane to complete our attire or to give us the sense of pride that makes us look as good as we feel.
Often times, a metal handle is preferred for a formal cane being used occasionally rather than an everyday cane. One reason for this, especially in winter, is because metal handles become cold which can be hard on our hands especially an arthritic hand. Many over come this by using gloves or buying our Chrome Derby which is plated on hard plastic. It really doesn't matter whether this style of cane is being used as a formal cane or as an everyday cane, the cane becomes the accessory that brings completion to your personal look.
Alpacca Sterling Silver Chrome Plated Brass
Using a fancy handle cane is one way to show personal style. CanesCanada.com offers a variety of fancy handle canes which are made from high impact plastic. These Italian made handles come in multiple colours. The derby, crook and square handles as well as the other handle styles in this line come in three colour styles - simulate horn, white ivory and shell. The eagle and fish cane lines are found in the colour option seen below but the duck head cane comes in five colour choices.
Derby Crook Square Eagle Fish Duck
We also carry a collection of simulated antique scrimshaw cane handles which are made of polymer resin. Ivory, in itself, is a very elegant and exotic. For good reason, it is no longer something that is legal to sell without a license. Our simulated handles help to bring a touch of the past into the present. Being made from a softer material than our other fancy handles, the simulated scrimshaw can nick more easily so they are recommended to be used as an occasional cane or for collecting.
Bird of Prey Acorn Fritz Rabbit Fox
Altogether we have four lines of fancy handle canes available to us. Not all of the handle styles are represented on our web site so if you are looking for a particular cane let us know.

Each of our suppliers brings their own creativity, style and craftsmanship that we are proud to offer to you. We invite you to look through our web site found at. Our quality products are designed for those looking for more than just a cane.

My favorite time of the year has finally arrived…muthereffing college football season! Aside from all the games, cheerleaders, tailgating (beers, burgers & brats), what comes next? The mascots of course. Capital One has put together an All-America Mascot Team that will compete throughout the 2010 college football season with one lucky mascot (and school) getting the title of “Capital One National Mascot of the Year”.
Here is your
The cool thing about this contest is win or lose, each school will at least receive $5,000 and the winner will get a nice $15,000 (which goes towards their mascot fund apparently). Even the United Coalition of College Mascots is behind this badboy.
Every week you can vote at CapitalOneBowl.com page (as we have) but also to go vote for your favorite soon and often (I know who I want to win but I’m not going to mention it as I want to keep it unbiased).
One more thing to note is that Extraordinary Mommy is looking for female bloggers to write about why they think their mascot is the best. So if you’ve got boobies…and you want to taut why you think a particular mascot is deserving more than others, head over to ExtraorindaryMommy.com to tell them what you think.
Now I’m off to the supermarket to pick up some PBRs, Dorito’s Cool Ranch, a crap ton of ground beef, cheese, buns, a pack or two of Ho-Hos, paper towels, plastic plates and a huge thing of TP. Because come Saturday my ass will be sitting on the couch for at least a good 12 hours. It would however be much more fun to be throwing down like these boys at a tailgate party…that’s next weekend though.‘RG3’ paints a vivid portrait of a young legend
RG3: The Promise
By Dave Sheinin. Blue Rider. 354 pp. $27.95. ISBN 978-0399165450
“The man of God placed his hand on the boy’s head and suddenly felt something – a surge, an energy. It could only have been the holy spirit. . . . Bishop Holcomb pulled him aside and told him what the prophecy meant: that young Robert was now bound by the responsibility that came with it.”
A few weeks ago I was talking to a friend of mine, recently retired NFL linebacker Scott Fujita, about the contrast between the actual NFL – the one that he and I and thousands of others have experienced – and the way the story of the NFL is told. What would the fans see, we wondered, if they watched the game with no commentators? With no sportswriters? Without being told what it all means?
This hypothetical is fun to discuss, but it dies immediately. The popularity of football is largely due to the men and women who tell us about it. In RG3, Dave Sheinin’s biography of the Washington Redskins’ second-year quarterback, we are told what others have dared to say about Robert Griffin III over the years, and it’s enough to stir the heavens.
RG3 begins in the final moments of Griffin’s record-breaking 2012 season, when his knee gave out on the beaten sod of FedEx Field in a playoff game against Seattle. Sheinin, a sportswriter for the Washington Post, describes the play as “the last moment when everything was still uncomplicated, when the story of Robert Griffin III was still a legend – growing richer and deeper by the week, by the day, and here, as he hobbled valiantly on a wounded leg toward the line of scrimmage, by the second.”
Whether Griffin’s hobbling was valiant or foolish is a matter of dispute; after all, he was wearing a bulky brace to protect a knee injured during those uncomplicated times. But Sheinin’s breathless prose sets the tone for a heroic narrative. RG3 bounces between vivid transcriptions of Griffin’s rookie year in D.C. and the athletic childhood that led him there: his upbringing as the son of two Army sergeants; the six months he spent in New Orleans’s Iberville housing projects that made him street tough; his glory days as a high school athlete in Texas, pulling SUV tires up inclined streets; his difficult decision to turn away from his first love, basketball, and his budding love, track, to focus on the more glorious game of football.
Then comes Baylor, where Griffin served as de facto ambassador between the student body and the city of Waco and raked in an estimated $250 million for the school in “extra donations, increased ticket sales, licensing fees, sponsorship deals (and) an unexpected deal with Fox Sports Southwest,” all stemming from his Heisman Award-winning 2011 season. And, finally, the NFL draft, in which the Redskins traded a fortune in draft picks to take him at No. 2.
Once in the NFL, Griffin’s rare combination of talents — world-class runner and accurate gunslinger – caused such a stir that, Sheinin posits, “someday historians may look back at the Redskins second play from scrimmage in their win over the Saints and pinpoint it as the moment offensive football changed forever in the NFL.” Between only two covers, Sheinin portrays Griffin as, variously, Black Jesus (a nickname Sheinin overheard in the locker room), post-racial, presidential and transcendent. Chapter titles include “The Perfect Quarterback,” “The Child Prodigy,” “The Savior Arrives,” “The Leader of Men,” “The Superstar Ascendant,” “The QB Revolution” and “The Race Question.” Sheinin seems to believe that Griffin can unite the racially divided Chocolate City, change the racially offensive Redskins team name and help President Obama push his political agenda.
But this mountain of superlatives helps explain the vertiginous momentum building around Griffin that, as the brutal season wore on, reached a breaking point. Beneath the superhuman praise stirred the fragility of Griffin’s human body. With three weeks left in the regular season, he sustained a knee injury that threatened to undermine the messianic fable, but all parties played it down, knowing that it would make the climax that much sweeter if he could overcome it. Griffin played his part and limped through the last month, somehow leading his team on a seven-game win streak.
His success validated every tough-guy football bromide: Real men push through the pain. Had he taken himself out, he would have been ridiculed. He knew that, so it wasn’t an option. That’s how NFL players think: I am a warrior, and this is my war. Forge ahead until I’m dead. So he pushed and pushed, and when it mattered most, his knee collapsed. The next day, everyone in the industry jumped into their chairs to point the big finger. He was obviously injured! Why was he playing? Who is to blame? Who is responsible? No one in particular, Sheinin accurately points out. The waters are muddy. Everyone is complicit, all the time.
Sheinin lays out the conflicts of interest and the high stakes that preclude a level-headed approach to injury management in the NFL: The coaches under pressure to succeed at all costs. The players who are dealing with injuries of their own and who don’t respond well to teammates who can’t handle the pain. The fans and their lofty expectations. The former players turned analysts who crucify perceived indiscretions. The teams’ confounded medical professionals, sworn to protect the health of their patients but unable to separate their professional opinions from the adrenaline-fueled NFL sideline, where the moment feels so important. And finally, Griffin’s relationship with his concerned family members and the lifelong struggles they, particularly his mother, have had with the inherent violence of his chosen path.
All of this is done tactfully by Sheinin, who paints a vivid portrait of Griffin – by all accounts a thoughtful, intelligent young man – and the strange world of superstardom that has engulfed him. But he stops just short of closing the circle, failing to turn the pen on himself and question the source of or reasons for such lofty praise. Griffin is just 23 years old, and now he has a 300-page book about his first season as a pro, jam-packed with every city-saving-superhero-athlete cliche that’s ever been uttered, along with a few new ones.
Sheinin delivers them all with a straight face and rarely shows us the other side. Like so many others in the stands and in the press box, he is holding out hope that there is no other side, that the fairy tale will come true in the end. Maybe RG3 is Black Jesus. But like every other player in the NFL, he is only human, a revelation that many seem reluctant to accept.

How long has "speed reading" been around?
It seems that I can remember it way back when I was just knee high to a toad stool.
The idea of it never struck me right. Getting through a book in record time held little appeal for my reading appetite. I prefer to digest each carefully chosen word written by an author.
The good ones paint a picture with words... like John Steinbeck or, just recently my new favorite, Bernadette Pajer.
It would be a sin to "speed read" one of their books.
What brought this to mind was listening to some television program hostess' "speed talking."
Call me sexist if you will but it seems to be mostly the women who are afflicted with the need to spit words out as rapidly as an AK-47 submachine gun spits out bullets.
And, to me, they all look the same. All of them seem to be bleached blondes with identical hairdos and always parted in the middle revealing the dark roots.
I wouldn't mind as they are mostly handsome wenches and properly proportioned but my problem is that they are talking 85 miles an hour while I'm only capable of listening at 40 mph.
I can't help but wonder why the director of these various productions doesn't hold up a prompter that says, "Slow Down" or holler that in their hidden earphones.
I suppose it could be that the script that they have been provided is too long for the allowed minutes. Either way something is wrong causing it to be difficult for viewers/listeners.
And speaking of television on a slightly different subject, I have been watching, somewhat regularly, the Military Channel because many of the presentations are steeped in history.
However, a certain short presentation about how fantastic a certain modern jet airplane is disappoints a little.
The voiceover, posing as a military person, is explaining that our troops on the ground love the plane's strike capabilities while the enemy doesn't. He goes on to say something to the effect that the arrival of that aircraft is seen as if "the calvary has arrived."
I can almost understand the old western movies when the cavalry is referred to as the calvary because many of the actors, deprived of a script, weren't the brightest people on our planet... but a present day military man calling it that is unforgivable.
Maybe some of these folks should be referred to their pastor or priest to learn about calvary.
I guess I'm getting' old. I find it hard to abide "speed talking" and morons referring to the cavalry as the calvary.

Hi hywd53,
Are you able to take tylenol? If so, there are many meds in the opiate/opioid family that can work wonders for Arthritis. Many of these meds contain tylenol though, but they are available in generic form.
Please stay with us and you will recieve some great advice from other members that know much more than I about Arthritis meds, OK?
Best wishes,
21 Oct 2011
I guess I really don't know too much, if you can't take any of the NSAIDs at all. What about good ole' Aspirin? I take them from time to time. Way back before Tylenol existed, everyone took Aspirin for all kinds of things, and pain was one of the #1 things.
There is also something called the Lidoderm patch. You place it where the pain is and it works directly on the pain. It doesn't go through your stomach or bloodstream like other meds do at all. I use them mostly for lower back pain, but I have placed them else where, and they have worked. You can cut them in whatever shape or size necessary to get them where you need them. They are fairly big, about 4 x 5 inches. You wear them for 12 hours and leave them off for 12 hours. I have forgotten and left them on up to 20 hours and nothing terrible happened, but you should remove them after 12 hours. Since you have a problem with NSAIDs, I say try them. The only other thing I know of are all real steroids, and I wouldn't want to be taking them.
Good luck and best wishes. I hope the Lidoderm patches can help you too.

During a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk on August 30, NASA astronaut Sunita Williams finishes the installation of a new switching unit on the International Space Station. The original unit experienced setbacks last week when misaligned parts restricted its movement. (See more space station pictures.)
Astronauts also installed a camera on the space station's arm. After helping to construct the orbiter, so-called Canadarm2 is now being used to capture unpiloted spacecraft in orbit.

Captured by the La Silla Observatory in Chile, the Pencil Nebula (NGC 2736) shows what's left of a supernova explosion that astronomers believe occurred nearly 11,000 years ago.
A supernova occurs when an aging star essentially collapses on itself, releasing its gravitational energy in one major explosion, leaving remnants of gas and debris in its wake for thousands of years.

On September 9, its 34th day on Martian soil, NASA’s Curiosity rover took this underside portrait—actually a composite of nine photos—as part of a diagnostic exam. Curiosity's hazard-avoidance cameras can be seen, appearing as four "eyes" midway up the rover's front side. In the distance is a portion of Mount Sharp, which the rover will study as it travels on the red planet.
NASA engineers designed Curiosity with high-definition cameras that can snap photos from as close as 0.8 inch (2.1 centimeters), precisely to allow the rover to take diagnostic self-portraits.

NASA's Curiosity rover completed a full self exam on its 32nd day on the Martian planet this week. Scientists wanted to inspect the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager (pictured), among other components, to gauge the amount of dust that had accumulated on its cover.
At 24 hours and 37 minutes, a Martian day is slightly longer than a day on Earth, posing challenges to mission engineers on Earth, who keep the same schedule to maximize efficiency when the rover is in daylight.

Go Montana!
A few days ago someone posted the average Montana household has eight guns.
The Second Amendment along with the rest of the Bill of Rights, was a necessary precondition for the ratification of the Constitution in the first place, so it’s plausible that abrogation of an individual right to arms would void the Constitution entirely, not just for Montana.
Give em hell Montana
When guns are outlawed
We haven’t seen anything yet. If Obama or Clinton get in, look out. And our side has the guns.
I think the South and the Southwest will follow Montana’s lead on this.
Oh really? You think McCain has no plans to increase gun restrictions? You think our CURRENT prez wouldn’t sign new gun laws into place?
Think again.
Right.
If the court rules against us you will be amazed at how fast the RATs and LIBs moves take you’re property (guns) without due compensation. Bet on it!!!
Alabama Constitution states in:
Sec. 26 That every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself
and the state.
I believe it. But I’d bet a dollar that at least 75% of those firearms are, for all practical purposes, useless to a militia.
muzzle loaders, antiques, novelties, rimfire rifles and pistols, small guage shotguns, oddball calibers, etc.
This might be worth keeping in mind.
Now if we can just get one of the southern coastal states to go on record in the same way...
Cool... I just saw your post after I posted.
Good. We may need them soon.
Well you'd be wrong. The average Montanan doesn't have the income to collect eclectic odd firearms. They own rifles, shotguns and large caliber handguns -- and they use them.
I lived their for four years, and really miss that state.
Need I remind you that even an oddball caliber round, if placed in the appropriate place, can change the world?
Or do you think that the 6.5x52mm Carcano was a “mainstream round?”
I just bought a new bushmaster assault rifle because I really think they will be outlawed again within the next 2 years. I’d like to buy something in 308 caliber too. But I can’t decide what I want...AR10, HK/CETME, or the new FN SCAR heavy.
Ecclectic odd firearms are acquired from dead relatives. I have plenty of them, and not one of them have I paid for. They all came from dead ancestors.
Well, I take that back, I have one old bolt action rifle in 8mm mauser that I bought. THere are lots of people out there buying old surplus rifles for cheap. And there are lots of people out there that inherited old 303 british rifles from their grandfather, who got it for about fifteen bucks after world war 2.
A 303 british is just about useless. Where are you going to get reliable ammo?
Could.....
tons of it at wally world, Sports Academy, most any gun store. 10 shot bolt action that will drop a bear is not to be taken lightly.

I'm at the George Allen this very moment, where attorneys representing New England Sports Ventures and Kop Holdings (which is to say, Tom Hicks) are squaring off over who owns Liverpool FC. In light of the UK judge's ruling this morning, which basically tossed yesterday's temporary restraining order, the attorneys (and assorted media) have gathered to see what the judge will decide, since Hicks owes the Royal Bank of Scotland close to $500 million dollars by tomorrow.!— Measurement Tag For Dictionary.com – > <!— Audience Tag for IAC Network – >

A daughter of a former business partner of the real Wolf of Wall Street has penned an open letter to L.A. Weekly to alert movie-goers of the part of Jordan Belfort‘s story Martin Scorsese chose not to include in his film: the effect his crimes had on the families of the investors involved.
The girl’s name is Christina McDowell, and she was just a freshman in college when she attended the trial of her father, Tom Prousalis.
Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is described as the government’s “star witness” to testify against Prousalis. Belfort had just pleaded guilty to money-laundering and securities fraud, and would go on to avoid years of jail time by ratting on a whole slew of criminals similar to himself.
As McDowell writes, Prousalis and Belfort “were in cahoots together with a list of ‘seemingly innocuous, legitimate companies’ that did not actually exist yet were all taken public to con unsuspecting investors and make the pair along with many others at Stratton Oakmont Inc. millions of dollars richer.”
The letter then takes an ugly turn as McDowell describes the day her father went to prison.
She recalls her mother locking herself in the bathroom and throwing up, not only because her husband was going under but because he had taken the family down with him.
Prousalis laundered money in his daughter’s name and hid what was left of the family’s assets in a Wells Fargo account.
McDowell, just 18, was receiving multiple phone calls from creditors and investors threatening to sue her. Her father had also left her her nearly $100,000 worth of debt.
The family was left almost penniless after the entire Wells Fargo account was liquidated. Her younger sister ran away at 17, and McDowell lived on other people’s couches and out of her car for roughly two years.
Starving and ashamed, McDowell barely survived on tips from her restaurant job. She even had to change her name because her father technically stole her identity by setting up the aforementioned account.
“It’s a pretty confusing experience to go from flying private with Dad to an evening where he’s begging you for a piece of your paycheck so he can buy food for dinner,” she writes.
The worst part, McDowell says, is that she still believed her father was innocent and that the government and Belfort were the bad guys.
).”
McDowell then lays into the director and actors of “The Wolf of Wall Street” for painting such a positive picture of Stratton Oakmont and leaving out what these people and their co-conspirators did to their families and clients.
She calls Martin Scorsese “dangerous” for making movie-goers believe that Jordan Belfort was not an evil human being, and that his schemes are entertaining rather than the real-life tragedies.
“Come on, we know the truth,” she says. “This kind of behavior brought America to its knees.”
McDowell labels lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio a disgusting hypocrite for claiming to be a model humanitarian who then glorifies Belfort’s crimes as well as the film’s frequent misogyny.
“Did you think about the cultural message you’d be sending when you decided to make this film?” she asks.
“You have successfully aligned yourself with an accomplished criminal, a guy who still hasn’t made full restitution to his victims, exacerbating our national obsession with wealth and status and glorifying greed and psychopathic behavior.”
McDowell sees Belfort’s true face because she was exposed to the same luxuries and privileges he was. She drove a Range Rover in high school, “snorted half of Colombia,” and got every guy she wanted because her father would regularly take them for rides in his private planes.
But then she discovered who her father really was: a cruel, soulless money addict obsessed with wealth and fame. Scorsese’s film makes Belfort look like a good person underneath, but McDowell is positive that like her father, he’s less of a man than the homeless guy they pass on the street every day.
Some of McDowell’s father’s victims lost everything. They cannot afford to send their kids to college, pay their medical bills, and will struggle to pay off their debts until they are dead.
“Let me ask you guys something,” McDowell writes as her letter comes to a close.
?”
McDowell ends by urging us not to support “The Wolf of Wall Street” because it only provokes people like Belfort to go even farther with their crimes. The film lacks the reality of their wrongdoings, she says, and every time we celebrate Scorsese’s film, the more wolves we help create.

This lovely hop was the brain child of Madame Samm and Soma, creators of the lovely paper piecing pattern. I must admit that I struggle with paper piecing. For some reason I can never get the fabric size right and I end up un-sewing way too often.
So on to my adventure! First up is the heart. My DgD loves loves pink, purple and hearts. I did not think she would understand the arrow so I adapted the heart to stand alone. Woot woot so far so good. I used it to make a sweet apron from the tutorial offered by Amanda.
Then I started work on the O (is that a hug or a kiss?). Humm something seems to be amiss.....
Yikes. how could I not have seen this?????? I was running out of fabric as I am trying to work from my stash. For some reason I thought I had a lot more of these two fabrics than I did. So some fancy un-sewing, ripping and cutting ensued.
And then the X
I seem to have odd luck every time I sign up for one of these hops. Just when I was going for a re-do I broke my elbow. Yup painful and limiting. Surgery in a couple of days.
So this will be it this time around for me. Enjoy the other hoppers!

So sorry about your elbow. I worked from my stash for this hop as well and was on a limited amount. Your projects turned out wonderful.
It's original and cute, great fabric choices, I really hope your elbow recovers soon, I can't even imagine how painful that be, but having knocked a few elbows in my lifetime, I know how disorienting it must seem.
What a cute tea apron for your granddaughter. Wishing you fast healing and little pain after surgery.
Beautiful apron, she must be very pride! And very nice quilting on your topper, I like it!
What a fun apron!!! Good luck with your surgery!
Great quilting -great project to practice on.
Love the fun apron. So sorry to hear about your injury. Here's hoping for a speedy recovery for you.
I think your projects are great. Good luck with your surgery...ouch!
Goodness, a broken elbow and surgery. Yikes! Love your little mat, pretty and practical. Nice FMQ, and DgD is just adorable in her little apron. Looks like she was having a grand ole time in the photo...so I would not call this unsuccessful! Good luck with your surgery and wishes for a speedy recovery!
OUCH! I'm sorry about your elbow, that sounds very painful. Your apron is darling, as is your DGD.
Your projects are great. So sorry about your elbow, I hope that you will soon recover from it.
Love the hot pink! Hope you're healing some by now!
Nana, it is something we all have struggled with at one time or another, the positive outcome is you did it…and it looks just fine….much heart was poured into it...
Thank you, thank you, thank you, for showin us all of your little trip ups! I cannot tell you how many times the same type of thing has happened to me! But I really want to know...how does one break an elbow? When you are all well, I hope you will share the story. sewingblogsarefun@yahoo.com
Nothing is a fail when you can put a smile on a childs face and you did just that with the apron!
Your free motion project is great too. Don't beat yourself up so much.
An apron is a wonderful way to use one of these patterns. I know she loved it - the smile on her face says it all. I'm so sorry to hear about your elbow. I have lifted you up in prayer this morning asking God for wisdom for your doctors and caretakers and peace for you. blessings, marlene
YEEEow! I hope your surgery goes well. I think your apron is a great success and the idea of practicing machine quilting on a mistake is a great idea! Maybe the OTHER side is to be the front! I will be thinking of you over the next few days and sending good thoughts to your recovery.
What a wonderful picture of the apron and beautiful model. She looks so happy with it. Great job. I kinda like that runner and your FMQ is going quite well. I'll say a prayer for the recovery on what sounds like a very painful injury.
The apron is darling, and worn by a cute model.
The apron is just as adorable as the little SWEETHEART wearing it. And the failed tablerunner isn't a fail at all in my HEART. I would use it on my table anytime. Great practice with the FMQ too. Glad you stuck with it and finished! Prayers for a speedy recovery on the elbow!
Very sweet, Your DGD looks like she is having so much fun in her tea party apron. Now that you have your pretty table runner complete, I am sure she would love to add it to her table ... I know I would ... XOs from me to you ... <3 Pat
Bless your heart ! I hope you have a speedy recovery from your surgery. I have trouble with the fabric size too, I think mine is because I try to save fabric and then skimp a bit too much. The FMQ looks great !
It is finished! Low the apron
How pretty! I do hope all goes well with your surgery and you will be back at the sewing machine very soon!
So sorry about your elbow. Great fmq practice
Cute apron. Best of luck with your surgery, and hope you heal quickly.
Paper piecing can be a challenge, that's for sure! Your apron is adorable! Oh my, a broken elbow sounds horrible...good luck and wishes to you for a quick recovery.
Ouch, a broken elbow sounds very painful. Very cute apron, though. Thanks for sharing your successes and fails. If everything went right every time, we would never learn, I suppose.
Hope you heal quickly!
The apron is fabulous!
I wouldn't call it a fail at all! That's a cute little valentine table piece. If that raw edge bothers you, it could be the perfect place for a heart applique, a bit of fat rick rack, or some other embellishment. Love what you did, and the apron is adorable, as is the model.
Love the apron! It's perfect for the holiday! Never a fail... just consider it a design element! What better way to practice free motion, and have a wonderful little runner too!
nice projects. hope your surgery goes well.
They look real good yo me! I am sorry to hear about your elbow. I hope it heals quickly for you.
Broke your elbow? Ouch! My daughter did that in 6th grade, here's hoping you heal right back to 100% just like she did! Beth @ Words & Stiches, pbstrand@msn.com
What a cute piece! I hope your surgery goes really well and you get back to quilting soon!
Love your sweet apron for your little sweetie pie! Such a big smile!
Paper piecing is so fickle... but you made a pretty little runner from your blocks. It will make you smile when you look at it!
Hope your elbow heals quickly.
Susie
Sewing/quilting is always a learning experience and isn't that wonderful? I find it encouraging to see that someone else has problems and that I'm not the only one! Sure sorry to hear about the elbow; now that is just plain bad luck!
Sorry to hear about your elbow, but great job on practicing you FMQ, I need to do some of that.
I hope your elbow feels better today. That is a painful injury. Thanks for sharing your project.
The apron is absolutely sew sweet. Good gift for a pretty young lady.
The apron looks so lovely and I think your mat looks pretty good! I wish you a very speedy recovery!
Thank you so much for joining the blog hop!
-Soma
The apron is adorable and it looks like your granddaughter loves it and that's all that counts. Best wishes for a speedy recovery from your surgery.
Your apron turned out beautifully! I pray you recover quickly from the surgery. A broken elbow does not sound fun.
Love the apron, no such thing as a fail if it was fun! :) Sorry about your elbow -- best wishes.
What an adorable model wearing an adorable apron. It is not easy thinking upside down, sideways and in reverse when foundation piecing but it gets easier. I hope all goes well with the surgery and recovery. We can't have a quilter away from her sewing too long!
Good luck with your elbow surgery. Thank you sew very much for Hopping and sharing your true PP adventures...
Lovely work! I do know about the struggles with PP!! LOL
Nothing is EVER a fail..this was very lovely!!!!!
The apron is very cute! I admire your X and O work and the FMQ with it. It wasn't a "fail" when you got to practice something! Take care of that elbow and thanks for sharing!
It' s all a learning experience. Paper piecing gets easier with practice. Besides, I'm sure your grandchild love the apron.
In quilting nothing is a failure but a learning experience and we will find a purpose for everything. I love the apron it is really sweet.
Your mat is cute and your free motion quilting looks great!

veteran Vlncentlan who do livered the principal address of the dayMr Walsh thanked the members of St Augustines Conference for the honor they had shown him In asking him to address them and then explained that people of all classes of all creeds of all nations and In every era had applauded charity even though they failed to practice it The alms and objects of the St Vincent de Paul Society he said were praise worthy because they were pure and unselfish Then he spoke In part as follows St Paul says that Char ity covers a multitude of sins and again he tells us If we speak In the tongues of men and angels and have not charity we are as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals and are noth ing And In St Matthew Chapter 25 we read Then shall the King say to them that shall be on his right hand Come ye blessed of my Father possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world For 1 to drink And when did we see thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and covered thee Or when did we see thee sick or In prison and came to thee And tho King answering shall say to them Amen I say to you as long as you did to one of these my east brethren you did ft to sue This being true we can show how praiseworthy and commendable are all the alms and purposes of this Society of St Vincent de Paul They are all purely charitable and un selfish Week after week the faith ful members go about in the commu nities In which they live seeking those upon whom the hand of afflic tion rests heavily When they find them they do not proceed to Impress their mission or importance upon them nor do they lecture them on account of their frallltles and faults Instead they extend the warm hand of genuine sympathy and proceed at once to relieve them of their Imme diate wants and to console them In their trials My friends YIP all know that In the economy of Providence for I rsY- R reasons best known to its Inscrutable ways all men are not born equal either in temporal or spiritual gifts and blessings It Is therefore or dained by heaven thatthe fortunate should help the unfortunate that the strong should help the weak that the rich should come to the aid of the poor and that those whose lines are cast in plehsant places should help those whose pathways are rough and harp and whose days are dark and drear kHere citizen of the land can perform work as meritorious In the sight of heaven as the hero of a hundred battle fields who plunges through tho smoke of booming cannon and plants his countrys flag upon the ramparts of the enemys citadel Here it is that every one can find plenty 6f good work to do because as Christ said The poor we have always with us No other work in the world shall be better rewarded than work done for the pooriAnd my friends letsme tell you that charity is needed among men in more senses than one and in n higher sense than mere almsgiving We need it in a pleasant smile and word of good cheer that should be given as we pass eachother In our daily intercourse We should strive to make smiles shine like rainbows through the tears of grief and turn the trailing nlsts of sdVrow Into gold We could make this old world of ours much better brighter and grander than it is and this is exactly what the St Vincent de Paul Society Is trying to do It wants us to make our own lives a success by con tributing what we can to the success of others It teaches that this is the best way In the world to prevent our own lives from being failures for no mans life is a failure who has spent It in making others happy- If we devote our lives to the cutlvatlon of that splendid spirit of charity which this society seeks to establish In the world then I warrant you that our lloves will be ai glorious success If we do this then when our little span of life draws to a close and our day Is well nigh spent and we find ourselves face to face with the dread issues of eternity we shall derive more consolation comfort and hope from the memory of the good works we iperformed In this society than from ill the empty works we have performed for mere temporalends Wo shall derive more consolation from the memory of the good we did in this society than from all the wealth we may have gathered or all the honors and applause we may have won In sounding all tho shoals and depths of fortune And when at last the hOU our departure comes we shall sink

Liberty Took Advantage of British Security and Blbnlons Hessians A NOTED DEED OF DARING Americas most historic Christmas is now 131 years old It might be termed the anniversary of the birth of the Nation as well as the birth of PATRICK T SULLIVAN Elected President of Division 3 A O II tthe Saviour Were It not for tho fact that Washington crossed the Delaware on Christmas day in 1776 and captured Trenton this might never have been an independent na tl6n we might still be under the tyranny of England WashingtonsLonrIslandJerseysCornwallispursuitWashingtonDecember 2 and prepared to cross to Pennsylvania The American commander collected all the boats he could find and on December 7 led his forces to the Pennsylvania side of the river The boats lie was unable to hide were burned sp that when Cornwallis reached Trenton he was without means to follow the American army The British General determined thereupon to wait until the Delaware river froze and settled Ills army down to camp Mild weather prevailed for a fortnight and thus aided the Continental commander in garrisoning Pennsyl vania forts and disposing of his little advantageItto cross the river and hurry on to Philadelphia to capture the Capital of the American patriots and iby the way the fall of that city seemed so imminent that the Continental patriots in Congress retired to Baltimore Cornwallis was so sure that he went to New York and intended to sail for England on the first out going vessel t The term for which many of Washingtons men had enlisted would expire within ten days many discouraged patriots were goingover to the enemy and the American command felt that it was time to strike a decisive blow or else the cause would be lost Isis little army was encamped at Newton Pa The British garrison at Trenton under Col Roll consisted of 1500 Hessians and several troops of British light horse Washington knew that the Hessians would indulge in liberal potations in celebration of Christmas and proposed to give them a surprise IlehadartilleryChristmas the weather grew much colder and a blizzard of sleet and snow while it hampered the movements of the American patriots served to screen them from the enemy on the eastern bank of the river The blizzard continued through Christmas day and night The boats previously hidden on the Pennsylvania bank of the Delaware river were collected and the Con tinentals began to embark about dusk The river Ivas full of floating- Ice but the boats were guided by expert New England boatmen under command of Col Glover It was close to midnight when Gen Washington and the last of his officers set out for tIle opposite bank but owing to nforseen difficulties it was 3 oclock in the morning before all of the American army was safely landed The illustrious Washington divided his army Into two forces one to i march down the river road and at tack the city from the vest the other to enter Trenton from the north He made his officers set their watches by his so that the attack be made simultaneously at all points It was 8 oclock when tho enemys outposts were encountered and driven in firing from behind trees and fences as they ran Col Rail who had been left in charge by Cornwallis had been up all night carousing and playing i cards Before he could buckle on his swore and rally his demoralized forces the British light horse and 500 Hessians had taken flight Col Knox who had charge of Washing n tons artillery planted his cannon to sweep the principal streets and the completeCoJbut before he tiled he surrendered his sword to Gen Washington The Americans took over 1000 prisoners and captured many cannons and hundreds of stands of arms Corn wallis delayed his trip to England and five days later surrendered to Washington at

Our forfoears who crossed the Atlantic prior to 1851 would not realizd that they were taking the same trip were they to cross it now in these days of steam turbines I Many of our leading IrishAmerican and German American men and women came over in the 30s 40s and 50s in sailing vessels and were from five to eleven weeks in making the journey- In 1851 the steamships began to make regular trips and the world was startled when the Asia reduced tho time from Queenstown to Sandy Hook to ten days and two tours In the same year the Baltic brought the trip down to nine days and thirteen hours Year by year new and im proved steamers were built and greater speed was attained so that in 18GG it was considered remarkable when the Scotia crossed in eight days and two hours In 1873 the time had been cut to seven days and twenty hours In 1882 the Alaska made it in six days and eighteen hours and ten years later the City of Paris crossed in five days four teen hours and twentyfour minutes Still the cry went up for increased speed for these ocean greyhounds hnd little by little the time has been cut down until the Lusitania recently clipped all records by crossing in four days and nineteen hours Her sister ship the Mauritania Is ex pected to do even better things The turbine engine is the invention of an Irishman and the Lusitania and Mauritania were built in Belfast shipyards hence trlbltutes to

With SharePoint 2010, Microsoft continues to leverage its Ribbon UI, introduced with Office 2007. The Ribbon is a context-sensitive interface that groups related tasks into a single tab, and it’s one of the key UI changes for SharePoint 2010. The Ribbon is extensible and offers customization opportunities that can help you enhance SharePoint’s usability.
We’d like to introduce you to making Ribbon customizations and offer some lessons learned from a recent project. We’ll cover some fundamentals, then work through some scenarios and examples.
As you read this article, note that Ribbon customizations fall into two basic groups: customizations needed to add a tab and customizations to existing tabs. The first group takes a bit more effort as you need to work with the Page Manager, while customizations in the second group can be accommodated, for the most part, in the Elements.XML, depending on the action.
SharePoint Ribbon Development
As a developer, you can extend the ribbon declaratively using Server ribbon XML and simple script, or you can use ribbon XML and a page component depending on what you need to do and the techniques you want to standardize your development on.
The packaging is no different than that for any other SharePoint 2010 solution. Helpful resources include the SharePoint SDK and Microsoft’s MSDN site for SharePoint development.
To customize the SharePoint 2010 Ribbon, you begin by editing the CustomAction nodes of the Elements.xml file in any SharePoint 2010 Feature. (To learn more about Features, see the Microsoft webpage “Using Features.”)
Basically, you make references to or add new references for what is called CommandUIDefinitions. This is how customizations are mounted within a Feature. Let’s start by examining the basic structure of this node, which you can see in Figure 1.
First, the CustomAction tag must have an ID that’s unique enough so SharePoint can identity it within a whole collection of Custom Actions that are part of your deployment. The value for Location attribute should always be set to CommandUI.Ribbon to tell SharePoint you’re doing Ribbon customizations with this action.
Second, the CommandUIExtension tag contains CommandUIDefinitions child tags to declare all controls or containers which should be created.
The Ribbon supports several controls to help create the user experience for your project. As you will see in our examples, we work with command buttons but you can also use such things as drop-down menus, check boxes, or spinners, as the interfaces and techniques are the same.
Finally, the CommandUIHandlers tag contains the instructions for executing command actions (e.g., Window pop-up, PostBack event on selected list item).
That’s the basics around customization. We’ll drill down into each area and conclude by providing some customization guidance.
Just keep in mind there are other child tags and attributes to support various customizations, but the ones we present are effectively the minimum.
Types of Ribbon Customization
Because there are many ways to customize the Ribbon, this is where you as the developer get to be creative. Let’s look at the following customization scenarios:
- Adding a tab to the Ribbon
- Adding a group as a container of new controls within an existing tab
- Removing a button from the Ribbon
- Replacing a button on the Ribbon
Adding a Tab to the Ribbon
A scenario that developers are quick to use is the addition of a new tab to the Ribbon. Adding a new tab gives you control over the whole experience, as you are starting with a blank slate.
Let’s create a new tab titled “ix Ribbon Page” and add it to the Ribbon so that it’s visible when the user is on a site. The new tab, which Figure 2 shows, includes two groups, “New” and “Test Functions,” and four buttons:
- New Popup: Opens a test page using the SPModal Dialog framework.
- Hello Alert: Pops up a simple JavaScript alert.
- GoodBye PostBack: Uses JavaScript to PostBack to the page for some operation.
- SeeYa Navigate: Uses JavaScript to navigate to another page.
To start creating the new tab, copy the ribbon XML in Figure 3 into the Elements.xml file.
This includes everything needed to design the action so it can be included in a Feature, implemented in the UI, and define what each control does for the user.
After we get beyond the UI of the Tab/Group/Button behavior, we’ll look at the CommandUIHandlers element. We think you’ll find this element equally or perhaps more interesting.
Adding a Group as a Container of Controls within an Existing Tab
Sometimes you’ll need to add a new group and a collection of controls to a tab. To add a group, identify the tab on the Ribbon where the group will appear, then define the controls inside the group to specify how the group renders these controls.
The example in Figure 4 adds a new group, “My Custom Group,” with two buttons, to the out-of-the-box Page tab on a site.
An important thing to note when using groups is to be sure you have a corresponding MaxSize attribute for each group. Without this element, you’ll get XML validation errors when SharePoint tries to render the customization.
For example, you could see the error message “ArgumentException: Ribbon ‘Tab’ node must have a ‘Scaling’ subnode.” The problem might not necessarily just be a Scaling subnode issue. It could be incorrect size attributes or missing associations.
Check your XML structure, as a lot of issues seem to trigger this message.
Removing a Button from the Ribbon
Sometimes a business will want to remove SharePoint functionality for some reason. Removing a button from the Ribbon is one example of a technique you might use to “dim down” the SharePoint experience.
To remove a button, you simply need to define the location of the button you want to remove and wrap this into a HideCustomAction element within the Elements.XML of the Feature. Figure 5 shows XML that removes the Connect to Outlook button from the Library tab in the Actions group for a document library.
The HideCustomAction element is useful for trimming out other functions in SharePoint beyond the Ribbon. For more use cases and specifics, see the Microsoft webpage “Default Custom Action Locations and IDs." This element is a very useful and powerful feature for controlling the entire SharePoint experience and trimming out unnecessary functionality.
Replacing a Button on the Ribbon
Sometimes a business might need to replace existing buttons on the Ribbon rather than replacing or creating a new tab. For example, you might need to direct the user to a custom data entry form when a new item is selected or replace an out-of-the-box button with something else.
The easiest way to implement this is to create a CustomAction element in the Elements.xml file, making a reference to the existing Ribbon and button IDs and replacing that entry with your own.
You will also need to implement a CommandUIHandler that corresponds with the command associated with your button (we’ll get into some options later).
In the example in Figure 6, we replace the Connect to Client Actions button with a simple Replaced button and JavaScript function that pops open an alert. Let’s drill down into key aspects of the implementation.
Custom Action. The Custom Action element in the Elements.xml file is used to create an extension to the UI or, in this case, to customize the SharePoint Ribbon.
Be sure to look at the specification in the Attributes table at Microsoft’s “CustomAction Element” webpage as you will see several attributes that let you control the user experience in many different ways, including more than just in the Ribbon.
The attributes “Rights” and “RequireSiteAdministration” are particularly useful for customizing the UI based on role or permissions set. These provide another dimension of flexibility to support your use cases by providing role and permission information for use in your logic.
For example, you might want to disable, remove, or add certain controls based on rights. We see this requirement occasionally to simplify the user experience or provide targeted features based on permissions and role. The key is to map out these use cases and design your CustomActions accordingly.
CommandUIDefinition. The CommandUIDefinition element defines how the controls will be displayed within your extension. It provides definitions for tabs, groups and controls.
In many of the samples in the SDK, you will notice a “_children” convention such as “<CommandUIDefinition Location=”Ribbon.Tabs._children.” It’s like a convention for making functions available to all aspects of the user context (e.g., List, View, Items Edit).
You can find examples online or in the SDK to help you with your control selection and arrangement. We found that the CMDUI.XML file in the SharePoint 14 Directory was a very helpful resource in terms of understanding arrangements used to make up the out-of-the-box UI.
Fortunately, the SharePoint team made this available as XML to fasttrack our efforts. See Microsoft’s webpage “Default Server Ribbon Customization Locations” to learn more.
CommandUIHandler. This is where the rubber meets the road: The CommandUIHandler attribute lets you specify script for command execution methods such as alerts, PostBacks, and redirects.
You can also include substitution tokens that are transformed at rendering (e.g., \\{ItemId\\}, \\{SiteUrl\\}). To understand more of these options available to you as a developer, see the Microsoft webpage “CommandUIHandler” and its attributes table.
Now, going back to our first example, two of our favorite techniques are shown in the following figures. Figure 7 shows how to use a PostBack command handler. Figure 8 shows how to use the SharePoint UI Modal Dialog framework.
As simple as they are, these two methods are very powerful and can help you expand the whole SharePoint user experience very quickly and with precision. You can include controls in the Ribbon that do more than simple JavaScript popups. You can also hook-in callback methods into the parent page for using the SP.UI.Notify.addNotification in your CommandActions as well.
Lessons Learned
Here are some lessons we learned on a recent project we did that might help in your next Ribbon customization experience. They are as follows:
- When developing Ribbon customizations, be sure to close and open a new browser during your tests to ensure you are running the latest script (or use In-Private Browsing in IE).
- Refer to the CMDUI.XML file in the SharePoint 14 Directory to see how the out-of-the box tabs are configured.
- Use the built-in SharePoint Pop-Up framework to instantiate Custom Application pages that you might need to invoke using the Ribbon for consistent user experience.
- Don’t be afraid to combine numerous actions into a single Elements.xml file for data consolidation or creating larger features.
- Know that Ribbon customizations can be added to Custom Application pages as well as to Web Parts and that there are benefits going either way.
- Try to remove/replace/add controls to existing out-of-the-box tabs if your design supports this model. You’ll incur less overhead in making changes to the Ribbon than from writing new tabs from scratch.
- Be sure to understand all communication methods available for the Ribbon. For example, you can use a PostBack by implementing the IPostBackEventHandler and deserialize the EVENTARGUMENT in code, but it’s no different than doing this with other controls in .NET.
- We’ve tried using a Ribbon Manager that’s been floating around many of the blogs. It handles interfaces with the page, which seemed to make things easier and our code cleaner for new tabs. However, we suggest you first understand interactions with the Page Manager before including this component and taking on ownership within your project.
- Make good design decisions around the user experience and type of Ribbon customizations. For example, we developed some contextual tabs that weren’t as intuitive to the users as we envisioned. We created new tabs when all we needed to do was change out, delete, and add some buttons.
- We suggest framing out a simple Ribbon solution to fully define variations and coding practices for your project. In other words, handling the presentation of tabs, groups, and commands, various pop-ups, PostBacks, redirect events, and more requires good organization and packaging.
Happy Coding!
It’s exciting to have the ability to customize the Ribbon to the extent that we can. For many projects, this is the right place to centralize many of the actions that make up the user experience. Certainly, there are many other aspects of using the SharePoint Ribbon, but we hope we gave you a good overview of what’s possible by sharing what we’ve learned. Anime MMMORPGMore Information

D7100 facial recognition?
Started Aug 17, 2013 | Discussions thread
Regular Member • Posts: 303
Does the D7100 have facial recognition for the autofocus and does it seek the closest eye? Also will it work on normal shooting or does live preview need to be on? Is it pretty accurate? I plan to use it with lenses that are close to wide open or close to it like the 50mm 1.4
Thanks in advance for any replies.

Color scheme? Blue / YellowI'm in love
I'm in love. Alpaca yarn is so soft and so nice to knit with. Here is a picture of my friend's unfinished fingerless glove. I changed the pattern a little bit. I added the light blue on the bottom just to ensure that I'd have enough yarn. The thumb is knit in the light blue as well. (Because I did not quite have enough to finish it in the dark blue). I also made the glove longer on both ends.
Just for fun look who else made these glovelets.
- Knitty Gritty (using Morehouse Merino)
- The Woolen Rabbit (scroll down a little)
- Sheep in the City (she used Koigu..yummy)

Hi! I just saw your comment about the Yarn Cafe (awesome!) and the alpaca. According to the cabled neck tube pattern, 100yds is needed (1 skein of alpaca). The alpaca guage is the same on slighty smaller needles. I'll have to knit a guage swatch to be sure...stay tuned for progress. Thanks for reading!

You will have to learn as much as possible about personal development, so you can try different methods. The information contained in this article will help you grow as an individual.
Be sure to read positive books on the subject of personal development..
Regardless of your surroundings, you should be ready to record ideas when they come to mind. Carry pens and paper with you at all times. Make sure to write down as many details as possible when a new idea comes to you so you can use them later.
Live your life according to your values. Everyone has beliefs that are central to their sense of self. Having a good foundation based on your core principles will benefit your sense of self esteem. Another bonus is the fact that doing so will encourage you to be steadfast in how you conduct your life, and that is something that will garner great respect.
You must know your own values to come up with a self improvement plan. It’s counterproductive to focus on things that you don’t value. Instead, focus on all that is important in your life, and work to improve those things. This will help you make significant changes to your life, both at home and at work.
Keep in mind that everyday should be better than the previous one. Aim for frequent and continuous improvement. Seek ways to grow beyond the person you were yesterday.
Therapy is the answer for many with serious problems. Resources designed for self-help may be helpful up to a point, but they do not provide the expertise or specialized attention that a patient can get from a therapist. Talking can be the motivation that some need in order to be successful. A book can not talk to you like a therapist can.
Make sure you treat all people with respect, no matter who they are, how powerful they are or what benefits you can obtain from them. The way you treat them says more about you than it does about them.
Do you frequently consume alcohol? Are nicotine or other destructive habits something that harms you? Mistreating your body will lead to illness, premature aging and an early death. If you are serious about improving your life, it is important to eliminate the habits which cause your body harm. Look at your lifestyle and what kind of habits you can eliminate.
When trying to battle depression, focus on diet and boost your complex carb intake. Complex carbohydrates are essential to producing serotonin, which helps to lift your mood. Complex carbs that you can easily eat to raise these levels include whole grains, nuts, raw vegetables and more.
If you notice that you are consistently failing to meet your goals and live up to expectations, you should attempt to diagnose the probable causes. Compare your goals with the goals of others that you can research online. You might discover that your aim is too high, you are missing something, or you are not putting enough into it.
This information is only valuable if you use it. Trying to be successful is the only way to actually achieve success.

The operators of Scotland's new 12,000-seat entertainment arena have said the venue will open on time despite reports that it is months behind schedule.
The Hydro will be part of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) complex in Glasgow.
Newspaper reports said pop concerts could be cancelled over legal wrangles with the contractor Lend Lease.
A spokesman for SECC said there was "no legal dispute" that would prevent the scheduled opening in September.
It added: "We will be announcing a very high-profile opening act for Scotland's new home of live entertainment very shortly."
The first concert currently advertised for the new arena is opera singer Andrea Bocelli on 15 September.
Two large stage shows - Peter Pan and Jesus Christ Superstar - and music legends Fleetwood Mac are also planned for the first month.
Pop stars Jessie J and Peter Gabriel are lined up to play the arena, which is sited next to the SECC on the north bank of the river Clyde, in October.
The Herald newspaper said there was a dispute between the SECC and primary contractor Lend Lease over payments.
A SECC spokesman said the claims were "out of date".Formerly named after a colonial governor, this threatened bird was recently renamed, Zambian barbet, to emphasize its status as Zambia’s only true endemic species (3) (4) (5).

CANTON, Ohio -- The first indication it was going to be a special weekend for Ed Bouchette came when he was assigned a driver to take him wherever he wanted to go for three days during the Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement festivities.
But there was no destination he enjoyed being chauffeured to more than Fawcett Stadium, where he shared the stage and a bit of the spotlight Saturday night with the Class of 2014 and some of the players he helped vote into the Hall of Fame.
Bouchette, who has covered the Steelers for 30 years for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, received the Dick McCann Award at the beginning of the enshrinement ceremonies, getting a few "boos" from some of the gold-jacketed Hall of Famers on stage, including the former Steelers great whose jersey was recently retired -- Joe Greene.
"I think they were doing that for my last name," Bouchette said. "At least I think so."
The McCann Award is voted on by members of the Pro Football Writers Association of America and given to a writer for long and distinguished reporting on professional football. It is named in honor of McCann, who was the first director of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
The list of McCann honorees -- 45 in all since 1969 -- is sometimes referred to as the "writer's wing" of the Hall of Fame, even though there is no actual area.
But Bouchette said he felt like a Hall of Famer after the way he was treated during the three days of festivities.
"The whole weekend was great, they treated me great. They went out of their way to make it a nice weekend. It culminated with Dave Baker presenting me with the award," Bouchette said, referring to the Hall of Fame president and executive director.
He added: "It's a little humbling, the whole thing. When you see all the names on that list, it was nice to be on it."
Bouchette is the second writer from a Pittsburgh newspaper to receive the McCann Award, joining Pat Livingston of The Pittsburgh Press, who was honored in 1979. Two other sports writers who formerly worked in Pittsburgh -- Vito Stellino (1989) and John Clayton (2007) -- received the award after they left their respective papers.
"Post-Gazette readers didn't need a Hall of Fame to tell them that they had a special correspondent in Ed Bouchette," said Post-Gazette executive editor David Shribman, who attended the induction ceremonies and visited with Bouchette and his family before he received the award. "But it's always special to have a correspondent like Ed recognized by the Hall of Fame."
Greene, Mel Blount, Lynn Swann and Dermontti Dawson were among the former Steelers and Hall of Famers who were on stage when Bouchette was presented his award. They were also a few of the many players he has covered in his 30 years on the Steelers beat for the Post-Gazette.
But Bouchette didn't just cover those players; he has been a selector for the Hall of Fame for 20 years and helped several of them get elected.
"I talked to Joe backstage and he congratulated me," Bouchette said. "I saw Dan Rooney the other night at the dinner and I got to see Dermontti. It was a wonderful weekend.".
Before he was introduced to the crowd at Fawcett Stadium, a video of Bouchette played on the giant video screens on each side of the stage. During the video, Bouchette said the favorite of the 30 Super Bowls he has covered in his career came in February 2009, when the Steelers beat the Arizona Cardinals on Ben Roethlisberger's throw and Santonio Holmes' acrobatic catch in the corner of the end zone in the final seconds.
One of his most memorable professional moments came in 1991 when he covered the final news conference of the late Chuck Noll, who announced he was retiring as head coach.
Toward the end of the news conference, Noll said the lasting lesson he wanted to impart was, "Don't leave anything on the beach but footprints." Bouchette used that quote to set up his ending in the story he wrote for the Post-Gazette.
"He walked briskly down the hall, pulling on his black overcoat," Bouchette said on the video, recalling the words he wrote. "He never glanced at the four Super Bowl trophies as he walked out the door.
"Those are Chuck Noll's footprints."

February 28, 2013
Formula One racing could have a new look in living rooms if 3D broadcasts become a reality.
Formula One racing is coming to 3D television. BSkyB, the U.K.-based pay-TV broadcaster, is conducting a live 3D trial for Formula One Management throughout the final 2013 pre-season test sessions in Barcelona, Spain.
BSkyB subscribers with 3D-capable sets can watch the test broadcasts from all four days at the Circuit de Catalunya -- the first time any viewers have seen live 3D coverage.
The trials are being conducted by a team led by BSkyB's chief engineer, Chris Johns, who set up eight fixed 3D cameras in selected locations, such as the start-finish straight and the first turn. The test team is also using a couple of hand-held Panasonic 3D cameras to cover the pit-lane and personnel interviews.
Johns said that a pair of onboard 3D cameras, while not part of the current test, could be mounted at fixed points in each car, and that the current broadcasting system would handle meshing the two picture streams. He added that BSkyB's existing technology could even correct for errors if one of the cameras were knocked out of alignment, thus ensuring that the 3D picture was seamless.
In this first on-track live footage, the 3D images appear indistinguishable from regular HD images when the cars are distant, but become very impressive as they speed toward or away from a camera. In pit lane, there are clearly problems with intrusion from people inadvertently passing in front of the hand-held cameras, which have to be set to a fixed depth of focus. When someone does walk in front of a camera, the effect for the viewer is disconcerting.
BSkyB has shared the U.K. rights to Grand Prix racing with the free-to-air BBC since 2011.
“This is groundbreaking,” said Martin Turner, the executive producer of the dedicated Sky Sports F1 channel. We're as excited as the next fan to see what Formula One will look like in 3D. It's uncharted territory, but this is a big opportunity to experiment and innovate, and we're grateful to FOM for working with us on this.
“Sky is a world-leader in the field of 3D broadcasting, so in partnership with FOM, we're in the best position to answer public appetite and take up the challenge of bringing live Formula One in 3D for the first time.”
Former driver Martin Brundle, now a Sky Sports F1 commentator, added, “This is a special moment for Formula One fans, and exactly the kind of innovation and access that Sky Sports F1 promised; 3D will show us the real challenges of the racetrack with added depth and perspective. It will be a new immersive experience for viewers and I can't wait to see what F1 action in 3D will reveal.”knoydart: Have you checked with the beacons people that you can't just bring in an overseas beacon and just register it with them? Each beacon has a large hex code so possibly it could be placed onto the New Zealand register? Aviation safety in Tauranga have supplied the ones I use, very helpful when we had one set off over New years down in Wanaka.
knoydart: Thanks for the country coding information - handy to know these things. If the costs are as you say, it seems like less hassle to buy one here in NZ. I've seen non gps versions below $599 but gps versions seem to be at the $599 mark at various retailers. Good luck with your tramping in any case. Another thing to consider if its short term, is beacon hire. But you might want to work out short term costs vs long term ownership of a beaconBy Tim KilbrideSpecial to American Forces Press Service
WASHINGTON, May 21, 2007 Economic expansion through the revitalization of domestic industrial capacity is a major factor for stability in Iraq, a senior defense official said, May 18, during a call with “bloggers” and online journalists.
Iraq’s state-run factories once served as the lynchpins of diversified regional economies, said Paul Brinkley, deputy undersecretary of defense for business transformation.
Turning those factories back on not only would provide employment and wages for hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, he said, but also would set off a ripple effect of smaller business generation throughout the areas in which factories are located.
More importantly, Brinkley added, “Economic prosperity is a counter-measure against social unrest and violence.”
Pointing to studies of the post-World War II reconstruction of Europe under the Marshall Plan, Brinkley said it was programs to return people to work and prevent economic stagnation that kept the continent from falling back into war.
While Iraq presents different circumstances, he observed, the fundamentals of the problem are the same.
“This is a human population that’s suffering economic distress,” he said. “And if you alleviate the suffering, I believe the job our forces have and the Iraqi defense forces have gets much easier.”
Religious zealots will remain a problem, but that situation is more easily controlled, Brinkley said, if the greater environment in which they operate is normalized.
“If you take away the portion that is simply frustrated and fed up after four years, and seeking any income,” he noted, “then I think the job of our forces and the ability to stabilize the country gets much, much easier.”
Iraq’s industrial legacy includes more than 200 formerly state-run factories, with a skilled work force more than 200,000 strong, Brinkley said.
Because of United Nations sanctions lasting from 1991 to 2003, Brinkley said, Iraq was forced to move beyond a dependence on oil exports and develop an industrial capacity to meet its internal needs. “This country already had a diversified economy,” he noted.
“When you look around the country, what you find is just a variety of factories making … essentially anything an economy can consume, with the exception of high-tech goods,” he explained.
Brinkley now heads up a team tasked with turning that production capacity into a tool for stability through growth. His Task Force for Business and Stability Operations – Iraq, is charged with evaluating Defense Department business processes and systems that affect contracting, logistics, funds distribution and financial management, to ensure alignment to theater commanders’ goals for reconstruction and economic development in Iraq.
The program originated with Army Lt. Gen. Peter Chiarelli, former commander of Multinational Corps Iraq. Chiarelli identified a relationship between unemployment and insurgent activity after collecting numerous reports of former Iraqi factory employees being paid to lay roadside bombs. According to Brinkley, the connection is obvious.
“Probably the worst time we ever had in the United States of America was the Great Depression,” Brinkley said. “And, the Great Depression was a time of great social unrest. It was violent in areas around the country, and the peak unemployment rate in the United States during the Great Depression, I think, was in 1933, and it peaked at 25 percent.
“The work force in Iraq is experiencing an unemployment rate, an effective unemployment rate, in excess of 50 percent,” he continued. “I don’t know of any population in the world … where if you impose 50 percent unemployment that there aren’t going to be militia roaming the street and people blowing things up. I just accept, and I think most rational people accept, that economic distress creates sympathy for violent activity.”
Turning the employment situation around involves a three-pronged strategy to support the restoration of Iraq’s commercial engine and create markets for Iraqi goods, Brinkley explained.
First, he said, the U.S. military could become a primary consumer, contracting for goods that “meet the requirements of military planners to support our forces.”
The second part, Brinkley said, involves reconnecting “the commercial links that existed throughout Iraq” under the U.N. sanctions. Iraq’s import gap from 1991 to 2003 was made up with domestic industry and business-to-business sales within the country, he explained. “It was part of the fabric that held the society together,” Brinkley said, and holds the hope of mitigating some of the more overt factional tension that has emerged since 2003.
The final piece for now is to attract foreign investment, Brinkley said. His task force is leading U.S., European and regional business executives on tours of Iraqi factories, encouraging the purchase of Iraqi goods, and negotiating contracts to transfer work into Iraq, he said. In the country’s areas of relative stability, he noted, what is “probably the most highly-skilled work force in the Middle East” is capable of manufacturing a wide range of products.
The Iraqi government is funding the factory-turnaround effort, Brinkley said. He added that those factories already selected for rehabilitation are on a “transitional path to privatization, very similar to the model that we’ve seen very effectively used in the Asia-Pacific region, in countries like China.”
Key to the Asia-Pacific model of moving slowly away from state ownership, he said, is privatization in phases: reducing the work force in factories over time; and putting in place profit and loss models.
Iraq is operating in a critical window to successfully restore a diversified, competitive economy, Brinkley cautioned. With pressure on the Iraqi parliament to pass hydrocarbons and revenue-sharing legislation in the near future, he said, the country needs to take active steps now to avoid letting oil become its sole economic driver.
Brinkley described two models typical of oil-rich countries. In the first, he said, foreign companies come into the country, create walled compounds around wells and refineries, and import all of their equipment and labor from abroad. In the second model, energy companies are encouraged through incentives and legislation to consume goods manufactured in the host country and put to use domestic capacity. This latter option is key to successfully managing Iraq’s oil resources, Brinkley said.
The compound model, by comparison, “would be a terrible mistake” since profit would accrue with the government but wouldn’t necessarily reach the population.
If Iraq manages to revitalize its industrial sector, develop markets and encourage investment in a timely manner, Brinkley predicted, “then this country could become something unique in the Middle East – a diversified economy with a skilled work force, a professional middle class, an educated middle class, that serves as an example to the rest of the region.”
He added, “I believe that’s what we’ll see here, and I hope that’s what we see here, but to me this next 6 to 12 months (are) really critical as those decisions are taken and as those first contracts for petroleum development take hold.”

An indirect platelet immunofluorescence assay (PIFA) was developed for detection of circulating antiplatelet antibody in dogs with suspected immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP). The PIFA was performed on 10 healthy dogs with normal platelet counts; 76 thrombocytopenic dogs, 20 of which were suspected of having ITP; and 18 dogs with other diseases and normal platelet counts. All normal dogs had negative test results. Fourteen (70%) of 20 dogs suspected of having ITP had positive test results. Fifteen of the remaining 56 thrombocytopenic dogs had positive test results, 9 had cancer and 6 had other immune-mediated diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this study, the PIFA assay seemed to be more sensitive (70%) than the megakaryocyte immunofluorescence assay (41 %) in the diagnosis of ITP. Of the 9 PIFA-positive dogs with neoplasia, 6 had lymphoproliferative disorders. The PI FA was positive in 5 of 18 diseased dogs with normal platelet counts. There was an inverse relationship between the platelet count and the intensity of fluorescence in the PIFA-positive dogs. We conclude that the PIFA is a sensitive screening method for detecting circulating antiplatelet antibody.Mobile Site You Are Here > BBR Home > Box Scores > Cleveland Cavaliers at Chicago Bulls Shot Charts, February 16, 2002

1998 Isuzu Rodeo • 173,000 miles
I had my transmission filter changed and fluid filled about 2 weeks ago due to a hard shift between 1st and 2nd gear. It fixed it immediatly, and it ran and drove excellent. However, a few days ago, it has started jerking at about 45 mph. The rpm's will go up and down rapidly, and I think I hear a clicking sound. It doesnt do it all the time, as sometimes it still runs, and drives, and shifts perfectly. It will also, die occasionally at an idle, but starts back up immediatly, but I '2 foot' it to keep it running. What could possibly be the problem?

Shortly after graduating in 1922, Henderson married (his wife's name is unknown) and, impressed and emboldened by Tuskegee Institute's ideals of self-reliance and economic autonomy and drawn by the cultural movement of the Harlem Renaissance, he and his wife moved to New York several months after he graduated. There, he found work as a linotype operator for the New York Daily News. Henderson lived in New Deal public housing known as the Dunbar Apartments in the Harlem neighborhood of New York with his first wife and their son.
Despite being relatively unknown today, Henderson was an accomplished author. He was, to an extent, an autobiographical novelist and writer; consequently, much of his writing reflects the ethos and creeds of Tuskegee Institute: self-reliance, the virtues of hard work, and autonomy. Throughout the 1930s and early 1940s, Henderson enjoyed a large audience in the periodical market, including the New York Daily News and Redbook. Among scattered references, clippings, microfilms of the periodicals, and some of the author's personal records, 17 short stories have been found. Unfortunately, an estimated 15 of his stories are lost.
His two most famous works are his novels, Ollie Miss, which he published in 1935, and its sequel Jule, which was published in 1946. Ollie Miss received widespread critical acclaim upon its publication. It takes place in Macon County and is about a sharecropper who earns a farm of her own. Critics praised the novel for its picture of the heroine, Ollie, who is a black woman surviving in a male-dominated world. They described her as opaque—a character with a blank past and open future who is existentially free. The subsequent novel Jule is set in the Ollie Miss universe and follows the title character, the illegitimate son of Ollie Miss, and his journey to Harlem to join a printer's union. It received unfavorable reviews, with critics stating that Jule was an artistically flat, stereotypical black migration novel that lacked the power and intensity of Ollie Miss.
Henderson's short stories are consistent with the literary style of the Harlem Renaissance, but his novels more closely resemble the works of the later protest novel movement. The characters he creates are personalities free from past and future psychological burdens. Their pasts are blank, and they have no longing for their future. They approach life as a series of hurdles and challenges, and they realize the world is broader than themselves and their desires. They realize there is no time for regrets or contemplation of tragic events. Henderson's aim was not for realism. As such, Henderson wrote these novels not as protests, but as a protest against protest to establish moral examples for his readers.
In 1941, Henderson met and married his second wife, Blanche, who had a daughter, Roslyn Kirkland Allen, from a previous marriage. Henderson began another novel in the 1950s entitled Baby Lou and the Angel Bud, which was meant to be a third installment in the series on Jule's family; however, Henderson never completed it for unknown reasons.
Henderson lived moderately and was a skilled worker and a union member. He continued to live in New York until his death in 1965. Although the names and dates differ from Henderson's own life, his stories echo his memories of rural Alabama and laud the virtues of hard work and self-reliance.

Within 30 minutes of their arrival, the fire was contained. Kingery then told the firefighters that his three cats, Pur, Merlin and Stormy, were trapped inside.
The felines, all adopted from shelters, were found inside the house overcome by smoke and unconscious.
"The first one looked like it was dead, the second two looked like they were trying to breathe," said Battalion Chief Ernie Fatta.
They brought the cats out onto the front lawn one by one and then hooked them up to small oxygen masks made for animals. "Within 15 minutes or so, they were all breathing well," said Fatta.
Woodland Fire carries a bag of medical equipment made specifically for animals. An increasing number of fire departments across the country carry pet oxygen masks.
Firefighters were able to retrieve the keys to Kingery's car, where the cats were confined for their protection.
With his phone, keys, wallet and cats saved, Kingery said his only other immediate concern was his backpack which contained school work and laptop computer.
Kingery was happy everyone was all right. He also planned to contact his parents sometime Monday to tell them about the fire.
"It looks like I'll be living with them again," he said, as will the cats.
The cause of the fire is under investigation.

But for many, summer has been winding down for weeks with rehearsals and practices for various extracurriculars. For my family, the week of Aug. 11 marked the end of the summer with the start of band camp at the Berea-Midpark High School. I visited practice on Thursday evening, a day that saw a high temperature of barely 70 degrees, and the cool evening made me anxious for the school year, football games and of course, the music of the Marching Titans. Here's to a great year for all our students in the district. And remember, everyone starts the year with an "A", you just gotta keep it there!
Going for the gold: And speaking of the school year just starting, if you are 60 years of age or older, and a resident of one of the communities within the Berea City School District, you are eligible for a Berea City School District Gold Card.

Councilors James Gallant and David Nealley voted against the budget.
Nealley did so in protest on decisions in Augusta and Washington, DC that he says are responsible for the financial struggles of many municipalities.
Councilor Gallant thought the council could’ve dug deeper to find other areas to trim.
About one-million dollars was cut from the budget since the city manager first presented it to the council in April.
Local leaders say the tax increase is due, in large part, to the reduction of state revenue sharing and an in increase in mandated expenses.
At Monday’s meeting, councilors accepted an amendment cutting cut an additional $14,580 from the Bangor Public Library’s budget.
Lee Chick, President of the library’s board of directors, argued, “The fourteen thousand would be used to fund the cost of living increase that many other city departments will be receiving.”
Councilor James Gallant said, “When I have something in front of me that goes over which trees to put in to a café or whatever design we’re looking at, at one of our last meetings, it comes to mind that, are we really in need of that 14-thousand dollars.”
Councilors also approved an agreement with Waterfront Concerts that shifts the cost of upkeep and maintenance to the venue, rather than the city.Shawn Michaels advertised for future Raw dates
Feb 13, 2012 - by Mike McMahon
During Monday’s Raw broadcast, local television affiliates in the Boston area advertised Shawn Michaels to appear at the March 5 Raw taping at TD Garden.
It also advertised Triple H as well as a dark match main event of CM Punk vs. Dolph Ziggler for the WWE Championship. The Rock, Undertaker and Chris Jericho are also advertised.
On top of the WWE Championship match, Kane vs. John Cena in a “Raw Challenge Match” is also advertised.
He’s also being advertised for the March 19 RAW in Philadelphia. Main event, I believe, is CM Punk vs. Ziggler.

This trend became very apparent in the fall/winter 2012 collections of labels such as Prada and Miu Miu, both of which presented incredible power suits. Since then, these graphic prints have conquered the hearts of many designers in not only clothes, but also shoes. For their spring 2013 collection, Aperlaï featured zigzag platforms and 3.1 Phillip Lim invested in dotted heels, which kind of looked like pantyhose. Balmain invested in a more Latin design, where black and white tiles served as inspiration to create harlequin-print shoes. Aquazzura invested in irregular shapes, making their shoes look kind of surrealist. But in any case, there are geometric prints that are so timeless that they certainly don’t need a trend to be in style; I’m talking about the Missoni print. A classic since the late 70s, the Missoni label is known for its horizontal zigzag design that you can clearly see in this Fashionista’s shoes.
In recent collections, Missoni presented their traditional print in shoes of their own. In their summer 2011 line, the label produced neon sandals that finished off with a striped pink and black lace. In their spring 2013 pre-collection, they created platform heels with details from their zig-zag legacy.
If you’ve decided to buy geometric printed shoes, here are a two options you could wear in college: printed ankle boots from ASOS or color-striped boots from Urban Outfitters. I also found these incredible neon triangle printed shoes from Nasty Gal, but unless your Lady Gaga, I’m guessing you won’t be wearing them to class!

San Francisco Founder of Arts Non-Profit Sentenced to 72 Months in Prison for Possession of Child Pornography, Anthony Josef Norris, Founder and Former CEO of Kid Serve, was Identified After He Posted Child Pornography Videos to an Online Bulletin Board
SAN FRANCISCO—Anthony Josef Norris was sentenced yesterday to six years in prison for possessing child pornography videos and images, United States Attorney Melinda Haag announced.
Norris, 46, of San Francisco, pleaded guilty on November 18, 2011 to a one-count information charging him with possession of child pornography, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2252(a)(4)(B). According to the plea agreement, Norris admitted that on April 26, 2011, he possessed more than 600 images of children engaged in sex acts with adults, including images of prepubescent children being subjected to painful sexual assaults. Norris waived indictment by the grand jury.
Norris is the founder and former CEO of Kid Serve, a San Francisco-based non-profit organization that involved kindergarten through high school-aged children in the creation of public murals, some of which decorated public schools throughout the city. Norris came to the attention of the FBI when an FBI agent who was acting in an undercover capacity discovered that he had posted child pornography videos to a Usenet newsgroup commonly used by traders in child pornography under the screen name “Spanky.” The posting was traced to Norris’ address, where a computer was found containing more than 7,000 images of possible child pornography. Norris admitted that the computer belonged to him.
The sentence was handed down by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Seeborg, who also sentenced the defendant to a five-year period of supervised release and ordered him to pay $6,500 in restitution, which is to be divided among the child pornography victims identified in his collection. The defendant was ordered to surrender to begin serving his sentence on May 8, 2012.
Owen Martikan is the Assistant U.S. Attorney who prosecuted the case with the assistance of Rosario Calderon. The prosecution is the result of an 11-month investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The Dec. 4 op-ed "Iran nuke accord is a mistake" forcefully tried to make the case against diplomatic initiatives toward Iran, but only from an Israeli perspective.
As the quote from Rabbi Hillel that was cited implied, "If I am for myself, who will be with me?" the authors glaringly omitted other perspectives on the issue. For one, why not give peace a chance?
If Kennedy can open a back door dialogue with Castro and the Kremlin, and Nixon can reach out to China, then surely Obama can sit down with Iran, especially when both sides appear willing to resolve their differences.
Another perspective is human rights. Do the authors want to point fingers at others? Who can step forward and cast the first stone in the Middle East?<p>When attempting to login with Chrome on iOS, it loads the security warning page where it says, "This site's security certificate is not trusted!"</p><p>Clicking the "Proceed anyway" button just loads the homepage again.

Dear Mr. Farbstein:
The Food and Drug Administration has completed an evaluation of your firm's corrective actions in response to our Warning Letter, CHI-13-13, dated JuneGreetings all... By now many of us are familiar with PSK31 and it's outstanding weak signal capability. It's really amazing what this mode can do when working HF dx , especially when narrow filtering is applied. However, it's nearly impossible to utilize this mode with satellites because of doppler shift and the precise tunning requirement needed for this mode. The Hellschreiber mode has nearly the same weak signal capability and is much less sensitive to doppler tunning. I was surprised at how well this mode works with the large amount of doppler shift that FO-29's 70cm downlink offers. Although automated doppler tunning would make things easier, it's not difficult to retune for doppler by hand... one only needs to keep an eye on the waterfall display built into most Hellshcreiber software. last night, I experimented with Hellshcreiber on OSCAR 10. I used the IZ8BLY soundcard program and recorded my downlink with an analog tape recorder. I then played the recorded Hellshcreiber signal back to the soundcard with the software running. The print was clear and easy to read despite the QRN from the 2 meter downlink. The sattellite was at 21,000km and the uplink power was 30 watts. Similar experiments on RS-13, FO 20 and 29 also yeilded 100% print. Hellscheiber is a CW like mode in that it's part digital and part analog, similar to facsimile. The charactors are in dot matrix form and appear to paint themselves accross the screen as the Hell signal is received. The duty cycle of this mode is 21% so it dosnt tax the satellite like SSTV , RTTY or even CW! It seems to me that this is one of the best keyboard modes for satellite work in terms of low duty cycle, and the ability to cope with doppler shift. For those who enjoy keyboard ops and satellite work, it's worth looking into. At the very least, the ease of operation and readily available software may generate a bit more activity on the birds. If anyone would like a screen shot of the test results, please e-mail direct. 73, Tony/AB2CJ IZ8BLY soundcard program - ZL1BPU's Hellshcreiber page - ---- Via the amsat-bb mailing list at AMSAT.ORG courtesy of AMSAT-NA.

University of Medicine and Pharmacy Gr. T. Popa, Iasi, Romania.
We describe two very rare genetic diseases characterized by particular physical features and deviation from normal growth. The first patient, CM, was admitted for delayed growth (113 cm at 8 years of age, -3 S.D.). The child had short lower arms with small hands and clinodactyly of the fifth finger. He had round widely spaced eyes with long eyelashes, a flat profile and prominent forehead, short upturned nose, misaligned teeth and gum hypertrophy. We diagnosed a rare (incidence of 1/500 000) autosomal dominant foetal face Robinow syndrome. The recessive syndrome is more severe and is related to mutations of a tyrosine kinase gene located on chromosome 9q22. The mutation for the dominant form is currently unknown. Our patient responded poorly to GH stimulation tests, so GH therapy was initiated. The second patient, IU, a 31 year old adult with a height of 220 cm, large extremities, horse-like face and severe mental handicap, was admitted with initial suspicion of acromegalic gigantism. The patients weight at birth was of 4500 g and he was the tallest of his generation from an early age. Clinical examination revealed a large mouth, macroglossy with incomplete mouth occlusion, defects in dental implantation with supernumerary teeth and sharp canines (bulldog teeth), and a short nail bed. The GH/IGF-I axis and the pituitary gland visualised by MRI were normal. Interestingly, the patient has a younger brother with comparable, although less dysmorphic features, with a height of only 195 cm and a normal intellect. The patient was diagnosed with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel (SGB) syndrome, a rare X-linked disease whereby glypican-3 is inactivated, leading to enhanced activation of various growth factors. The SGB syndrome is a true rarity only 130 cases described until 2008. Perturbed growth process added to mysterious clinical features could be the diagnostic tip for rare diseases with genetic)SEBRING - As Frank Montz supervised construction on a new building for Sherwin-Williams Paints on U.S. 27, he voiced optimism Tuesday about the future of the local building industry.
"It's been slow for the past few years, but it definitely seems to be picking up," he said.
Part of that was in residential.
Between Jan. 1, 2012, and Sept. 13, 2012, the county had 22 permits with a valuation of $4.4 million. This year that increased to 37 units, including a duplex, with a valuation of $7.3 million.
Other permits, which include commercial, remodels, churches and government buildings, were 427 from Jan. 1, 2012, to Sept . 13, 2012. For the same time frame this year, they were up to 690 permits.
In the city of Sebring, the Sherwin-Williams building was one of two commercial projects that received a permit this year. The other was a modular building behind the main building at The Studio, a day spa that has seen an increase in business.
Aaron Bertl, the manager of the Sherwin-Williams store, said the business had been at its previous location for 19 years. That building on the west side of U.S. 27 had 2,000 square feet, he said, adding the new building, near Highlands Independent Bank, will be 4,000 square feet.
"It's something we've needed," he said. The building will be able to house more inventory and allow for better service. It also will be more attractive, Bertl said.
The business will have a design areas with hightop tables, wallpaper books and a gourmet coffee bar, he said.
Until the new building is completed on Nov. 1, the store will operate out of a mobile center near the construction site, he said.
Montz, the owner of Montz Builders, said he expects to be working on several commercial projects in the Lake Placid area during the next few months. The next project may be a new maintenance shop for a farming operation, he said.
That's a lot different from during the past few years when they stayed busy by doing remodeling projects or working in other parts of the state.
"If we had sat at home and waited for it (the business), that would have definitely been a problem," Montz said.
Montz is becoming more optimistic about the future.
"I wouldn't have said that a year ago," he said.
He said he also believes that residential construction will continue to increase. As the glut of homes on the market diminishes, more new construction will occur, he reasoned.
Mielke Construction in Lake Placid also has seen an upswing in business , said owner Bob Mielke. There hasn't been a large increase, but work has been steady, he said.
Currently, they are working on a new house in Lake June Pointe.
Bill Dailey, owner of W.C. Dailey Construction, said his business has its first new house to work on in four years. There's been a slight increase in new construction, but his business's focus has been on remodels and work on homes that have water or fire damage, he said.

(863) 386-5834Earlier this week, word began spreading around the web that Serena Deeb had been released by WWE. This rumour proved to be true, as WWE officially announced on Friday that it had parted ways with the female member of the Straight Edge Society.
"WWE has come to terms on the release of WWE Diva Serena. We wish Serena the best in all future endeavors," the Fed posted on their website.
The confirmation by WWE comes days after Deeb's release rumours started gaining momentum through social media. Deeb herself perhaps added fuel to the fire on Tuesday, when, through her own Twitter account (@serenadeeb), she posted that, "You are the best fans in ANY universe."
Deeb had not been with WWE's main roster long. In fact, her debut was somewhat inconspicuous. During a series of head shavings performed by CM Punk and Luke Gallows in the early days of the SES, Deeb was seemingly just another member of the audience who was "plucked" from her seat in the name of redemption by Punk on the January 22nd episode of Smackdown. While others who had their heads shaved did not return, Deeb did the following week and soon became a fixture of the three- (and later four-) person faction.
During the SES's run, Deeb would frequently appear at ringside for Punk or Gallows' matches, but barely appeared in action herself. Her first bout took place just one week ago, on August 20, in a tag match with Gallows against Big Show and Kelly Kelly, a match which Serena won for her team.
Deeb, however, is not an unfamiliar name to wrestling faithful. Deeb's wrestling career dates back to 2005, when she began training and working for Ohio Valley Wrestling. She would later spend time with SHIMMER, Ring of Honor and was also brought to TNA for a couple appearances, including one bout with Awesome Kong. Deeb was also seen in Wrestlelicious as Paige Webb. These bouts were broadcast during Deeb's time in WWE.

babysbadnews posted...i still cant understand why it isnt popular oppinion that astorias is the hardest boss in dark souls.Because he's not really that hard. He telegraphs his harder hitting attacks pretty badly and his faster ones still aren't so fast that they're difficult to dodge on reaction. His power up ability can be halted entirely just by hitting him a few times.The only thing that really makes the fight harder is his higher than normal damage resistance, but Manus and Kalameet have that too.---In DeS, easily the Maneaters. High damage knock back attacks on a platform above a pit fall.

>>IMAGE.” ($8 at homedepot.com) and a small chandelier ($15 on craigslist). Then, my amazing husband replaced and repaired the drywall. While I don’t think he should quit his day job, I do think it looks fantastic! I framed the window with hardboard, which is super cheap and smooth, so it’s easy to wipe clean. We then added trim and decorative detail to the door and window, painted everything using leftover paint from other rooms and projects, and laid down some carpeting from when the previous owners had finished part of the basement. Overall, this was a fairly inexpensive project, and we’re really happy with the results. More importantly, our daughter loves it!
The best thing about this project is that we did it all ourselves instead of paying hundreds to have it completed. We also didn’t have to buy any decorations or furniture for this DIY playhouse. The doll bed, rug, and chair were all gifts. The picture of our dog was something my daughter had requested, and we happened to have the frame. The other artwork was made by my adorable tiny artist. The exterior paint was a color I had leftover from another room in the house, and the trim color is the same as the built-ins that I’d recently refinished. We did purchase the flower pot (also a homedepot.com find), and the flowers and “mulch” were about $8 at Michaels. I almost bought one of those foam flower molds, but they were way more expensive than I thought. I used a regular household sponge that was only $2 and covered it with the faux mulch. Of course my daughter picked out the pretty flowers.
Originally, we planned to drywall over the opening that just went to the ugly water heater and furnace. However, I’m really glad we decided against that. We positioned the kitchen so that it partially blocks off the utilities, and hung a cute curtain to hide the rest. It’s not perfect, but it was less expensive and will definitely make it easier for us to transition the space back to a storage room in the future if necessary. Another plan we changed mid project was the front door. Although a small dutch door would undoubtedly be adorable, it could also be a safety concern. Little fingers have a tendency to get pinched in doorways and they’re also a lot more difficult for moms and dads to crawl through. We’ve even thought so far ahead to realize that there will likely be times that we have to grab a little girl, kicking and screaming, and drag her through said doorway. We instead opted for curtains. These curtains were completely FREE…kind of. I had bought these panels on clearance at target.com for my kitchen window, cut them down to size, and then had enough fabric to make two smaller valances for our breakfast room windows. That’s right; two curtain panels covered THREE windows, one playhouse doorway, and I’ve still got two very small pieces that I could even make tiny draperies for the playhouse window if I really wanted to be a kook. (I might some day. I’m tired today.)
This morning, I took care of another little girl the same age as my daughter, and they played in the playhouse the entire time. I’m proud to say that my daughter was an excellent hostess to her friend, offering her refreshments and the
only best seat in the playhouse! I can see her enjoying this space for years to come, and I hope she does.
I’m giving 5 bonus points for anyone who can figure out the meaning of the address. 😉
MIchelle, that is SO cute!!! I’m totally impressed, especially with the frugality of it all! It looks like it cost MUCH more than what you guys actually spent. Is the address the date in which you completed the project?
Thanks, Laurie! Yeah, we didn’t spend much on it at all! The address is something my dad thought of. My daughter’s name is Ella and she’ll soon be 3, so we were throwing around ideas for an address like “apt E” or “3E” when my dad said “How about spelling her name with numbers?” It’s kind of a throwback to my childhood! Remember putting upside down and backwards words into your calculator for your friends at school? Way before everyone in the world had a cell phone obviously! Great, now I feel old. Anyway, I thought his idea was so cute, I just had to do it! The numbers are just stick-on from the hardware store for less than 2 bucks total!
Great idea, kids LOVE having their own space. When my son was young he was constantly looking for nooks and crannies to make into “forts.” I also applaud the decision not to put the door on……if experience has taught me anything, it’s that invariably a finger would have gotten caught, and then the playhouse would be ruined and sit unused because of that memory.
Kids need their own space! When we had some friends and family over for a birthday party recently, our daughter went into her playhouse to get away from the crowd for a bit. Sure, she was being kind of antisocial when she sat in there and just read a book for a bit, but she needed some down, alone time. I love that she feels comfortable enough to do that. She’s “redecorated” the art on the wall a few times, but that’s exactly why I didn’t put anything of value on the walls! I want her to feel free to play and be silly…and rip the paintings off the wall…why not?

Same-sex couples can get married in Cook County
By Tony Arnold
Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman issued a written ruling saying couples shouldn’t have to wait for the state law to go into effect. Last year, the Illinois legislature voted to allow same-sex couples to get married - starting June First this year.
In her ruling, Judge Coleman said, “committed gay and lesbian couples have already suffered from the denial of their fundamental right to marry.”

IMO, the current format of NPS presentations here at Gettysburg, while much different from ten years ago, is not to the detriment of presenting the battle and the Address. I, too, would prefer just a tactical presentation, but it's not up to me. If you think about how many come here just once, then the NPS has only one chance to give them something significant, even if it's what many of us in this group already know and aren't interested in. I don't envy the park staff; I worked at the old Cyclorama building and I know how ignorant the general public can be.

This is you having had a sufficient amount of sleep….
This is your marriage when YOU have not had sufficient sleep….
So here’s the message:
Get the F*** to sleep!!!
Yes, you heard me…your entire well being (including your relationship) depends on it! In fact the American Sleep Association states:
“For most adults, 7 to 8 hours a night appears to be the best amount of sleep, although some people may need as few as 5 hours or as many as 10 hours of sleep each day…. Many studies make it clear that sleep deprivation is dangerous. Sleep-deprived people who are tested by using a driving simulator or by performing a hand-eye coordination task perform as badly as or worse than those who are intoxicated.”
Okayyyyy…so based on that, if you’re one of the many sleep deprived folks out there, then how the hell are you supposed to act, think, or respond in a SMART way when it comes to your marriage??
NOT.
That is my answer for you.
I hope you’ve considered today’s message and with that said, I MYSELF am going the f*** to sleep.This product is no longer available. BB and 25/9 top off the spec.

Unabated stone crushing and urban sprawl towards the Grand Trunk Road have not just destroyed the beautiful Margalla Hills but also impacted the rain pattern in the area, said experts at the Meteorological Department. The east of Islamabad, starting from Chattar down to Bari Imam, always received more rainfall compared to the city’s western end.
“But in the last 15 years, this difference in the amounts of rainfalls in the eastern and western edges of the federal capital has increased significantly,” Chief Meteorologist Dr Ghulam Rasul told Dawn, substantiating his statement with data recorded from last week’s late night heavy showers.
While rain gauges installed in the Saidpur Village recorded 126 millimetres downpour that night, the gauges set up in sector G-13 recorded only 15 to 20 millimetres rainfall. This was an unprecedented turn of events in the last 10 years, especially between city locations just five or six kilometres apart.
“Rain in the western end of the city has decreased by more than 27 per cent in the last 10 years,” he said.
Dr Rasul attributed the less rainfall beyond sectors F-10 and F-11 to excessive stone crushing at the western end of the Margalla hills, uncontrolled encroachments and the development of sectors and housing schemes. In conjunction, these activities have altered the ecology of the western end of Islamabad completely.
“Natural environments are fragile settings,” he said, stressing that the slightest alteration can trigger a disaster.
“The stone crushers have destroyed thousands of acres of vegetation. Less green cover means less moisture that will result in less cooling of the atmosphere, and less moisture means there is not enough water vapour to form clouds,” he added, explaining how the western end of the capital city was gradually becoming more arid, with the air becoming warmer and the climate drier. Islamabad and Rawalpindi get rains from the clouds pulled in from Kashmir, reaching over Murree hills and then travelling towards the twin cities picking up moisture in the air.
“The rain showers are more than adequate as far as Bari Imam and a little farther on to the west. However, raindrops get smaller in size by the time clouds reach the western end. They start evaporating midway because of the increasing atmospheric heat. The raindrops sometimes disappear before hitting the ground, hence less rain,” the expert explained.
Islamabad has seen “severe deterioration of its natural environments” over the last 10 years, confirms Asif Shuja, the director general, Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-Epa).
The environmentalist reiterated his old stance that it was about time that the city planners stopped expanding the city.
“Islamabad is already a concrete jungle which absorbs heat all day making the surroundings warmer,” said Shuja.
Dr Ghulam Rasul said he would not be exaggerating when residents in sectors beyond F-11 and G-13 and G-14 and across the G.T. Road would be “longing for rains”.
He added: “If the pattern of development continues and the menace of stone crushing is not stopped immediately, there will be adverse effects on the climate of the regional areas and also on the locations surrounding the new Islamabad airport,” Dr Rasul said.Updated SpaceX Falcon rocket blasts off
- 29 September 2013
- From the section Science & Environment
SpaceX conducted two post-mission experiments.
One was to re-ignite the second-stage after shutdown, a procedure that can be used for de-orbiting the stage but which is also used for getting geostationary satellites into their correct orbit. This re-light experiment encountered an anomaly and was not completed, said Mr Musk, "but we believe we understand what that issue is, and should have it addressed in time for the next flight of Falcon 9".
There is sure to be a lot of interest, also, in the outcome of the experiment that SpaceX ran of the nine first-stage engines were commanded to re-ignite, to see if they could bring the rocket segment down through the atmosphere intact. The centre engine of the cluster of nine was then ignited to try to slow the stage still further and control its approach to the water.
Mr Musk reported that the test went well, although the stage lost stability in the moments prior to impacting the water - a behaviour he said his engineering team understood and could.

Computer Software Reconstructs Ancient Language
Tuesday, February 12, 2013
BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA—New computer software is being used to reconstruct protolanguages from modern ones. “It’s very time consuming for humans to look at all the data. There are thousands of languages in the world, with thousands of words each, not to mention all of those languages’ ancestors,” said Dan Klein of the University of California, Berkeley. The software identifies changes in words in a group of languages and then “reverses them” to find early words. “At a much deeper level, our system doesn’t explain why or how certain changes happened, only that they probably did happen,” Klein added.Adobe has announced several updates for Creative Cloud in the 2014 release.

The VCR mechanism was developed for use in both gasoline and diesel medium- and heavy-duty engines. The announcement was made by Gary Rogers, FEV, Inc. president and CEO.
"This mechanism has the potential to contribute greatly to overall vehicle fuel economy and the reduction of emissions," said Rogers. "The powertrain continues to evolve in response to the never-ending desire for higher efficiency. The need to explore renewable energy sources and fuels adds even greater demands for flexibility, while still focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the greatest extent possible. At FEV we are constantly looking at options that can be easily and cost effectively integrated into current technology to accelerate that evolution."over piston and pin design. Other benefits derived from the ability to adjust the compression ratio include improved cold startability and the potential to optimize performance while utilizing alternative fuels.
The system currently supports peak cylinder pressures of 180 bar and is presently completing durability testing.Steve’s Prince of Steaks was started at its original location on Bustleton Avenue in 1980 by Steven Iliescu. Steve’s Steaks was voted best cheese steak in Philly by the Philadelphia Magazine in 1998 and 2007. Steve’s has also been awarded "Best of Citysearch" 2005 & 2007 and "Best of Bucks" 2007 & 2008.
On November 27th 1998, the Philadelphia Eagles decided to make the "World’s Largest Cheese steak", for the Guinness Book of World Records. The steak itself was 365 feet long and was made by 22 local cheese steak restaurants, all competing to be the Best of the Biggest, which Steve's Prince of Steaks was crowned the winner. Other sources of fame for Steve’s Prince of Steaks happened in 2006 when the Food Network aired a show called the Hungry Detective. During the show Steve's Prince of Steaks was highlighted as the best kept secret in Philadelphia cheesesteaks.
Steve’s has since expanded to open 2 different shops. In 1999, "The Prince" opened his second location, Steve's Comly, at Comly Road and the Roosevelt Blvd. The third location opened in 2006, Steve's Langhorne, located at 1617 E. Lincoln Highway.
I ate at Steve’s original location and have to say that I am not impressed. I had a regular Philly cheese steak and it cost me roughly $7. The steak sandwich used strip steak instead of chopped. Steve’s was unique in the sense that he double layered the stripped steak on the rolls. Also the steak was a little thicker than Geno’s or Pat’s who also use strips of steaks instead of chopping it. The roll was a nice Italian roll but Dattilo’s Italian Deli sandwich had a roll that was much longer and better in terms of color, texture, softness, and taste. The onions were plentiful but were very dark. They were not the kind of caramelized onions that your perfect cheese steak would have.
The cheese…
This was the gooiest steak I have ever seen with American cheese. The cheese on this sandwich is what ruined it. It was layered on top of the steak but in an oozy type of format. I was served the steak sandwich with the cheese actually dripping off the ends of the steak because the American cheese was just completely liquefied. This is American cheese and not whiz. This just is an absolute no-no.
Although I liked the fact that you can sit inside and eat at Steve’s Steaks, they have peppers for you, and an interesting chocolate soda, I am not impressed with their sandwich at that value. I think that they have tried to compete so hard with Geno’s and Pat’s by using the same style that it has worked against them. Tell me one reason why I won’t drive an extra mile up the street to Dattilo’s to eat a steak for $1,50 less and have a much bigger, better quality sandwich. I can’t think of one. Steve’s needs to be more of Steve’s. I think that when they first started out they may have been great, but this isn’t South Philly and you aren’t Geno’s or Pat’s.
Steve’s should take my advice and lower the price and beef up on what it has to offer its customers. I especially recommend that they do something about that cheese as it has ruined what potentially could have been a very good sandwich. Sorry Steve’s Prince of Steaks, I cannot recommend you in the Best Philly Cheese Steak Club this year!
i honestly disagree with your opinion on this. i think steves american cheese sauce is what sets them apart from the crowd. its a nice off-shoot from the norm. also, the taste is great. i prefer melty/oozy cheese. its part of the experience. and their "strip steak" is very different from pats or genos. the pieces are much smaller.
To each their own I guess, but I consider Steve's to be one of the best steaks in the city. I prefer the wiz wit, so my steaks are often gooey and I love them like that.
Are you out of your mind? That is what a Philly . If the cheese didnt drip, you wouldnt have to do the philly lean.(so the cheese does not get all over your shirt. Steve's is without any doubt...the best steak you will ever have. All you have to do is go to the original store and count how many people come in just while you are there. trust me it's non-stop all day. He must be doing something right. Also, you get what you apy for. I get the double meat and it cost me about $12 and some change. well worth it.May 22 2015 Latest news:

The proposed coating will significantly reduce friction between concrete barriers and colliding vehicles and, therefore, reduces the tendency for a vehicle tire to climb the barrier, which could result in a severe rollover crash. The proposed Phase I effort combines material development and testing tasks with a novel application technique that allows for rapid application. The application approach enables in-place coating, is solvent free, and is easily repairable. The coating application technology and coatings will be configured to be applied using a truck mounted/automated application system, mirroring the design and operation of conventional highway stripping equipment.

As I have said in the past I am reluctant to jump to any conclusions as to the whether this is the right decision or not – after all the track record and testing of the system is based on the current system.
However, if market conditions have indeed changed then it would be prudent to adjust the system accordingly – watch this space for updates.
Market wise – I think the current risk on rally is coming to an end. We have all the news, good and bad, out in the open now and it seems difficult to imagine what will drive prices materially higher.
SO I think we will see markets consolidate at around these levels – USDJPY may find some resistance ahead/around 80.00 for the time being also.0 commentsOutpatient Rehabilitation

Hello,
I would like to take a moment and make a comment about Trooper P. DeCarlo who patrols the Florida Turnpike near Orlando.
This morning my daughter's car broke down on the southbound Florida Turnpike near exit 267. While I was in route from Lady Lake approximately 50 miles from my daughter Trooper DeCarlo stopped and stayed with my daughter. I had called AAA for assistance and it took them close to two hours to respond. Trooper DeCarlo stayed with my daughter and I the entire time to ensure our safety. I just want to once again thank her for staying with us and following up with AAA and the tow truck driver. I believe that she certainly went the extra mile and my daughter and I greatly appreciate her efforts.
Thank you,
Kimberly Anderson-BryantJACKSONVILLE, Fla. --A small business on the verge of calling it quits during tough economic times becomes a victim of theft and now the owner is facing yet another struggle to keep her restaurant in operation.
For two years Maria Martinez has kept her Spanish restaurant in operation five days a week at the Johnson's Family Flea Market. Even during tough economic times, Martinez has managed to keep her doors open, offering Spanish-American cuisine, but her clientele continues to decrease.
"Not a lot of people are coming in at this time because everybody is shopping in the malls, and things have been, business has been very difficult, and we've been thinking maybe we should hang the towel," says Maria Martinez, Owner of Martinez Restaurant and Bakery at the Johnson's Family Flea Market in Westside.
And now the restaurant is hit with a burglary. On Saturday morning, Maria came to work, as she always does through the back of the business and noticed her AC unit was gone.
"I said 'oh my God now what's going to happen?' you know we have been going through so much in here and now this," says Martinez.
The theft caused over a thousand dollars in damage and to make matters worse, the unit is what the restaurant uses to cool the freezers.
"Fans are not working," says Martinez, as she pointed to the fans in her freezer.
Police believe the burglary may have occurred in the early morning hours because all of the food was still frozen. Luckily, no goods were spoiled, but Martinez is forced to find alternate ways to keep the food safe for consumption.
"We cannot stock anything anymore; we have to buy whatever we are going to use and nothing extra," says Martinez.
The owner says now she has to buy a larger chest freezer to store the food while the building owner works to replace the old unit - another strain on the budget, but she's also looking at the bright side - she wants to use this experience to warn neighboring businesses.
"If you have a system that is like ours that is outside or that is on top of your building, just go and check it out, make sure that it is safe and it's not easy for someone just to come and take it," says Martinez.

Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC, is an annual conference that showcases the company’s new software and technologies for developers.
The conference, which was first held in 1990 and which traditionally takes place in California, includes hands-on labs with Apple engineers and in-depth sessions covering a wide variety of tech-related topics for attendees. The 2008-2014 conferences were sold out at 5,000 attendees, all of whom have to sign a non-disclosure agreement covering the sessions and other material handed out at WWDC.
Beginning in 2002, WWDC became a site for hardware announcements. In 2003, WWDC merged with QuickTime Live, another Apple trade show. The number of QuickTime sessions was increased, the Apple Design Awards were joined by “Apple Design Awards for QuickTime Content,” and more enterprise-oriented content was added.
In June 2014, WWDC celebrated the 25th anniversary of WWDC. The event included the unveiling of new software items like the iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite. The new Swift programming language and a surplus of developer kits and tools for iOS 8 were also announced at WWDC 2014.Re: RE: Bizarre traffic

The University of Iowa Libraries have recently launched a new project called DIY History—a project which asks the interested general public to participate in the process of transcribing some of their Special Collections holdings. OCR is a great technology but one which really works best with print, and so older, handwritten documents still need a human eye to help make them search engine accessible—not always a very difficult task, but a pretty time-consuming one.
I think the DIY History project is a great one on a number of levels. It opens up the practice of history, allowing people who aren't formally historians to "do" history, to see what it is that historians and archivists do; it allows us to engage with the general public; it allows us to overcome some of the limitations of technology and funding resources. I can also see it being very useful in the classroom—what better way to have students in a history class learn how to read primary sources in an analytical manner, seeing themes and contradictions and problems with the historical record as they go?
Have any of you worked on projects like this in the past, whether as organisers or contributers, or have you used them in the classroom? I'd be interested to know what you guys think about:
- Usefulness in the classroom—what skills do students gain from working on DH projects like this?
- Quality control issues and "good faith" revisions. (Some of these projects can be very accurate; how can we ensure that this is true of all of them?)
- How to publicise the existence of projects like these, both to the general public and to other academics (there are projects like the Harry Ransom Center Fragments Project, which are aimed at harnessing the knowledge of a very wide range of specialists on medieval manuscripts and writings, for instance)
- The role of the historian/archivist—who is the final arbiter and why/how?
- Other issues that I'm forgetting here?
Transcriptions in a Digital Age
Thanks Yvone for this! The DIY project sounds great because of the way that it introduces students to primary documents while also getting them to transcribe for the library. I do not know much about other projects like this, but I do have a related idea to add.
This week I went to a lecture by Dr. Luis von Ahn of Carnegie Mellon University. An associate professor of computer science, von Ahn presented at the Provost Lecture Series at Duke University. While his presentation was primarily about Duolingo, he also discussed the use of captchas in transcribing online books. The idea is that everytime you decipher a captcha you are also helping to transcribe a letter that a computer can not read. These transcriptions are then used to digitize old books. So, not quite the same as DIY, but definitely interesting!
Duolingo
Oh, thanks for the link to Duolingo! I've come across mention of how captchas can be used to OCR some old texts before, but I haven't seen a project quite like that one. It's interesting to think of projects like this which combine both self-interested (language acquistion) and selfless (transcription) elements in order to motivate people. I'd be very interested to see how it works out in the longterm--if it's a viable model that could attract more users in the longterm, or if it's something that people would move away from without longterm support.By Chris Kanaracus
Compuware said Wednesday it has agreed to acquire Web application management vendor Gomez for US$295 million. The transaction is expected to close in November.
Gomez's technology will work in concert with Compuware's portfolio of tools for managing the performance of on-premises applications, providing coverage "from the data center to the customer," the companies said in a statement.
Such capabilities are crucial in today's IT environments, Compuware President Bob Paul said during a conference call Wednesday.
For example, a retail banking transaction may begin with customers using an iPhone to connect with an online banking Web site, and end up spanning multiple third-party services, back-end databases, ISPs and mobile carriers, Paul said. "The complexity is staggering."
The acquisition will bolster Compuware's ability to compete with the likes of Hewlett-Packard, CA and BMC in application performance management. Those competitors offer only "narrow, keyhole views" into various areas, Paul claimed.
Compuware will also gain fresh footholds in many of the world's largest Web properties. Gomez has about 2,500 customers, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Amazon.com, according to its Web site.
The acquisition announcement follows steps Gomez had taken to prepare for an IPO.
The privately held vendor has 272 employees and is based in Lexington, Massachusetts. Compuware is not planning any significant personnel changes, according to a statement.
Gomez's current product road map will also "essentially remain unchanged," and the Gomez brand will be retained, although plans to integrate the vendors' offerings are afoot, Compuware said.

LIMITED-TIME OFFER SUBSCRIBE NOWOur first location will be in the high elevation cloud forest in the Talamanca Mountain Range in a virgin oak forest that is part of the largest protected natural zone of Central America. This area, which includes parts of both Costa Rica and Panama, has been designated a World Heritage Site. The large native oaks grow to a height of 70 meters and rival the largest lowland tropical trees in size. The range is home for many endemic plants and animals and is habitat for five species of big cats: pumas, ocelots, margays, jaguars and jaguarundis. There are 600 species of birds including the three-wattled bellbird, bare-necked umbrella bird and resplendent quetzal. The quetzal is generally considered the most spectacular bird of the Americas. Our visit will coincide with the quetzal nesting season, the birds nest in tree cavities and there should be good opportunities to observe and photograph them from adjacent trees.
We will stay at the Savegre Nature Reserve in a very comfortable and pleasant lodge owned and operated by the Chavez family, a local family who were the original settlers in this area. They recognized the importance of conserving this unique beautiful forest and the role of eco-tourism to make this happen.
There are large wild old growth trees to climb and explore in the forest and also smaller trees with lower branches for novice climbers.
The lodge:
Optional activities at this location include a nearby zipline, horseback riding, fly fishing for trout and a visit to the spa.
The next stop after the cloud forest will be Las Cruces Research Station, Wilson Botanical Garden and the town of San Vito in an environment of mid elevation (3900 feet) pre-montane primary and secondary forest as well as restoration forest and agricultural areas with coffee being the primary crop.
Las Cruces Research Station in operated by the Organization for Tropical Studies, a non-profit consortium of about sixty universities and research institutions around the world. It is a key site for studies in restoration ecology and biological corridors. We will visit primary and secondary forest and explore the Wilson Botanical Garden which has an extensive collection of palm and a self-guided tree walk with tropical trees from around the world. There will be opportunities to interact with researchers and field station staff if interested and of course trees to climbs. The arborists in the group can take part in a volunteer project to do a detail canopy reduction for a view from their observation tower.
The town of San Vito was founded by Italians (good pizza), you may see the indigenous Ngobe people and members of the local Mennonite community in town. If you are so inclined this is good chance to go out and meet some locals Friday night. Word has it we should be able to find a place with live music.
Other optional activities at this location include a coffee tour, river rafting, and a cave tour.
II Osa Peninsula
Guaria de Osa. From San Vito we will drive to the Sierpe River by the Pacific Ocean and travel by boat to Guaria de Osa, our paradise home on the Osa Peninsula operated by our enthusiastic host, Jonathon[ Miller Weisberger. Jonathon is an ethno-botanist with extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and traditional practices. He has created a remarkable eco-resort on this beach just north of Corcovado National Park. We will stay in cabins in the ethno-botanical garden. This area has some truly great trees both inside and outside Corcovado Park, thought to be the largest trees in Central America. Corcovado also contains the largest primary forest on the American Pacific Coast. National Geographic has called it “the most biologically intense place on earth in terms of biodiversity”. Notable species are scarlet macaws, howler, capuchin, spider and squirrel monkeys. There are tapirs and jaguars and an abundance of other species. We will take part in the turtle conservation project and have an evening bat program. We will catch and release bats using mist nets in the canopy, record the species and learn about their natural history.
Optional activities available at Guaria include scuba diving, snorkeling, horseback riding, a dolphin tour and surfing.
Learning
On this trip there will be lots of opportunities to learn and have your questions answered. Our Costa Rican guide, Carlos Chavarria is a very knowledgeable naturalist, he has a degree in forestry and is experienced in managing eco-tourism. Jonathon at Guaria is an expert on local natural history with a specialty in medicinal plants. You can expect to learn to identify a limited number of tropical trees, birds and mammals including common bats and the four species of monkeys native to Costa Rica. You will learn some about conservation policies and eco-tourism. The learning is as casual or involved as you desire, for example the presentations at Savegre Lodge will be in the loungeJ.
Climbing.
There will be lots of tree climbing but also plenty opportunity for other activities and relaxation. This group is for adult responsible climbers of all levels who come together to enjoy nature and share new experiences with friends. You will decide your own activities and level of involvements within some general guidelines subject to the instructions of the guides. The large old forest trees generally have no lower branches, the canopy structure is high. The “first ascent” of the wild trees requires experienced climbers with guides. Beginners can start with guided climbing of “tamer” trees with a lower branch structure. The trip will have a ratio of 4 guests to one climbing guide. Please consult with a guide before the trip regarding your experience, climbing methods and equipment as well as guidelines to follow.
Contribution to Conservation.
We will stay at places that actively work for conservation and research. Savegre Lodge is undertaking forest and habitat restoration and a major focus of the research at Las Cruces is best practices in restoration. Guaria has a successful ongoing turtle conservation project. The amazing large ancient turtles travel extensively through the world’s ocean and return to their beach of origin to lay eggs in the sand. Prior to Jonathon’s arrival and creation of Guaria it was common for people to collect the turtle eggs for human or even pig consumption. Through education and work with the local community and school this practice has been stopped. In addition the local turtle project protects the nest from predation by dogs and releases the newly hatched baby turtles to head for the ocean and begin their epic journeys. Our visit coincides with the turtle season and there is a good chance we can take part in releases.« Weekend reading 3 | Main | How'd you like to wake up to this? »

Baucus Applauds Senate Confirmation of John Koskinen to be IRS Commissioner
Finance Committee Approved Koskinen’s Nomination by Voice Vote Last Week
WASHINGTON –Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) today applauded the Senate’s confirmation of John Koskinen to be commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by a vote of 59-36. During a committee hearing to consider his nomination last week, Senator Baucus called on Koskinen to restore public trust in the IRS following the Inspector General’s report on the agency’s handling of 501(c)(4) applications. In addition, Senator Baucus said Koskinen must work to oversee the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and provide input on the committee’s continuing efforts to overhaul the tax code. The Finance Committee approved his nomination by voice vote on December 13.
“John Koskinen has an excellent record of public service and leadership in demanding roles,” Senator Baucus said. .”
Koskinen served as non-executive chairman of Freddie Mac from 2008 to 2011 and acting CEO in 2009. Koskinen was.
###GREENBRIAR SHORT SUBJECTS
Here’s another posting concept I’ll float over the next while that hopefully will work toward getting images up and ideas out that don’t necessarily merit a longer piece. I’ll use the Greenbriar Short Subjects format to recommend books and maybe a few DVD’s as well.
SHOW ALERT: Cinevent 2009 happens three weeks from today in Columbus, Ohio (May 22-25). It’s a four day collector and fan gathering that’s gone on since I was but a youth, and what a marathon this is for rare screenings and unique memorabilia. We used to drive ten hours over perpetually unfinished West Virginia highway to get there. Since ridding myself of that incubus named 16mm collecting, I can traverse the hotel’s exterior lot minus nagging compulsion to intercept dealer vans to see what they’ve brought. Film's been largely displaced by DVD, but there are still ghostly images projected upon walls in the selling area, and I’m nostalgic near to wistful tears for projectors grinding and Super 8 (yes, Super 8!) prints of Castle Films’ Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde being unspooled by dealers I’ve known for nigh onto thirty years and then some. People in the movie life may die, but they never quit. Guys twenty years my senior buy up books and stills like teenagers just entering the hobby. Do we ever lose our childish enthusiasm for this stuff? I keep waiting for my interest to subside, an event concurrent with onset of much belated maturity and realization that all of it’s ephemeral and shouldn’t matter to grown-ups, but in the meantime, I buy up books and stills and wonder if twenty years from now I'll be doing the same (hope so!). They’ll be showing a Bill Hart feature new to me, and I’ll sure be there for that. Also a dye-transfer Technicolor print of Hello, Frisco, Hello which will remind us of what Alice Faye musicals looked like before Fox junked their three-strip negatives. Morris Everett has another of his poster auctions Saturday and Sunday. Program coordinator Steve Haynes sent an e-mail reporting that rooms at the Ramada Plaza Hotel and Conference Center are still available, but going fast. If you’re within a continent’s travel of Cinevent, by all means check it out.
I look at theatre ads like this and so many questions arise. What were the Three Stooges like on stage? This was 1942. Curly was still in pretty good performing shape, but how long before these live appearances became untenable for him? The recent Stooge DVD sets gave us opportunity to examine his decline from one short to the next until a stroke took him out. Bloggers have even posted frame grabs to pinpoint moments when you could see Curly giving it up. I’m open to Stooges now whereas I used to switch off whenever their theme came on, thus nearly all these are fresh viewing meat. One the other day had me levitating upon realization that its setup was lifted wholesale from The Laurel-Hardy Murder Case. Now the rest of you have been on to this for a lifetime, but here I exalted, What A Discovery! Obviously, I’ve got lots of Stooge catching up to do (and I’ve been helped in that regard by Stuart Galbraith IV's excellent DVD reviews). Next question ad wise: Would Jackie Cooper remember this gig with the Stooges? They’d have done at least five or six shows a day (doors opened at Ten AM). That’s a lot of backstage waiting, and I’m wondering how much conversation Jackie might have had with the boys. Did they send out for sandwiches? Things like that cross your mind when looking at these promotionals ... wishing to Heaven you could have been there primary among them, of course.
RADIO vs. MOVIES CIRCA March 29, 1928: The above group supplied an hour’s free entertainment on NBC radio that was like opening cannon fire at Fort Sumter, the first of many battles to come between theatres and media piped into homes. United Artists’ Joseph Schenck committed star talent for an hour sponsored by the car manufacturing Dodge Brothers for purposes of selling their Victory line of six-cylinder models (from left to right at top is A.K. Schoepf representing Dodge, Douglas Fairbanks, Joseph Schenck, and Dolores Del Rio, with John Barrymore, Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith, and Norma Talmadge at bottom). Exhibitors hit roofs nationwide over movie people competing with theatres they proposed to support with then silent features. A public’s curiosity assured interest in hearing Chaplin, Fairbanks, Talmadge and the others speak for the first time. It was a coast-to-coast broadcast that neatly bifurcated show nights in the east (8 to 9 PM) and kept normally paying customers hearthside, a chilling portent of things to come. Theatre-men assailed Schenck and got his promise not to let it happen again. Exhibs more open-minded played the Dodge Brothers show with comedy shorts and trailers on screen as UA luminaries spoke and sang from recently installed Vitaphone speakers. There was clean reception or major static depending on location, commercial radio being still in its comparative infancy. Audiences stamped and hooted disapproval according to sound quality or their level of disappointment with speaking voices new to them. Chaplin’s was a particular letdown, and there was reason to believe pro orators stood in for Talmadge and Dolores Del Rio. The whole scheme was pretty much a train wreck and object lesson to discourage further such experimentation, but there was no denying sound’s penetration into theatres and the fact it was very much here to stay.

John;
Any idea of the location or exact date of that Three Stooges ad for their live appearance with Jackie Cooper? I'm guessing the date would be some time in July 1942, as one release date given for the accompanying feature "Sweater Girl" is July 13, 1942 (although I have two reviews of it from May 1942).
Regret to say I don't have an exact date on this, Richard, other than the year, nor the location. Maybe another reader will recognize the theatre name.
Even when I was eight years old, I could tell the healthy Curly from the sick -- he lost weight (not in a healthy way) and his voice was weak and whiny. The Curly from "Micro-Phonies" doesn't appear anything like the human tornado of "Punch Drunks" a decade earlier. I dreaded watching anything from his last two years of acting -- it was just too sad.
I think it's San Francisco - at least, there is a big intersection at 11th & Market Streets & the Fox Theater was once at 9th and Market.
Thanks very much John for taking the time to research and post all of these Greenbriar entries. I did a quick internet search, finding the Earle Theatre in Philadelphia, and also Midgley as a more likely spelling. Actually, the name (as opposed to the morale-building photo) that first caught my eye in the full-page ad for the Earle was that of Betty Jane Rhodes. I see that she turned 88 on April 21. Betty, just give me a sailboat in the moonlight and you. :-)
John,
If I get around to calling my cousin Barbara, I MAY ask her if Jackie remembers anything about this, but mind you, I'm not making any promises. Sure, they sent out for sandwiches between shows, they're people, like anyone else. They probably sat around backstage talking "shop" and probably playing gin or poker.
I did see The Stooges perform live here in L.A. It was on something like my eleventh or twelfth b'day (who can remember?). My parents WAY TOO GENEROUSLY chartered a bus, and took myself and a whole group of friends from school down to what was then called "The Moulin Rogue", which had formerly been "Earl Carroll's" and later became "The Star Search" Theatre on Sunset, to see the boys performing live. I remember it was a lot of fun, my parents catered a beautiful lunch there at the restaurant, (They were just way "over the top" looking back), everyone had a splendid time, and as the "topper" to the afternoon, I recall being taken backstage afterward to meet with the boys, and I had a photo taken with them.
They were nice guys, all of them. Of course, you understand, I'm sure, that this was with the later "Curly" replacement. A year or two after that, our family went to dinner one night at a restaurant in Beverly Hills called "La Scala" and as we walked in and were seated in the dining area, Moe Howard, seated at the booth in front of us, called me over. He introduced me to his wife and several others seated at his table, and could not have been more gracious. My grandfather, M.K. must have been there too, that night, because I vividly recall the two them standing outside afterward, deep in conversation. (We laughed later about the two "Moe's" talking to each other). My grandfather had known the boys in vaudeville, and later worked with them, on a film called "Myrt and Marge" shot at Universal, which my grandfather wrote the songs for, and made a cameo appearance in, so I guess they had a lot to reminiscence about! (Somebody evidently remembered it well, because it turns-up as an extended clip in George Clooney's "O Brother Where Art Thou").
And finally, dear friend of mine, dancer named Jerry Antes told me a story once about appearing as the opening "musical" act, along with some other singers and dancers as a "production number" intro in Las Vegas for the boys. This would have been most probably late fifties. He said, from backstage, they heard not one person laugh during their act. This was at the dinner show. Before the "Midnight" show, they were canceled by the management, and hastily replaced and sent packing! Yikes!
I have vivid memories of "The Crime of the Century" from when I was a very little boy. The film stops dead, just before the end, and gives the audience a minute to figure out the killer!
All best, always,
R.J.
A chartered bus to a live Stooges show followed by a catered meal would pretty much ring the bell for my next birthday, RJ, if such a thing could be had at this late date. Hard to imagine anyone experiencing such a remarkable day as you did, and I really appreciate your sharing that event with Greenbriar.
By the way, everything I've ever read about Moe suggests he was a super nice guy and always gracious to his fans. Glad to have it confirmed again here by you.
Thanks Dave and Zafrom for helping ID that theatre where the Stooges appeared. All I had was the clipping itself ... not the page on which it appeared.
Any idea on the grosses of those Curly-Joe feature films of the late 50's and early 60's? They must have done pretty well, they cranked them out.
The Earle Theater was at 11th & Market in Philadelphia, 1924–1953.
John,
First of all, sorry, I should have spelled it "Moulin Rouge". The luncheon was actually held at the nightclub (only in this case it served as a "Dayclub"), before "The Main Event" as I recall, and as you can imagine the place was mostly kids that afternoon,who were roughly my, and my friend's ages. The Stooges were then at the "height" of their "resurgence", owing to the reissue of their Columbia shorts on television (I saw very few of their "newer" features theatrically), and I do recall that the only kind-of disappointment my friends and I had that afternoon was that they were doing a standard "nightclub" act, when what we had come for -- and were fully expecting -- was to see these three guys beating the you-know-what out of each other!
Moe was extremely nice. After dinner that night at "La Scala", he escorted me over to his car, a parked station wagon, opened the back of it, and out spilled all these 8x10 glossies that were piled in back, took one out and autographed it to me. They were all current stills to promote their upcoming feature, "Snow White and The Three Stooges", which was, I believe, the only one of those later features of theirs I can recall seeing in a theatre. I guess at the time I thought it was "okay".
Jerry, I do recall now, said, that they were not pleasant to work with, at all. They were kind of miserable and mean, and made derogatory remarks about some of the male chorus dancers which didn't help endear them to anyone in the show, and might have helped to encourage the management to decide to cancel them. As I wasn't there, I can't say. This may have been during a very "down" period for them before they made their comeback. He just said that their act was kind of pathetic. I don't really think the Stooges were "Vegas" material at best. I remember my parents taking me to see George Burns and Carol Channing one night at The Riviera, THEY were "Vegas" material, not the 3 Stooges!
I'm afraid that like yourself, John, I was never really an "aficionado" of the gentlemen, and as I got older, less so. I still enjoy them, but in small amounts. Laurel & Hardy are more my style, and of course, you know of my great, undying affection for "Uncle Claude". By the way, I just got a "line" as recently as last evening from someone, on a pub down in Manhattan Beach which is frequented, I understand, by his grandson, Ron Fields. I'd love to meet him, if only to convey my respects and offer my heartfelt condolences on the passing 70-years ago now of Mrs. Nesselrode.
I do have a good excuse to contact my cousin Barbara thanks to you, and if I do, I will alert her as to your post.
Thanks again, and again, my very best, as always.
R.J.
RJ, I'd heard that Moe was pretty exacting about keeping the act in line while performing, so maybe some of that behavior was his impatience over inefficiency connected with putting on these shows ... that plus overrall second-rate circumstances of various clubs/dates they filled before the comeback got them back into features for Columbia.
Greg, I do have a few figures on the Columbia features:
"Around The World In A Daze" did $603,000 in domestic rentals, with $205,000 foreign. "The Outlaws Is Coming" did $598,000 in domestic rentals with $240,000 foreign.
The jig was up for Eve Kendall in today's mystery house banner.
Fortunately, ROT came to her rescue.
Re: Today's (Sunday, 3 May) "Name This House!" Challenge.
Well, John, I don't know if I can "name" the house, but I think I can identify it: It's the house occupied by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) overlooking Mt. Rushmore in Hitchcock's North by Northwest. Or am I way off...?
I agree with Jim Lane that its James Mason's house near Mt. Rushmore from North by Northwest. I had better know that since it is one of my favorites.
I believe that the house, located there in North Dakota, near Mt. Rushmore, was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.
That house in NORTH BY NORTHWEST doesn't actually exist. It was a matte painting. There are no Frank Lloyd Wright houses in North Dakota.Like I said you never got them direct. If you did you'd know about this.

True but you do know rips came in a plain white box without labels as well? Same source, same protocol is what I'm saying. I know who it comes from so I could throw it in a plastic bag and sell it. ...
Not going to argue over this but your buddy working in the pharma industry means nothing when these are black market gh. There are only two sellers of this gh SO either your buddy is Homerkahan or...
Your guy doesn't get them direct than. Nothing comes complete from the source. It's shipped separately.
That's the way they come. With no labels or boxes. Still may be same gh.
We get them straight from one if the two sources that sell these. We have been dealing with him since 2011.
These are the same grey tops pharmalogic carries btw.
That is correct.
Yes it's a great gh. I would say third best behind genos and humatrope.
This is true but the same provider of rips now sells grey tops which are just as good. Pharmalogics now carries the greys.
Rips are supposed to be back in 2-3 months.

If you get real primo, it is great. Most labs fake it though as it's pricey. It always has some pip as well, even pharm grade does.
This stuff is legit!!! My test subject has been trying it all week at about half the dropper. He has hard ons all day and new vascularity without even lifting! Definitely going to see if he has...
There are plenty of labs here that do lab work often to prove their legitimate.

I am no relation to this family.I had a great weekend, having two long rides in the bush (unfortunately, the last one ended up with my borrowing my horse and Arwen getting limp again, so I may not be out for a ride in while…) and catching up on some much needed sleep.
On Friday evening, Tabita came on and stayed the night, and we had a fabulous Saturday morning enjoying all the crazy animals at Ishtar’s Ark.
One of Tabita’s favourite happening right now is when we take Sahara for a tour around the house. As soon as she’s unleashed, she takes off in full speed-
…and within seconds, the Mugu Trio (the goats and the dog) appear from nowhere and join the fun.
So at the end of the day, we all had plenty of exercise running around the house and giving all the animals a good shower.
Now that we’re in the middle of the warm season, even Dennis comes asking for a shower.
The goats however were more concentrated on eating some of the horse fodder than cooling down…

Master Photographer? Yes, Kenny Rogers the country singer who is, undisputedly, one of the best country music artists to ever live, has “charted more than 120 hit singles across various music genres, topped the country and pop album charts for more than 200 individual weeks in the United States alone and has sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the highest-selling artists of all time and is a Professional Photographer. (Source Wikipedia)
When Imaging USA, the longest running national photographic convention in the US, first announced that Rogers was going to receive an Honorary Master of Photography degree it was almost unbelievable. How did he find the time to do?
On January 14th of this year Imaging USA 2014 hosted, Rogers "Places I've Been, Things I've Seen" Q&A and they also had some of his current works on display. Rogers photography was just as good as his hit songs. The creative and technical approaches he used reflected in the quality of his work. It was shocking to see just how good his images were, especially his portrait lighting, because lighting is one of the most difficult aspects of photography. But the one characteristic that set Rogers apart from the “smoking mirrors” was that he talked about making images as if he were singing a country song, you could tell he loved photography and that was inspiring.
During his Q&A Rogers told story about making a portrait for Michael Jackson and Bubbles and mentioned that Jackson was hesitant. But after session started Jackson wanted to keep going and they did, for hours. That surprised Rogers because he knew had found a connection with Jackson. The one common thread in all Master Photographers is they share a level of passion that is undeniable and contagious.
How did he do it? Rogers mentioned that learning was the key to his success. He always made time to create images on tour. Whether it was backstage photographing other artist, traveling on road or anytime he had a chance Rogers would venture out with his camera gear and make images.
When Imaging USA wrote on their site “Kenny brings a lot of passion for photography” it was no exaggeration.
The take away:
Anyone who can achieve the passion Rogers did in his images definitely deserves to be honored. His appearance at Imaging USA 2014 was a testament to a commitment to achieving the highest level of artistry you can without excuse.
Thank you Mr. Rogers, inspiring.New Book Shows How To Lower Blood Pressure Without Medication
Contact: Vanessa deGier, | vdegeir@bu.edu
Contact: Julianne LaMay, 617-638-8491 |
Boston, MA — A new diet book authored by a researcher at Boston University Medical Center (BUMC) helps to lower blood pressure without the use of medication. “The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet for Hypertension” teaches individuals with hypertension how to use a nutritious medication-free eating plan to reduce elevations in blood pressure as effectively as most hypertension medications.
“What makes the DASH diet successful is its emphasis on healthy foods,” said author and diet creator Thomas Moore, MD, assistant provost for research at BUMC, and professor and director of the Office of Clinical Research at BUMC. “Our research showed that no single food or nutrient is capable of decreasing blood pressure, but a diet rich in several vegetables, dairy foods, fruits and whole grains; and low in sugars and fat decreased blood pressure substantially in several individuals with hypertension.”
The first part of the book provides readers with information on how the diet works as well as advice on how to incorporate the diet plan into everyday life. The second half of the book provides 62 recipes created by a team of experienced nutritionists, practical informational resources and a form to help individuals track their new eating habits.
Together with Moore, a team of researchers studied the affects of the diet on a group of 459 individuals with high and high-normal blood pressure. Results showed that the DASH diet reduced blood pressure in hypertensive individuals by an average of 11 points in systolic pressure and 5.5 points in diastolic pressure. “The DASH diet is a healthy diet for all individuals, but never change your medications without the advice and agreement of your physician,” said Moore.
Moore is an expert in the area of nutrition and blood pressure. He is a fellow in the Council for High Blood Pressure Research of the American Heart Association (AHA) and was named a specialist in clinical hypertension by the American Society of Hypertension. Moore is the recipient of numerous awards including a Clinical Investigator Award from the National Institutes of Health and an Established Investigator Award from the AHA.Manufacturer: NZXT

Chipotle is the only brick-and-mortar store Jeremy would even consider owning in his portfolio, he says. With an average meal price of about $10, Chipotle is a machine that pumps through customers at its busy 1,300 stores, he says. It makes high-quality food and will continue to expand its operations in the fast-casual market.
Chipotle has a lot of room for growth, Austin says. It can expand both here in the U.S. and internationally. It also has yet to roll out its Asian-inspired Shophouse stores outside the Washington, D.C., market.
After trading at up to 50 times earnings last year, Chipotle has fallen to about 30 times earnings. That puts in in line with many competitors. Yet Chipotle has much more room for growth, Austin says.
Chipotle Mexican Grill has been a longtime pick of Motley Fool superinvestor David Garder and has soared 387.33% since he recommended the company in January 2007.

Both players missed the 1-1 draw at Plymouth last time out with minor injuries but return to contention at the Kassam Stadium, where Oxford need a win to stay in the race for a top-seven finish.
Doubts remain over striker James Constable, whose thigh strain will be assessed by the club before kick-off, and goalkeeper Ryan Clarke (rib). Wayne Brown is standing by to deputise for Clarke once again should he not make it.
Peter Leven is fit and available after a knee problem, but Tom Craddock (knee) and Alfie Potter (broken ankle) will not feature for the U's for the remainder of the campaign.
Meanwhile, Southend welcome Elliot Benyon back from suspension for this fixture.
The striker has completed a three-match ban for his dismissal at Bradford on Good Friday and will challenge for a place in Paul Sturrock's matchday 16.
Sturrock could keep faith with the same XI who clinched a superb 3-0 victory at home to Barnet last Friday night, although, despite still having an outside chance of automatic promotion, he may well be tempted to rotate one or two with the Shrimpers' play-off place already secure.
Long-term absentee Ryan Leonard is looking at making a comeback against Macclesfield on the final day of the season, while Christian Dailly (broken toe) and Blair Sturrock have also returned to training are set to be ready for possible play-off action.

I got this recipe through my grandmother-in-law. My wife loves it. To add some variety I usually pre-Kar the chicken the night before, marinated in lemon-lime or BBQ. Shedding the chicken works great after that. I add 2tps of garlic power, 1tps of ground pepper, 1 cup of grated cheddar into the soup/chicken mix. 2-3 tbls of grated Parmesan and then 1tps of Cayenne and a little less than 1tps of red pepper flakes. Add dashes of coriander and/or cumin depending in who you are serving to. I usually use store bought lower sodium tortilla chips. The overall taste is the same without the sodium bloating hangover. I've tried making the tortilla chips from scratch but it's a huge hassle, the overall sodium content doesn't change much and the casserole isn't as crunchy. I have diced tomatoes and jalapeño peppers and it tastes better than the Rotel with less sodium but not significantly less. I

October 25th, 2013 7:34 amSteinhardt’s February 2014 Education Policy Breakfast session, “The Benefits of Testing… and Its Consequences,” brought together members of the education community for a conversation on testing and teacher assessment.
Howard Wainer, distinguished research scientist at the National Board of Medical Examiners, and former principal research scientist at the Educational Testing Service, and George Noell, a professor of psychology at Louisiana State University, presented research and findings. Sharon Weinberg, professor of applied statistics and psychology at NYU Steinhardt, moderated the event.
In a presentation about using statistical measures to evaluate teachers and create educational policy, Wainer argued against evaluating teachers based on their students’ test scores as such a model could not present a comprehensive picture of the teacher-student relationship. He noted that missing data has a profound effect on research outcomes and that drawing conclusions about teachers from a limited data sample offers a distorted picture of teacher effectiveness.
Noell stressed the value of using all the data at hand to make informed policy decisions. He noted that educational policy decisions are frequently made by elected officials who create policy around their own educational experience. He urged policy makers to make decisions in the face of uncertainty using reliable and proven assessments.

Read an event recap — in tweets and pictures — on Storify.Cities us to address more accurately these questions. This paper presents an improvement of the Town Energy Balance (TEB) urban canopy model. Vegetation is directly included inside the canyon, allowing shadowing of grass by buildings, better representation of urban canopy form and, a priori, a more accurate simulation of canyon air microclimate. The surface exchanges over vegetation are modelled with the well-known Interaction Soil Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA) model that is integrated in the TEB's code architecture in order to account for interactions between natural and built-up covers. The design of the code makes possible to plug and use any vegetation scheme. Both versions of TEB are confronted to experimental data issued from a field campaign conducted in Israel in 2007. Two semi-enclosed courtyards arranged with bare soil or watered lawn were instrumented to evaluate the impact of landscaping strategies on microclimatic variables and evapotranspiration. For this case study, (i.e., the street-level meteorological variables) are better simulated with this new version. This opens opportunities to study with better accuracy the urban microclimate, down to the micro (or canyon) scale.Earthquake Details

AAA is doing its part to keep inebriated motorists off the roads on St. Patrick’s Day, whether or not they are members of the automobile club.
The company is offering free tows and rides home on Monday to drivers who have had too much to drink to get behind the wheel.
The Tipsy Tow program will be in effect from 6 p.m. on St. Patrick’s Day until 6 a.m. Tuesday. Anyone in need of a tow can call 800-222-4357.
A tow truck will pick up the driver, the car and any other passengers who will fit safely in the tow truck and take them to the driver’s home. The tow service is free up to 10 miles.

Atrios: "Boehlert brings us back to when the right wingers were obsessed with another "forged" memo. What he leaves out is that Howie Kurtz had invited Assrocket to come on his show to discuss this theory, though the Pope's death bumped him.

If a group of homeowners in a meeting decide that rather than mow their own lawns they would be happy to pay someone a reasonable amount to do it for them. The expectation is that the cost to the homeowner would be less than when each homeowner has to own and operate his own lawnmower.
If one of the homeowners who has a fine lawnmower and a couple of teen age boys volunteers to take on that responsibility, a business opportunity is thus is created. And permission to operated that business is given to the one homeowner along with some specifications as developed by the homeowners in general. Specifications like hours of operation of the lawnmower, the height of the grass, the frequency of the cutting etc. etc.
Question: Who owns the business. Who has the right to control the operation of the business? Who has the right to benefit financially from the operation of the business?

I think the best indicator of the success of a society would be a change in the average age of a person dying. It would be the most overall measure of success in the quest of the good life.
The question of whether or not government is the root cause of longevity is debatable but if you compare the longevity of the American people versus other societies and forms of government I think we come out ahead. Not that we always have the oldest people, but that we have the best average.
That's right, Mike. I guess if your home gets burglarized, you don't call the police department. If your house catches on fire, you just put it out yourself. The mail gets to your postbox by magic. The roads you drive on pave themselves. The food you buy at the supermarket and in restaurants is safe to eat because they just care about you that much. And I suppose that the US military doesn't count as "government", either.
Are you being serious? Really?

Taxation, by it's very nature, is redistribution of wealth. It is the way government pays for the programs and services it provides. We as a community create government and in its creation allow for taxation for programs, goods and services, we want government to provide.
Redistribution is necessary because we have created this covenent to have a government and to have that government do things. The only way to have government do the things we want and pay for it, as mentioned, is through taxation.
If you are opposed to redistribution, you are opposed to taxation. If you are opposed to taxation, then you don't want government. And if you don't want government, you don't want community. And if you don't want community, then . . .

Mike, you're a stitch! What would the world be without people like you? You're like a lighthouse, keeping rational people from crashing on your shore. You're a true believer if ever then was one, and as long as you believe what you want to believe, that's OK. It really doesn't matter to me. Like I said, it only reminds me that life is a continuum. There are many perspectives on any issue, ideology is oftentimes the path out of the light and into the swamp.
We need you. I need you. As long as you're out there writing your stuff, there will always be a need for a progressive mind in the discussion. It make people like myself think more critically and more carefully about the issues of the day and why our type of democratic government, albeit flawed, is necessary for a free people.
According to Redshirt the government can't do anything correctly so disband the military and stop governments from carrying out the death penalty.
My goodness why would you let the government kill people if it can't do it right.
RedShirt,
No question that the rights of employers need to be respected and that without it, capitalism fails. But we have been rethinking the exact parameters of those rights for 200 some years. Minor adjustments are likely okay. Major redoes lead us to ruin.
Although segregation and Jim Crow laws were in the (then) largely Democratic south, it was hardly liberal. It was liberal northerners who chipped in with blacks in the Civil Rights fight.
Mike Richards,
If govt. is the problem then it is deficient in all areas, true. It does NOTHING right so the military, police, etc. are all hapless, correct? Please. Govt. does some things well, others not. Business does some things well, others not.
As to what problems has govt. ever solved? Let me see . . . the rebuilding of Japan and Europe, the Hoover Dam, the National Parks (which drive lots of tourism), forest fire fighting, etc.
If you are looking for societal things, civil rights comes to mind. And poverty is certainly much different (less severe) in America than it was a century ago.
Many of the issues you cite are cultural/moral issues. They are not governmental.
Mike Richards, you make way too much sense to be posting out here in anonymous comment wasteland. You may want to find better places to spend your time and talents.

"Freedomingood. If you don't want to be poor, don't be!"
Don't be old. Don't be sick. Don't be handicapped. Don't be part of a minority group which is discriminated against. Don't be young with not family.
"Develop job skills and market them to the highest bider employer!"
A fine sentiment, but unrealistic for the disadvantaged and disabled. A woman working in Utah, on average, makes 55% of what a man makes. Perhaps "highest bider employer" opportunities are lacking in the state.
Quote "Freedomingood. If you don't want to be poor, don't be!"
I'm far from poor mountainman. I just happen to believe all those christian pricipals and vote accordingly. I'd rather build schools than blow up infrastructure in other countries so oil companies can get the oil.
The fact is that republicans spend more tax money and borrowed money than democrats but on the wrong things. So if you want to have the free will discussion start in your own side of the isle.
To "Ultrabob403" that is too easy. The business is owned by the 1 homeowner who is taking the responsibility. The other home owners are only stipulating conditions of the contract. That one homeowner controls his business. If he agrees to the stipulations, including price, then the job is for him to oversee.
In this case, the only person that most likely will benefit financially is the guy mowing the lawn. He could be charging the same or more than the other lawn services because of the restrictions put on him.Monday June 11, 2012 4:20 pm

CurrencyShares Singapore Dollar Trust (NYSEArca: FXSG) holds actual foreign currency deposits rather than derivative instruments, the firm said. The ETF will rise when the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the Singapore dollar.
FXSG charges an annual expense ratio of 0.40%.
“We’re pleased to continue to expand our CurrencyShares line-up, and believe that the short-term tactical and long-term strategic opportunities in Singapore make it attractive,” said William Belden, managing director and head of product development at Guggenheim Investments. “CurrencyShares Singapore Dollar Trust provides investors an opportunity to potentially capitalize from the Singapore economy and positive movement in the Singapore dollar.”
The CurrencyShares ETFs, which now include nine funds with Wednesday’s launch, held $1.9 billion of assets at the end.Thirteen undergraduate and graduate students are inducted
RENO, Nev. – Thirteen undergraduate and graduate students in the Spanish program of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures, as well as an Honorary Member from the faculty, were officially inducted into the Zeta Omicron Chapter of Sigma Delta Pi, the National Collegiate Hispanic Studies Honor Society, during a ceremony on Dec. 12 in the Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center.
Emma Crossman receives her induction cords for the Zeta Omicron Chapter of Sigma Delta Pi, the National Collegiate Hispanic Studies Honor Society from Casilde Isabelli. Crossman was one of eleven undergraduates, two graduates and one faculty member inducted to the honor society last week.
“The ceremony went really well,” Casilde Isabelli, the group’s faculty advisor, said. “The parents and family members of the students were in attendance. Many commented afterward how memorable the ceremony was.”
The ceremony was the first in many years, and Isabelli, along with Beatriz Robinson, who was inducted as an honorary member, hopes to induct new members every semester.
“The students who were inducted into the Honor Society for their excellence in Spanish are students who understand the importance of becoming bilingual graduates and experts in Spanish, and have therefore multiplied their cultural awareness and opportunities in life,” said Robinson.
The honor society serves as another example of the University’s growing diversity, recognizing the benefits of bilingual studies.
“Our Zeta Omicron Chapter for Sigma Delta Pi is of great importance to our University,” Robinson said. “Not only from the point of view of diversity, but from the point of view of excellence in academic studies as a whole. These days, every graduate entering the professional world needs to be at least highly proficient in a second language, if not bilingual. The difference in the opportunities that a bilingual graduate has is enormous, and our University offers its students opportunities to fight and get over the sad and dreadful disease of ‘monolingualism.’”
To become a member as an undergraduate, students needed to have completed three years of study of college-level Spanish including at least a course in Hispanic literature or culture and civilization at the junior level. Students needed a minimal grade point average of 3.0 in all Spanish courses taken and have a 3.2 cumulative GPA. Graduate students must have successfully completed two graduate courses in Spanish.
“It was a privilege to receive this honor at the same time with some of my own fabulous students,” Robinson said. “It was awesome for me to share such an important moment with my colleagues and students.”

To make RFID more popular, there is a need to make them cheaper; a team of major technology companies is confident that the cost will be reduced once the tags can be printed because electrically conductive and semiconducting plastics can be used in high-volume printing processes
What with the Pentagon, Wal-Mart, and other large organizations requiring their suppliers to tag their products with RFID tags, it appeared for a while that the technology would soon permeate every aspect of the market. RFID technology has been adopted by more and more organizations, but the pace has been much slower than anticipated. Some large European companies want to do something about it. A consortium of major European companies has started a three-year, £11 million semiconducting plastics can be used in high-volume printing processes.
PolyIC has already unveiled PolyID, a polymer tag made from a plastic semiconductor called polythiophene. It is a passive tag that powers up when exposed to a 13.56 M. It will not be easy to create a plastic chip that works as well as a silicon one. For one thing PolyIC managing director Wolfgang Mildner said it means adding many more transistors. Also, while the PolyID contains hundreds, its silicon competitor can contain roughly 12,000. The company would have to miniaturize the transistors on its tags down to micrometers, and Mildner said this could only be achieved with a better semiconductor material. PolyIC is currently working with BASF and Siemens to develop such a material as part of the MaDrix project. Companies such as Philips are also hoping to commercialize a large-bit printable plastic RFID tag, but Mildner is quick to point out that his company was the first to demonstrate a 13.56 MHz — one of the standard RFID frequencies — tag based on polymer materials in 2005.
The next challenge will be to increase frequency performance. Researchers have yet to develop a plastic chip that operates at the ultra-high-frequency of 860 MHz to 960 MHz, which would increase signalling range and could, for example, detect goods leaving a warehouse. The frequency performance will depend on “mobility,” programs in the United States million in the exercise and each silicon chip-based tag cost between 15p and 25p. A cheaper price could allow these projects to be expanded for commercial use. “With the pharmaceutical industry, the main concerns do not just have to do with the cost of production, but also the safety for the users of the product,” said Mildner. 2015 David Rio San Francisco

Background
The policy of the diminution of the social isolation of the disabled is the main objective of the strategy of the EU new policy concerning the disabled. Lithuanian society faces this objective as well. For this reason, this study aiming at providing the theoretical basis for and predicting the possible psycho-social environment in an integrated education system, as well as at the evaluation of the reasons for the formation of a positive approach to the disabled, is especially relevant, since it creates the prerequisites for the optimisation of the process of the integration of disabled schoolchildren into the general system of education.
Method
The sample of the study consisted of 2471 children from the same schools: not integrated (1958), integrated (126) and special schools (382). Empirical methods: questionnaire poll, comparative analysis. The statistical analysis was carried out using SAS.
Results
Our study showed that the majority of schoolchildren without disabilities and disabled schoolchildren have positive intentions for interpersonal interactions (>82%) and positive emotions (>69%) independently of the discrepant character of interpersonal contacts, different conditions of education and family life, and despite of low level of knowledge.
Conclusion
The results of the study confirmed positive intentions for interpersonal.
Background
It is thought that socialization is most successful in societies with simple division of labor and minimal distribution of knowledge [1]. Each member of the society knows who he/she is and who the others are. An individual becomes the member of the society when he/she realizes that he/she is living in the same world as people around him/her. An individual has to begin adjusting the motives of his/her behaviour to other society members, and begins constantly identifying him/herself and the others. However, there is a question of whether the individual agrees with his/her allocated position and role in the society [2].
The ideology of the individual medical approach to the disabled that is predominant in Lithuania contradicts the EU culture of socio-educational approach to the disabled, and causes legal policy contradictions between the healthcare system that promotes the stagnant rehabilitation approach to the disabled, and the educational system that has adopted the progressive educational approach [3].
Social interaction is unequivocally important to an individual. According to Lemme, social relationships must be evaluated in the wide social and historical context. They not only provide positive emotions, stimulate our self-awareness, and satisfy our cognitive needs, but can also result in emotional risk. Social relationships, health, and mortality are closely interrelated. Social isolation results in the deterioration of health, and poor health limits social contacts [4,5].
Our respondents learned and lived in specialized educational establishments, separately from their families. Their socialization took place under the predomination of external control that stimulates the child's obedience and values collective communication. Lithuanian scientists [6-9] also presented similar conclusions in their writings stating that children's separation from their families, and education in specialized educational establishments impedes the accomplishment of educational goals (one of the main goals of comprehensive education is the development of an independent personality capable of responsibly creating his/her life). In a specialized school, children create a distorted worldview, and therefore they wander away from the real life. In addition to that, the society thus alienates itself from the disabled as well [9].
The aim of our study was to evaluate the attitudes of disabled schoolchildren and their peers without disability towards each other and towards the integration of the disabled in the education system.
Methods
The study was performed during 1999–2003. The research was conducted in 1999–2003. The permission of the Committee of Ethics has not been received as the Law of Biomedical Research was adopted only on January 1, 2001. The authors of the study got approval for their work in the Special Education Sector from the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Lithuania. The participants of the study were schoolchildren aged 9–12, and 13 years. The oral consent was obtained from every participant of the study. The criterion of moral development played a crucial role in selecting the age of schoolchildren. Our interest focused on the early adolescence, when the morality of social rules is established, and adolescence, when a teenager follows the principles of his/her indisputable rights and personal ethics [6,9]. The pilot study was performed in the school of the integrated type, where 150 respondents – schoolchildren – were interviewed. Later on the same study was repeated in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Prienai schools. Comprehensive schools in Vilnius were chosen at random, whereas institutions of special education in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Prienai were selected according to the disability form, vision, hearing, motion or combined. The research was conducted anonymously, and the respondents filled the questionnaire independently. Of 2700 questionnaires distributed among schoolchildren, 91.6 percent were filled and handed back. The studied sample was represented by 2471 respondents – groups of schoolchildren from integrated and non-integrated comprehensive schools as well as from schools with special education. The homogeneity of the respondents was determined by the taught subject, and the homogeneity of schoolchildren – by their age and sex. In specialized schools, the type of disability of schoolchildren determined the heterogeneity of the groups.
Simple methods were applied in the research. According to Sultive and Ulrich [10], when dealing with the integration problems of the disabled, the applied statistical methods should be as simple as possible. Moreover, acquired statistical data are characteristic only of the participants of the study.
The empirical methods applied were questionnaire poll and comparative analysis.
Statistical data analysis was performed when applying the statistical methods. To compare the groups, Wilcoxon's Two-Sample Test was chosen. Spearman's correlation coefficient (r) was applied in the analysis of the correlative sample data relations. The significance level p < 0.05 was chosen for the verification of statistical hypotheses. In order to determine the reliability of the questionnaire data, Cronbach's alpha data reliability procedure was used (for schoolchildren without disabilities, α = 0.73 – reliable, and for schoolchildren with disabilities, α = 0.64 – reliable).
With a view to investigate the multidimensional attitude of the respondents towards each other as well as their attitude towards the integration process in the area of education, two types of authentic questionnaires were used for schoolchildren with and without disabilities. The questionnaire was composed of questions like Has anybody talked or explained to you about the disabled people? followed by fixed-choice answers: 1. Never, 2. Yes, sometimes, 3. Frequently. The answers were evaluated 1 to 3 points based on Ternary scale [Additional file 9,10]. The pilot study was performed among all age groups of the integrated school type. There were no difficulties encountered while filling the questionnaires. The reliability of the questionnaires was satisfactory.
A questionnaire for schoolchildren without disabilities was composed of the following components: a behavioural component of attitude (a desire to communicate with the disabled schoolmates occasionally, during spare time, and at school, and readiness to help them in a conflict situation or in daily living needs), a sensual component, and the index of knowledge (the level of knowledge and the need for knowledge).
A questionnaire for the schoolchildren with disabilities was composed of the following components: the relation to the schoolmates without disabilities (a desire to relate to them separately, during spare time, at school, to communicate at home, or in a conflict situation), the relation to other disabled (interpersonal communication, relation, and self-expression), sensual components of the attitude of the schoolchildren with disabilities towards their schoolmates with and without disabilities (emotions towards each other, self-worth and self-image of the disabled), and the index of the knowledge of the schoolchildren with disabilities (the level of knowledge and the need for knowledge).
According to Berger and Luckmann [1], the reality during the initial state of the child's socialization is perceived as inevitable. During this stage, internalization is based on emotions for as long as the individual is operating in the everyday world. However, when the borders of this world widen, marginal situations of human experience start to threaten the individual's internalization process, and this period of socialization becomes an unnatural one. For this reason we think that it is important to clarify a person's emotional attitude towards surrounding people in the aspects of these marginal situations of a child's experience.
Results
The attitudes of schoolchildren with and without disabilities towards reciprocal feelings were evaluated on the basis of the results of the investigation of the emotional components of the attitude of schoolchildren without disabilities towards the disabled ones (HSAD), and the attitude of schoolchildren with disabilities towards their peers without disabilities (DSAH-1) (see Figure 1). The obtained findings showed that the absolute majority (ca. 70 percent) of respondents experienced positive reciprocal feelings irrespectively of whether schoolchildren without disabilities were learning at an integrated or a non-integrated comprehensive school (p > 0.05). Only a small proportion of the respondents expressed negative feelings towards each other.

and non-integrated comprehensive schools) and schoolchildren with disabilities (specialized

negative feelings) components of reciprocal attitudes (HSAD, DSAH>1) in relation to the type of the school.
The investigation of each component and indices of the disabled respondents' attitude with relation to age, sex, and the type of disability showed that schoolchildren with disabilities expressed much more positive feelings with respect to schoolchildren without disabilities than to the disabled ones. The analysis of the data on the relationship between the indices of the emotional components of the attitudes of schoolchildren with disabilities towards their peers without disabilities and towards disabled schoolchildren, and the type of disability [see Figure 2], age, and sex [see Figure 3] showed that in respondents with all the studied types of disability, the index of the emotions towards schoolchildren without disabilities (EMX-1) was reliably higher than the index of emotions experienced with respect to the disabled ones (EMX-2). The total emotion index with respect to the schoolchildren without disabilities was rather high (2.56 out of 3 pts.) with respect to either the type of disability, sex, or age, whereas the index of emotions experienced towards the disabled ones reached only 2.22 points.
Figure 2. The emotion indices of schoolchildren with disabilities by the type of disability. The relationship between disabled schoolchildren's indices of emotions experienced
towards their peers with and without disabilities, and the type of disability (visual,
auditory, movement, combined).
Similar results were obtained having distributed the respondents with disabilities according to age and sex [see Figure 3]. In schoolchildren with disabilities, the index of emotions experienced towards their peers without disabilities (EMX-1) was reliably (p < 0.05) higher, compared to the index of emotions experienced towards the disabled peers (EMX-2). The total age- and sex-adjusted index of emotions experienced towards the disabled (position B) was reliably lower (p < 0.05), compared to the index of emotions experienced towards schoolchildren without disabilities, and amounted to 2.21 out of 3 points.
In order to determine why the emotions of schoolchildren with disabilities towards their disabled peers were less positive than those experienced towards schoolchildren without disabilities, we investigated the relationship of the EMX-2 indices with the type of disability [see Figure 4]. The obtained findings showed that schoolchildren with all the studied types of disability did not experience joy or fear when seeing their peers with disabilities (positions D and B). However, schoolchildren with auditory disorders manifested reliably greater sympathy and compassion towards their disabled peers (positions S, and G), compared to schoolchildren with other types of disability.
Having distributed the schoolchildren with disabilities into age groups according to sex and the type of disability, we noticed that older girls with movement disability manifested the highest levels of disability-related anxiety [see Figure 5], and their SX was reliably lower in all the studied groups (p < 0.05) according to age, sex, and the type of disability. Meanwhile, the SX of younger boys with combined, auditory, or movement disability was reliably (p < 0.05) more positive, compared to that among older girls or boys (positions J, K, and Komb.). According to our findings, the SX of respondents with vision disability was not dependent on either age, sex, or the type of disability (position R).
The relationship of the disabled respondents' self-worth index (SX) of the emotional component of attitudes with respect to their disability, and the respondents' age and sex is presented in [see Figure 6]. According to our findings, SX indices reliably (p < 0.05) decreased with age (positions b, c, and d), whereas the respondents' sex did not have any influence on them.

sadness because of the disability, the feeling of the surrounding people's love, the
feeling of worth) with their age and sex (girls, boys).
In order to clarify the disabled schoolchildren's evaluation of their possibilities for socialization, we investigated and evaluated the relationship between their self-awareness index (SKX) and their age, sex, and the type of disability [see Figure 7]. The obtained findings showed that total indices (B-1, B-2) did not depend on age, sex, or the type of disability. However, the analysis of these findings in different aspects of age and sex groups and the types of disability showed that SKX in younger boys with movement disability were reliably (p < 0.05) higher, compared to those in their peers with other types of disability, and younger girls with combined and auditory disability especially carefully evaluated their possibilities (positions Komb., and K). The generalization of these findings showed that the total SKX in all groups of respondents was high (2.5 out of 3 points), and tended to increase with age.

the type of disability. The relationship between the self-awareness component (SKX) of disabled schoolchildren's
feelings towards their disabled peers, and their age, sex (girls, boys), and the type

The presented data [see Figure 8] show that nearly all the disabled participants of the study, independently of their age and sex, did not tend to segregate themselves from the members of the society without disabilities (position N), and this indicator was higher (p < 0.05) than other indicators of the self-awareness index (positions G, S, and P). In the group of older respondents, the independence indicator was reliably higher (p < 0.001) than that in the younger respondents (position S). Thus, the obtained data showed that the social identity of schoolchildren with disabilities remained high irrespectively of age. Their independence tended to increase with age irrespectively of sex.

Discussion
Significant attention in our study was paid to the emotions of schoolchildren with and without disability. Models of disabilities analysed in scientific literature differ in their approaches to the nature of the phenomenon of disability and the causes of its development, as well as in the possibilities, ways, and means for the integration of the disabled into the society.
It could have been expected that the attitudes of schoolchildren without disabilities towards their disabled peers in the integrated and the non-integrated comprehensive schools would differ [11]. However, the findings of our study contradicted the contact theory. Scientists who investigated the attitude of schoolchildren with disabilities towards the integration issues stated that the contact theory could only be proven philosophically [12].
Other researchers [13] also noticed that the disabled experience positive emotions when relating to people without disabilities. We think that the fact that schoolchildren with disabilities experienced significantly more positive emotions towards their pears without disabilities than towards other children with disabilities, had a positive influence on their psychological and physical health, and should facilitate their successful integration into comprehensive schools.
We think that it is important that our respondents did not feel fear in relation to each other, and felt safe within their social group [14]. However, sympathy for the disabled was manifested only by schoolchildren with auditory disability.
We determined close relationships between the self-awareness index and the feelings of fear and sympathy, and between the feelings of joy and sympathy and the self-esteem index. This allows for stating that the disabled, being indifferent towards the members of their social group, cannot fully understand themselves and their aspirations. We tend to think that our respondents are oriented towards socialization through suppression.
The suppressive socialization model states that socialization in a disintegrated environment emphasizes obedience, respect for the authority, and external control. During communication, a child is somewhat looked down upon, there is a tendency to command, frequently choosing statements that suppress the child's willingness to answer them. The fact that children with auditory disability exhibited reliably more positive feelings of sympathy and compassion, confirms the predomination of this model in special education establishments.
It is highly important for the learning youth during their maturation period to discover and internalize their identity on the basis of humanistic and global cultural values, the principles of democracy, and universally accepted human rights and freedoms.
The results of our study corroborate the predominant opinion that at present in Lithuania it is still too early to speak about clearly defined state policy with respect to the school-related socialization of the disabled. For this reason we think that disabled children with auditory disability and speaking the state language, whose education has been segregated, should be educated in the integrated way, i.e. together with schoolchildren without physical disabilities, so that the society does not devaluate disabled schoolchildren's capacities.
Conclusion
The majority of disabled schoolchildren from special schools highly evaluated the indicators of self-esteem and self-concept of the evaluative and behavioural components (from 2.57 to 2.8 out of possible 3.0 pts.) irrespective of their age and sex, which could be considered as a favourable psychological precondition for the development of equal relations in the integrated educational environment.
The level of the self-realization of the disabled increased with their age (p < 0.05), whereas their self-esteem decreased (p < 0.05), and their self-concept remained stable.
Children with vision and movement impairments expressed higher levels of self-realization (p < 0.05) compared to children with hearing and combined disabilities.

Bayou L'OurThe DC State Fair is an agricultural, culinary, and artistic showcase of the District. Our main event will take place this fall on September 12, 2015 at Old City Farm and Guild, with a full day of competitions and other fun and educational activities for all ages. You can join us for other events throughout the year, as well.
How did this come about? DC is home to gardeners, cooks, bakers, photographers, artists–and yet we didn’t have a state fair to celebrate the home-grown talents of the District. In 2010, that all changed: The first-ever DC State Fair was held on August 28 of that year at the Columbia Heights Day festival. In following years, the Fair later was held at the Barracks Row Fall Festival. And in 2014, it was held at Old City Farm and Guild on September 21. See photos from last year’s Fair.
DC State Fair is returning this year for another celebration of DC community talent! Sign up to get the latest news, contest rules, and volunteer opportunities.
DC State Fair is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization.

(updated February 2014)Negotiating Home Inspection Repairs
You and your Buyer’s Agent will decide what repairs to ask the seller to make. Or, you can ask the seller to give you a dollar amount credit instead of making repairs. Whether the seller will do either of these things depends on who the seller is and their level of motivation.
Negotiating repairs can be harder than offer price since both buyer & seller feel they’ve already given as much as they can.
If the home is owned by a normal seller, you’re more likely to get them to agree to some repairs. If the seller is a bank or a “short sale,” the likelihood of getting repairs paid for is very low. Banks generally won’t pay for obvious things like cosmetic repairs, broken windows, or most anything you can easily see by walking around the property. However, if major repairs such as a dead furnace or leaking roof (that looked fine prior to inspection) are discovered, they are more likely to pay for these to be repaired or replaced.
Getting a credit instead of repairs completed can be risky because repair costs may end up higher than estimated!
The thing to remember is that you can ask for anything you want. Everything in real estate is negotiable. The answer may be “No”, but you can ask.
A good rule of thumb is to ask a seller to do repairs that would require hiring a professional, and not asking for repairs that you can do yourself. Include photos and a description of the the problem areas (from your inspection report) to support your requests. Also, be sure to tell the seller what repairs you are not asking for so they see you’re being reasonable and not expecting a brand new house (unless of course it is a brand new house!)
The seller is not required to do any repairs, but you have the right to cancel the sale if they refuse.

Hobart’s $75 million Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) had been on our radar for some time, and my partner and I were not ignorant of its frankly dubious fixations – death and sex. The good, bad and ugly of owner David Walsh’s “subversive adult Disneyland” unfurls over three dimly-lit subterranean levels with visitors relying only on a gallery-supplied iPod and their own moral compass for guidance.
Current exhibitions include a plaster cast of the remains of a suicide bomber, a horse on a meat hook, a self-administering suicide machine, bestiality, a full-frontal transgender nude, anal lipstick kisses and a wall of 150 delicate porcelain vulvas.
In short, hardly the place for someone with a pacemaker let alone two small children. But with no Plan B (read: babysitter) in place, the children were coming with us and that was that. We’d deal with the vexed issue of innocence lost at a later date.
Upon entry I half expect some responsible adult to pull us aside and say, “What the hell do think you’re doing?” Instead, the attendant happily takes our money, and shows us via a map the areas we should perhaps avoid taking the kids to (this should be easy as most of the more disturbing displays are behind floor-to-ceiling red velvet curtains).
We pass the vulvas (which at my eye level literally go over our kids’ heads), catch the two-year-old just before he makes a grab for “The Bowl with Fish and Sharp Knife” (my words) and marvel at the strobed stop-gap animation inside Gregory Barsamian’s giant metal head.
The longer I spend at MONA the more I’m convinced that Walsh, a father of two and something of a former enfant terrible himself, designed the gallery (at least partially) with kids in mind. There’s the theatre, of course, and it’s not all sex and death. Much of the collection is simply playful.
“Look, there’s Lightening McQueen,” our eldest points excitedly at Erwin Wurm’s hilariously unambiguous “Fat Car”. “But what happened to him?”
We do falter the once, during Delvoye’s “tattooed-pig” exhibition. Stretched pig skins line the walls, while playing in an adjoining room is a video of the pigs—pre-tanned and very much alive. The juxtapositioning of life and death leaves the four-year-old bewildered and us pathetically tongue-tied.
We’re saved by the belch. Next door, a Cloaca, ostensibly glass cylinders, metal casing and rubber tubing, is busily digesting day-old café fare. Another sits oddly serene after a job well done. My kids hold their noses giggling madly; shifting readily from disgust to delight and back again.
Back in Melbourne, our decision to take the kids to MONA receives, at best, a muted response. While we remain comfortably numb to criticism, it does give us cause to reflect on how MONA might have impacted our four-year-old. Weeks later, we get our answer.
My partner is collecting him from childcare when he announces, “Dad, I forgot to tell Euan about the water that falls from the sky and makes all those words.”
It takes him a moment to realise our son is talking about a MONA exhibition, bit.fall, a waterfall of words taken from daily Google searches. It’s a curious choice as he’s yet to fully grasp the alphabet, let alone reading.
“Could he be responding to the work on some intuitive, conceptual level?” my partner asks me later that evening. I admit it does give me pause. The room fills with possibility. “Then again,” he adds, “he told everyone about the Cloaca.”

The figures in the poster represent four cultures that were linked to the wild horses of the American West: the Spanish conquistadors; Native American Plains Indians; troopers of the 9th Cavalry regiment, "Buffalo Soldiers"; and modern day Anglo-American wranglers. The poster depicts the different breeds and basic types of coloration found among wild horses: (1) Kiger, (2) gray, (3) sorrel, (4) palomino, (5) bay, (6) pinto pony, (7) palomino, (8) buckskin, (9) sorrel, (10) sorrel, (11) black, (12) bay, (13) gray, (14) black, (15) buckskin, (16) bay, (17) bay, (18) pinto, (19) white (not albino), (20) Appaloosa. Two types of spring and summer forage are depicted on the poster: western wheatgrass (21) and bluebunch wheatgrass (22). During the winter months when the snow becomes too deep, horses are unable to push it aside to uncover grass. As a result, they will eat shrubs such as bitterbrush, winterfat, and four-wing saltbush for their high protein content. None of these is illustrated. Sagebrush (23) is shown but is not forage for horses.Nineteen eurozone creditors held a meeting in Latvia on Friday to demand the completion of the economic reform program agreed to by Greece necessary to avoiding a Grecian default or exit from the euro.

The green is algae, the froth is from that and yes it is safe to use on plants, just don't drink it. Simple in a way, if the water smells ok, or has no scent then it is usable.
It is only that our Hellebores are covered in these tiny white skins and the really do look like white fly, but aphid skin is what they are.
Looks like the weed Euphorbia, Caper Spurge.
That is normal behaviour for most Alliums. It makes showing them quite difficult as you either have to remove all the old leaves or, trim the sear ends of to look like the leaves are still whole.
If the stem comes away at the base then that is fairly normal, once the plant flowers the stem is only barely attached to the bulb. If snapped off up the stem then blame molluscs. They have a habit, in this garden at least, of eating haf way through the stem.
Are you sure they are not the dried skins of thr aphids? They look awfully like small white flies.
Mustelids are mammals that belong to the weasel family. Mustelids include 65 species (and 25 genera) of weasels, badgers, ferrets, fishers, grisons, martens, and such like..
Otter? or even Mink. We have had mink in the garden and they are the worst possible thing. They dug under and into our Quail run and killed them all, without even eating more than one or two.
On the point of 'greenwaste' We have a thing we call the non-compost heap. This is where all the things like dandelion roots, couch, dock etc go. It is covered up so that no water can get to it and it has been left for 3 yeras now. I have opened it up, in the past and the material is beautiful, well rotted and as far as I can tell, weed seed free. At least in the area where I have used it there are no extra dandelions etc.
Now, in theory, the heat produced in the green waste composting process, ought to be enough to kill off all seeds. I am not saying it does, but that is the theory.Best of the Bronx: Le Suite boutique fashion truck

Toyota will start Saturday’s Six Hours of Shanghai from the pole position as it searches for back-to-back victories in the FIA World Endurance Championship.
Nicolas Lapierre and Alex Wurz, winners last time out in the rain-shortened Fuji round, combined for a four-lap average of 1:48.013 in their No. 7 Toyota TS030 Hybrid in qualifying Friday in China.
The time was good enough to edge out the No. 1 Audi R18 e-tron quattro of Marcel Fassler and Benoit Treluyer by 0.089 seconds, despite a late improvement by Frenchman.
It marked the Japanese manufacturer’s second pole of the season, albeit under challenging track conditions teams have been faced with this weekend.
“The track is very aggressive on tires so we did the minimum laps,” Lapierre explained. “To be honest, today’s job was done by Alex. The two first laps were really quick and I just had to do two normal laps and not push too much, save the tires for the start tomorrow.
“In the end, we are very happy to be there. We have seen today that on the rubber, the car is very competitive. So we’re quite confident for the race.”
The No. 8 Toyota, qualified by Stephane Sarrazin and Sebastien Buemi, will roll off third overall, ahead of the championship-leading No. 2 Audi of Allan McNish, Tom Kristensen and Loic Duval, which qualified a disappointing fourth, more than 1 second off the pace.
In LMP2, G-Drive Racing by Delta-ADR scored its third class pole in the last four races, thanks to another impressive performance by Mike Conway and John Martin.
The duo recorded a 1:55.423 average, which was some seven-tenths clear of the competition. It came after a challenging start to the day, which saw their Oreca 03 Nissan have gearbox problems in the first practice session.
“We had been behind the eight-ball all day so it was a bit of a struggle,” Martin said. “But I think the team did a really good job to not lose their head. Everything was put back together.
“Qualifying went really well. The car is quick and looks OK over a long run as well but we’ll see tomorrow.”
The No. 24 OAK Racing Morgan-Nissan of Olivier Pla, Alex Brundle and David Heinemeier Hansson qualified second, ahead of the No. 41 Greaves Motorsport Zytek-Nissan in third.
The talk Friday at Shanghai has been lack of grip and tire degradation, a situation all 28 teams are facing for tomorrow’s penultimate round of the championship.
The ability to double stint tires could very well be a determining factor in the race’s outcome, according to a number of drivers.
“If you watch after your tires and have good management, you could do it, but it’s something I’m not comfortable with [yet],” said pole-sitter Wurz. “We’ll have to wait through the first stint and then make a decision on that.
Aston Martin Racing continued its impressive mark, with the British manufacturer taking class poles in both the GTE-Pro and GTE-Am categories.
Darren Turner and Stefan Mucke combined to put the No. 97 Aston Martin Vantage V8 on the top spot in GTE-Pro, thanks to a four-lap average of 2:04.370.
Their time was only 0.019 seconds quicker than the sister No. 99 Aston Martin, qualified by Bruno Senna and Richie Stanaway, who wound up second.
It marked the third pole of the season for the No. 97 entry of Turner and Mucke, who remain in a tight championship battle heading into tomorrow’s penultimate round of the season.
“It was good,” said Turner, whose two-lap average put the car on pole. “The car felt good and I hooked up two clean laps without making any mistakes and that’s what put us back up towards the time sheets.
“I’m really happy with the extra point [for winning pole]. We know the championship is very close. At the end of the year, that point can be very decisive.”
Turner and Mucke have now closed to 7.5 points of championship leaders Gianmaria Bruni and Giancarlo Fisichella, who qualified a dismal sixth.
Qualifying third in class was the No. 91 Porsche AG Team Manthey Porsche 911 RSR of Marc Lieb and Richard Lietz, followed by the quickest of the Ferraris, the No. 71 AF Corse entry of Toni Vilander and Kamui Kobayashi in fourth.
The GTE-Am class pole went to the No. 95 Aston Martin, qualified by Christoffer Nygaard and Nicki Thiim. The duo, who will be joined by Kristian Poulsen on Saturday, recorded a 2:05.903 average.
It was just 0.015 seconds quicker than the No. 61 AF Corse Ferrari of Matt Griffin and Marco Cioci, which was second. The AF Corse-run 8Star Ferrari of Rui Aguas and Davide Rigon completed the top-three in class.

“Yes, I am going to miss you both” Egg3 said looking at them and then they all looked at the empty cups in the egg tray.
“3 days ago we were all here, now…” Egg1 says and started crying without finishing his sentence.
“Don’t worry, we all were born for these humans and we have to serve them” Egg2 says and asked Egg1 to stop crying.
“And what about egg5” Egg3 said.
“He didn’t understand his duty and decided to commit suicide. So that morning he jumped from that man’s hand” Egg2 said and told both other eggs about their duty to serve the humans.
Two hours passed in all this conversation and the door of the refrigerator opened, a hand grabbed the egg tray and put down on the kitchen counter.
“It was nice meeting you guys” Egg 1 says and next second he was grabbed by the man in the kitchen and got killed. His smashed dead body was in the big transparent glass bowl and both Egg2 and Egg3 saw him and cried.
“Bye Mate!” Egg2 said as now it was his turn to serve this man. He got picked up by the man and got killed right in front of Egg3’s eyes.
“I don’t want to live without you guys. I can’t spend a day without you in this tray, Please God! Do something” Egg3 said and God heard him.
“Hey man, what’s up” a man said entering in the kitchen.
“Hey! Would you like to have omelet” The first man said and Egg3 waited for the answer of the other man.
“Yes sure” The other man said and a smile appeared on Egg3’s face.
The first man picked the Egg3 from the tray and Egg3 accepted his death but he was happy that he died with his friends.

This cake really satisfied my chocaholic sweet tooth! Athough I made a couple errors, it was a GREAT cake. First mistake, I used a dark chocolate mix w/pudding. I didn't notice this until it was too late. My pudding boxes were about 3 oz each (not 6 oz). The batter was very thick and needed about 60 min of baking time. Otherwise, I made it as written. It couldn't be better at satisfying the need for a chocolate fix. I dusted w/confex sugar and served warm with Cool Whip. Would be perfect for a bake sale. Loved it. Thanks for sharing!
This was extremely rich! It's for that once in a great while Chocolate fix. It took longer to bake and it's very important to grease the bundt pan well. I made a cream cheese chocolate frosting and servings were smaller to cut back on the calories a bit since it was rich enough to enjoy without ODing on chocolate goodness:)
have you taken a gander at the calorie content of a single serving - it is more than a whole meal should be... now that is decadent!

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service together with U.S. Sen. David Vitter, U.S. Rep. John Fleming, former U.S. Rep. Jim McCrery, and the Red River Friends Group opened the Red River National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center in Bossier City today.
“The Red River Visitor Center is a place where the American public can go to learn about wildlife on the refuge and their habitat,” said Mark Musaus, the Service’s Southeast Deputy Regional Director. “It provides an accessible, welcoming entryway for people to connect with nature through hunting, fishing, hiking, and other wildlife-dependent recreational activities.”
The public is invited to attend an open house at the Visitor Center on Saturday, Jan. 14 from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. There will be nature-related activities for children, guided bird walks, and displays from the winners of the Art in Nature competition. In addition, Wildwood Dean, outdoorsman and author, will speak at 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Visitors can access the facility from the western end of Sunflower Road. Later this fall, it will be accessible from the extension of the Teague Parkway.
Established in 2000, the refuge is comprised of 13,000 acres located in the Red River Valley. To date, more than 5,000 acres of former farmland has been converted to bottomland hardwood forest, its historic condition. The forest is improving water quality in the Red River Valley and providing habitat for 44 species of mammals, including the white-tailed deer, raccoons, squirrels and bats, as well as about 200 species of neotropical birds. Additionally, the refuge supports numerous water and marsh birds along with more than 14 species of waterfowl, such as mallards, green-winged teal, gadwall and wood ducks.
“Congratulations are in order for the Red River National Wildlife Refuge staff, friends and contributors on the ribbon cutting for their new Visitor and Education Center. The Red River is a vital part of Northern Louisiana’s ecosystem, and the continued restoration of the wildlife habitats along its banks is integral not only for citizens of North Louisiana, but for the entire state,” said U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu. “Through the advent of this center, visitors to this refuge will now be able to gain a greater understanding of the Red River’s vital importance to Louisiana. I regret that I was not able to be at this momentous occasion, but like all who were in attendance, I share the enthusiasm for this wonderful achievement.”
The new $3.8 million facility will enhance awareness and connection to wildlife and wild places and is expected to generate an economic boost for the surrounding area.
"The opening of the Visitor and Education Center of the Red River National Wildlife Refuge is an exciting step in the development of the refuge,” said former U.S. Rep. Jim McCrery. “While the preservation of thousands of acres in northwest Louisiana is important for a number of reasons, this Center represents the hope that the refuge will contribute to our area's tourism and will serve as an important educational resource for students throughout our state."
The Visitor Center features exhibits that bring fragile features of the Red River National Wildlife Refuge into spaces that allow people to touch, hear, see and understand the natural beauty. The 9,000 square-foot facility was designed with green technology to maximize energy savings. It includes solar panels and was built using environmentally friendly natural materials. Volunteers from the Friends of Red River National Wildlife Refuge will staff the Visitor Center and a Nature Store.
“The beauty and wonder of the Red River National Wildlife Refuge has been known to a small group of nature enthusiasts for a few years now, but the opening of the Visitor Center brings a whole new dimension to the Refuge,” said Nancy Menasco, president of the Friends of Red River NWR. “Now the general public and untold numbers of students and tourists can get an overview of the distinct environment found here. They can start with the lessons taught by the wonderful exhibits and the special events offered here. Then they can proceed outdoors to the lake, river, trails and all the natural wonders that exist throughout the refuge.”
The Visitor Center is located at 150 Eagle Bend Point, south of Bossier City and the Jimmie Davis Bridge along the Red River. The Service is committed to providing access to the open house on Jan. 14 for all participants. Persons needing reasonable accommodations to participate in this event should contact Refuge Manager Pat Stinson at 318-742-1219 or pat_stinson@fws.gov. In order to allow sufficient time to process requests, please contact Stinson by close of business on Jan.‘I've got this thing I do to relax.,’ said Michael Czysz, speaking to Motorcyclist magazine, when they interviewed Czysz for their November issue this year.
About five years ago, Czysz was working on the C1-990, a 990cc MotoGP prototype, which ultimately didn’t get a chance to get off the ground given MotoGP’s move to 800cc machines in 2007. The move also happened to coincide with a gradual, but steady, build-up of interest in electric bikes and electric bike racing. And Czysz decided to change tracks and build an electric racebike – the E1pc. ‘The change to electric was more about inevitability than opportunity. I realized almost immediately that everything we were trying to accomplish with the C1 project, we could do better with an electric bike,’ says Czysz, in the Motorcyclist magazine interview.
And indeed, Motoczysz did do very well with their electric racebike, with the E1pc winning the 2010 TTXGP at the Isle of Man. The Motoczysz E1pc is an impressive motorcycle all right. It is fitted with a DC, brushless, oil-cooled electric motor from Remy, which is fed by a pack of five lithium-polymer batteries and which produces 125 horsepower and a constant 343Nm of torque. The chassis is made of carbonfibre and the suspension comprises of a fully adjustable Öhlins shock at the rear and Czysz’s proprietary ‘6X Flex’ fork at the front. The bike rides on magnesium wheels made by Marchesini and the top-notch race-spec Brembo brakes (with monobloc radial-mount callipers at the front) provide impressive stopping performance – important for a bike that weighs 238kg, that can hit a top speed that’s in excess of 260km/h, and the price for which is estimated to be more than US$250,000.
You want fast? The Motoczysz is fast. The battery-powered bike hit a top speed of 261.82km/h at the Bonneville Salt Flats in August this year...!
Spanish magazine Solomoto recently had the opportunity to test ride the E1pc, and here are some brief excerpts from what they have to say about this digital racer.
Visually, the E1Pc looks like a shark, with a genetic code that’s deeply rooted in racing. In the place where you’d normally find an engine, there’s the bike’s removable D1g1tal Dr1ve battery pack. You have to get used to switching it on. There’s no noise or vibration – just a green light on the digital instrumentation that tells you the bike is ready to go. Twist the throttle and the E1pc lunges forward like a compact 600cc supersports machine. The riding position is very sporty, with high footpegs and low bars. Just like a proper racebike, of course.
On the move, the E1pc’s power delivery is straightforward, clean and uninterrupted. Acceleration is similar to that of a 600cc supersports bike’s, and spinning at 16,000rpm, the E1pc’s electric motor makes a Star Wars-esque whistling noise that’s strangely pleasant. However, the bike’s weight – all of 238 kilos – makes it a bit awkward and saps the rider’s confidence at high speeds. The bike has tight, aggressive steering geometry, but the weight – most of which is due to the batteries – stops the E1pc from being very agile.
Electric propulsion has some undeniable advantages – it allows you to concentrate fully on your lines and lets you open the throttle while exiting corners, without the added complications of having to worry about shifting gears. Just open the throttle and go!
Michael Czysz is now working on the 2011 E1pc, which will be lighter and more powerful than the 2010 version, and will also have better software controlling the bike’s D1g1tal powertrain. As it exists now, the E1pc is a bit heavy, very expensive and as yet unapproved for street use. It’s also very quiet, smooth, does not require any maintenance, does not pollute and offers performance that’s actually very impressive.
Coming back to the Motorcyclist magazine interview, ‘The work I'm doing with this motorcycle might someday actually make the world a better place,’ says Michael Czysz. Hmm..., you know what, it just might!

I'm throwing myself a pity party.
I'm bummed, I'm pissed, I'm hurt.
I was hoping to be announcing "I'm pregnant!" by this point, but God had other plans (or so I need to believe).
This sucks. In January, when we got the news that hubs was leaving for Texas, we threw all TTA (Trying to Avoid) measures out the window.
BFN.
Then in February, Thad and I visited E in TX.
BFN
March went by without a visit, without any sex, and without a BFP.
And then came April. Oh dear Spring Break. You were perfect. My first ever OPKs came up super positive. We had sex. We had a lot of sex. We had so much sex I ended up with a UTI. (Eh, it was worth it.)
The timing was perfect. Perfect I tell you.
I felt it was God's plan.
I had good vibes. I had really good feelings about this cycle. I was convinced I was pregnant.
I dreamed of ways to tell the hubs, the family, and thought about a December 28th due date.
BUT I still didn't know if I was pregnant.
With my PCOS, I have a luteal phase (LP) of 10 days. So at 8 DPO, I started testing. (With Thad, I got a BFP at 11 DPO...granted it was so faint I had to wake the hubs by shoving a pee stick in his face.)
Day 8 - BFN.
Day 9 - BFN.
Day 10 - BFN and on and on it went.
But then something weird happened. Day 10 passed without a sign from AF.
This was abnormal. My cycle is religious. I ovulate, 10 days later the bitch shows her face.
Day 11, slight temp drop. Still above coverline. No sign of AF, hopes are wavering, but still high --- until 11 PM.
There it was. That little bit of light pink staring back into my face from that ever so soft piece of toilet paper. So light in fact, I convinced myself that it was implantation bleeding/cramping/dip in the chart. So light that overnight nothing happened.
To be extra safe today, I wore a tampon - after all, it was still there when I wiped this morning. (And Lord knows, I cannot risk getting blood all over my pants while teaching high school.)
Was it enough to fill the tampon? Uh, no.
But don't get too excited. Tonight....tonight we're bright red.
I'm defeated.
Fucking bitch.

Pity party for one. (TTC #2)
Labels: #2 , cycle , implantation bleeding , PCOS , TTC
I'm sorry! That really sucks! I have PCOS too, but I don't get periods or ovulate on my own. We had to conceive our son with the help of Clomid. We aren't TTC yet for number 2, but I'm expecting to have to do the same thing again.
I am so sorry! I have PCOS too- haven't reached the TTC phase of life yet, but I worry about it going poorly A LOT. Currently I wait for a period to arrive the way you're waiting for those faint lines. PCOS sucks the big one. SECSvsPCOS.blogspot.com
I hate that feeling of disappointment. When we were trying to get pregnant with our son I ended up having to do 3 rounds of provera and clomid because I don't get my periods regularly (after almost 8 months of trying without meds). We are starting to think about TTC #2 and I really don't want to take clomid again (it was a terrible hormonal rollar coaster for me...although I'm so thankful for it since it helped us conceive Carter). Anyways, hang in there!!
I've done fertility treatments, had 3 miscarriages, etc. I KNOW how you feel! I was diagnosed with PCOS and hypothyroidism and all the other crap. It took us 5 years to get pregnant with our daughter with one miscarriage beforehand(who is now 7) and then for 6 years with this pregnancy with 2 miscarriages in between (due in June/July 2012). We moved from Texas to Germany almost one year ago and had pretty much given up on the idea of having another baby and BAM. I randomly got pregnant. Here I am, now 28 weeks pregnant, and am still in shock about it.
Good luck to you! I hope it happens soon!
I'm sorry. :( That's such a sucky feeling when you're TTC. My cycle is almost always like that. Very slight temp drop, a teensy bit of spotting, a day of basically nothing, and then bam - major red flow. I hate it & wish the beotch would just show UP already. ((hugs))
I hear u... I feel ya! We miscarried in dec. I was so excited for #2 and at 10 weeks there was no heart beat to be found :( we had a d&c and have been TTC ever since and have had no such luck. I even convinced myself this last time that I wa preggers and then the dreaded wipe. Your heart just sinks and I just start crying as all hope goes out the window and my babies are getting farther and farther apart in age. I so badly wanted them 2 yrs apart and now we r creeping up on them being 3... Good luck next month. :) sending prayers ur way!
I'm really sorry sweetheart :(
Oh Libby dearest...been thinking of you so much! It sucks to get a BFN, but it REALLY sucks that your cycle had to tease you like that. BAD CYCLE! All in due time, God does have a plan for you :)
awh, i'm sending you a big hug. this will all work out when the timing is right in God's eyes. *hugs*
Awww, I'm so sorry. I've been there, and it SUCKS. I saw so many BFNs when TTC our daughter that I almost went crazy. But hang in there, when it does happen, I know you'll think "Yes, this really was the best time" Easier said than felt though!
I hope you'll soon be announcing a pregnancy, but if not, like someone else said, all in good time. I know it's hard to wait and wonder, but try to be patient.Book your room at Hotel Palma

A complimentary buffet breakfast is served each morning between 7 AM and 10:30 AM..PHILIPPI?- When Nikki Shriver steps onto the volleyball court tonight, it will be the last time the senior standout plays in front of her hometown crowd.
Shriver recently amassed her 1,000th career kill shot, but setting the benchmark for the Colts isn't her top priority - she wants to win a state championship.
"She's really fun to watch," coach Heather Halfin said. "Getting 1,000 kills was never her goal. It's never about her. It's always about the team. She wants to win a state championship. That would put the cherry on top for her."
The Inter-Mountain photo by Joey Kittle Philip Barbour’s Nikki Shriver (14) prepares to go up for a spike during a recent game. The senior standout is the only player in school history to record 1,000 kills.
Shriver reiterated - the state championship is what she is after. Being the only player in the school's history to get 1,000 kills just isn't enough.
"It would be amazing to win a state championship," Shriver said. "We've been to the tournament all four years and we've had the talent. But I'm more hungry to win, now.
"It's my last chance and it would be awesome to share that with my teammates and everyone who has supported us."
The four year starter has played both the front and back row this season. Last season, Shriver was named to the Class AA, all-state first team and All-Big 10 Conference first team. In 2011, she was second team all-state and All-Big 10 first team.
"She's a quiet leader," Halfin said. "You won't see anything more than a smile when she smashes it down in someone's face. She doesn't jump up and down and get all excited. She's very modest. She just does her thing and lets her play speak for itself."
Shriver downplayed the magnitude of her achievement, saying her teammates are really who deserve the credit because they set the ball for her to slam down. She said special recognition should also go to Morgan Stemler and Shelby Daugherty.
"I have such good players around me, that's what made it possible," Shriver said. "Coming into high school, I never dreamed I would accomplish anything like this."
According to Halfin, watching Shriver grow up and develop into the player she has become has been enjoyable.
"I've known her since she was a little girl," Halfin said. "I've watched her grow and get bigger and stronger. I almost feel like a parent, watching her grow up right before my eyes. I've very proud of what she has accomplished."
Aside from being a dominating force for the Colts, Shriver has also been instrumental in teaching solid volleyball skills to the underclassmen.
"She has been a big help teaching the younger girls," Halfin said. "I think she has given them what they need to fill her shoes."
The Colts (43-5-3) will participate in a quad match at 5:30 p.m. today against Tyler Consolidated, Morgantown and Buckhannon- Upshur.

Right now, there are three remaining Blockbuster stores in Dallas proper. That's down considerably from the gazillions that once crowned street corners during the heady days of VHS, before movies could be conveniently dispensed from a red box or instantaneously zapped onto your telephone, and that number could drop even further.
Dish Network, which bought the struggling rental chain in April 2011 announced today that it will be closing 300 locations and laying off 3,000 employees. That leaves about 500 outlets remaining in the United States.
Why? A Dish spokesman told the Los Angeles Times that the stores in question are performing poorly or are nearing the end of their leases. He refused to identify the stores marked for closure.
It might also have something to do with Blockbuster's failure to effectively compete with Netflix, Redbox and the like, though the spokesman insisted that Dish continues "to see value in the Blockbuster brand and we will continue to analyze store level profitability and -- as we have in the past -- close unprofitable stores."
That doesn't bode well for the 500 remainingGet on1's Perfect Effects 9.5 for FREE! (£48 value)

Brian Preski, Esq., Chairman of the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority (PRPA), is pleased to announce that PRPA recently concluded an agreement to acquire over 15 acres of waterfront property in the heart of Philadelphia’s port industrial district, property that will immediately be utilized for the construction of a new waterfront warehouse.
PRPA purchased the 15.59-acre parcel, encompassing land and water rights, from the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) for $3.9 million. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided funding for the purchase. PRPA is an independent agency of the Commonwealth.
“Several years ago, PRPA didn’t stand in the way of Walmart and other retail establishments that wanted a presence along the Delaware River,” said Chairman Preski. “We permitted those projects with the understanding that other significant waterfront lands would be put aside for maritime industrial use. The 15-plus acre facility we just acquired was part of that earlier agreement. DRPA acquired and banked the land on the Port of Philadelphia’s behalf at the time, and recently PRPA completed the final purchase of the land from DRPA. We now look forward to immediately developing this significant acreage to service the Port’s labor-intensive cargoes.”
The acreage in question, titled the “Pier 74 property” (though an actual pier hasn’t existed there in decades), is located along the Delaware River immediately south of the intersection of Delaware and Snyder Avenues. The Pier 74 property sits next to PRPA’s Forest Products Distribution Center at Piers 78/80. In mid-November, groundbreaking will commence on the property for a state-of-the-art, 200,000 square-foot warehouse specially designed for handling the Port’s growing forest products cargoes, specifically rolls of high-quality coated paper from Scandinavia, as well as rolls of newsprint. The new Pier 74 warehouse, which will cost approximately $12,000,000, will become part of PRPA’s Forest Products Distribution Center.
The Forest Products Distribution Center is operated by Penn Warehousing & Distribution Company, Inc., which has imported paper and forest products into the Port of Philadelphia for almost 30 years.
“This is an exciting time for the Port of Philadelphia and for the Delaware River,” said PRPA Executive Director James T. McDermott, Jr. “Agreements such as this one demonstrate a growing realization of the importance of maritime industrial activity among our governmental and civic leaders. This current agreement, which gives us land to construct what will be one of the largest warehouses ever built by PRPA in South Philadelphia, will allow us to service better than ever before the many shipping companies that regularly deliver forest products to the Port of Philadelphia. Forest Products are labor-intensive cargoes that deliver a big boost to our regional economy, and this new warehouse will allow us to handle more of these cargoes, and more efficiently. Just as importantly, the new, expanded facility will go a long way in helping us continue our mission to protect and increase the number of quality, family-sustaining jobs on the working waterfront.”
Both Teamsters and ILA longshoremen are employed at the Forest Products Distribution Center. The ILA is responsible for discharging cargo from forest products vessels and the Teamsters handle the cargo once it is inside the facility’s warehouses. Last year, close to 800,000 metric tons of forest products were handled at the forest products center, an amount expected to be surpassed by 2005 final cargo figures. With the completion of the new warehouse in early 2007, annual cargo levels at the facility are expected to jump to well beyond one million metric tons annually.
“We want to thank PRPA and the Rendell administration for their constant support of this initiative,” said John Brown, Jr., President of Penn Warehousing & Distribution Company, Inc. “The port was diligent through the often complicated process of acquiring the land from DRPA and theInside Out investigates property developers who

At the century's turn, when he was transitioning from club sensation to full-fledged recording artist, German DJ and producer Timo Maas spent much of his free time collecting wine. Thanks to his peripatetic lifestyle, which took him to world capitals and exotic locales on a regular basis, he was able to build an eclectic, world-class collection that's lovingly preserved in his Hannover home. But these days, he no longer devotes the hours he once might have to hunting down the perfect Pinot.
"The priorities in life changed," Maas says in a heavily inflected voice that sounds eerily like that of a certain Governator. "I became a father four months ago, and I've got a super-sweet daughter -- and I've been married for half a year, as well. Now I go to baby stores, not wine stores."
But just because the thirty-something Maas has gone from the world of candy pacifiers to the real things doesn't mean he's no longer interested in bringing his version of the dance gospel to a wider audience. With the help of his longtime creative partner, Martin Buttrich, he's just completed a new collection of original songs called Pictures, and when he's asked about the CD, which he's been tinkering with since 2002, he says, "For us, personally, it's a maasterpiece."
There's no telling if his delivery of this last word is a self-referential joke or an amusing fluke caused by his Germanic accent. Still, Maas appreciates the pun potential of his moniker -- he's put out two mix sets under the catch-all title Music for the Maases -- and he uses it to differentiate himself from generic deck masters around the globe. He hopes his forthcoming disc, which contains vocals by an intriguing cast led by Neneh Cherry, Placebo's Brian Molko and "Milkshake" maker Kelis, will continue that process. "We tried to do something that we feel is cool and that we think has a pop appeal, because we want to sell albums," he notes. "We invested so much money in the album that we, of course, want to get something back from it. We didn't spend two and a half years of our lives to put it in the cupboard and never look at it again."
Such comments are sure to irritate purists who think DJs obsessed with broadening their fan base betray the dance scene. While Maas concedes that defending his approach "is not a discussion that is really interesting to me," he does so anyhow. "Let's come back to the basics," he says. "As soon as you start releasing records on a label, it is a sellout already. Unless you're only making music for yourself, everything else is commercial. But when you've got a good song and that song is successful, that's a good thing, not a sellout, as long as you are happy with what you're doing -- and I am very happy. My sense of quality, my sense of coolness, is right there where it always was. Trust me, I'm not selling my ass."
Nevertheless, Maas has been around the block a time or two. He got into music through an older brother with artsy tastes before discovering the '80s version of big beat. By his early teens, he was already deejaying on a semi-regular basis, and he stuck with the trade through the early rave years before finally landing a marquee slot at the Tunnel, a major venue in Hamburg, circa the mid-'90s. His initial single, 1995's "The Final XS," led to a series of efforts under his name and others' throughout the remainder of the decade, but it wasn't until his reimagining of Azzido Da Bass's "Dooms Night" that he wound up on the remixers A-list. The track, which kicks off the initial Music for the Maases, made for Hope Recordings and issued in the States on the Kinetic imprint, still sounds great thanks to a moody opening that blends into spare, inventive trance rhythms that quicken heart rates on contact.
The double-disc Maases, which also features some effective solo joints and numbers from previous Maas projects, including Mad Dogs ("Better Make Room") and Orinoko ("Mama Konda"), established him as a mixer on the come, and celebs began seeking him out. Over the years, he's done dance-floor makeovers on ditties by Madonna ("Don't Tell Me"), Fatboy Slim ("Star 69") and even Tori Amos; he and Buttrich were nominated for a 2004 Grammy award in the "Best Remixed Recording (Non-Classical)" category for their variation on Amos's "Don't Make Me Come to Vegas."
Yet Maas wasn't satisfied with being merely a behind-the-scenes savior, and with 2002's Loud, he stepped into the spotlight. He describes the CD as "an artist album," and indeed, the focus is on actual songs, not just lethal grooves. Kelis -- whose Neptunes-penned "Young, Fresh n' New" (from the U.K.-only disc Wanderland) had previously received the Timo treatment -- croons lead on "Help Me," a mock sci-fi number that manages to be simultaneously seductive and sinister, while idiosyncratic soul man Finley Quaye hops aboard the evocative "Caravan." The disc sported its share of "Old School Vibes," as one cut was dubbed, but it also demonstrated that Maas was more than just an expert dial-twister.
Loud sold just under 200,000 copies worldwide -- a significant figure by dance standards, but too modest to turn the heads of American music-company honchos, who were souring on the idea that DJs could easily be transformed into pop stars. The industry's schizophrenia made life tough for some spinners, but Maas says he wasn't fazed. According to him, "It wasn't like we wanted to push anything or were trying to top anybody or anything like that. Martin and I were living more or less in a little cocoon, a little microcosm, just doing our thing and trying to realize our ideas in the most perfect possible way -- what was financially and technically possible for us."
Music for the Maases 2 came out in 2003, but its lineup of high-profile remixes for the likes of Garbage, BT and Moby marked it as more of a stopgap than a genuine sequel to Loud. Meanwhile, Maas and Buttrich were assembling new material and recording much of it with live musicians -- even a ten-piece string section. In addition, they put in calls to performers with whom they'd worked in the past, but didn't always receive the answers they wanted to hear. "We wrote something for Tori Amos, because we thought we had a personal connection, and we talked with her a couple of times when we did the remix," he says. "But we sent it to her, and she completely ignored us."
The partners had better luck with Kelis, even though she'd become an MTV favorite since Loud. "She came back to the old friendship, which is great," Maas points out. Her vocals wound up on a song called "For Your Ears," while the semi-reclusive Cherry (remembered for the '80s pop/hip-hop hybrid "Buffalo Stance") surfaced for the recording of "High Drama." As for Molko -- who got to know Maas when he remixed Placebo's "Special K," which concludes the second Maases -- he's at the forefront of three offerings. The most prominent of these is the lead single, "First Day," in which he and newcomer Jo Kate perform "perfect vocals on top of a really rocking, '80s-oriented breakbeat track," Maas says.
Elsewhere, he continues, "we tried to push the usual boundaries of dance music and electronic music in different directions -- in directions of rock, in directions of hip-hop, in all directions, really. We weren't happy how dance music was building in the last two or three years. We wanted to do something else." In his opinion, "There was a lack of a good dance album with crossover appeal without being cheesy. You might hear a song and think, ŒIt's not bad, it's pretty catchy, but there are those high-pitched vocals again, and that's kind of boring. They need a new idea.'"
Maas boosters in Europe can evaluate his concepts for themselves beginning in late June, when Hope Recordings expects to put out Pictures. The domestic-release schedule is less certain, because negotiations with U.S. labels and distributors are ongoing, but Maas thinks Americans will be able to hear the disc by summer's end -- and he plans to slip "First Day" and some other CD previews into his current DJ sets. Being on the road keeps him away from his wife and daughter in Germany, but they provide him with more of an incentive to keep going than a bottle of vino ever did. "Everything makes a bit more sense now than it did a few years ago," he says. "It's like I know what I'm doing all this stuff for. I'm working really hard, I'm traveling a lot, and I try to play for many people because it's for the future, and the future is my family."

We helped Phillips Distilling reshape their growing UV Vodka brand by encouraging consumers to be their authentic, fun self. The digital solution needed to be fun, transcend the product category, and be experienced wherever and whenever the audience wanted it to. Based on data-driven insights, we learned that nearly half of site vistors were on a mobile device. Using a mobile-first approach, we focused on the things that really mattered to the user. I created wireframes, information architecture documents, and a content strategy that effectively documented and communicated our vision. We also created two other products that created deep social engagement, more on those soon.

Periscope was going through a rebranding of their own. They wanted to be less Minnesota humble and instead live up to the global company they are. At the center of this was a new mission: do things people love. We redesigned the site to be more professional, simple, elegant, and cutting edge. The team conducted research to identify the business objectives and gather insight about our audiences. Based on data-driven insights, we learned what users are interested in and we balanced that with communicating our new mission. I created wireframes, IA documents, a content strategy, and collaborated tightly with the designer and developer to create something amazing.

Red Robin had been an edgy brand with an irreverent vibe but over the years, they lost their swagger. They came to us to help them get it back, we renewed the focus on the gourmet burgers people love. We refreshed the brand and updated their site. Along with bringing the site's design up to date, Red Robin asked us to make sure their site was easy as possible to use for their customers. I conducted user tests with the old site to identify problem areas. Customers seeked big pictures of the food, menu pricing, and a painless way to find their closest Red Robin location. We used that insight to fuel our design approach in making Red Robin's site truely enjoyable to use.

This is not due to any road safety measures put in by the local government there but is in fact due to the confiscation of 8,600 bicycles by traffic police for offences.
Dubai police figures reveal that only one person has died in a cycling accident in the first nine months of this year, compared with seven in the same period last year with the total number of accidents dropping by about a third.
Speed limit
Local police have acted to stop cyclists riding on roads with a law in the Emirate stating that cyclists can’t cycle on main roads where there is speed limit of more than 80kph and inner roads where there is a limit above 60kph.
Cycling in Dubai is seen as being on an upward curve, though many riders are poorer construction workers who see a bike as a cheaper option to local transport and use main roads to get to work quicker.

Works like a champ! Thanks for the great technique. The corned beef sliced perfectly.
Made this yesterday...wasn't exactly what I hoped for. Slicing Corned Beef has never been an a problem with me, but cooking it in a crockpot has been. SOMEHOW the taste loses something, when cooked in a crockpot! Doubt if I'd make this again...sorry.
This method does work very well and I had no trouble at all slicing the meat. I think I would not cook as long next time (maybe 5 hours) or perhaps the brisket I used was a little small.
Your method for compacting the meat for easier slicing worked very well. I used Guinness beer, tossed several cloves of garlic into the pot, and added a bit of water to cover the meat with liquid. I cooked on low overnight, turned the meat over, and then cooked on high a while longer. Thanks for posting!
This worked great! I just sliced up some of my corned beef and it was condensed and was so easy to get nice thin pieces off of it! Thank you for sharing this idea.

EARLY START
Search for Flight 370; Hunt for Landslide Survivors; Obama Attending Hague Nuclear Summit
Aired March 24, 2014 - 05:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) DEBORAH FEYERICK, CNN ANCHOR: Happening now, President Obama is wheels down in the Netherlands, heading to The Hague this morning for the first day of a two-day nuclear security summit with over 50 foreign leaders. But that meeting bound to be eclipsed by the broiling trouble in Ukraine and Crimea, as members of the g-7 hold their first face-to-face talks on how to deal with Russia. The president expected to urge continued unity against Moscow. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: Meanwhile, in Crimea, Russian troops have referendum to also rejoin Russia. FEYERICK: Well, EARLY START continues right now. (MUSIC) ROMANS: Breaking news overnight, 17 days after flight 370 went missing, a Chinese plane spots suspicious objects off the coast of Australia. We're learning more details of what happened on board that jet. We are live with the latest developments on the search, the investigation, and this morning, what the families are saying. FEYERICK: And the death toll is rising this morning after a landslide buries homes near Seattle. Rescuers hold out hope as they try to get through a square mile of mud to find anyone surviving. ROMANS: Yes, that is a really dangerous situation there in Washington state. Good morning. Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans. FEYERICK: And I'm Deborah Feyerick. It is Monday, March 24th, 5:00 a.m. in the East. ROMANS: All right. Let's begin with this -- there's word this morning of suspicious objects spotted in the southern Indian Ocean. Could they -- could they unlock the mystery of the whereabouts of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, missing for 17 days now? A Chinese crew reportedly saw them floating on the water, but so far, Australian officials say search planes have been unable to relocate them. This comes as we're learning more about what happened in the cockpit of that flight. Military radar indicates the Boeing 777 dramatically changed altitude, flying as low as 12,000 after turning off course and disappearing from radar. CNN's Andrew Stevens live for us in Perth, Australia. Andrew, what do we know about these suspicious objects in the ocean? ANDREW STEVENS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, suspicious objects. That's what they're being called by Xinhua, which is the official state-owned news agency, Chinese news agency, Christine. What we know is frustratingly vague. There are two relatively big objects surrounded by smaller white objects over an area of several square miles. Nothing more specific than that. Aviation experts I've been talking to say that could tally with a debris field from something like a downed plane, but could is the operative word here. We just don't know. Now, you said that a P-8 Poseidon, a U.S. plane was diverted to that area. It's got to the area. And frustratingly, it can't locate that debris field which the Chinese saw. Now, what we are learning through tweets from the search coordinators is that the Chinese aircraft was actually just heading back out of the search zone on its way back to Perth when it saw these objects. It sounds like they saw them at quite a high altitude, 33,000 feet, perhaps. We're just trying to confirm that, but this is what we're getting from a tweet from the search organizations. Any visual from 30,000 feet is obviously going to be very, very difficult to identify. The plane had to head back to Perth. The P-8 was diverted into that area and hasn't, as we say, been able to locate it. But as far as the broader picture's concerned, Christine, it is fitting an emerging pattern, if you like. There has been satellite images now from the U.S., via the Australians, who release them, from China. There have been now two sightings of what looks like some sort of debris field, or at least several objects clustering together, all in the past five or six days, all in the same area. And when I say the same area, we're talking about still a very, very big area, thousands and thousands of square miles. We can't necessarily join these dots together and say they are all related, but at the moment, it remains very much the strongest lead anyone has. The next step is to get more planes down there. The weather is not helping. And also, they need sea assets, surface vessels in the area at the moment. There is only one, an Australian warship. More are coming, but it's still going to take time for that to happen. ROMANS: Really important, you mentioned the weather. You've got really bad weather coming in. That's going to make it much more difficult to get assets in the ocean, close to where they think this debris is, to actually confirm these sightings that the planes and the satellites are finding, right? STEVENS: Yes, right, that's the problem. The Australians have been saying the last three days at least that it's so important to get eyes on, actually get visual confirmation of what they're seeing, which means they've now drawn in several of these small, corporate jets, ultra long-range. They can take 10, 12 spotters with them. They get down there quite low and they scan the sea. Good, old-fashioned eyeball technology just so they can get an idea. Now, if you are getting bad weather, visibility is absolutely critical here. And what we're hearing from the planes coming back over the past 24 hours is visibility in some areas in that target zone, Christine, virtually down to not quite zero, but very, very limited because the cloud, this low cloud that has been hanging around in some places is now down to sea level. It's patchy. Some areas are clearer. But the weather picture is for worse to come, so that is just making everything more and more difficult. At this stage, though, 10 flights in the air today. That is the biggest search day we've had so far. There's no suggestions from the authorities here that they're going to have to scale back because of the weather. ROMANS: All right, broiling seas, white caps. I cannot imagine how difficult it is to a spotter in one of those corporate jets. Andrew Stevens, thank you so much, Andrew. The U.S. is committing additional resources to the search right now. NASA is using satellites to try to take pictures of the Indian ocean, but it my take days before the satellites are repositioned, and the Navy is sending its own sophisticated listening equipment right into the search zone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are sending the ping locator down to aid in locating the black box. Basically, this is highly sensitive equipment that is used, it's towed behind at very slow speeds on a commercial vessel down to depths of about -- it can listen down to depths of about 20,000 feet, listening for the ping coming off the black box, which is going to be critical in helping out with the investigation. It's a difficult task. The Indian Ocean is a very large area, and we were trying to follow -- you know, we go to every lead that's out there in these identified search areas. We're dedicated to the mission and we'll keep going as long as we're needed out there. (END VIDEO CLIP) FEYERICK: Such a massive search, so many countries involved. Word that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 dropped as low as 12,000 feet before disappearing from radar. That's raising new questions for investigators about just what happened inside the plane's cockpit and why. CNN's Jim Clancy's live for us in Kuala Lumpur. And, Jim, we have heard multiple theories. We've heard that perhaps the cabin depressurized and the pilots tried to fly low. We've heard that perhaps it was a botched hijacking, maybe a suicide. But it's all speculation. What are you learning there on the ground about why that plane may have been coming back towards Kuala Lumpur? JIM CLANCY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, originally, they said this a couple of days after the plane went missing, that they thought it was coming back in the case of an emergency, but there are questions that are raised by all of this. You mentioned 12,000 feet. There have been other altitudes that have been talked about. You know, one of the investigators told me that as they looked at it, it also at the end climbed up to 29,000 feet. It tells us that someone inside the cockpit, whether it was a pilot, whether it was a hijacker, whoever it was, was steering the plane. Could it have been a catastrophic failure, as you said there, a loss of pressure in the cabin? Well, possibly, but the pilot in that case would almost certainly be dropping altitude and coming in to land at an airport. And there is more than one airport that this aircraft came very close to before it took off and headed towards the Indian Ocean. So, why? You know, that raises the question. It's just another one of the puzzle pieces. And it just stresses more than ever before why it's so important to find the plane to get the flight data recorders and discover the real process that took place inside the cockpit. Right now, we have a mystery. We're waiting for a press briefing that should be starting at any moment. And we'll bring you the latest. If we hear it, you will, too -- Deborah. FEYERICK: All right. Jim Clancy, thanks so much. Clearly, no mayday call at all, raising more questions and time running out, because that black box only emits the ping for about 30 days, so they've got 13 more to go. ROMANS: Oh, wow. All right, the families of the 239 people on board Malaysia Airlines flight 370, they simply want answers, and they believe the airline and authorities have been less than forthcoming. For them, this awful waiting game drags on. CNN's Pauline Chiou, she is in Beijing for us. She's following that important part of the story. Pauline, what are you hearing from these families? They must be, frankly, so frustrated and in agony here, you know, going into the third week. PAULINE CHIOU, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's been a wait of agony and anguish. These people have been suffering, and they're emotionally exhausted. Now, we heard, Deb, and Jim there talking about speculation and theories, and there's a lot of that going on here in Beijing because the Chinese families of the passengers feel they're not getting enough information. They say they're not getting consistent information from the Malaysian officials. For the past few days, they've been meeting with this high-level delegation from Malaysia. We had another one of those meetings today. And again, the families said they posed certain questions to these officials, even that report out of CNN that a source had told CNN that this plane had gone down to 12,000 feet. They asked the officials here in Beijing about that, and the answer was we cannot answer that because there's no one from the military here to address that question. And that's why these families are so frustrated. Now, I spoke with a group of family members in a hotel. You can see this video of them. We shot them from behind because they say they don't want their elderly relatives to know about their connection with this flight. They have kept this news away from their grandparents and other elderly relatives, but they say they're just so frustrated. And then earlier, we had spoken with a family whose only son was on the flight. His name is Mr. Li. He walked out of that briefing so angry and he talked about his mistrust in the Malaysian government. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Our relatives were on that flight. This wasn't an accident. Instead, it was caused by the Malaysian government. They are covering up something. (END VIDEO CLIP) CHIOU: And, Christine, that's a sentiment that we hear from a lot of families here. But a special envoy from the Malaysian prime minister's office has said to CCTV, the state television station here, that Malaysia will be honest and truthful with the Chinese families. Also, the Malaysian ambassador to China has said that a high-level delegation from Malaysia will be sent to Beijing, but that also is an issue, because the families here say they want a consistent point of contact. They want the same people to answer their questions. They don't want this revolving door -- Christine. ROMANS: That makes sense. That makes sense -- they need an advocate and they need somebody who's going to give them information they need. So, you know, you're going into the third week now. Most of the families, are they choosing to stay in Beijing? Are some people going home? I mean, what are -- their life has been suspended here. CHIOU: Yes, their lives have been on hold. They've had to take leave from their jobs. Many of the relatives say they are staying. There are a few families who have decided to at least send a few relatives home and then have other relatives come back to take their places. And the reason why is because Malaysia Airlines is paying for their hotel rooms here in Beijing. There are about four or five hotels that are being used for this particular issue, and the airline has made it clear that once they leave, there is no guarantee that they'll get accommodations when they come back. So, there is this rotation that we're seeing among certain family members that if they have to leave and go back to jobs, they try to call another relative in to at least stay in Beijing for a couple of days. And most of them are saying they want a presence here, because these are their loved ones on this plane and they want to get down to the bottom of this. ROMANS: All right, Pauline Chiou for us this morning in Beijing -- thanks, Pauline. FEYERICK: And there is word this morning of a problem on board another Malaysia airlines jet, this time a flight from Kuala Lumpur to South Korea. The Airbus A330 had to be diverted to Hong Kong because of a failed generator. The plane landed normally and passengers were transferred to other airlines to make the rest of their trip. ROMANS: Breaking news this morning from Washington state, where authorities are trying to find survivors from this deadly landslide. The very latest on that, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROMANS: We are following breaking news this morning from Washington state. The death toll from a massive mudslide rising. Eight people are now confirmed dead in what's described as total devastation in an area north of Seattle. There are still 18 people unaccounted for. Officials are saying rescuers struggling to reach those people because the area is unstable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JAY INSLEE (D), WASHINGTON: To a significant extent, Mother Nature holds the cards here on the ability of ground personnel to enter the slide area. It is essentially a slurry. They rescued at least seven people, both being through airlift and through on-the- ground efforts, but some of them who went in literally got caught in up to their armpits and had to be dragged out by ropes themselves. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROMANS: At least six homes destroyed. Authorities say the destruction comparable to a tornado strike. FEYERICK: President Obama this morning is in the Netherlands for an important international summit at The Hague. He is joined by 50 world leaders. They're set to discuss nuclear security, but the meeting is likely to be eclipsed by the trouble in Ukraine and Crimea. The president expected to urge continued unity against Moscow. ROMANS: Meanwhile in Crimea, Russian troops have now a referendum to also rejoin Russia. FEYERICK: Well, let's get a quick look at your forecast. Jennifer Gray is here. Good morning, Jennifer. ROMANS: Good morning. JENNIFER GRAY, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Good morning to you. We are looking at another possible winter storm. It is spring, yet, we could see a major storm develop across the Northeast. Now, we're still trying to keep our finger on how things are going to play out. We're still a little uncertain here, but we do know there will be a low tracking to the east, and it is going to bring extremely windy conditions and possible snow to places in the Northeast. Now, the two models we are watching are very, very different scenarios. This is scenario one. It doesn't bring much snow to New York. Boston picks up about two inches. The other scenario -- this is the worst-case scenario -- that low tracks a little bit more to the west and we could be looking at 4 1/2 inches of snow in New York city and up to a foot of snow in boston and possible blizzard-like conditions around the cape. So, this is going to be something we're really going to be watching. Hopefully, the models will come to better agreement tomorrow. This is going to hit Tuesday night into Wednesday, so this is right around the corner. ROMANS: Bad news. GRAY: Yes, I know. ROMANS: Bad news, but thank you. I'll take it this morning on a Monday morning. I'd rather be prepared. Thanks, Jennifer. GRAY: All right. ROMANS: We're now down to the sweet 16 at the NCAA tournament, and some big favorites have fallen. Andy Scholes is here with more in this morning's "Bleacher Report." My team, the Cyclones, they're in, so that's all I've got to say. FEYERICK: She's happy. ROMANS: My team's in! But, oh, man. FEYERICK: Shockers are what we'll talk about first. We'll get to your cyclones in a minute. But the amazing run by Wichita State, you know, it finally came to an end. The Shockers were 35-0 coming into the matchup with Kentucky and this was another great game this weekend. Both teams trading clutch shots down the stretch. Wichita State was down two in the closing seconds, and Fred VanVleet's going to get one last shot for the shockers, but it was off the mark. Kentucky pulls off the upset 78- 76. Now, the other number one seed in action last night had no problem advancing. Virginia took care of Memphis 78-60. They'll now play Michigan State in a huge Sweet 16 matchup. Arizona, meanwhile, is heading to their third sweet 16 in the past four years. The wildcats dominated Gonzaga 84-61. In other action, the Baylor bears crushed Creighton, ending Doug McDermott's stellar college career. Doug's dad is the head coach of the blue jays and got to watch Doug climb all the way to fifth all time on college basketball's scoring list. All right, Christine, this is the game I knew you were watching closely yesterday, Iowa State/North Carolina, coming down to the wire. Time winding down here, DeAndre Kane, the clutch drive and finish. The Cyclones survive and head to the sweet 16 for the first time in 14 years. All the action, of course, is going to pick back up on Thursday and Friday, and you can watch it on TV. Yes, Christine, I was looking at your bracket earlier. You're not doing too hot right now. But if Iowa State goes to the final four and ends up winning, I think you're doing pretty good. ROMANS: I put all my eggs in that basket and that basket is wearing cardinal gold. FEYERICK: Loyalty is loyalty. ROMANS: Loyalty is loyalty. Go, Cyclones! I know they're going to do it. I'm so excited. Thanks, Andy. SCHOLES: All right. FEYERICK: We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) FEYERICK: This morning, we're following the latest breaking news in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. A Chinese plane has reported what they're calling suspicious objects off the coast of Australia, that as CNN has learned the plane dropped down to 12,000 feet after making its turn off course. There are many theories about what may have happened to flight 370. One of them is called the shadow theory, and it's not impossible. Chad Myers explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: 370, because the transponder's turned off, and 68 doesn't even see 370, because with the transponder off, there is no proximity alert to this plane. It doesn't work that way. If this is turned off, that plane doesn't even know it, and if it came up from behind or from the back, you may not even see the plane ever there. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROMANS: Fascinating. FEYERICK: Absolutely. ROMANS: We'll get the very latest on the search for this flight right after a break.

Justice is going to get you George.
The State of Florida has charged George Zimmerman with murdering Trayvon Martin. But that might not be the end of his legal problems:
According to WFTV, an affliate of ABC in Orlando, Zimmerman may soon be charged with a hate crime by the FBI:. […]
FBI investigators are actively questioning witnesses in the retreat at the Twin Lakes neighborhood, seeking evidence for a possible federal hate crime charge.
WFTV notes that “if Zimmerman is charged and found guilty of a federal hate crime involving murder, he could face the death penalty.” FBI officials confirm to ABC News that the investigation is ongoing but say the “hammer won’t be dropped” anytime soon.
Most of the evidence against Zimmerman has yet to be disclosed. Late yesterday, Florida prosecution delivered 67 CDs of evidence against Zimmerman to his attorney. Under Florida law, most of it should be available to the public soon.
Some people believe if Zimmerman is found guilty, life in prison seems right. But the death penalty only magnifies heinous crimes by killing again. Do you think the FBI is justified in convicting Zimmerman of a hate crime and would the death penalty be the right sentence for him?

Darfur
While international attention was focused on finding peace between northern and southern Sudan, in the early 2000s another conflict emerged in Sudan’s western region, Darfur.
SLA = Sudan Liberation Movement
JEM = Justice and Equality Movement
NCP = National Congress Party
SLA-MM = Sudan Liberation Army – Minni Minnawi
DPA = Darfur Peace Agreement
In February 2003, two rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Movement, or SLA, and the Justice and Equality Movement, or JEM, launched a full scale rebellion against the Sudanese government. The rebellion was prompted by ongoing economic marginalization and insecurity. Those involved in the rebellion were predominantly from Muslim sedentary tribes of the region, including the Fur and the Zaghawa.
The Sudanese government responded by enlisting the help of some of the nomadic tribes in Darfur, including the Rizeigat and the Misseriya, to put down the rebellion. The government promised these tribes land in exchange for their military allegiance, subsequently turning the conflict into genocide by “Arabizing” the issues. With support from the Sudanese Government’s National Congress Party, or NCP, these groups formed militias known as the Janjaweed, and began wreaking havoc throughout Darfur, ultimately leading to the deaths of around 300,000 people and the displacement of almost 4 million.
Since the conflict began, the rebels in Darfur have splintered multiple times, leaving an unwieldy number of groups with varying needs, and an increasingly complicated road to peace. One such splintering, which resulted from a Fur-Zaghawa division within the SLA, ultimately led to the creation of the Sudan Liberation Army – Minni Minnawi, or SLA-MM. The SLA-MM was the only one of the Darfur rebel groups to sign the Darfur Peace Agreement, or DPA, in Abuja in 2006. While Minnawi’s decision to sign the DPA secured him a leadership position in Khartoum, he was later sidelined by the government and ostracized by his own people, thus accomplishing nothing for the people of Darfur.
The most recent Darfur peace process in Doha offers little hope. The Liberation and Justice Movement, a group of rebels cobbled together for Doha by international mediators, continues to negotiate peace with the government even as the most powerful of the rebel groups remain outside the process.

South Kordofan and Blue Nile
In June 2011, following disputed state-level elections, violence erupted between government and Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North, or SPLM-N, forces in South Kordofan. The violence spread in September 2011 to Blue Nile, where the Government of Sudan removed the state’s popularly elected SPLM-N governor, Malik Agar.
Refugees reported that the Sudan Armed Forces, or SAF, targeted civilians they suspected to be linked to the SPLM-N, and in July 2011, satellite imagery captured by our Satellite Sentinel Project evidenced the existence of mass grave sites in South Kordofan.
The violence spread in September 2011 to Blue Nile, where the Government of Sudan removed the state’s popularly elected SPLM-N governor, Malik Agar.
Because the Sudanese government refuses to allow independent observers into South Kordofan and Blue Nile, precise civilian casualty figures are unavailable. The United Nations estimates that there are now more than 202,000 refugees from Blue Nile and South Kordofan in camps in South Sudan and Ethiopia and as of May 31, 2012 en estimated 300,000 people have been displaced or severely affected by the fighting in South Kordofan.
The assaults on civilian populations have largely occurred during the planting and harvest seasons, severely undermining available food stores in the two states. The Government of Sudan steadfastly refuses to allow international organizations to deliver desperately needed humanitarian or food aid to civilians in SPLM-N controlled areas. According to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, 200,000-250,000 people in areas of southern Blue Nile and South Kordofan are currently experiencing crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity, one level short of famine.
These atrocities are nothing new. They are the latest iteration in a pattern of human rights violations that the Government of Sudan has committed against Sudanese civilians in South Sudan, South Kordofan, Blue Nile, the Abyei area, eastern Sudan, and Darfur since at least the early 1990s.

Eastern Sudan
Sudan’s eastern region garners almost no attention from the international community, but a UN official described the three states in the East—Red Sea, Kassala, and Gedarif—as "a volcano waiting to erupt."
This region, which struggles with access to water and sanitation and routinely suffers from acute malnutrition and maternal mortality rates, is primarily inhabited by the non-Arab Beja and Rashaida ethnic groups.
In October 2011, hundreds of student protestors took to the streets in the city of Kassala, chanting "people are hungry" and "people want to overthrow the government."
An anti-government youth group, the Girifna Movement, reported that Sudanese authorities broke up student protests with extreme violence, using live ammunition and tear gas as well as running down eight students with a security car.
In December 2011, a UN source predicted, "that conflict on the scale now taking place in South Kordofan and Blue Nile could erupt in Kassala state within a few months." Both the Beja and Rashaida were never completely disarmed after a 2006 peace deal and remain heavily armed today.
Eastern Sudan is also the location of Sudan’s only port, a necessary component to Sudan’s oil infrastructure.
In June 2012, the Sudanese government expelled at least four humanitarian aid groups, including Save the Children and Medecins Sans Frontiers (Doctors Without Borders), accusing them of subversive behavior.
Denial of humanitarian aid to impoverished communities is a hallmark of the Government of Sudan’s domestic policy. Sudan denies aid to its citizens to punish the international community for decisions it doesn’t like. While eastern Sudan.

Democratic Transformation
There is a movement for democratic transformation underway in Sudan. Led by student activists, most notable the Girifna movement in Khartoum, these Sudanese citizens are standing up to Bashir’s regime and calling for democracy.
Girifna literally means "we are fed up" in Arabic, but colloquially it is akin to 'we've had enough.'
Sudan held deeply flawed and fraudulent elections in 2010, with the ruling National Congress Party, or NCP, "winning" 73% of the National Assembly seats, and Bashir winning the presidency with 68% of the votes.

Who are you?
Pilkington Profilit channel glass.
Where are you from?
I'm originally from Germany, but lately I've been residing in Snoqualmie, Wash.
Aside from sugar and spice and everything nice, what else are you made of?
I'm made of U-shaped, linear cast glass channels in an extruded metal perimeter frame. When you mix me with sugar and spice and everything nice, you get a façade or wall that obscures vision while allowing light to pass through.
What one word best describes you?
Luminous.
What do you see when you look in the mirror?
My reflection in the mirror is always changing. Some days I'm so translucent I can barely see myself; other days I'm bright green, sapphire blue, hot pink or even gold. Not to mention, my shape is always changing. I can be tall, short or patterned, although I have to say my favorite is when I'm curved like rippling waves.
How do you lessen your environmental impact?
I help architects and designers reduce electric lighting loads by diffusing soft, even light to reduce unnecessary glare and heat gain or loss.
In what type of interior do you make the greatest impact?
My friends have told me I make the biggest impact in offices, lobbies and entryways. These spaces are often in need of natural light but must be concealed from other parts of the building. I help solve this challenge by letting in daylight, while offering various levels of translucencies to meet the desired level of privacy. I can be playful, elegant or modern in design.
Describe the secret to your success.
The secret to my success is my ability to multitask. I can transfer natural light without the loss of privacy while helping with sound reduction, or I can act as a dramatic backdrop by day and be backlit at night. Some say I blend all the benefits of daylight with the modern.BBC Mundo Lo Invita A Mandar Sus Fotos

Largely responsible for a lot of the Bills offensive figures is the two-headed monster in the team’s offensive backfield.
Perhaps most impressive is his current streak of games in which he’s had a completion percentage of better than 70 percent. On Sunday Fitzpatrick completed 77.8 percent of his passes (21-27), the highest single-game total of his career. It was his third straight game with a completion percentage of 70 percent or better becoming just the second signal caller in Bills history to do it (Jim Kelly, 1991).
What makes the production intriguing is Fitzpatrick does not believe he has peaked as a player. Set to turn 29 later this month, the Bills quarterback believes there are more rungs to climb on his career ladder.
“I'm going to continue to get better,” said Fitzpatrick. “I'm going to continue to improve every week, every month every year, and hopefully, this is just a good beginning for us.”
Fitzpatrick is on pace to have the second-most prolific passing season in Bills history as his current passing totals project to just under 4,000 yards passing for the 2011 campaign (3,974). That would be second only to Drew Bledsoe’s 4,359-yard season in 2002. On pace to throw 32 touchdown passes, he would fall just one short of Jim Kelly’s team record 33 in 1991.
Meanwhile Buffalo’s all-purpose running back is threatening to topple some of the single-season marks of the franchise’s two Hall of Fame running backs.
He’s third in yards per carry average (5.5), fourth in rushing touchdowns (6) and second in rushing yards per game (103). Jackson is on pace to rush for 1,648 yards, which would be third-best in Bills annals behind O.J. Simpson’s two best seasons in 1973 (2,003) and 1975 (1,817).
Jackson has topped the 100-yard rushing mark in five of the Bills seven games this season. Sunday was his third straight 100-yard rushing effort becoming the first Buffalo back to do that since Thurman Thomas in 1994.
Tied for fifth among running backs in receptions (27), Jackson is also fourth in receiving yards (353), second in receiving average (13.1) and first in the league among running backs with four receptions of 25 yards or more (4).
Turning in game-breaking plays has been a weekly occurrence for Jackson, who became the first Bills player ever to have a 40-plus yard run and a 40-plus yard reception in the same game on Sunday.
“It’s motivating,” said Jackson of the expectation to turn in big plays. “I’m putting together some plays for my teammates and I want to be the guy they can continue to count on to put plays together for them. Hopefully I can continue to go out, make some plays for them and we can keep on this streak that we have right now and make good on the things we set out to get done this year. Hopefully we can get them done.”
Second in the NFL in yards from scrimmage (1,074), only Chicago’s Matt Forte has been more productive (1,091). And those 1,074 total yards through the first seven games this season is second only to Simpson’s 1,106 total yards in the first seven games of the 1975 season.
Fitzpatrick believes what’s driving himself, Jackson and the rest of the team is a collective desire to produce for one another.
“I think that’s part of the success that we've had is we're out there fighting for each other,” said Fitzpatrick. “I want to do my best out there. When I see Freddy taking on defensive ends and blocking him, I don't want to let that guy down.
“When Stevie makes a diving catch, when Eric Pears steps in, and

You need to log in to comment on this article. No account? No problem!Jets rookie quarterback Geno Smith didn’t play last night, but he said he’s close to being well, and still has a shot at the starting job.
Smith told Jane McManus of ESPNNewYork.com his sore ankle was “as close to 100 percent as it’s been this week,” and that he still had a shot to be the Jets starter.
“I was told the competition is still open,” Smith said.
If it is, he still has a chance, after Mark Sanchez failed to put it away with an up-and-down night against the Jaguars.
Smith pushed himself to practice last week, after injuring the ankle against the Lions a week ago. But he was obviously bothered by it, and had what Rex Ryan described as a “brutal” practice before he was shelved for the week.
“I wanted to be out there in practice,” Smith said. “I wouldn’t allow them to keep me out of practice. . . .
“Any chance I get to complete, I’m going to take full advantage of it.”
He walked in the door with a decent chance to win that competition, so he should feel that way, though playing hurt didn’t help him in practice this week.
McElroy starts by the end of the season.
Geno appears to have a good attitude…
Sanchez is coming off two terrible seasons…
So I think at somepoint Geno will get his chances to play this year…
His best way to compete is to relax, ice the ankle and let Sanchez take all the reps and play 3q of game 3. That way, by default (Sanchez being Sanchez) Smith steps in as starter by preseason game 4. He better hand off alot in that game too.
Smith needs a mentor. And Rex Ryan isn’t it.
Simms looked pretty good to me.
No matter who wins the Jets fans lose. Not saying that Smith will be a bad QB before he ever plays a snap, but he is not in an environment conducive to winning with a coach who already has one foot out of the door, and no help at receiver.
It was probably good for Geno to sit and just watch from the sidelines.
Next week, if he can play a turnover free game and produce some points, this team is his.
Good luck Geno.
I’ll tell you who opened my eyes was Simms, I’d like to see more of him, he looked poised, and seemed to have a rifle for an arm. His father wasn’t too bad either, maybe it’s in the genes.
I hope he does well enough to see a real competition for QB. Injuries to the Jets and my Dolphins suck. When the two teams play this year I want it to be for something more important then both of them trying not to be in last place. It’s been hard to be a fan of either team lately
How does Greg McElroy not even have a chance? He’s the best qb on that roster and it ain’t close
According to the article, Sanchez had an up and down night. So I guess he’s improving tremendously.
You could also say that if Sanchez plays a turnover free game and produces some points in the next preseason game that the team is his!
So when Sanchez was taking the Jets to the playoffs, what did he do differently? Was he a different player, or was the team a much better team capable of making up for his deficiencies as a quarterback?
Look, this isn’t really a “competition.” That’s just a label they use to provide the appearance of fairness. In truth, Geno’s already won the job. The only question is when they admit it, be it Week 1, 5, 10, etc.
Bottom line is, Mark’s going, and Geno’s coming. So if you’re Geno, you just start preparing every week as if you’re the starter because, before long, you will be.
Sanchez will start the year as the QB and we’ll see what happens from there. Let’s stop acting like Geno is Andrew Luck. Geno has a lot of work to do to be a starting QB in the NFL. It’s not a knock on his potential.
Sanchez will get the start Week 1. Geno is primed to be the dark horse. Rexy has more than a tattoo riding on Sanchez. And the way Sanchez has read opposing defenses, the Jets have everything riding on Geno being a quick study.EnglishEdit

The past several weeks have been very uneventful commuting. Then last night all hell broke loose!
Cruising on IS80 at an altitude (or attitude) of 75 mph I came up on a Mustang and Eclipse GTS Spyder playing around. The GTS was abusing the mustang, which was a GT ragtop.
I came up, passed and pulled away with authority to about 85. Caught up with some traffic, as my two new playmates caught up with me. IS 80 is four lanes west bound at this point, and we now have three of the lanes across, with the SHO in the center. Creeping at 30 mph the Spyder rolls down the window and asks where I bought the "V8" signage and how much. I told him any local ford dealer for $15K and up! He had no sense of humor. Once traffic broke, so did I.
Later on SR23, I am leaving a light, and I am accustomed to do I leave on the aggressive side (no wheel spin, but just so the secondaries turn on, love that sound (; ) I'm in the left lane (three lanes wide) when I notice a Honda Prelude, stealth riced (blacked out windows, chrome wide tires and lowered I think) is trying hard to impress. I can see the driver mashing gears and revving hard. We stay even to the next light, arriving at the same time. He gives me that look, so we go. No match. I am at 55 and two car lengths ahead when I let off.
Next Light, he pulls in the center lane. (Windows down) He tells me he didn't know I was going to go, and he didn't get on. Let's go again. At 65 I have several car lengths, and slow down for the next light. He catches up, and asks if I'm running NOS. No, I politely say, just a steady diet of rice. He takes the next exit. Another one with no humor.
Further up the road I come across two GTP (on SC, the other not). This is my favorite part of the trip home cause it gets twisty. I fall in line behind my new found friends. We are at a comfortable 40-50 MPH pace. Very light traffic with the holidays (Spring Break, Passover...) so I take the out side lane on a left the right combo, and pass with authority at 60.Dumb looks prevail from the GTP's. At the next light the guys signal to pull over to a rest area, and I do.
I then listen to the same story, "I never seen a Taurus do that!" What mods? Where did you have the work done, yadda yadda yadda. I then break their collective hearts to tell them it's bone stock. Neither have ever heard of the SHO. (great marketing FORD!) They are most impressed, and left with smiles of envy.

Management
Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed or Medline, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library in October 2008 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., colposcopy, cervical dysplasia) and key words (e.g., colposcopy management, CIN, AGC, cervical dysplasia, LEEP, LLETZ, HPV testing, cervical dysplasia triage). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no date or language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to July 2012. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, and national and international medical specialty societies.
Expert opinion from published peer-reviewed literature and evidence from clinical trials is summarized. Consensus opinion is outlined when evidence is insufficient. Preventive reviewed for accuracy from content experts in cytology, pathology, and cervical screening programs. Guideline content was also compared with similar documents from other organizations including the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, and the European Cancer Network.

April 2nd, 2010
Transform and roll out
Impressions:
Maaaaaan. If I had know that this was just going to be 21 straight minutes of Kisaragi with next to no Prof, and essentially no Noda or Tomokane silliness at all, I wouldn’t have been looking forward to it quite so much. Kisaragi is easily the most dull character of the bunch and she’s sure as hell not who I think of when I look back and remember why I enjoyed this show. I wanted my Color Rangers, Magical Witch Nodamiki, or at least some chicken pantomime. Not twenty minutes of Kisaragi bumbling around.
The first half was a bit better than the second, mainly because Noda and Tomokane were actually engaged in the plot for more than 15 seconds each. The new (to us) teacher emasculated Tomokane and Kisaragi for their lack of style, so Namiko and Noda tried to teach them a bit about fashion. I do question Namiko’s fire hydrant dress, but it did look okay in her imagination. The second half was essentially just Kisaragi wandering around the school. Homura (I think that’s his name)’s evolution into some kind of art supply mecha was easily the highlight, although Ararararakawa continued cardboard box shenanigans were also decent enough. However, that does speak to the trouble that a segment is in when Arakawa is one of the high points.

Damn. They animated the latest chapters but leave out cardboard Namiko, shuriken pencil kisaragi and the badminton match. What a waste not to use them in the OVA.FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Despite its reputation as one of the noisiest and most difficult places for opposing quarterbacks to play, Tom Brady says he's excited to travel to CenturyLink Field in Seattle for a Week 6 matchup with the Seahawks.
"I think anytime you go on the road, you expect it to be loud," the Patriots quarterback told reporters during a Wednesday news conference. "We practice with that. I know this is a very -- [the stadium] gets some attention around the league for how loud it is. I'm actually excited to get out there and play in a place I've never played."
Seattle is one of just two cities that Brady has not played in during his 12-plus seasons in the NFL (San Francisco being the other), and the quarterback admits he's excited to take the field at a new venue.
"Yeah, I think I've always looked forward to doing that," Brady said. "There probably aren't many that I haven't played in at this point. But this will be fun. It's always nice when you take 53 guys on the road and you say, 'This is all we've got and this is all we need and this is what we have to do.' "
Among the goals for Brady and his offense will be to quiet the crowd, and, as he states, turn the fans against their own team.
"I think that's an exciting part for road teams, is to see if you can get them booing their own players," he said.
It won't be easy to do, as Seattle boasts one of the top defenses in the league, and, according to head coach Bill Belichick, the loudest stadium.
"We've played in a lot of loud stadiums before, but none louder than Seattle," Belichick said. "I think they're as loud as anybody. We'll have to do a good job with our communication and just our mental alertness."
Belichick says his team will "crank up" the noise at practice this week in an effort to simulate the game conditions, but ultimately it will come down to execution on Sunday.
"We can crank up the noise here as loud as you want to crank it up, [but] in the end, Sunday we're going to have to go out there and we know we're going to have to deal with it," he said. "And it's not just offense, it's your punt protection ... on the field goals, it's all those plays."
Receiver Deion Branch, who played four-plus seasons with the Seahawks, knows what the Patriots will be facing.
"I think everyone knows the atmosphere of that stadium," Branch said. "Everybody across the league [knows] it's by far the loudest stadium, and it can get louder and things go bad for the offensive side of the ball."
In order to neutralize the impact of the crowd noise, Branch says, the Patriots must stay focused on what the team can control.
"I think the biggest thing for us is to make sure we go in and stay focused and try to stay on track, and we can try to control that portion of the game," Branch continued. "We just have to go out there and do our job, and we can kind of silence them a little. Just a little."
Seahawks rookie quarterback Russell Wilson, who played his final college season at the University of Wisconsin (whose Camp Randall Stadium seats north of 80,000 people), describes the atmosphere in Seattle as unique.
"There is nothing like it," Wilson said. "I played in a lot of stadiums in college, in front of 100,000 people, and here I'm not sure exactly what it is -- probably 65, 66,000 -- but it's ferocious in that stadium, just how loud it is, and the energy that the 12th Man fans bring in CenturyLink. Just that energy, that passion that our fans bring, it really heightens our ability to play at an even higher level."
The veteran Brady says there's nothing better than taking an opposing crowd out of the game with a strong performance, as his team was able to do in Buffalo during Week 4.
"That's the fun part about being on the road. There's nothing better than being on the road, like in Buffalo a few weeks ago, there were more of our fans there at the end than their fans," he continued. "We've done that in Pittsburgh, we've done that in some very loud environments."
Last Sunday at Gillette, during the Patriots' Week 5 victory over the Denver Broncos, Brady and his offense spent the majority of the game running an up-tempo, fast-paced attack. But in Seattle, in front of a spirited crowd and ambient noise, will that approach work?
Brady says the offense can play at a number of different tempos, and will focus on what it believes to be the most effective strategy to attack the opposition.
"I think we have several different tempos that we try to play at. Sometimes you go no-huddle; sometimes we have to slow it down," he said. "It's all really a matter of how the game is going and how we feel is the best way to attack the other team.
"Every week you go in and you have different modes of playing and plays and schemes, and usually by halftime you narrow those down and you have 30, 35 plays left in the game and those are the ones you have to hone in on," Brady said. "Whatever is working, that's what we're going to try to do."
Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll, who compared the Patriots' offense to the University of Oregon's (which Carroll faced annually during his tenure as the head coach at USC), says that practicing fast is the goal of his defense's preparation this week. He also mentioned getting lined up fast and displaying sound technique as integral to slowing down the Patriots' up-tempo pace.
"It's the problem of getting everyone where they have to go and doing the things you have to do. That's the challenge to it," he said. "If we line up, and get our assignments right, and play well techniquewise, we'll have a chance to show you what we're all about. If not, then we'll look like the other teams they're playing and they'll have their way."Amazing Benefits of Embracing Promotional Bags
Amazing Benefits of Embracing Promotional Bags
Once a company gets to the market to push their products forward, they will use any means possible to make it. However, in most cases campaigns fail to avail the desired effect mainly because of simple reasons like lack of enough airing. This could mean that no changes will take place as far as commanding the market is concerned. To make things easier, investors have resorted to the use of promotional bags to push their campaigns forward. One may be forced to wonder why this is so but there are valid reasons as to why more investors should consider using this technique.
Promotional bags offer a unique and creative flair of promoting a product. In most cases, these bags are customized to appeal to a certain audience. If, for instance the target is to reach the youth, the bags will be designed with creative patterns that every young person will like. Also the colors that are used may be put in such a manner that any youth member will love. This creativity helps to draw the attention of a wider market because every person will be scrambling to get a piece so as to feel part of the rest.
When placed on a scale of comparison with other methods of advertising like the print media, promotional bags offer a much cheaper option that does not call for regular subscriptions. Once promotional bags are released to the market, the business owner will not follow to offer upgrades. The message is structured in a manner that allows the user to rely on the item for a long period of time. Using the television and print media requires one to invest millions so as to reach the target audience. There is also no guarantee that the people who are targeted will be watching, or will read the advert. Therefore, creating something that is appealing like promotional tote bags at offers an affordable option that will help to bring to the presence of the business to attention of the public.
The tangibility that comes with promotional bags helps people to have the item for longer periods. This is unlike TV and print media adverts, which only last for a short duration. One is able to remember the presence of the company from time to time whenever they use the bag. Keeping the effect of an advertisement for a longer time will always win over more people to embrace the products the company deals in.

How to Find the Best Laser Tattoo Removal Sydney For an Affordable Price
How to Find the Best Laser Tattoo Removal Sydney For an Affordable Price
The process of laser tattoo removal Sydney has made significant technological advances over the last decade. While doctors previously used salabrasion and dermabrasion to remove tattoos, advancements in technology have paved the way for laser tattoo removal treatments. Lasers leave little no scarring in the infected area, and patients feel less pain during the process.
Finding a quality laser tattoo removal Sydney specialist can be an overbearing process.
Use the following tips to help you choose a doctor that’s right for you:
Government Certification
Sydney-based tattoo removal specialists must be certified by the Department of Health to use lasers for dermatology purposes.
Ask the specialist to see certification, or use the government database to search for certified specialists close to you. Doctors who aren’t certified to use a laser might fail to use the equipment properly and likely don’t carry the proper business liability insurance should something happen during the procedure.
Laser Removal Experience
Specialists who have just completed training in laser tattoo removal Sydney by thinkagainlaserclinic.com.au with little to no experience should be be avoided. Laser removal treatments are often complex and any issues that arise during the procedure can be handled by an experienced specialist because they can apply issues with previous clients to something that arise during your procedure.
The Type of Laser Used
Laser tattoo removal Sydney can be performed with a variety of different lasers. Not all lasers are approved for laser removal by the Department of Health. Ask what equipment they use and compare it with a list of approved medical devices from the department before you decide to use them for your laser removal procedure.
Verify the Process and Cost
If the laser removal specialist meets the other requirements, the final step is to ask about every step of the procedure, how long it will take to remove the tattoo and if they can prescribe any pain medication.
The cost of the actual procedure can be anywhere between $100 and $500 per session. Ask about their pricing structure and if there are any discounts currently available. Most specialists will offer some type of coupon or referral discount if you refer a friend or family member.
Saving Money with a Hens Night Melbourne Offers
Knowing the Crowd
Generally, the bride and the main planner discuss some ideas and make preliminary plans for a hens night Melbourne will soon offer to them. While they are engaged in these preliminary discussions, they must consider the finances of the people whom they are inviting. For example, requesting that a group of middle-class individuals spend an incredible sum of money on a five-day-long celebration with expensive activities each night is unreasonable.
Selecting Lower Cost Activities
In order to keep the costs down, the bride and planner will have to use some ingenuity. For example, if the bride would like to check out the most expensive restaurant in the neighborhood, they may call to ask if a prepared menu is possible so that guests know what they are spending before they arrive. They can see if any new party venues have opened up that are offering sales. They can also see if some agencies offer discounts for a hens night Melbourne with.
Accepting a Lower Attendance Rate
Sometimes, the bride has a dream about her hens night Melbourne has to offer, and she does not want to budge about that vision. The party planner may also agree that the desired activities are appropriate. That is fine, and the bride should select activities in which she wants to participate. However, she must accept that some of her guests may be unable to attend. When it comes to a pricier hens night Melbourne can provide, some brides decide that they will pay for guests who cannot. That is certainly not a requirement though.
Laying the Costs out Early
The person in-charge of planning the party needs to make sure that the guests know how much the activity or activities is going to cost. Usually, hosts send out this information in an email about the hens night Melbourne can provide. While predicting the exact amount of money that each guest will spend is virtually impossible, the host can offer reasonable estimates. The list of costs should be broken down when multiple activities are involved.
Allowing for Partial Involvement
When people set up a list of costs, they are doing so to provide clarity, but also to allow individuals to partially participate in the hens night Melbourne has to offer. For example, if there is going to be more than one hens night Melbourne can provide, then some of the guests might come for one evening, but not for the other. Therefore, if individuals cannot afford the entire outing, they can come for part of it.
Celebrating a hens night Melbourne has to offer does not have to force people into spending all of their money when financial planning starts early.Deontay 'The Bronze Bomber' Wilder: interview
Ahead of his fight with Malik Scott this Sunday, we speak to heavyweight Deontay 'The Bronze Bomber' Wilder about what's wrong with boxing
With a staggering 30 KO victories to his name and no losses, 28-year-old American boxer Deontay 'The Bronze Bomber' Wilder is the most exciting prospect in the heavyweight division.
In-between preparing for his upcoming bout with fellow US fighter Malik Scott on Sunday and Twitter beefing with British boxer Tyson Fury, the Alabaman with the vicious right hand took a few minutes to tell MF why he’s wrecking shop in the heavyweight division.
MF: How did you get on sparring with David Haye when you came to the UK to help him prepare for his (cancelled) bout against Tyson Fury?
DW: Me and David are cool. I sparred with him during two camps, and it's really helped me come on as I fighter.
MF: What’s going on in the heavyweight division at the moment?
DW: There’s a revival taking place. Over the next year you’re going to see a lot of young guys coming through and bringing back the spark to the division – led by Deontay ‘Bronze Bomber’ Wilder, of course.
MF: Who would you rather fight Fury or Chisora?
DW: I'll fight either one of them. I want the biggest fights so I’ll go to war with whoever wins their rematch. A fight between me and either of them would be huge on both sides of the pond.
MF: Do you think the Klitschko brothers are still relevant?
DW: One is – Wladimir. He still has all the belts. Vitali has retired. I'm working my way towards a big showdown with Wladimir.
MF: What makes Malik Scott a tough opponent?
DW: Malik’s a great boxer – he's beat 37 out of the 38 people he's fought, and even his loss (to Chisora) was a bad stoppage. But he hasn't fought me yet and I'm totally different to anyone he's ever faced. It’s going to be a hell of a fight, however long it lasts.
MF: Have you been doing anything different in your strength and conditioning sessions to prepare for him?
DW: We work hard in the gym. A lot of heavyweight guys aren't in shape when it's time to fight but I always come ready. To make sure my conditioning is up to scratch my coach gets me to do lots of uphill interval runs on the treadmill. Core strength is also critical to boxing so I often stand on one leg on a bosu and catch a medicine ball. For strength and power we do cleans, jerks and shoulder presses, often while wearing a weight vest. Our programme is all about multi-tasking.
MF: Do you take any supplements to help you recover after all that?
DW: Nothing other than a multi-vitamin. All that stuff isn't going to make you a fighter – you can either do it or you can't.
MF: What music gets you pumped when you're training?
DW: In camp I bring in old school tunes, mostly from the late 70s. We play some good stuff by Rick James, Maze and Kool & the Gang. We crank it loud!

Brewer says she is stepping up to protect her state from crime because "decades of federal inaction and misguided policy have created a dangerous and unacceptable situation."

A call was made to the owner of the house to verify that the two were not authorized to be at the property, and both were arrested, charged with breaking and entering and damage to real property. One of the males was charged with resisting an officer, as well and both were transported to the Watauga County Detention Center. The investigation is continuing and verification of the identity of the individuals is being verified through the SBI, FBI and Immigration Customs Enforcement, and more arrests may be forthcoming.DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background
The Occupatioal Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act) authorizes the promulgation of such health and safety standards as are necessary or appropriate to provide safety or healthful employment and places of employment. The statute specifically authorizes information collection by employers as necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of the Act or for developing information regarding the causes and prevention of occupational injuries, illnesses, and accidents.
The standard requires employers to develop and implement a written housekeeping plan, to develop and implement an emergency action plan, to implement procedures for the use of tags and locks to prevent inadvertent operation of equipment being prepared, serviced or adjusted, and to prepare certification records after scheduled inspections of the mechanical and safety control equipment associated with dryers, grain stream processing equipment, and dust collection equipment..
The written housekeeping program is used by employers in understanding their duties and responsibilities as an integral part of an overall program to control dust; and, what specific actions they are to take to reduce dust accumulations at the facility. The written housekeeping program is also used by compliance officers as a measure of compliance to compare the planned actions specified in the housekeeping program to those actually implemented to maintain an effective dust control program.
Failure to have a written housekeeping program would result in the absence of a formalized policy on the part of the employer regarding the importance of the facility dust control program, what actions are to be taken during certain circumstances, and the duties and responsibilities of employees in removing dust accumulations. The absence of these factors could adversely impact the effectiveness of the facility dust control program.
Additionally, if an incident occurs, employees must be aware of the appropriate actions in advance that need to be taken during the emergency. The standard also requires that employers issue hot work permits when hot work is performed, that employers issue permits for entry into grain storage structures and that all mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic equipment which represents a danger to employees entering these structures be deenergized.
The hot work permit is to assure that the employer is aware of the hot work being performed and that appropriate safety precautions have been taken prior to beginning the work. The permit for entering bins, silos, or tanks is to assure that employers and employees know if these spaces are safe to enter, and the requirement to deenergize equipment which presents a danger to employees entering these bins, silos, or tanks is to assure that employees are not injured due to accidental energization of equipment.
The procedures for the use of tags and locks while servicing equipment is meant to prevent inadvertent injury to employees servicing equipment. Finally, the requirement for certification records of maintenance inspections confirms for the employer and employees that scheduled inspections have been performed.

Aggressive Rabbits
HRJ Letters –1998
Q. My rabbit Oreo is a dutch and she likes to bite. She has bitten several family members. Do you think if I play with her more, she will stop biting? Could you give me some tips?
Emily Horstmann
Howard Lake, MN
Q. I am writing in hopes of getting advice on my rabbit Turbo. She is a six month old dwarf rabbit and has recently been spayed. She is an indoor bunny. The problem is she has become very aggressive with maturity. We thought the spaying might help, but it hasn’t. If I shoo her off the couch or bend down to pet her, she lunges at my ankles and won’t stop until I either jump on the sofa or she bites me. I’ve grown very attached to her but this problem can’t be ignored. Do you have any advice?
Christie Green
La Mesa, CA
A. Often, aggression is the sign of a sexually frustrated or territorial rabbit. Neutering males and spaying females can dramatically reduce aggression behavior. But sometimes, aggression may have other causes and you need to figure out when and why your rabbit is biting.
Some rabbits nip when they want to communicate that they are unhappy with what you’re doing. Try squealing so she realizes she’s hurting you.
Rabbits have great long-distance eyesight, but not good near-vision. A human hand in front of a rabbit’s face can be startling. If you need to approach an aggressive rabbit, try bringing your hand down from above and away from the nose.
All rabbits can be territorial. Is she biting when you pull her out of her cage? Make sure a cage is a place she can feel secure by opening the door and letting her come out on her own. When you need to clean the cage, do it when she’s not inside.
Try to find patterns. Is she stressed out by new surroundings or loud noises? Do you try to grab the bunny every time you reach for her? You may need to make changes in the way you interact with your rabbit.
It’s safe to assume that your rabbit doesn’t hate you, and that physical punishment will not help. Protect yourself by wearing long sleeves, shoes and socks, and even gloves if necessary. Then you can respond to your rabbit and her aggression with affection, and teach her that you’re not out to hurt her.

A few years back, I think it was at the 2011 Santa Barbara film festival, I asked Christopher Nolan (then making the rounds for "Inception") if he could ever see himself heading back to the Independent Spirit Awards with a modest piece of work. After all, the director got his start at Slamdance in Park City, with the 1999 entry "Following," and again a couple years later with "Memento," which would later be recognized at the Spirits.
"It depends on the story," he told me at the time, before saying, tellingly, "I tend to think that if you have the chance to do a big film, you should do it while you can. I’m always worried maybe I won’t be able to do a big film again."
And indeed, November's "Interstellar" promises to be the biggest one yet. But as much of a fan of Nolan's large-scale work that I am, I'm actually very, very eager to see him scale it back again. His best output, in my opinion, is still "Memento," followed by "The Prestige," though the latter showed the signs of ungainly structure that has plagued some of his bigger efforts (particularly "The Dark Knight Rises"). It would be a good exercise, if nothing else.
Then again, it's not like the process has changed drastically as Nolan segued to bigger productions. As "Interstellar" star Matthew McConaughey told me in a recent interview, "Chris is a great mind.."
Maybe Nolan will catch the spark and try his hand at something smaller coming off a recently announced honor that he'll be receiving at the upcoming Slamdance fest, a tandem circuit focused on the most indie of indie productions. The organization has chosen Nolan as the inaugural recipient of the Founder's Award.
"Throughout his incredible successes, Christopher Nolan has stood firmly behind the Slamdance filmmaking community," Slamdance president and co-founder Peter Baxter said via press release. "We are honored to present him with Slamdance's inaugural Founder's Award."
Added Nolan, "Slamdance continues to provide an important forum for emerging filmmakers and I'm proud to be part of their history."
The 2014 Slamdance Film Festival runs Jan. 17th - 23.

(steps off the soapbox).-
A Syrian Christian who fled the fighting in his country believes that the Good Friday Stations of the Cross at the Coliseum.
“Christians are facing very serious problems and the Lebanese lived (with) the aftermath of their civil war for many years, so they understand,” said the 25-year-old Syrian.
The meditations focus on ongoing violence in the Middle East and Christian disunity, as well as the abuse of women and children and the promotion of abortion.
Six of the reflections were written by representatives from the six rites of the Catholic Church in Lebanon: Latin, Maronite, Melkite, Armenian, Syriac and Chaldean.
The remaining eight were composed by six different Catholic youth groups, a special needs group and a non-governmental organization.
“When rebels turned the Homs neighborhood of Hamadea into a battlefield about a year ago, 80,000 Christians were forced to leave,” Salibi recounted.
And in his estimation, the Lebanese “live in a volcano ready to erupt any time.”
“When Cardinal Bechara Boutros Rai visited Syria in February, he left a strong message of how important it is for Christians in the Middle East to unite,” said Salibi.
His visit to Syria was the first by the head of the Maronite Church since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943.
“Muslims and Christians lived side by side, like a rainbow, but people are now being forced to leave their country and this is making the region lose its uniqueness,” said Salibi.
“Christians play a very important role there since they make a bridge between the East and the West and between Islam Shiites and Sunnis,” he added.
The young people who helped write the reflections arrived in Assisi from Lebanon on March 26, and they will later make their way to Rome.

1. Ranomi Kromowidjojo (7/5)
2. Sarah Sjoestroem (11/2)
3. Fran Halsall (12/1)
Britta Steffen could certainly challenge for a medal here, but I see Kromowidjojo and Sjoestroem as Tier 1 and Halsall as Tier 1a. As Shanghai proved, this event has the potential to throw up some big shocks. I wonder how Alicia Coutts will be received in the call room after her allegations of foul play. A great bet would be Femke Heemskerk to medal at 16/1, don't sleep on the fact that she had the fastest split of anyone in the 4x100 free relay in Shanghai.

1. Camille Muffat (4/1)
2. Allison Schmitt (9/2)
3. Sarah Sjoestroem (12/1)
This has the potential to be the race of the games. Allison Schmitt's textile best time was an eye opener, but Muffat has been ultra consistent this year and has posted stunning times without being fully tapered. I give Muffat the slight edge. Sjoestroem for bronze will come as a surprise, and it feels wrong to bet against Federica Pellegrini, but I have a sneaky feeling Sjoestroem will have some special swims in London. Missy Franklin shouldn't be overlooked either despite being a long way back at US Trials.

1. Camille Muffat (8/11)
2. Federica Pellegrini (9/2)
3. Rebecca Adlington (4/1)
Muffat this year has shown that she has several race plans up her sleeve. If the first 200m is slow, she came back in 1:58.5 at the Canet leg of the Mare Nostrum and she has the speed in the 100m/200m free to go with early speed. Pellegrini, Adlington, Schmitt and Kylie Palmer are all in contention for silver and bronze but I will go with the reigning World and Olympic champions.
800 free
1. Rebecca Adlington (8/15)
2. Lotte Friis (10/3)
3. Katie Ledecky (10/1)
Friis has had a quiet year so far and sits 3.5 seconds back of Adlington in the world rankings, but she should be much closer when the final gets here. Ledecky is the ultimate wild card, at her age she could drop another chunk of time from her 8:19 at US Trials. Despite a couple of stern challengers, I still believe Rebecca Adlington has enough quality to take this.
Blimey I'd completely forgotten about elbow-gate! I've got Coutts down to win the 200IM...
My predictions
Women
50 - (no Alshammar, dammit) Kromowidjojo, Halsall, Hardy
100 - Kromowidjojo, Halsall, Steffen
200 - Muffat, Pellegrini, Schmitt
400 - Pellegrini, Muffat, Schmitt (who knows really, you could swap the 200/400 orders!)
800 - Adlington, Friis, Belmonte (think Maria has a much better shot here than in the tough 200/400 medley fields)
Men
50 - Manaudou (just bcs this would be hilarious), Cielo, Ervin
100 - Magnussen, Roberts, Adrian
200 - Lochte, Agnel, Biedermann
400 - Sun, Park, Biedermann
1500 - Sun, Joensen, Paltrinieri
I have to put Camille Muffat winning both the 400 and 800 free. She is just looking way too good in the water right now. With her recent 4:18-4:04 split at a race in France, I really think she will be unstoppable.
Sorry Jonas, Muffat's not entered the 800 free (thankfully from a British perspective). Start list is here -
Thank you Tom, I take everything back :) Such a shame she won't be swimming in it. Would have been one amazing race, that's for sure! Then I think it will either be Ledecky or your own Adlington.Members of the Denton City Council want a few priorities added to the city’s legislative agenda, a directive that came after being briefed this week on the upcoming biennium.
Council members are looking for efforts to reform payday lending practices, to retain local control over natural gas drilling and production, and to re-establish local authority following an unfavorable state court decision on vested rights earlier this year.
The city staff and lobbyists told the council during a workshop Tuesday that they are already trying to analyze legislation and prepare for the biennium.
The 83rd regular session of the Texas Legislature begins Jan. 8, but legislators have been pre-filing bills since Nov. 12.
Redistricting and the odd election schedule brought near historic levels of turnover to both the Texas House and Senate, according to Brandon Aghamalian, lobbyist with Focused Advocacy, which lobbies for the city at the state level. More than 75 members of both houses are starting either as freshman or sophomore legislators. Many of them have not come up through the ranks serving on city councils or school boards, Aghamalian said.
“We’ll see what that leads us to,” he said.
Overall, Texas cities will need to be defensive during the upcoming session, he said.
Aghamalian anticipated some give-and-take between the Legislature and the governor. Legislative leaders have said publicly that the state needs to tackle school funding and paying for water and transportation projects. Meanwhile, he said, Gov. Rick Perry has been touting “red meat” issues, such as Transportation Security Administration screenings, school vouchers and anti-abortion initiatives.
But it is the sunset bills for the Texas Ethics Commission, the Public Utilities Commission and Texas Railroad Commission — all up for reauthorization — that pose the most danger for cities and municipal-owned utilities, Aghamalian said.
“All the issues are germane and lots of damage can be done on the floor with amendments,” he said.
Focused Advocacy and the city staff recommended that Denton’s top priority issues be to preserve local budgeting authority and revenue sources, local control of zoning and land use planning and local control of Denton Municipal Electric.
In past legislative sessions, legislators have proposed regulating property appraisals or otherwise capping the amount of property taxes that local governments can collect. For the 83rd biennium, Denton would, along with other cities, oppose any effort to restrict local government revenues, unless they come with supplementary money from the state.
Several legislative trends also threaten cities with proposals that shore up vested rights and require landowners be compensated for zoning or regulatory changes. Denton and other cities are expected to advocate preserving municipal authority to manage growth, and without such burdens on local taxpayers.
Bills were introduced in the last session to deregulate municipal-owned utilities. The city would oppose legislation that would take away local control of DME.
Focused Advocacy and the.
Council member Kevin Roden told the staff and lobbyists, given the council’s struggle to regulate natural gas drilling and production, legislation preserving that local control should be a priority. The item was included as part of Denton’s general legislative agenda, relating to the city’s authority to regulate for health and safety, said city staff member Lindsey Baker.
Council member Dalton Gregory asked whether the city could recover some authority lost in the recent state court decision on vested rights in Harper Park Two vs. City of Austin.
“That has done a great deal to restrict cities,” Gregory said.
In the case, a developer sued Austin over a multi-use project, claiming it had vested rights in development rules in place when it applied for the parcel in 1985. Although the city argued current development rules applied, the court sided with the developer and agreed the company had vested rights from more than 25 years ago.
Since then, Denton adopted an ordinance, in advance of the rest of its rewrites for natural gas drilling and production, that established a procedure for a developer, including energy operators, to claim vested rights.
City attorney Anita Burgess said that the staff had discussed the matter, perhaps proposing legislation that would re-establish authority relating to gas drilling. But lobbying efforts could include other development rights, Burgess said.
Gregory also asked whether there would be reform legislation for payday and title lending.
“Or are they going to try to restrict cities from doing that?” Gregory said.
Dallas, Austin and San Antonio have all tried, through zoning authority, to limit the presence of payday and title lending businesses. Faith and nonprofit groups have criticized the state for its lax rules, which have lead to predatory lending practices.
The Consumer Service Alliance of Texas, an industry trade group, has sued Dallas and Austin over their ordinances.
Aghamalian said he believed several legislators would be working on that, including Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, and Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland.
However, he cautioned the City Council that if the Legislature does do some work to shore up rules for payday lending, it may also pre-empt cities from being able to regulate the businesses.
This may be the one time he would welcome pre-emption, Gregory said.
“If it’s adequate protection,” he said.

The allegations involve defensive lineman Andrew Basham, who signed with the Huskies last February but failed to qualify academically. If the allegations are found to be true, Lupoi would be guilty of a major NCAA violation, which could also result in trouble for his former boss, current USC coach Steve Sarkisian.
Mike Davis, a throwing coach who helped Basham win a state shotput title, told The Times that Tosh Lupoi, Washington’s defensive line coach, gave him $3,000 to cover private tutoring for Basham through a test preparation company. Davis said he also received $1,500 from Lupoi to reimburse Basham’s father for online classes Andrew could use to raise his grade-point average.
NCAA rules prohibit universities from paying for a prospect’s academic services. Head coaches are required to “promote an atmosphere of compliance” and are held responsible for the actions of assistant coaches and administrators who report, directly or indirectly, to them.
Be sure to read the whole story as it details the sneaky ways Lupoi passed cash to Davis.
Lupoi got his start at Cal, where he played in the early 2000s before coaching under Jeff Tedford. He earned a reputation as a great recruiter, bringing to Berkeley such national recruits as Keenan Allen and Chris Martin. He was then hired away to Washington by Sarksian in 2012 and had a hand in getting 5-star recruit Shaq Thompson to switch his commitment from the Bears to the Huskies. While he’s respected for his ability to relate to recruits, he’s long been suspected in recruiting circles of playing fast and loose with NCAA rules.
Now that Sarkisian has been hired by USC, the thought was that Lupoi might join him on staff. However, the USC compliance office is unlikely to let that happen now — “less than zero” is how a source from USC characterized those chances to the Times reporter.
If these allegations have any credence, it would mean major egg on the face of Trojans athletic director Pat Haden, who crowed about Sarkisian being “a good fit” for USC when he announced the hire a couple weeks ago. With USC still in the throes of NCAA probation, hiring a coach who himself hired an assistant who passed around cash to recruits and their coaches would not be a good thing, especially if Sarkisian is found to be culpable for failing to promote an atmosphere at Washington that respects NCAA rules.
It’s not easy to create a mess for two programs at once, but Lupoi appears to be well on his way.

Looking back at a classic primer of American design
By Jean Dunbar | From Preservation | March/April 2007
The Decoration of Houses
By Edith Wharton and Ogden Codman Jr.
Rizzoli, $35
Most fans of lean, midcentury modern sofas, bark-cloth draperies, and kidney-shaped coffee tables grew up with French provincial bedroom sets or baggy shabby-chic slipcovers. As soon as children know enough to loathe their parents' terrible taste, they long for something completely different—be it gurgling lava lamps or Grandmother's flocked damask wallpaper..
Noted architectural historian Richard Guy Wilson introduces the new edition. He adroitly traces what's known of the odd collaboration between Wharton—who would later write acclaimed novels, such as The House of Mirth and The Age of Innocence—and New England architect and decorator Codman. Having improved Wharton's Newport house, the duo set out to improve the public's approach to decorating.
The coauthors gleefully attack the mixed patterns, curtained door openings, wall-to-wall carpets with multicolored designs, and ever-present wallpaper of the late Victorian period. "Nothing," they proclaim, "is more distressing than the sight of a large oil-painting in a ponderous frame seemingly suspended from a spray of wild roses or any of the other naturalistic vegetation of the modern wall-paper." Not even the Old Colony style, which Codman himself practiced, escapes undished: It's accused of "attenuated laurel-wreaths combined with other puny attributes taken from Sheraton Cabinets and Adam mantel-pieces."
Taken together, these jibes provide a useful, if unintentional, overview of c.1860-1895 interiors and taste. During that period, design reformers of the Aesthetic and arts and crafts movements taught that a home's decorations and furnishings affected its inhabitants' characters. Good ("artistic") design improved; bad design and shoddy products corrupted. Wharton and Codman scoff at the idea that decoration has moral influence but share the reformers' conviction that design depends on universal principles.
In addition to critiques, they offer their own decorating principles and solutions to pesky problems, such as choosing colors for a small room and arranging furniture in a cavernous one. Yet if The Decoration of Houses only advised, its popularity would be hard to fathom. It lacks the spunky can-do attitude of Candace Wheeler's Principles of Home Decoration (1903) or Sidney Morse's Household Discoveries (1908). The authors often ignore cost or comfort, recommending against central heating and endorsing stone floors, prominent fireplaces, decorative wall painting, and tapestry hangings. Many principles they promote—good design matters more than materials, proper proportion is the key to pleasing design—were old hat in 1897.
Slightly foggy photographs of antique European rooms—rather than tasty examples of well-designed contemporary ones—punctuate the text. But they alert the reader that the book offers a groundbreaking history of interior decoration, introduced by an impressive list of the authors' sources. These include today's documentary gold standard, probate inventories of old houses' contents. Wharton and Codman explain how furnishings, architectural features, and individual rooms have responded to changing culture and technology. Despite heroic efforts to dismiss their parents' taste, these children of the design reform movement can't escape its central premise—that the way people live and the way they decorate are inseparable.
Wharton and Codman, in their turn, recognize past decor as a fossil record of the way people have lived. Sadly, this discovery is still new. All too often, "restoration" refreshes facades while gutting, stripping, and obliterating original interior decoration. Although Wilson believes The Decoration of Houses had "a major impact in America and England," no one knows exactly how its ideas affected houses decorated on Wharton and Codman's watch. Certainly, interior preservation today owes much to two friends who, while bashing their parents' bad taste, found inspiration and history in decorated rooms.

Mexico is paying homage to late Colombian author Alvaro Mutis (1923-2013), a major Latin American literary figure, with a three-day colloquium in this capital.
The seminar titled “With All Dreams Intact,” which began Friday and runs through Sunday, has brought together Mexican and Colombian fiction and non-fiction writers and poets to discuss Mutis’ legacy at Mexico City’s National Center for the Arts.
“We all lament the passing of Alvaro Mutis, who, like (his beloved literary character) Maqroll, we wanted to remain with us until the end of our own existence,” Mexican writer Jorge Ruiz Dueñas, one of the Colombian author’s closest friends, said.
During the opening of the colloquium, held during the inaugural Winter Lights Festival, Mutis’ widow, Carmen Mutis, thanked those in attendance for their show of affection and admiration for the 2001 Cervantes Prize recipient.
“I love that Alvaro is being remembered with so much affection. It pleases me greatly that all his friends and colleagues, poets and writers are here,” she told Efe.
Mutis, who was born in Bogota but lived for nearly 60 years in Mexico, suffered from Parkinson’s disease and cardiovascular ailments for several years and died of cardiorespiratory disease on Sept. 22 at the age of 90.
The author is best known as the creator of the literary character Maqroll the Gaviero, a rootless, cynical and weary sailor who embarks on adventures on sea and land in different parts of the world.
A tribute was also paid to Mutis earlier this month during the Guadalajara International Book Fair.Seatcraft Articulating LED Light

The overall activity and distribution of pyruvate carboxylase and of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in rat liver was studied by applying an improved technique for the fractional extraction of hepatic enzymes. In the rat the mean activity of pyruvate carboxylase amounted to 10 units/g fresh liver (1 unit = 1 μmole pyruvate carboxylated/min at 30°). In the human liver the corresponding value was about 1 unit/g fresh wt. For phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy-kinase 2.5 and 10 units/g fresh wt. were measured in rat and human liver, respectively. During fractional extraction only negligible quantities of pyruvate carboxylase appeared in the soluble cytoplasmatic fraction. It is concluded that the bulk of enzyme activity is located within the mitochondria. By digitonin treatment of isolated rat liver mitochondria pyruvate carboxylase could be localized within the matrix space. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was found to be located mainly in the soluble cytoplasmatic fraction. Our results strongly support the view that in rat liver gluconeogenesis pyruvate has to enter the mitochondria prior to its carboxy-lation to oxaloacetate.OFA Short Course Boasts Comprehensive Growers Program
The 2008 OFA Short Course — a must-attend event for industry professionals — is hailed for its targeted educational sessions. This year, growers can expect the same wealth of educational sessions on timely topics impacting their businesses and bottom lines.
The event, taking place July 12 to 15 in Columbus, Ohio, boasts a comprehensive grower program (along with a garden center program, management and marketing program, interior plantscape program and more). From innovative strategies to curb energy costs, to in-depth crop culture sessions, to communicating effectively with your Latino workers, to surviving the drought and the journey to sustainable certification, the sweeping grower program hits on all the hot issues facing growers today and beyond.
Here’s a sampling of what the grower program has to offer:
Innovations in Energy Savings in Greenhouses. Sponsored by the Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, this session tackles the issue on every grower’s mind: rocketing energy costs. Growers can learn what Dutch growers are doing and the new concepts and innovative technologies they’re employing, including the “closed greenhouse” and the “energy supplying greenhouse” to conserve energy.
Crop Culture Unplugged. Jim Barrett, professor of floriculture at the University of Florida in Gainesville and consulting editor for GPN, will lead an open discussion on poinsettia production issues. This is an opportunity to ask your pressing questions and learn from your peers’ experiences with cool temperature production, whitefly control, variety selection, growth regulators and more.
Communicating Effectively With Your Latino Workers. Learning Spanish is only half the battle in effectively communicating with your Latino/a workers. Claudio Pasian, associate professor in The Ohio State University’s Department of Horticulture and Crop Science, will discuss the other half of the battle: understanding Latino culture, with an emphasis on Mexican cultural and personality traits, as well as an examination of the differences between typical Anglo and Latino/a management styles.
“Green” Nuts & Bolts: The Journey to Certification. This session, sponsored by Ball Horticultural Company and BioWorks, will take you through the challenging journey of becoming sustainably certified. A group of panelists will share their experiences in their effort to become certified, and hopefully dispel some of your fears.

Vietnam & Cambodia Boutique River Cruise/Tours FAQs
The information provided below should help answer some questions you might have about Uniworld’s Boutique River Cruise and tour in Vietnam and Cambodia. Additional information can be found in the Cruise Companion guide for Vietnam and Cambodia in the BEFORE YOU GO section of this website. [link]
Q: Are visas required?
For US and Canadian citizens, a multiple-entry visa is required for Vietnam. Please see the VISAS section of our website for information about how to apply online. For entry to Cambodia, your Cruise/Tour Manger will obtain a visa for you while on tour. You will need to provide your passport, one passport photo, and $50 USD in cash for this purpose.
For optional extensions, a single-entry visa is required for Laos and no visa is required for Thailand. Please note that obtaining the proper visa(s) and any other required travel documentation is solely your responsibility.: Do I need vaccinations?
We recommend consulting your doctor to make sure your vaccinations are up to date and that you are in good health for the trip.
Q: What should I wear on my cruise/tour?
It’s best to pack for a range of weather conditions, depending on the season and the regions visited. Wearing layers of lightweight clothing—ideally in light colors—will allow you to easily adjust to temperature changes. Limiting your wardrobe to a simple mix-and-match color scheme will keep your bags to a minimum. Attire in Southeast Asia is more casual than it is in Europe, due to the warmer temperatures. We recommend wearing comfortable, smart-casual clothing onshore and onboard. We also suggest sturdy walking shoes, as you will do a significant amount of walking on shore excursions, often over unpaved or uneven terrain. A sun hat and rain gear are good items to have. Sports jackets and cocktail dresses are not necessary on this itinerary. Please note that shorts are not allowed at dinner aboard the ship.
Q: Is laundry service available?
Laundry service is available in all hotels and onboard your ship for an additional fee. No dry cleaning services are available onboard.
Q: What’s the food like?
Onboard the ship, our skilled chefs use fresh, locally sourced ingredients to prepare all meals, a mix of regionally-inspired and western dishes. Most included meals onshore will be at restaurants serving Asian cuisine.
Q: Can you accommodate special diets?
Kindly inform us if you have specific dietary requests (e.g., low-fat, low-calorie, sugar-free, vegetarian, vegan, etc.). We will do our best to accommodate your needs given the resources available to us.
Q: Can I drink the water?
The ship’s tap water can be used for washing, but please do not drink or brush your teeth with it. Complimentary bottled water for drinking and brushing teeth is provided onboard, and additional bottled water is available free of charge on all excursions. All hotels on this itinerary provide complimentary in-room water. When going ashore, we strongly advise against drinking tap water or any beverage served with ice.
Q: What about insects?
Insect repellant is always a good item to have on hand when traveling in Southeast Asia. Mosquitoes are rarely seen onboard whenever the ship is cruising.
Q: Can I use my credit and debit cards?
All onboard charges are billed to your onboard account. The official onboard currency is the US dollar. You may pay your charges at the end of the cruise with a credit card (Mastercard or Visa) or with cash (US dollars only). Most major credit cards are widely accepted throughout Asia at larger stores. Credit cards and most debit cards can be used for ATM cash withdrawals onshore (there is no ATM machine onboard the ship). Limited currency exchange is available onboard (cash only) and all major hotels have exchange facilities. Travelers Checks are not recommended. Vietnam’s currency is the dong, Cambodia’s the riel, Thailand’s the baht, and Lao’s the kip. Market vendors and small stores will usually only accept local currency (with the exception of Cambodia, which widely accepts US dollars). It is a good idea to carry a modest amount of cash in the local currency for tips or for purchasing souvenirs or sundries. We recommend letting your credit card issuer and bank know of your plans to travel aboard so they can expect foreign transactions on your account.
Q: What is the voltage?
The voltage in Vietnam and Cambodia is 220/50Hz in all hotels and onboard the ship. Onboard ship, the outlets in your stateroom can accommodate both 110v and 220v appliances. In hotels, your electrical appliances from home may require an adapter and/or converter, which your hotel might be able to loan to you. You will need a two round-pin plug adapter in Cambodia and a three-flat-pin plug adapter in Vietnam.
Q: Is there onboard Internet access?
Wi-Fi is not available onboard, but all hotels on this itinerary offer Internet access (an additional fee may apply, approximately $15-$20 USD per day).
Q: Where does the ship dock?
In many Asian ports, your ship is small enough to dock within easy walking distance of places of interest. Vietnam and Cambodia itinerary focuses on places of cultural and historical interest, some of which prohibit vehicles. You should be in good health and able to walk significant distances, often on unpaved or uneven terrain and up and down stairs. Docking facilities may differ from port to port and may be somewhat rudimentary; we will always ensure that gangways are safe and have crew members on hand to assist you. River cruise ships are not designed to accommodate wheelchairs or motor scooters, nor are many Asian buildings or historical sites. Guests with mobility issues may be unable to participate in all shore excursions, but are always welcome to relax onboard and enjoy a spa treatment or quiet time with a good book. Riverbanks and walkways can be dusty or muddy, so we kindly ask that you remove your footwear upon returning to the ship. We will clean your shoes and return them to you as soon as possible.
Q: How do I book optional excursions once onboard?
Optional excursions can be booked with your Cruise/Tour Manager and charged to your onboard account. Some optional excursions need a minimum number of participants to operate. There are no refunds for cancellations made within 24 hours of the tour start time or for pre-paid tours. On pre- and post-cruise/tour extensions, you may book optional excursions with your Local Host and pay by credit card (cash not accepted). Optional excursions cannot be reserved prior to the cruise.
Q: Is smoking allowed?
Smoking is not allowed onboard or on any sightseeing motorcoach. Onboard your ship, smoking is allowed only in a designated area of the Sun Deck. We also ask guests to refrain from smoking on shore excursions/tours.?
There are several optional pre- or post-cruise/tour land extensions available on this itinerary: Luang Prabang, Laos; Bangkok, Thailand; and Ha Long Bay, Vietnam. aim to follow the itinerary exactly as promoted, but reserve the right to make any necessary changes to ensure the safety of our guests and ships. If time permits, we will let you know of any changes before you board the ship.
Q: Does each group on excursions have its own guide?
Each group has its own English-speaking guide. Our local experts are considered the best in the industry, and our complimentary audio headsets make it easy to hear every word of their insightful commentary.
Q: Can I take children on my cruise?
In our experience, most children—especially those under 4—are not yet old enough to enjoy river cruising. We make no special arrangements for little ones and offer few kid-friendly activities onboard or onshore. Children under 18 must be accompanied by an adult 21 or older at all times.
Q: Is there onboard entertainment?
Talented local performers (music, dance, traditional arts, etc.) may come onboard from time to time to provide after-dinner entertainment.
Q: What about gratuities, either onboard or onshore?
Onboard gratuities for the ship’s staff, crew, and your onshore tour guides are not included in the price of your cruise. Guidelines for tipping can be found in the Cruise Companion for Vietnam and Cambodia. [link] When going ashore on your own, keep in mind that tipping is less expected and more modest in Asia than it is in North America (although equally appreciated). We suggest keeping some local currency on hand for tipping purposes whenever ashore..Taz October 25, 2013 8:59 AM How bad are the finances of Lotus?Boullier has been prattling on all year saying the team is secure and there's no issues and now they can't sign the driver unless they can sell of a chunk of the team.

-- Badtux the Cat-owned PenguinBayern Munich vs. Dortmund 2013 is shaping up to be a terrific Champions League Finals. And while Dortmund is fortunate enough to have a star in Robert Lewandowski, he will not be a factor in this match.
There is no denying Lewandowski's skill. Only 24, Lewandowski possesses a tremendous amount of athleticism, size, speed and technical skill. He's scored 35 goals this season. Karl-Heinz Riedle, who played for Dortmund in the 90s, told The Guardian that:
His superior technique and strength means you can play him up front all on his own..
That skill allows him to take advantage of any space the defense gives him. However, there will be less space against Bayern Munich. Twenty-year-old Mario Gotze, who is a tremendous midfielder with a knack for dangerous passes, often takes defensive pressure off of Lewandowski. Gotze is a goal scorer in his own right, with 24 this year. When the two are on the pitch together, defenses have to make a choice on whom to defend.
It'll be an easy choice for Bayern, as Gotze will miss the final with a hamstring injury. Instead of having to deal with two dynamic offensive players at once, Bayern can shift all of its defensive attention to stopping Lewandowski. By doing so, the Polish striker will have very little room with which to operate.
Even if Lewandowski can get a clear shot, he'll have to deal with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Neuer is on fire right now, with four clear sheets in the quarterfinals and semifinals:
#DidYouKnow @fcbayern keeper Manuel Neuer is the first man to keep 4 clean sheets in the QFs & SFs since Edwin van der Sar in 2008!— Champions Matchday (@ChampionsMag) May 23, 2013
Neuer is stopping everything he sees and is playing the best soccer of his career. With a great defense in front of him, Neuer probably won't see too many shots, and any shots he sees from Lewandowski will probably not be of the best quality.
Lewandowski is going to have a tough time. His skill is undeniable, but the circumstances in this matchup make it difficult for Lewandowski to make a huge impact.
Without Lewndowski, Dortmund will have a tough time beating the better Bayern team. This game could get ugly.Chapter 4
I knew I would help her as much as I could. Yet I hadn't managed to tell her that, which meant she would have to hope I would, because I can't see any other way of getting out of Badgers grip, no girl had beforehand.
Hidden in the bushes I watched her reaction to seeing The School. Her mouth dropped open and her eyes opened wide, from this angle her wavy blonde fell over her shoulders but didn't cover her face like it did from the other side giving me a perfect view of her. She was beautiful. My stomach tightened as I gazed at her and I knew she would be the one for me, but I mustn't let her know that, she would never trust me then.
Pushing down the want and other feelings I didn't want her to know about, I watched Badger slip the blindfold over her face and tie and knot in the back. He then grabbed her hand, hard. She reacted and pulled back.
He hung on and said to her "Don't fight me girl, it will just make it worse for you later".
Obviously reacting to the threat she let him hold her hand, yet she stood away from him, uncomfortable.
He led her by the hand to the entrance doors, then letting her step across the threshold first; he continued to drag her to the stairs. I knew from seeing what he did to other girls he would let go of her hand and force her to walk up the stairs by herself, just to embarrass her, and that would be the perfect time to tell her that I was willing to help her.
Walking only a few paces behind the teacher and her, I kept pace well as we walked down the corridor, with all the arches leading to the classrooms I couldn't help but admire the beauty, I did every time as it still managed to impress me.
As we reached the end of the corridor, we went up the steps, watching her stumble, then down the next corridor with all the rooms for students before reaching the teachers staircase. At the bottom of this, Badger turned round, seeing me standing nearby he glared and I smiled politely back at him, I was so glad I didn't have him as a teacher or he would fail me with that horrid grin on his face all the way through.
He spoke out at me then "Otter, what brings you here on such a nice evening, surely you should be revising?" the sweetness in his voice was disgusting, she tensed up at the mention of my name, turning slowly to try and figure out where I was standing.
Answering with the same sweet tone, I said "As you should be planning your lessons, not getting off with a girl that's at least one quarter of your age"
"An old man like me can still enjoy the pleasures of a girl's body, whether young or old"
"Yes, but surely you can see her age and height fits me much better than you" and this time I was speaking truthfully.
"Aw, the poor young boy has fallen for a girl that he can never have"
"Ah but your wrong there, I can have her, and will have her!"
"You let your feelings rule you. You should know by now that a teacher always beats a student"
"This isn't about lessons, old man, this is about her"
"Do you even know her name; does she even trust you with that?"
Freezing I knew he had me now, until she spoke up "Ellie, my name is Ellie"
Surprised Badger turned round to see than Ellie had managed to take her blindfold off and was standing with a strength that I didn't know a girl could process.
"and you" she continued talking and pointed at Badger "chose the wrong girl to try and kidnap" and with that hanging in the air she made a run for it to the left, towards my room.

For better or worse, we can’t control how far sound travels and it is not fair to restrict access to a public or private non-related venue because of errant “free” sound waves, i.e., those the producer is logistically unable to charge for.
Where would this stop? Would they not allow homeowners to go out onto their decks and patios so they wouldn’t hear the sound free of charge? Ridiculous. Maybe they should just turn it down!

Christmas is for children, we are told, or for the child in all of us.
Knowing this is what makes this particular Christmas so terribly hard, as we think of 20 homes in Connecticut where stockings hung by the chimney will remain unclaimed, six more where a mother or grandmother or sister or aunt is gone forever.
The jolliest holiday of the year blighted forever in the hearts of those families and, indeed, by an entire town, because a deranged gunman turned his madness on innocent first-graders at an elementary school and also killed the adults who tried to defend them and his own mother.
We cannot make sense of this slaughter. There is no way to do it. But there are children out there, even in our communities, who are headed down roads that will end in early death. They need our help. They are the heirs of the children Charles Dickens urged us to embrace as our own almost 170 years ago when he wrote "A Christmas Carol."
His book about the miser Ebenezer Scrooge and how the visits of four spirits convinced him to mend his ways is full of children. Some of them are healthy and happy, capering around their mothers and fathers, gobbling onion and sage dressing, riding ponies in the country and singing carols in the streets of London.
Others are not so lucky. We think especially of Tiny Tim, the frail youngest son of the Cratchit family, whose little body was supported by an iron brace and who needed a crutch to walk. In Dickens' story, Scrooge is shown a vision of what will happen if he does not mend his ways and open his purse to Tim's father, who is his underpaid clerk.
It was common then to lay a body out in the home before a funeral, and Dickens poignantly describes Bob Cratchit's vigil. ."
The other children who stand out in Dickens' story are the starving pair who hide under the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present. The girl is called Want, the boy is Ignorance. "Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased," the spirit warns Scrooge.
"A Christmas Carol" was written and produced in less than six weeks, inspired by a visit Dickens made to the industrial hellhole city of Manchester. According to Les Standifer's book "The Man Who Invented Christmas," the child mortality rate among Manchester working class families in 1843 was fearsome: 57 percent did not live to see their fifth birthday.
Thanks to better food, hygiene and antibiotics, such statistics are far behind us now in the industrialized world. But children still die early in this very community of neglect, abuse and, yes, murder. Others will grow up in homes and neighborhoods that are so dysfunctional they will wield guns themselves. The intervention of a caring adult could make a difference for such a child, and society at large.
Scrooge learned his lesson during his night of ghostly visitations. He woke up on Christmas morning and contributed generously to a charity for the poor. He made amends with his nephew. He gave Bob Cratchit a raise.
But the most important thing Scrooge did was to learn to "honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year." The best thing we can do in the wake of the tragedy in Newtown is follow his example, and find some child to befriend and mentor year-round. There is an elementary school near you that would welcome you with open arms.

Glock … the book, the gun, the gun nut.
There is an interesting interview with Paul Barrett, author of Glock: The Rise of America’s Gun
, published here. What I find most interesting about it is the way gun owners as a group are characterized. At several moments in time, private ownership of Glock pistols increased significantly for reasons that one would normally find explaining the behavior of toddlers, or dogs, or monkeys in an experimental setting, not sentient adult humans. For instance, the cops start using Glocks, and gun owners automatically want to use what the cops use. Or, a made up fictional Glock (the Glock 7) is described in a Lethal Weapon movie, where everything about it is wrong (remember, it’s fictional) and this enrages gun owners who run out and buy Glocks. And so on and so forth.
Now, one of the things that seems to rive Glock sales is the fact that they have been used in an increasingly larger number of tragic and horrific massacres on American soil. Somehow, the association with angry carnage and hateful violence makes American gun owners want one.
Glocks hold more ammo than other pistols, can be fitted with super-large ammo holders, and have a trigger that is very smooth making it easier for untalented amateurs to be better shots. Glocks should be banned.The First and Second Balkan Wars (1912-1913) First and Second Balkan Wars (1912-1913): Selected full-text books and articles

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has issued a warning to the Tories to concentrate on fighting the "firestorm" in the eurozone rather than trying to re-negotiate Britain's membership of the EU.
In an interview with The Guardian, Mr Clegg said the priority should be to "put out the fire in the eurozone and to come out of this phase of economic emergency".
The Prime Minister is widely expected to promise a referendum ahead of the 2015 general election.
Mr Clegg said: "I think to have a referendum, kind of about nothing very much in particular, when you're in the middle of an emergency repair job to your own economy and European economy, is putting the cart before the horse."AIDEA Finances Nome Fuel Storage Expansion
Board Approves Energy Development Loan Participation
(Anchorage) – The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) Board at its recent meeting in Ketchikan unanimously approved an energy development loan participation for a project located in Nome.
The loan, to Bonanza Fuel, LLC, is for $7,312,500 (90%) of an $8,125,000 loan brought to AIDEA by Northrim Bank. Northrim originated the loan and is participating with $812,500. The purpose of this loan is for long term financing for the expansion of a petroleum storage facility.
The project adds three storage tanks to the existing six tanks at the facility, and increases storage capacity by 2.3 million gallons to a total of 5.9 million gallons. The project also increases competition among local fuel suppliers and enhances the development of Nome’s harbor by providing additional fuel storage to meet increasing demands for marine traffic in the Bering Straits. Additionally, this increased storage capacity reduces the likelihood of a fuel shortage in Nome. The project generated 15 construction jobs and creates three new permanent positions..It is nine in the morning. The Momma has already changed two dirty diapers.

Objective:
In this experiment, students will discover which battery composition lasts the longest.
Research Questions:
- How does a battery work?
- What are rechargeable batteries?
Materials:
- Carbon Zinc Batteries (such as Eveready)
- Zinc Chloride Batteries (Panasonic makes some)
- Alkaline Batteries (Duracell)
- Lithium Manganese Batteries (such as Sony)
- Nickel Cadmium Batteries (these are labeled rechargeable, but for this experiment, they will not be recharged)
- Rechargeable Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries (such as Energizer, will not be recharged for this experiment)
- Lithium Ion batteries (such as Panasonic, will not be recharged)
- A device that drains a lot of power in a relatively short time (such as a digital camera)
- Timer
- Pen/paper for notes
Experimental Procedure
- Take your first battery type and put it inside your chosen device. Turn the device on and leave it on consecutively until the batteries “die”. This time should vary and you should time the duration.
- If you are not present when the batteries “die”, you should set up a camera and leave it on to monitor the exact time it does “die”.
- Do the same for all your batteries and compare how long it lasts.

I have a huge soft spot for cinnamon rolls!
I really enjoyed making these cinnamon rolls. I never knew they could be easy to make and actually taste good homemade! I learned that you can cut the dough after it is rolled with floss. I would have never thought to do that.
this was a fun thing to make in class?

i've heard people say before that roger moore is THE 007 to them because he's the first they ever saw, but i just don't get it.
that's like saying, "the first version of 'psycho' i ever saw was the remake with vince vaughn as norman bates, so to me, vaughn will always be the best norman bates, not anthony perkins."
yes, the first bond i ever saw was moore, but i got over it IMMEDIATELY after i saw one starring sean connery. :-)
but anyway, all bond movies are so good (even when they're so BAD) that i'll watch any one of them over and over and over again. and they're great fun to argue about!

Memphis Grizzlies owner Pera was set to play Memphis guard Tony Allen in some friendly 1-on-1 for charity. As that has yet to pan out, somehow Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban got tossed in the mix. Pera, wondering where the Cuban talk came from, upped his game.
“If we are talking an owner game, get me MJ! I’ll up the charity contribution to $1mm,” he tweeted.
Bold.
While Pera had promised to make “quick work” of Cuban, he didn’t use that talk when mentioning Michael Jordan. Jordan would easily take him, no doubt, but Michael should know Pera does have some skills.
UPI reports that the money raised by Robert Pera vs. Michael Jordan would go to St. Jude’s Research Hospital.
Michael Jordan has yet to respond to his colleague’s friendly challenge, but seriously, Michael, how hard could it be? Break out the old Air Jordan shoes and show the kid how it’s done.
If we are talking an owner game, get me MJ! I’ll up the charity contribution to $1mm
— Robert J Pera (@RobertPera) October 15, 2013
Do you think Michael Jordan will accept the challenge? Does Michael Jordan Have what it takes to defeat a fellow owner? Can Robert Pera beat Michael Jordan?The 2014 Detroit auto show, the chosen venue for Subaru’s big reveal of the 2015 WRX STI, hasn’t even happened yet and, sure enough, we’ve already seen the 2015 WRX STI. While that car’s online debut wasn’t intentional—the photos leaked onto a Mexican website—the digital unveiling of its racing cousin, destined for the 24 Hours Nürburgring endurance race, was. The car made its in-the-metal debut, fittingly, at the 2014 Tokyo auto salon aftermarket show.
- First Drive: 2015 Subaru WRX Sedan
- Instrumented Test: 2013 Subaru XV Crosstrek 2.0i
- Comparison Test: 2015 Volkswagen GTI vs. 2013 Ford Focus ST
Looking somewhat sleeker than the square-jawed, rally-bred production WRX STI, the endurance racer nonetheless maintains the donor car’s hood scoop, prominent rear wing, and even wears a vaguely World Rally Blue–esque paint color. Subaru isn’t talking powertrain or chassis details quite yet, but we’re sure those will be impressive. We expect the standard car will use a nearly 300-hp 2.0-liter turbo four, so don’t be surprised if this race car gets a stronger version of the same deal. It will compete in the SP3T class of the 2014 24 Hours Nürburgring race that starts June 19, where it will seek its third victory. Subaru last won its class at the ‘Ring in 2012.Friday

Abstract
Numerical simulations were conducted to study the melt flow under the influence of control devices in a T-type two-strand bloom caster tundish via the open source Computational Fluid Dynamics software OpenFOAM. Three different cases were studied: a bare tundish, a tundish with two pairs of baffles, and a tundish equipped with a turbulence inhibitor and a pair of baffles. Turbulence inhibitor and baffles arrangement showed an improvement of the fluid flow characteristics, yielding lower values of dead volume and higher values of plug flow. With a turbulence inhibitor, the velocity of metal which flows directly toward the tundish floor is smaller and the turbulence kinetic energy of the melt top surface is lower than the other two arrangements.
1. Introduction
In the steel production route, continuous casting of liquid steel is the most important process. Basically, the tundish in the continuous casting is an intermediate vessel between the ladle and the mold to distribute and supply liquid steel to different molds at an approximately constant rate (Figure 1). In recent years, tundish has become more of a continuous reactor than merely an intermediate buffer to distribute and supply liquid steel with an approximately constant rate [1]. Various metallurgical operations, such as alloy trimming of steel, thermal and chemical homogenization, inclusion separation and floatation, are carried out in steel making tundishes. The time available for these operations is very short, and therefore, it is necessary to have a good understanding of fluid flow behavior in the tundish. Generally, two research methods, physical modeling and mathematical simulation [2–5], are used for the tundish configurations optimization and flow control devices, such as weirs, dams, baffles with inclined holes, and turbulence inhibitors (TI), have been widely used to increase residence times and plug flow volume of liquid steel [6–8].
Since detailed knowledge of the molten steel flow is a prerequisite to any effective flow-control optimization, significant efforts have been made by researchers to investigate fluid flow phenomena in tundish systems. Estimation of the various residence time distribution (RTD) parameters via the pulse tracer addition technique has been widely used to study the fluid flow patterns in tundish system [9–11]. In such studies, a tracer (e.g., dye, acid, or salt) is injected through the incoming water stream and its concentration at the exit is recorded as a function of time. The plot of the exit concentration against time is known as the RTD curve. The RTD of the fluid in a tundish is analyzed to characterize the flow which, normally, includes the determination of the extent of mixing (plug and mixed volumes) and the dead volume in the tundish. And it has been generally considered that the mathematical model is able to simulate RTD phenomena realistically [12–14].
In the present, work fluid flow in a 30?t tundish with different flow control devices was investigated by mathematical models. In each case of study, flow characteristics, velocity patterns, RTD curves, and inclusion distribution were obtained. The objective in this work was to study the effects of the flow control devices on the fluid flow pattern and RTD curves in a T-type two-strand tundish of a bloom caster.
Figure 2 shows the physical dimensions of this problem. Design of the baffles and the turbulence inhibitor as well as the positions of the TI and baffles inside the tundish is also indicated in Figure 2. Three types of the tundishes were studied as follows: the bare tundish (Case I), a tundish with a pair of baffles (Case II), and a tundish with a TI and a pair of baffles (Case III). The cross-section of slab is 1600?mm × 200?mm and the casting speed is 1.2?m/min, so the corresponding flow rate is 0.768?m3/min.
2. Mathematic Formulation
2.1. Fundamental Equations
The liquid steel flow in the continuous casting tundish can be considered to be three-dimensional, Newtonian, and incompressible turbulence. A layer of slag at the top of liquid is neglected and the melt surface is assumed to be flat. The mathematical model, which is used to simulate the melt flow inside the tundish as well as the chemical mixing process of the tracer injected by a pulse in the incoming stream, was formulated based on the solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, the mass transfer equation, and two equations for the - model chosen to represent turbulent viscosity.
Continuity equation:
Momentum equation: where are the time-averaged fluid velocities in the th and th directions, respectively, is the liquid density, is the pressure in the fluid, is the effective turbulent viscosity, is the gravitational acceleration in the th direction, , are the spatial coordinates in the th and th directions, respectively, and , denote the three directions in the global Cartesian coordinate system.
Effective viscosity is the sum of laminar viscosity and turbulent viscosity : The following equation describes the turbulent kinetic energy: The following equation describes the dissipation rate of turbulence energy: where is the generation of turbulence kinetic energy caused by the mean velocity gradients: The values for the constants in this - model , , , , and are 1.44, 1.92, 0.09, 1.00, and 1.30, respectively [15].
Mass transfer equation:
In the mass transfer equations, is the tracer concentration. is the effective mass transfer diffusivity, which is the summation of molecular and turbulent diffusivities, respectively. The turbulent diffusivity is related to the turbulent viscosity by which means that the turbulent Schmidt number is equal to one.
2.2. Boundary and Initial Conditions
Due to symmetry, only a half tundish from the symmetric central-longitudinal plane was chosen for this mathematical simulation. On the top surface of the bath and in symmetry planes, the fluxes of all variables were set equal to zero. No slip conditions were applied to all solid surfaces of the tundish including baffles, and interior walls of the tundish and standard wall functions were applied. The tundish exit is computationally treated as a plane, at which flow occurs at an ambient pressure. The vertical velocity profiles of the liquid steel at the inlet of the tundish were assumed to be uniform through the cross-sections and the other two velocity components were assumed to be zero. The values of and at the inlet were calculated from the inlet average velocity through the following equations:
The initial condition for (5) is that the tracer concentration is zero except in the ladle nozzle from the injection point to the nozzle tip.
2.3. Geometry and Numerical Methods
A control volume-based technique was used to convert the nonlinear governing equations to algebraic equations that can be solved numerically using the 3D mesh (Figure 3). A dense mesh was employed near the wall of the tundish. SIMPLE algorithm [16] was applied for the pressure-velocity coupling. A segregated and implicit solver was used to solve the governing equations and the second-order accuracy upwind differencing scheme was adopted to improve the accuracy of the solution. The open source Computational Fluid Dynamics software OpenFOAM [17] was used to compute the velocity and concentration fields. OpenFOAM is an open source code which is designed for continuum mechanics applications and has attracted much attention recently. It is an object oriented programming based toolbox which makes it sustainable in terms of reuse and development by users all around the world. OpenFOAM gives a flexible framework which combined almost all the required tools for solving CFD problem. Firstly, (1)–(4) were solved together with their boundary conditions until the steady state of the fluid flow was reached. Then the velocity field was employed to solve (7) for the tracer concentration under unsteady state conditions. Here, the tracer was treated as a passive scalar; that is, the presence of the tracer does not affect the melt flow. A criterion for convergence was set to be less than 10-5 on all variables and computations were carried out until the relative sum of residuals on all variables fell below the stipulated value.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Model Validation
In this section, the fluid flow model was validated against the experimental data [18] in the water model for a single inlet, single outlet tundish in which the tracer concentrations with time at the outlet were measured. The bath height was kept at 260?mm in the experiment and the same height was used for the model accordingly. Figure 4 shows the temporal variation of the tracer concentration (nondimensional) with nondimensional time and its comparison with the experiment. It can be seen that the overall characteristics of the RTD curve predicted by the present mathematical model match quite well with the experimental data although some delays existed.
A typical grid independence test (i.e., 51 × 58 × 34, 63 × 79 × 40, and 76 × 96 × 48) of the present numerical calculation was evaluated in Figure 5 which shows the profiles of the velocity at various transverse positions in the symmetry plane of the bare tundish (,??,??). According to the results, the grid size schemes of 63 × 79 × 40 and 76 × 96 × 48 have almost the same velocity magnitude distribution, which demonstrates that the grid size scheme of 63 × 79 × 40 is accurate enough for the present numerical calculation.
3.2. Effects of the Control Devices on the RTD Curve
Figure 6 shows the comparison of the RTD for the three studied cases. The curve for Case I is characterized by two peak values of concentrations, one soon after the tracer injection and then the second. After then, the tracer concentration decreases continuously with time. This is because a portion of the liquid moves on the horizontal plane straight towards the exit [19]. The existence of the two peak values of concentration may suggest that the flow field in the tundish is short circuited and that is undesirable in tundish fluid system. Thus the bare tundish is associated with considerable short-circuiting and large dead volumes, which are potentially detrimental to the floatation of nonmetallic inclusions. As seen from Figure 6, the RTD parameters in Case II and III are improved considerably and only one peak value appeared.
From the RTD curves, minimum residence time, , peak concentration time, , and mean residence time, , can be obtained for each case. Considering that there is fluid exchange between the fluids in the dead zone and in the active zone, the flow model proposed by Sahai and Emi [20] was employed in this work to calculate dead volume fraction, the fractions of plug flow and well-mixed volumes.
Table 1 shows a summary of the flow characteristics in the tundish with different flow control devices. Each volume fraction of flow for the studied cases is shown in Figure 7. It can be seen that the associated dead volume is significantly high for the bare tundish. The application of baffles brings down the dead volume from 54% to 24% and it is further decreased to 16% with the TI+baffle configuration as is clearly mentioned in Table 1. The better mixing in the tundish occurs corresponding to higher well-mixed along with lower dead volume and therefore it is also expected for better temperature homogenization. At the same time, higher plug volume with minimum dead region shows the better inclusion removal in the tundish.
3.3. Analysis of Velocity Fields
Figure 8 shows the predicted flow fields in one half of the two-strand bare tundish system which represent the velocity fields in plane (central longitudinal vertical plane) at (inlet stream). Highly turbulent flow can be clearly seen near the inlet region of the tundish. The incoming jet hits the tundish bottom with very high velocity, which is evidently shown in Figure 8(a). After striking the tundish bottom, the melt partly moves up along the tundish side walls to the free surface, partly moving downstream to the exit and the rest recirculating back toward the incoming jet. The strong velocity fields thus created are responsible for reversal of flow towards the inlet stream and generated clockwise recirculatory flow. The impact of the melt flow on the walls will result in high refractory wear in the entry zone and the wall refractory wear will increase the exogenous inclusion count of the steel supplied to the molds. Figure 8(b) shows the flow fields for Case II, which is very similar to Case I. With the aid of the TI in Case III, though the recirculating flow remains, it is directed toward the tundish floor and the turbulent flow with smaller velocity vectors is well controlled, as shown in Figure 8(c). At the same time, due to the high turbulence level in the TI area, it would be the best region to make any alloy additions in the tundish. And along with the higher convective and diffusive mixing in this region, the alloy will get uniformly distributed in the rest of the tundish, which results in homogeneity during the casting.
Figure 9(a) through Figure 9(c) shows the predicted turbulence kinetic energy contours along the top surface of one half of the tundish for Cases I, II, and III, respectively. The high turbulence kinetic energy is associated with the liquid steel top surface instability and the entrainment of the slag. As seen from Figure 9(a), the highest value of the turbulence kinetic energy is found in the region just above the inlet stream and it is ?m2/s2?per?kg of the liquid. With a pair of baffles, the highest value is lowered to ?m2/s2?per?kg of the liquid (Figure 9(b)). For Case III as shown in Figure 9(c), the turbulence kinetic energy is greatly decreased and the highest value is ?m2/s2?per?kg of the liquid.
4. Conclusions
A numerical study was conducted to investigate the fluid flow and residence time distribution of the T-type two-strand continuous casting tundish with and without flow control devices. The following conclusions have been drawn from the present study.(i)The application of a pair of baffles eliminates the short circuiting phenomena in the tundish and brings down the dead volume from 54% to 24%.(ii)The employment of a TI and a pair of baffles is more effective to increase the plug fraction than a bare tundish or a tundish with just a pair of baffles, and it was found to be an optimum configuration of the two-strand tundish in the present study.(iii)With a TI, the velocity vectors directed toward the tundish floor are smaller and the turbulence kinetic energy of the liquid steel top surface is lower than the other two arrangements, which means a more stable slag-metal interface.

Worried about test results...
I had a miscarriage this past March. Last week I was sure I was pregnant. I never had a BFP but I had all the signs. Then on Friday night I had horrible cramps and heavy brown discharge that looked like mud. I went to the doctor this morning. They said its possible I had another miscarriage. They are sending me for blood work and to have an ultrasound to make sure everything is ok. My husband and I were planning on starting to try in December but we don't care if it happens earlier so we're not being careful. I'm just afraid they are going to find something wrong and I will find out I can't have kids. I'm 31 and wonder if I waited to long to start a family... I've never had any sort of menstrual problems in my past. When I was at the doctor they really didn't tell me much...just wanted me to go have some tests. It just makes me nervous.. Has anyone else had similar issues?

The Eighth Circuit's newest Clean Water Act opinion marks a substantial victory for businesses who are required to get a jurisdictional determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The decision sets the Eighth Circuit apart from other jurisdictions where the only way to challenge an adverse jurisdictional determination is to either (1) complete the entire permitting process and then seek judicial review, or (2) risk substantial enforcement penalties by conducting activities without a permit and then challenging any enforcement action taken. Rejecting this unfair choice as a "transparently obvious litigation strategy" that "ignores reality," the Eighth Circuit has held that that a judicial determination is a final agency action that is ripe for judicial review.Shrouded in a cloak of mystery, likely cloistered in a tricked-out Parisian garret, Donda — Kanye West’s startup to end all startups — exists.
That’s pretty much all we know, based on a passing mention of the “creative agency that oversees his nonmusical ventures” in a recent W profile of Mr. West.
The agency’s only mentioned as a means of identifying Virgil Abloh, Mr. West’s “close collaborator at Donda,” in the W profile. Mr. Abloh also acts as Mr. West’s totally crucial full-time style adviser, according to this YouTube video from Chicago magazine.
We first got wind of Donda, which is named for the rapper’s late mother, when Mr. West went on an epic Twitter rant in January 2012. He declared:.
After Mr. West deleted all his tweets, we didn’t hear another peep about Donda — aside from an online hoax. The company doesn’t appear to have an official web presence.
So what goes on chez Donda on the daily, aside from Mr. Abloh picking out Mr. West’s outfits? Mr. West’s post as creative director for The Jetsons movie seems like a perfect fit for the agency, as does his burgeoning side gig as a fashion designer, detailed in the W piece.

This company will make one great Harvard Case Study some day. Right now, Saturn, Cadillac, and Yellowstone all deserve some critical comments.
First, Yellowstone (the U.S. version of GM's Brazilian Blue Macaw venture):
n The prototype plant, Blue Macaw in Brazil, isn't even in production, yet here is GM promising to build U.S. versions when it doesn't know if, or how well, the system works. I understand that the experimental VW truck plant in Brazil hasn't worked. The GM Brazil experiment might work; it's just that GM says it will build such plants here without knowing.
n Will GM really save on labor costs? Modules may come from suppliers, but any "saved" workers will be paid by GM for the remainder of their working lives (and then go on GM pension). So how do you save on labor costs?
n The GM modular plant is said to be a replacement for the Lordstown, OH, plant. But is the problem high-cost production, or that Lordstown's Cavaliers don't sell for top dollar? Why not design and build a car that's worth $3,000 more?
In fact, the whole point of the Lordstown plant was to build a cheap small car. They hired 19-year-olds who had been pumping gas for minimum wage, figuring they would really put out, and run the line at 100 cars an hour.
That's right. I was there. Lordstown was the birthplace of "the Blue Collar blues." Four days of GM wages were enough to pay for a terrific weekend drunk for a teenager, so why work five days? And those youngsters didn't like to be told what to do, either. Worse, the car they built was the Chevy Vega, a dog.
I wonder if anyone on the GM board will ask these questions.
Now about Saturn:
The old Saturn is dead, gone, ended. GM killed the magic. Now please, Don Hudler (Saturn President), don't write one of those long letters saying it ain't so. I love you, you are the best. Maybe a new and better Saturn can be built from the rubble, but the old one is gone.
They are taking the product engineers away and sending them back to GM. Take the engineers away from a car company, and it isn't a car company anymore.
I figure the new head of Saturn, after Mr. Hudler, will come in with a new motto:
"The same kind of car, the same kind of company."
And that guy will know how to salute:
Yes SUH! We don't need no plastic bodies, SUH!
No SUH! We don't need no separate engine, SUH!
If they had built the convertible and small SUV off the Saturn platform, Spring Hill would be running full now. And if they had approved that second car years ago, as they should have . . . but then for all the sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest are these: "It might have been."
So just don't write the letter, Don. Maybe you can build a new and better Saturn. I know you will give it your best shot.
And then there's Cadillac:
When I hear of Cadillac's plans, I think of my fantasy life. I throw the winning touchdown pass for the Lions in the Super Bowl. I catch Osama bin Laden singlehandedly and win the Congressional Medal of Honor. Pamela Anderson Lee wants me.
Let's look at the record of this outfit. Not all of the errors of the past, just the past few years.
Global: How much effort has there been to sell Cadillacs in Europe? How many exclusive showrooms are in the best locations, as Lexus did here? And who distributes Cadillac in Europe? Is it Cadillac, or some international GM entity that would rather sell a German Opel than a Detroit Cadillac?
Marketing: When Cadillac didn't fire the Catera agency - you remember the ducks - they showed they weren't serious people. Serious people don't reward mistakes.
Product: Let's not even get into that.
You say I criticize them when they don't do anything, and now I'm criticizing them for planning lots of things. Maybe you are right. but I would really like to see Cadillac do just one thing right: A great new rear-drive Catera with great marketing. Then I would believe.
Until then, all this sounds like my fantasy life.Bad Blood

In a word, no.
“A lot of people are fearful,” said Stefania Cardinali, an associate real-estate broker at Citi Habitats in New York. “Not everyone is familiar with dogs and cats.”
Beyond buyers’ phobias and allergies, there is also the potential for mishaps such as biting, jumping or clawing,” without needing to use a lint brush afterward, Cardinali said.
“A showing is not just about looking but about relaxing and enjoying the space.”
As for pet toys and accessories: The fewer the buyer sees, the better, said Joan Dineen, an architect and dog owner who recently put her New York home on the market.

Leave only those accessories that work with your decor.

Just before each showing, she said, thoroughly “de-fur” all surfaces and make sure there is no visible pet-related damage. Dineen’s dog, Charlotte, has been known to chew bedspreads and carpets.

As Saudis and others oil production is over priced by the Wall Street commodity manipulators and USA government keeping a blind eyes on the issue.., it means that people pays for the costs keeping the vulture capitalism practice in thievery.., in Israel the government practicing an Apartheid-Slavery method practiced by Dutch immigrants in South Africa.., yet Israel is safeguarded by vulture capitalism.., that tells me the both system are thieves and people are slaved.

The recruiting calendar flips Wednesday, National Signing Day, as South Florida's best high school football players finalize their recruitment by putting pen to paper and signing their letters-of-intent.
The majority of South Florida's prospects have already declared with whom they will sign Wednesday, but nothing is official or binding until the signed document reaches the school. Will we see cold feet, second thoughts or last-minute flips?
And then there are players who have kept their intentions quiet — the players who make their decision the centerpiece of a Signing Day ceremony. There are a few of those in South Florida, too, and they have die-hard college football fans playing hooky from work, so they can be the first to see if they commit to their favorite school. Athletes in baseball, soccer and other sports also get their chance to make their college choice official today.
Then, it's onto Class of 2014.
But there are still questions for the Class of 2013, and we can't flip the calendar until they are answered. Heading into National Signing Day, there are five burning questions, all of which will be answered:
Where will they go?
This is the obvious question, but where will those major uncommitted players sign? We'll finally know where Northeast wide receiver Stacy Coley, Miramar linebacker Jermaine Grace, Atlantic defensive tackle Keith Bryant, and University School wide receiver and linebacker Jordan Cunningham and Skai Moore are going to school tomorrow, bringing to an end each player's arduous recruitment process.18 years of experience

Abstract/Summary
This report describes a study of the geochemistry of the Mersey estuary carried out between April 2000 and December 2002. The study was the first in a new programme of surveys of the geochemistry of major British estuaries aimed at enhancing our knowledge and understanding of the distribution of contaminants in estuarine sediments. The report first summarises the physical setting, historical development, geology, hydrography and bathymetry of the Mersey estuary and its catchment. Details of the sampling and analytical programmes are then given followed by a discussion of the sedimentology and geochemistry. The chemistry of the water column and suspended particulate matter have not been studied, the chief concern being with the geochemistry of the surface and near-surface sediments of the Mersey estuary and an examination of their likely sources and present state of contamination.This is a continuation of Ser. No. 09/143,507 filed Aug. 28, 1998, now abandoned, which is a continuation in part of Ser. No. 08/986,004 filed Dec. 5, 1997 now abandoned.
1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates generally to implantable devices for interventional therapeutic treatment or vascular surgery, and more particularly concerns a coated superelastic stent formed from a stranded micro-cable with enhanced radiopacity.
2. Description of Related Art
The art and science of interventional therapy and surgery has continually progressed towards treatment of internal defects and diseases by use of ever smaller incisions or access through the vasculature or body openings in orderoocclusive, treatment ofvascular defects in the human brain which were previously untreatable or represented unacceptable risks via conventional surgery have become amenable to treatment. One type of nonsurgical therapy that has become advantageous for the treatment of defects in the neurovasculature has been the placement by way of a catheter ofvasoocclusive devices in a damaged portion of a vein or artery.
Vasoocclusionformed strand of flexible material that can be a nickel-titanium alloy is known from U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,558, which is specifically incorporated by reference herein.. Although various materials are more or less kink resistant when nickel-titanium alloys are dimensioned into wire smaller than approximately 0.010 inches in diameter, they can have low yield strength and can kink more easily, thus severely limiting the applications for such finely drawn wire in the fabrication of vasoocclusive devices. As a further limitation to such applications, nickel-titanium alloys are also not radiopaque in small diameters, and a single nickel-titanium wire would need to be approximately 0.012 inches in diameter to be even slightly radiopaque. However, such a thickness of a single nickel-titanium wire would unfortunately also be relatively stiff and possibly traumatic to the placement site, particularly if used for treatment of delicate and already damaged areas of the small diameter vasculature such as an aneurysm in an artery or vein in the brain, for example.
One conventional guidewire for use in a catheter is known that is made of a high elasticity nickel-titanium alloy, and is useful for accessing peripheral or soft tissue targets. The distal tip of the guidewire is provided with a radiopaque flexible coil tip, and a radiopaque end cap is attached to the guidewire by a radiopaque ribbon. Such a construction is complex to manufacture, fragile and can potentially break off during use with undesirable results. A stretch resistant vasoocclusive coil is also known that can be made of a primary helically wound coil of platinum wire, with a stretch-resisting wire attached within the primary coil between two end caps. Unfortunately, such a construction is relatively difficult to fabricate and also fragile, allowing for the possibility of the fracture of the central radiopaque wire, the coil, the welds or some combination of them, and it can also potentially break off during use. Also, such a construction has a complex and nonlinear bending characteristic, dependent on the spacing of the coils and central wire and the radius of the bend of the coil.
Stents are typically implanted within a vessel in a contracted state and expanded when in place in the vessel in order to maintain patency of the vessel, and such stents are typically implanted by mounting the stent on a balloon portion of a balloon catheter, positioning the stent in a body lumen, and expanding the stent to an expanded state by inflating the balloon. The balloon is then deflated and removed, leaving the stent in place. However, the placement, inflation and deflation of a balloon catheter is a complicated procedure that involves additional risks beyond the implantation of the stent, so that it would be desirable to provide a stent that can be more simply placed in the site to be treated in a compressed state, and expanded to leave the stent in place.
Stents also commonly have a metallic structure to provide the strength required to function as a stent, but typically do not provide for the delivery of localized therapeutic pharmacological treatment of a vessel at the location being treated with the stent. Stents formed of polymeric materials capable of absorbing and releasing therapeutic agents may not provide adequate structural and mechanical requirements for a stent, especially when the polymeric materials are loaded with a drug, since drug loading of a polymeric material can significantly affect the structural and mechanical properties of the polymeric material. Since it is frequently desirable to be able to provide localized therapeutic pharmacological treatment of a vessel at the location being treated with the stent, it would be desirable to combine such polymeric materials with a stent structure to provide the stent with the capability of absorbing and delivering therapeutic drugs or other agents at a specific site in the vasculature to be treated.
Conventional forms of stents are known that have a covering or outer layers of collagen, that can be used for enhancing biocompatability and for drug delivery. One known tubular metal stent, for example, is combined with a covering sleeve of collagen in order to increase the biocompatibility of the stent upon implantation. The collagen sleeve may be collagen per se or a collagen carried on a support of Dacron or a similar material. Another three-layer type of vascular prosthesis has two outer layers formed of collagen, and a middle layer made from inert fibers such as synthetic fibers. Another tubular reinforcing structure for use as a cardiovascular graft is made of collagenous tissue with a reinforcing fibrous structure surrounding the lumen. One drug delivery collagen-impregnated synthetic vascular graft is also known, formed from a porous synthetic material having collagen such that the graft substrate cross-links the collagen in order to render the substrate blood-tight. A matrix is also provided in another biodegradable drug delivery vascular stent that is made from collagen or other connective proteins or natural materials that can be saturated with drugs. However, none of these types of stents provide for a coated, superelastic shape memory stent that can be delivered and released at the site in the vasculature to be treated in a compressed state, and expanded to leave the stent in place without the need for placement with a balloon catheter.
From the above, it can be seen that vasoocclusive devices and stents provide important improvements in the treatment of the vasculature. However, it would be desirable to provide a structural element that used to form a coated stent, that offers the advantages of a shape memory alloy such as a nickel-titanium alloy, and that incorporates radiopaque material in a stable configuration that is not subject to breaking during use of the device, so that the device can be visualized under fluoroscopy. The present invention meets these and other needs.
Significant advances have been made in the treatment of neurovascular defects without resolution to surgery. More specifically, micro catheters have been developed which allow the placement of vasoocclusive devices in an area of the vasculature which has been damaged. In presently used.
In order to gain the advantages presently being realized with microcatheter therapies and procedures to repair damage to the vasculature in the brain and other vessels, shape memory materials such as nickel-titanium alloys have been incorporated in vasoocclusive devices to be placed by the catheters. However, the range of diameters ofwire and the configurations of the resulting geometry of both the coils and the devices developed which can be used have been limited by both the relatively small diameter of wire that must be used to avoid trauma and allow housing within the catheter prior to deployment, and the requirement for larger diameters to provide for radiopaque markers and mechanical robustness. In many cases this has resulted in primary wire characteristics in the coil that are unacceptably stiff, very delicate, or subject to kinking. The present invention obtains significant advantages over such prior art devices by providing a cable of multiple strands of an alloy adapted to be used in catheters, stents, vasoocclusive devices , guidewires and the like, thus providing a kink resistant, high strength material with highly desirable performance characteristics which can be altered by construction details to suit a variety of interventional therapeutic procedures.
More specifically, it has been found that single strands of small diameter nickel-titanium alloys, as well as other metal alloys, used to form vasoocclusive devices can be kinked if twisted and pulled as can occur during or after deployment from a catheter, especially if the doctor wishes to withdraw a partially deployed coil because it is somehow incorrect in size, shape or length to repair the damage to the vessel. Also, single wire coils are more likely to cause trauma to the area to be treated if the wire is of a sufficient diameter to provide adequate tensile strength. Furthermore, such small diameter wires of some of these materials such as nickel-titanium, stainless steel and the like, are not generally radiopaque with currently available equipment, necessitating the use of radiopaque markers attached to the device, with the resultant possible diminution of functionality and increased diameter.
The present invention solves these and other problems by providing, in its broadest aspect, a superelastic collagen coated stent formed from a micro-cable which includes at least one radiopaque strand to offer a continuous indication under fluoroscopy of the deployed configuration of the device incorporating the micro-cable. When combined with the benefits of a material such as nickel-titanium in the other strands of the micro-cable, numerous advantages are available from the use of this basic construction in interventional medicine. The shape of the superelastic collagen coated stent can contour to the shape of the anatomical cavity or portion of the vasculature, and the superelastic collagen coated stent would provide an adequate surface area of collagen for contact with a vessel wall to deliver drugs to the vessel wall.
Briefly, and in general terms, a presently preferred embodiment of the present invention provides for a superelastic collagen coated stent formed from a multistranded micro-cable made of a suitable material such as stainless steel or a nickel-titanium alloy, with the cable including at least one radiopaque strand, made of platinum, tungsten or gold, in order to serve as a marker during a procedure. The multi-stranded micro-cable can be configured into a stent to reinforce areas of the small diameter vasculature such as an artery or vein in the brain, for example. The superelastic collagen coated stent can be formed as a helical ribbon or tape, supported internally by a superelastic structure that can be compressed along the width and length of the stent structure, to be pushed by a pusher member through a microcatheter or cannula. When deployed in a helical configuration, with a ribbon cross-section, a closed helical pitch is achieved, providing a collagen tube in contact with the vessel wall. The stent is detachable from the pusher member. The superelastic collagen coated stent can be manufactured by producing the superelastic inner structure, compressing the structure, sliding it into a collagen tube, and allowing the superelastic inner structure to expand and flatten the tube into a ribbon. The collagen tube of the superelastic collagen coated stent is preferably loaded with a therapeutic agent or drug to reduce or prevent restenosis and thrombosis in the vessel being treated.
In one presently preferred embodiment, the invention accordingly provides for a superelastic collagen coated stent formed from a multi-stranded micro-cable having a plurality of flexible strands of a super elastic material, and at least one radiopaque strand. In one presently preferred embodiment, the multi-stranded micro-cable comprises a plurality of flexible strands of nickel-titanium alloy, the micro-cable having at least one central axially disposed radiopaque wire, such as platinum, tungsten or gold, for example, in order to provide a radiopaque marker during vascular procedures. In this preferred embodiment, the construction of the invention places the lowest tensile strength and highest flexibility member, the radiopaque marker strand, in a position in the cable which results in minimum stress on that member; at the same time, the superelastic material is in the outer strands, which have the dominant affect on performance parameters, thus enhancing the benefits of the material. Another benefit associated with the invention compared to prior art devices is that the multiple stranded cable configuration, in addition to providing a highly flexible and resilient structure, eliminates the necessity of a safety wire, since the failure of a single strand will not cause a severing of the cable. Also, the construction prevents stretching of the cable in the event of failure of a single strand, which is a significant benefit compared to constructions which have a coil around a central safety wire.
In a second presently preferred embodiment, the invention includes a superelastic collagen coated stent formed from a multi stranded cable constructed of multiple twisted strands of a suitable material such as a shape memory alloy or super elastic alloy of nickel-titanium, with one or more of the twisted strands consisting of a radiopaque material. The radiopaque strand may be one or more of the peripheral twisted strands and may also include one or more central strands of the cable. In a preferred aspect of the embodiment, the cable consists of six peripheral twisted strands and a central linear core strand, one or more of which can be of radiopaque material.
In a third aspect of the invention, the cable forming the superelastic collagen coated stent can be of linear strands that are arranged in a bundle and fastened or bound at intervals, or continuously, in order to maintain contact among the strands as the cable is bent. One or more of the strands may be radiopaque. This construction is adaptable to guidewires and other structures that must be pushable and/or torqueable, but still remain highly flexible and include radiopacity. Variations on this embodiment can include an outer sheath which consists of a solid or helically wound cover to provide enhanced torqueability and pushability. More specifically, the outer sheath can vary in thickness, stiffness of material or spring of the sheath members to provide desired variations in bending or stiffness of the cable. Such a construction is particularly adaptable to guidewires and the like, and can be varied in terms of the binding or outer layer to alter the torqueability of the cable, and the flexibility of the cable can be varied along its length by the number and sizes of the stranded members in the cable.
In a fourth aspect of the invention, one or more of the strands of the superelastic collagen coated stent can be of a therapeutic material used to enhance treatment of the site after placement of the device. In one presently preferred embodiment of the invention, the cable includes twisted strands of wire around the periphery of the cable, at least one of which is radiopaque. The core of the cable contains a therapeutic agent such as human growth hormone, genetic material, antigens or the like that are intended to become active after placement. Such a construction can be adapted to a variety of interventional therapeutic treatments. In one aspect of this embodiment, one of the strands can have multiple functions, such as providing both a therapeutic effect and also contributing to the structural integrity of the cable. By using copper in such a micro-cable, for instance, the copper can enhance the use of a device made from the cable as on intra-uterine device, with the copper also contributing to the radiopacity and structural integrity of the micro-cable. In the event that such an effect is desired, the therapeutic strand can be placed on the exterior of the cable to enhance contact with the site to be treated.

While stents can be implanted within a vessel in a contracted state and expanded when in place in the vessel in order to maintain patency of the vessel, and typically have a metallic structure to provide the strength required to function as a stent, metallic stents typically do not provide for the delivery of localized therapeutic pharmacological treatment of a vessel at the location being treated with the stent, and typically can not be delivered and released at the site in the vasculature to be treated in a compressed state, and expanded to leave the stent in place without the need for placement of the stent with a balloon catheter.
As is illustrated in the drawings, which are provided for the purposes of illustration and not by way of limitation, the invention is embodied in a multi-stranded micro-cable formed of a plurality offlexible strands of a resilient material with the cable including at least one radiopaque strand. In a presently preferred embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1, the multi-stranded micro-cable 10 is approximately from 0.0021 to 0.0045 inches in diameter, and comprises a plurality of flexible strands 12 of nickel-titanium alloy, with at least one centrally, axially disposed radiopaque wire 14 which is approximately from 0.0007 to 0.0015 inches in diameter. While the above stated diameters represent those presently known to be compatible with the invention, larger or smaller diameters may be useful for particular applications. The central radiopaque wire 14 can be formed of platinum or gold, for example, or other similar suitable radiopaque metals, in order to provide a radiopaque marker of the deployed configuration of a device made of the cable during vascular surgery.
There are numerous benefits to the novel construction of the invention for use in interventional devices and the like. By using the stranded or micro-cable construction of the invention, a device made from the micro-cable becomes virtually kink resistant compared to the single strand wires now commonly used in micro-coils. The multi-strand cable construction of the invention allows the micro-wires of the cable to slip across each other and reinforce each other rather than break or take a set. Also, by incorporating a stranded radiopaque material such as platinum, tungsten or gold into the cable construction, the device is radiopaque in sizes much smaller than with other constructions. The micro-cable construction of the invention can be used to produce soft, kink resistant, radiopaque stents, guidewires, guidewire distal tips, and microcoils.
FIG. 2 is a cross-section of the micro-cable of FIG. 1 at 2—2 illustrating one presently preferred arrangement of the strands within the cable. In this embodiment, the exterior strands 12 are formed of a resilient material chosen to provide the characteristics desired for a specific application in interventional therapies. In a presently preferred embodiment, this material is a nickel titanium super-elastic alloy which is, such a cable can have a central core 14 of a radiopaque material such as gold or platinum, thus dramatically enhancing the radiopacity of the cable. Even a solid super-elastic wire of the same diameter as the cable would have substantially less radiopacity than the cable of the invention with the central gold or platinum wire and the construction of the invention provides numerous other highly desirable characteristics. Among these characteristics is the relative flexibility and resistance to kinking of the cable compared to an equivalent single wire and substantially greater accommodation of the cable to bending, etc., with resultant lessening of trauma to the surrounding tissue and ease of placement in a small body cavity.
One advantageous application of the invention is to vasoocclusive devices formed of the micro-cable for insertion into aneurysms and other vascular defects for the purpose of occluding flow to the aneurysm. FIG. 3 illustrates a helically wound coil 16 of micro-cable 10 which is formed to fit within a micro-catheter for insertion into an area upon which a therapeutic procedure is to be performed. While a helical coil is illustrated, it will be appreciated that numerous other secondary shapes can be formed from the cable of the invention. More specifically, as illustrated in FIG. 4, a three dimensional, essentially spherical, device 18 can be formed of the cable 10, (or even of a coil of the cable, if appropriate) at a temperature sufficient to heat treat the material and thereby create a memory of the desired shape. The device is then inserted into a catheter from which it may be deployed into an aneurysm or the like. The teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,558 describe the construction of such a device out of flexible wire and are incorporated by referenced herein. FIG. 5 illustrates a collapsed coil configuration 20 for a vasoocclusive device which also can be formed from the cable of the invention and is used for the purposes of insertion into aneurysms and other defects that have relatively large entry necks compared to their internal volume.
FIG. 6 is an illustration of a catheter 22 using a coil 16 as a vasoocclusive device made of the present invention and used for insertion into an aneurysm 24 projecting laterally from a blood vessel 26. The coil 16 is contained within the outer housing 28 of a micro-catheter that is used to house the coil prior to deployment. The end of the catheter housing 28 is introduced into the opening 30 of the aneurism 24 by use of a guide wire (note shown). Thereafter, the vasoocclusive coil 16, and a pusher 32 are introduced into the catheter to provide for insertion of the vasoocclusive device into the aneurysm. In a presently preferred embodiment, the coil 16 formed of the cable of the invention is retained to an optical fiber pusher 32 which is attached to the coil by a collar of shape memory plastic material 34 as described in co-pending application Ser. Nos. 09/019,841 and 09/072,314 the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference. As shown in FIG. 7, the coil is introduced into the aneurysm and is then pushed from the micro-catheter until it fills the cavity.
Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is sometimes the case that the vasoocclusive device must be withdrawn after it is fullyocclusive devices of secondary shapes which are based upon a basic configuration of a coil or the like. The present invention includes such applications within the scope of the invention. However, when vasoocclusive devices made of even super-elastic material are used, it is sometimes the case that the devices will be stretched or kinked when withdrawal is attempted. The.
In one presently preferred embodiment, the shape memory collar 34 is heated to a temperature which allows it to be shrunk onto coil 16. The collar is attached to optical fiber pusher 32 by an adhesive 36 which retains high strength at temperatures beyond the shape memory material transition point. After insertion, and when the operator is satisfied that the device is properly deployed, light energy from a source of coherent light is introduced into the proximal end of the optimal fiber (not shown) and propagated in the distal end 38 of the fiber to cause the shape memory material collar 34 to return to its previous shape and release coil 16. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can also be used with a variety of other placement catheter systems, and it is not intended that the invention be limited to the placement concepts illustrated by way of example.
Those skilled in the art will recognize that a number of shaped devices may be introduced into an area to be treated depending upon its geometry and the number of devices to be inserted. FIG. 8 illustrates an essentially spherical device 18 which has been deployed into such an aneurysm but it will commonly be found that a device such as that. FIG. 9 is an example of one such construction 40 in which radiopacity is more desirable than in other forms and for that reason a number of radiopaque strands 42, in this illustration four in number, are formed into the cable along with three resilient material strands 44. It will also be appreciated that a larger or smaller number of strands may be incorporated into a given cable and the cables may be formed of multiple cables in order to provide desired bending and strength characteristics. It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention is adaptable to the use of a variety of materials which by themselves would not have been easily adaptable to micro devices for interventional therapies. For instance, materials such as copper are useful for intrauterine devices and the like, but copper wire, even when heavily alloyed, has certain limitations for use in such devices. By use of the present invention, composite cables incorporating one or more strands of a desired material can be configured with other strands providing strength, flexibility, shape memory, super-elasticity, radiopacity or the like for previously unavailable characteristics in micro devices.
The invention is also adaptable to numerous other purposes. FIG. 10 illustrates a cross-section of a further preferred embodiment in which radiopaque strands 42 and resilient strands 44 form a portion of the cable 46 and a therapeutic agent 48. Such constructions are contemplated within the scope of the invention.
FIG. 11 illustrates a cross-section of an additional presently preferred embodiment of the invention in which the strands 12, 14 of the micro-cable 10 are bundled and banded at intervals by bands 50 to produce a composite banded cable 52 in order to provide increased flexibility without unraveling or dislocation of the strands in the cable. FIG. 12 is a perspective view of the banded cable 50 of this embodiment. While the illustrated configuration shows the strands being laid parallel within the cable, it is also possible in this construction to include both twisted cables as the primary cables 10 within the outer bands 50 to form the composite cable 52. This configuration can use one or more longitudinal strands 14 which are radiopaque, thus providing a continuous indication of radiopacity within the cable. As a further alternative embodiment, it is possible for the longitudinal cable 52 to be formed of a single inner cable 10 with bands 50.
FIG. 13 illustrates a further embodiment of the invention in which longitudinal strands of cables 54 are contained within a wound cover 56 for the purposes of providing a composite guide wire or the like 58 having improved torqueability. Such a construction has particular advantages for guidewire designs having improved radiopacity in very small diameters. It will be appreciated that in this configuration, as well as the other longitudinally arranged multi-stranded cables, the number of strands and the degree to which they extend along the cable within the sheath is a variable which can be used to provide increased stiffness, pushability and torqueability in some sections with greater flexibility in others. Additionally, composite cables according to the invention can incorporate additional elements normally not available in solid guide wires, such as optical, thermal or ultrasound imaging elements, therapeutic agent delivery catheters, and can take advantage of materials which are not readily adaptable to prior art catheter or guide wire designs incorporating a primary wire structured element. FIGS. 14a and 14 b illustrate a further variable available because of the invention; the exterior wrapped cover 56 can be wound at greater or lesser intervals 60 along the outside to provide variations in the torqueability and stiffness of the composite cable. Also, the thickness and width of the wrapping cover 56, as well as its material composition along the composite guide wire 58, can offer further capabilities for customizing the design for various applications. These advantages can be combined with the benefits of shape memory or super-elastic alloys to create guidewires and other devices with heretofore unavailable capabilities.
FIG. 15 illustrates a cross-section of a micro-cable according to the invention which has at least one overall exterior sheath to contain the micro-cable. The micro-cable may be made of one or more multiple strand elements which may further include twisted or longitudinal strands within their construction. The sheath may also be used to control the torqueability characteristics of the cable and as discussed in copending application, Ser. No 08/986,004, the sheath may be multi-layered with different materials in order to provide a graduated bending and stiffness characteristic over the length of the cable.
FIGS. 17 to 23 illustrate a superelastic collagen coated stent that can advantageously be formed from one or more strands or micro-cables of such strands as described above. The superelastic collagen coated stent 70 can be compressed to a narrow thickness as illustrated in FIGS. 18B, 20B and 22B, and can be expanded at the site to be treated to the form of the superelastic collagen coated stent ribbon or tape forming a helical structure 72 illustrated in FIG. 23. The superelastic collagen coated stent comprises one or more groups of flexible strands 74 of superelastic, shape memory material, disposed within a tube 76 of collagen, forming a superelastic structure within the collagen tube that can be compressed along the width and length of the stent structure, to allow the stent structure to be pushed through a microcatheter or cannula. Alternatively, the tube may also be made of another suitable material that is preferably biocompatible, and may be a polymer material such as a thermoplastic or elastomer, or other similar materials, for example, that preferably can be loaded with a therapeutic agent for treatment of the desired site in the vasculature. As is illustrated in FIG. 23, when deployed, in a helical configuration, with a ribbon cross-section, a closed pitch is achieved, providing a collagen tube in contact with the vessel wall. The proximal end 78 of the stent preferably includes a stem 80, grippable by a shape memory collar as described above, to be detachable from a pusher member when delivered at the site in the vasculature to be treated. The stent structure can be manufactured by producing the inner superelastic structure, compressing the structure, sliding it into a collagen tube, and allowing the inner superelastic structure to expand and flatten the tube into a ribbon.
The collagen tube of the superelastic collagen coated stent is preferably loaded with a therapeutic agent or drug, such as to reduce or prevent restenosis and thrombosis in the vessel being treated, for example. The collagen tube of the superelastic collagen coated stent is preferably loaded with a therapeutic agent or drug, such as antiplatelets, antithrombins, cytostatic and antiproliferative agents such as are well known in the art, for example, to reduce or prevent restenosis in the vessel being treated. While such therapeutic agents have been used to prevent or treat restenosis and thrombosis, they are provided by way of example and are not meant to be limiting, as other therapeutic drugs may be developed which are equally applicable for use with the present invention..July 30, 2006

(JOINED IN PROGRESS)
CALABRESI: ... and the effect on U.S. foreign policy.
We are fortunate today to have two experts, who I'll introduce in a moment. First, a few housekeeping notes, which you're all, I'm sure familiar with.
The most important thing to note at the beginning is, though this was advertised as off the record, we have agreed to do it on the record. So this meeting is on the record. Everything you say can and will be held against you.
(LAUGHTER)
But it's an important discussion that we -- we feel most usefully could be on the record and a contribution to the broader discussion, so please note that.
As you see in your handout, there's a variety of courtesies. Please turn off your electronic devices. If you're called upon to ask a question, please identify yourself; no need to stand, since we're at the table.
We have two speakers today, with whom you're well acquainted; Professor Russell Crandall of Davidson College, a former director at the National Security Council in the Office of Western Hemisphere Regional Initiatives, and of course, General Barry McCaffrey, president of McCaffrey Associates, former director, under Bill Clinton, of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and, of course, the famous leader of the 24th ID in the first Gulf War.
MCCAFFREY: Victory.
CALABRESI: That's right.
So it may be best to begin with a quick overview of the changes in U.S. domestic drug policy, so that we're all on the same page when discussing the extent to which and the ways in which they may or may not be affecting U.S. foreign policy. It -- there's been quite a lot of change, obviously, in the -- in the last few years. I'll run through a couple and then, perhaps, some of our guests can -- can -- can add to it.
The first and most obvious is the legalization of recreational marijuana use in Colorado and Washington State; a fairly recent development, so it may be a little early to try and gauge the effects that that's having overseas.
The administration, further, has said it will not prosecute banks that do business with licensed pot businesses in Colorado and Washington, and also has said it won't interfere with those state experiments.
The longer term trend of medical marijuana legalization, obviously, more likely to already be having an effect overseas. The Obama administration has, of course, itself been pursuing more liberalized drug policy, drug courts, the sentencing issues on crack cocaine. And both taken together, it's a marked change in direction the drug policy we all grew up with.
But why don't I start by asking General McCaffrey to make a few comments and -- and say what you think the overall effect of these changes are, General?
MCCAFFREY: Well, (inaudible), I'm glad to be -- join Russell and talk to him about some of these issues.
Just by way of background, I spend probably a third of my time dealing with domestic drug policy, mostly from prevention, education and treatment. I'm on the board of directors of the National Association of Drug Courts. Did not start with Obama; started with Clinton. We started with a dozen; we got it to 1,000 before Clinton left office.
There's now almost 3,000 drug courts. We just had our annual conference in Anaheim. There were 5,000 people there. We got 215 veterans' treatment courts; it's clearly moving in the right direction. That and A.A. and N.A. are the two magic pieces of domestic drug policy. They're not adequate, but they're just contributing.
I spend a lot of time at the National Institute of Drug Abuse and SAMHSA and others who have influence on policy. I try and stay in touch with ONDCP. They've lost a considerable amount of clout in the last few years. And I'm very much engaged at a state level, with drug treatment organizations in particular.
There's around 22 million of us that have some level of substance abuse disorder, poly-drug abuse, alcohol's almost invariably involved, the most dangerous drug, arguably, in America.
And -- and -- and, by the way, just as sort of a backing off the whole issue; domestic drug abuse has gone down dramatically since 1979. It's probably half of what is was before and, depending on the institution you're looking at, the Armed Forces have gone from significantly impaired by drug abuse in the late '70s, to where, now, we're testing positive, one, two percent, et cetera.
So, you know, there's (sic) been a lot of things moving in the right direction. What hasn't moved in the right direction is -- and I tell people, if you want to understand drug -- the -- the drug addiction problem, look at your 8th graders. And if you see significant and rising rates of drug abuse -- the most dangerous drugs in America, by the way, is an 8th grader binge-drinking beer, smoking pot and using ecstasy.
That's sort of a triumvirate. And if you add in mental health disorders undiagnosed and then flash forward 10 years in your community, that's going to be the shape of what your social workers, your court system, your hospital emergency rooms with see. They'll see increasing rates of drug abuse.
So for 13 years, adolescent drug use went down, starting in the Clinton administration. For four years, it's gone up. The primary cause is -- has been the growing normalization of the use of marijuana. And, you know, I -- I'll give a talk in Denver and there'll be -- I'm -- I'm going to make these numbers up; 400 medical marijuana places. Los Angeles, 8 or 900; nobody really knows.
So the widespread proliferation of medical marijuana, which the message has to be, if it's medicine, how could it be dangerous, so I think that's the problem. We should expect to see that trend continue.
I guess the only other thing is -- and I'll defer to Russell and many of you in the room are lifelong experts; but normally, I won't take part in a program like this, because I tend to end up being -- being (inaudible) idiot general who doesn't understand that if we open the doors to the prisons and let all the nonviolent drug users out and legalize, not just marijuana.
That's a stalking horse for a more Darwinian approach, in which drugs in general are viewed as not my problem, my community. It's somebody else; it's black people, brown people, poor people, west coast people, somebody besides me. If we just did that, the problem would go away and we'd save billions of dollars.
One of the most alienating things I say to the drug legalization community, and I'll just toss this on the table so you can think about it, is the general statement; nobody in America gets arrested, prosecuted and jailed for the possession of illegal drugs.
Now, where it is, for example, the federal system; I think the general guidelines are -- Department of Justice is here; you probably had 200 kilograms on you when we arrested you, though as a general statement, that just doesn't happen.
And nonviolent drug offenders means people selling methamphetamines, doing street prostitution, breaking into your house, et cetera. So some of the -- the language on ending the War on Drugs is so riddled with inaccuracies and so harmful, I would suggest, to our future public health policy that it's mind-boggling.
And on that nuanced uncertain note...
(UNKNOWN): So...
MCCAFFREY: ... let me end my remarks.
CALABRESI: Thank you; excellent.
So -- so -- so, just summarizing that, it sounds like cross currents. On the one hand, you've got drug abuse going down; on the other hand, you've got marijuana use going up. Russell Crandall, can you -- can you summarize your sense of the way those trends have rippled out across our borders?
I've seen a variety of different reports on the effects, just on the -- the marijuana issue alone, with regard to cultivation of marijuana, other people following suit or the debate opening up among policymakers in other countries.
CRANDALL: Yeah, yeah; sure, sure.
CALABRESI: If you can run down a little bit of what's known so far about the effects of the...
(CROSSTALK)
CRANDALL: OK, yes, sure. Thanks, Massimo.
Certainly, I just have one clarification to reinforce that I am a Davidson College professor, since we're on the record, and not an administration official. I left the administration three years ago, so please, if you do quote me or anything, (inaudible) I should have worn patches or something...
(CROSSTALK)
CALABRESI: Speaking directly from the brain of President Barack Obama.
(LAUGHTER)
CRANDALL: And -- and I also plead humility, in that I know the kind of collected wisdom, insights on drug policy around this table. I -- you know, forgotten in five minutes infinitely than I could imagine in my career, so I plead humility and, if anything, look forward to all your comments when we get to Q&A.
I thought, well, if anything, maybe I -- I could point out some ironies -- controversy, just to -- to get our discussion going. And I think, in doing that, I thought -- and I think General McCaffrey, yesterday, when we were conversing, indicated that we might be, you know, one of a handful of people who've actually read the 2013 ONDCP strategy; right?
Which I -- I -- I couldn't sleep for, you know, nights before it came out and it's (ph) just the expectation...
(CROSSTALK)
MCCAFFREY (?): ... Kelly's (ph) mother (ph) was another one.
(LAUGHTER)
CRANDALL: And it -- but it -- it is -- it is interesting that, you know, if we -- if we are looking for -- for ironies, that one operation highlighted -- and I don't know if -- if -- if -- if you heard about this; you probably didn't. Operation -- this is in the fall of -- of 2012; Operation Mountain Sweep.
It's a seven -- seven-state, two-week long campaign to eradicate illicit marijuana plots in public lands. I think Director Kerlikowske, your esteemed successor, was -- visited one of the -- I think it was in El Dorado National Forest in California.
And over the two-week operation, according to ONDCP, there were over -- close to 800,000 plants that were eradicated, with a street value of roughly $1.6 billion. A month later, including one of the states, Washington, as you all know, which was part of the -- the seven-state mountain sweep; there was the vote to -- to legalize marijuana.
So, again, for -- for -- for ironies that the national strategy has a highlight on what it contends is a step forward on the War on Drugs, at the same time that in almost geographically identical areas of the country, voters are -- are opting for something entirely different. And so, I think that's -- it -- it -- I was struck -- and there's so much kind of good news, I think, as -- as you mentioned the drug courts; there's a lot of innovation.
It surely isn't your father's drug war at home. And I think it's -- you know, finally, we -- it's belated, but we've -- we've -- we've turned the corner and we're talking much more frankly, much more empirically about finding these -- these solutions, despite the fact that we still have -- we have all these great answers, we have all these programs and we have drug courts; we still have a drug scourge.
We still have a -- a -- a harrowing problem that does devastate our communities, from Vermont and heroin to Wilkes, North Carolina and meth. And you don't have to throw a stone very far into -- especially, I think, in the type of -- of economy we are in, in a -- a divided economy; a -- a -- a stratified economy that we -- we fight these communities, despite the -- the broader good news that, compared to the '70s or something, things have -- have gotten better.
And that leaves me with one question. You know, how -- do -- how -- do we now have it all figured out? Do we actually know what you need to do and we just need more of it? Or, if -- if we have been doing all the right things in recent years, why do we have -- continue to have so many problems?
Why do we continue to have new problems; say heroin, if -- if -- if -- if the solutions are out there? Or is it simply, while it's just -- it's an inextricable, you know, part of our culture, of our habits that kind of resign us to this -- this phenomena that -- that is so devastating, we all know?
In terms of the international side, and for me, if the -- the -- the bias that -- that filters all through -- through Latin America, I think there are some other ironies. One, I feel a little bit sorry for President Obama. I recall he was blindsided at the Assembly of the Americas, Cartagena in the spring of -- of 2012.
President Santos of Colombia, other Latin leaders kind of talking what appeared to be in a courageous talk on a new alternative path for the War on Drugs in the region. And out of that came this agreement that the OAS -- and again, you probably have not read this. If you've read it, that -- that might -- may mean, you know, that you are a drug war junkie. But the OAS would produce a report with kind of alternative scenarios; how might this be done differently?
What's amazing, and again, you can just pull this off the Web, but to read the scenarios and to see that they're -- in fact, I was expecting that -- that these would be radical departures. Let's say is it legalization, is it decriminalization? (Inaudible) no mas of drug war as usual, more militarized, interdiction-based. And, in fact, they're -- these are quite conservative. They even make the ONDCP document seem kind of radical by comparison.
So I -- again, I think it might have been politically expedient for the Latin American leaders, Santos in particular, to (ph) appear courageous on the drug issue, even though Obama, where there's been a lot of domestic innovation, sort of got hit as sort of more of the status quo agent, so maybe -- maybe good politics for -- for -- for -- for Santos.
And just to wrap up, I think part of it is the fact that -- and the OAS report recognizes this; that there's simply not an appetite in Latin America for a significant shift towards legalization, even pot. In the case of Uruguay, what -- you know, of course, that -- that recently legalized.
It's still a net negative; I think maybe even two-thirds in the last poll I saw of Uruguayans not wanting to legalize part, with that fear of becoming another Amsterdam or becoming, dare we say, another Denver. That's as close as I get to drug war humor.
(LAUGHTER)
But, OK. So, I -- I -- I -- I think one, you know, last question that I -- I pose for -- for you all is, if we are kind of innovative, if we are adapting on the domestic front, and it -- and it looks good in terms of our willingness to kind of -- to finally cover great (ph) policies that work, even if they -- even if it used to appear a little bit funky; what are we doing on the -- the international side, the interdiction side? Is it still just simply spray, as usual? Is it still simply interdict and bust labs, as usual?
And my worry is that we've simply done this for so long that even if you have a much more liberal pot policy in the U.S. throughout, you know, with much more legalization; that we would still be busting labs and interdicting and dealing with the international component in a way that kind of we -- we've done since the -- the mid, late 1980s.
(UNKNOWN): Can I ask?
CRANDALL: Yeah.
CALABRESI: So we -- we -- we -- have treated commitments with regard to drug policy that we're now, in one degree or another, in violation of.
Are -- as somebody who is anything but expert in this, do we lose leverage bilaterally because of our current position with regard to those treaties? Or were they always essentially fuzzy international law that never really bound the action on the ground?
What's -- what -- what has been the effect, if any, on our ability to project the policies we want overseas by our apparent contravention of our own treaty on the issue?
CRANDALL: Yeah, that's a -- it -- it's a great action. I -- and again, I think you've been talking to INL and other people who -- right now, who are sort of involved with this on the policy side, so they have a much better sense than I do of actually how it's -- it's -- it's working itself out.
But I do remember, back when I was in the administration, the case of -- off Bolivia and sort the Evo Morales government coming out and saying OK; we want to kind of change, you know, the -- the status that coca has and so we can industrialize, kind of coca in the country.
And -- and our -- you know, this is just U.N., kind of all these different kind of conventions that simply can't -- can't be. And it's not us; it's the international community doing this. Now, jump forward, so it's -- if -- if we're looking for consistency, we're not going to find that.
Is this something what (ph) normally we -- we have relied upon to kind of why there's a consensus about sort of how to do this type of stuff? Absolutely. Now, whether are going to point out the fact that, with these developments, that -- that we're sort of out of kilter; I just don't know.
And -- but again, I think for most of it, at least in Latin America, because there is -- the -- the Brazilians are worried about cocaine and kind of its -- its -- its -- its -- its variance (ph) (inaudible) Chile's (ph); because of -- of -- that they're, kind of with their increasingly consumer societies, and (ph) all of the -- the -- the nasty baggage that comes with that; that I think they're going to be kind of less concerned about any imminent (ph) sentences (ph) and still more concerned about some -- some of what we're (ph) just what's happening to their -- their society.
CALABRESI: And problems (ph) they're facing on the ground.
CRANDALL: Exactly.
CALABRESI: General, in -- in that regard, with the sort of more domestic focus, it does seem as if we're flying a bit blind with the changes that are brought about by these experiments in the States.
I've seen some reports that there -- you can draw a connection between the increasing liberalization of marijuana policy and the increasing supply of heroin into the growing market here in the US, in some ways fueling heroin -- the traditional marijuana growers, especially in Mexico, seeing prices collapse, and shifting their crops to heroin and that, in some way, creating a more robust market here.
Is it your sense from the drug control community that that is a trend? What do we know about unintended consequences from -- of that sort; economic and market consequences?
MCCAFFREY: Well, you know, one observation I -- and I'm here and there's several at the table that are really experts on dealing with drug addiction, but when you look at the U.S. population, 307 million of us; overwhelmingly, we don't use drugs. We don't abuse alcohol, we don't smoke cigarettes.
The trends were steadily moving in the right direction, all of which have started to reverse, I might add, in the last few years. So that's one observation.
The second one is, when it comes to drug addiction, we don't care what drug you're using. Now, if you're a heroin addict and you're buffering your, you know, drug addiction, or even worse, methamphetamines and you're -- you're coming off a meth tweaking incident for 21 days with almost no sleep and you're using alcohol to buffer, we really don't care which drug you're -- you're using.
If you're a heroin addict and we get you on methadone maintenance and we're drug-testing you once a week, you have to worry about the guy moving to cocaine. What we care about is do you encounter devastating impact on your life in legal, social, medical and work-related areas of your existence.
Those of you who have encountered drug addiction -- I'm in and out of treatment centers all over the country all the time; it is abject misery. Now, when you look at U.S. trends in drug abuse, the -- and you asked me about what are the top 20 things you want to talk about or worry about, the last one would be Central American domestic drug policy.
If you want to influence 70,000 heroin addicts in Baltimore; that's not the way to go about it. What we -- and, by the way, when you look at recent drug trend, what we had was a 500 percent increase in diverted legal narcotics, so synthetic opiates actually became this huge cause celeb.
Methamphetamine skyrocketed; the worst drug of abuse we encountered, massive organic brain damage over the course of a year. That's now plummeted, cocaine use plummeting, crack cocaine use in the black community plummeting, but that doesn't make us any happier if you're just moving to different drugs of abuse.
So -- so I think that's something to take into account. So the notion that, for example, that if we legalized marijuana, we'll run the Mexican criminal organizations out of business is such infantile thinking, it's beyond belief.
These are criminal organizations. They're not ideological; they're trying to make money so they're in prostitution, they're in migrant smuggling, they're in bank robberies, they're -- and if they can't make money off marijuana, which I dispute will happen either.
CALABRESI: Right.
MCCAFFREY: And you look at the other sources -- by the way, drug producing nations -- another thing to take into context when you're talking about Latin America, a major drug-producing nation in the world is the United States. We produce huge amounts of marijuana, ecstasy; even though it may be, you know, Mexican cartel activity, methamphetamine production now tends to be mega-labs, not micro-labs.
And you know, the Netherlands is a major drug-producing (ph) nation (ph). Canada, with THC-content marijuana up, you know, 25 percent and higher, trading at kilogram per kilogram for cocaine. So, drug-producing nations is not the way to distinguish this. It's not their drugs and our consumption.
CALABRESI: Um hmm.
MCCAFFREY: By the way, if you're looking for high rates of drug abuse; you want to see skyrocketing rates of drug abuse, look at Mexico, where the trends are all like that, where ours were coming down.
So I've always been very uncomfortable about the notion that, you know, it's a simple -- I was on this global program -- started to tell Massimo before we started; most asinine program I was ever on. It was a debate in Oxford.
My opening lines were -- I was in California, on Microsoft video and I said the only reason I'm even on this show is because you paid me $25,000 to get me to take part in this. It was just complete nonsense.
(LAUGHTER)
But my friend, Vicente Fox -- which (ph) -- there were several former heads of state on and Vicente came on; he said poor Mexico's the victim of the United States. Here we live in their shadow. They're all using drugs; therefore it gets drawn through our country. We produce no drugs.
Wow; wow. Mr. Fox, for God's sakes, you know, most of the heroin in the United States doesn't come out of Afghanistan. Amir (ph) was in Afghanistan as an advisor, I guess really on ore (ph). Kansas wheat fields of opium poppy, as far as the eye could see, in the southern provinces in particular.
But most of our heroin comes out of Colombia and Mexico; never mind methamphetamines, marijuana, et cetera. So, I don't know. I -- this is not a central debate to me. The militarization of U.S. drug policy in Latin America, in my view, is sheer nonsense.
If you've been in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Columbia, particularly 10 years ago, when it was worth your flipping life to be a rancher, trying to get out to your property and, you know, the notion that we would say, well, the Colombia National Police are being militarized by the -- by the United States was just completely outrageous, in my view.
By the way, Colombia has gone from -- on a scale of zero to 100, with 100 being the worst; it's gone from 104 down to 20. The last time I was there, my security detachment was a dozen CNP officers. When I left office, I went -- flew in at the end of my tenure; they winged a mortar round in (ph) the runway as I landed. And I had 4,000 people in my security detachment.
CALABRESI: Right, right...
(CROSSTALK)
CALABRESI: ... complicated series of dynamics that have -- have brought about that change, of course.
Did you have a comment on drug war, quickly, and then we'll open up the table?
CRANDALL: Yes, sure, just brief -- brief; just to respond to the General's comments. And I -- I do think, if we look at domestic consumption, all of these effects that -- it's absolutely correct that kind of what happens in Honduras, what happens in Peru, or you know, coca going -- if it's (ph) up, down, is peripheral, at -- at best.
And I think, just the example of cocaine, again, if you read the ODCP strategy, all the bells and whistles that cocaine consumption went past five, seven, eight years has dropped by half, but it doesn't mention -- so they -- yes; this is an Andean (ph) success story, lets imagine, but it doesn't say anything else about, sort of pot, heroin, every -- going up and how much (inaudible) the fact that coke's down now. What's to say it's not going to bounce back up in the future?
But I -- and I think, more specifically, to Colombia; there's no question that if U.S. -- what started out as U.S. drug policy has been great nation-building for Columbia. And they needed a lot of nation-building. I think that's a -- a success story.
But if we kind of look at Colombia's success story as a real feather in the cap of the broader war on drugs, I'm -- I'm less convinced, because of all the shifting effects, because of the sort of cost associated. And I think one example is Bolivia, where, if you remember back in the late '80s and '90s; Bolivia was ground zero in the war on drugs, in terms of coca eradication.
They were the INL, State Department big presence, DEA; well, that's all over with the new, kind of anti-war on drugs Morales administration. So Bolivia is not -- as we see it, kind of part of the war on drugs and nobody has batted an eyelid.
So if -- if -- if -- if it's OK for Bolivia to sort of be out of the orbit; well, because all the Bolivian cocaine goes to Brazil or Europe or something, do we really need to be doing what we're doing in Peru or -- yet, we don't -- we're not asking these hard questions, because we've been doing this for so long, because in some ways, it's sort of morphed into, well, you know, we've got to help the CNP just kind of deal with thugs in Columbia or something; things that I think you could make a case for independently, but are kind sharp (ph) thinking about.
And that's just the last thing I would add. I know there -- there are people, kind of inside the government right now, who are infinitely kind of more versed in all this than I is, is that my -- as amazed in my time in government; thinking OK, well, we can try and get a handle on the war on drugs, as part of sort of the President's kind of Americas portfolio.
And I think I -- I left government more confused about what we do in Latin America in the war on drugs than I came in, you know, which can be (inaudible) if you even (inaudible) time at the Office of the Secretary of Defense, you've got kind of western hemisphere and then you've got your counter (inaudible) people, with stovepipes and authorizations and it's amazing.
You could have a part of the Office of Secretary of Defense, a -- a -- a -- a bureau that would go down to Colombia and meet with all their kind of counterparts and people and talk about (inaudible) and tech stuff. And you go down and meet with all different people; you have no idea what the -- anybody's talking about.
But it's just, well, what are they doing? Well, they've got authorizations, they've got cash and they kind of spend it. And when they go down, certain CNP generals take them on helicopter rides and you get your helicopter rides.
(LAUGHTER)
And I mean is the -- the -- the...
(CROSSTALK)
(UNKNOWN): So, on top of all...
(CROSSTALK)
(UNKNOWN): On -- on top of -- on top of all of that that...
CRANDALL: ... narcotics complex, so.
(UNKNOWN): ... extraordinary complexity, we've now...
(CROSSTALK)
MCCAFFREY (?): ... I've got to add a data point, though.
CALABRESI: We should open it up for -- for questions. But go ahead, General.
MCCAFFREY: When you get -- when you get in a discussion of -- of the war on drugs, and it can get pretty heated if you're in Ecuador or in Colombia or in Guatemala.
(UNKNOWN): Lots at stake.
MCCAFFREY: Try (ph) to tell people -- and I don't know the current numbers, but I -- every time I went into Afghanistan, I would stop (ph) -- I would start in Islamabad. You know, the ISI would work me, the PAC (ph) military would work me, and then I'd shoot on into Kabul later on in the week.
When I started those visits into Afghanistan, there were three DEA agents in Pakistan. I think I got it up to a dozen by hammering them over the ears every time I'd come back. I'll bet you, today, in Colombia -- I'm going to make this number up; there's 20 DEA agents in Colombia.
I mean, so the notion that this is some massive military law enforcement effort is laughable.
CALABRESI: Yeah.
MCCAFFREY: It just isn't there. The dollars aren't there. You know, I -- there's one of the reports here was just terrific; the Americas report. For riddled, muddled thinking, this is a classic document.
(LAUGHTER)
You know, of course we want poverty alleviation, violence against women; I mean all of those are genuine factors. But the notion we tell the Colombians or something that supporting their police is causing these problems, seems to me, laughable.
CALABRESI: So -- so a -- a -- a variety of already complex, nonresponsive problems that have been made more complicated and unpredictable by the introduction of legalization and liberalization of the drug policy here and a good opportunity for our experts around the table to try and help clarify what some of those effects might be.
A couple of reminders, especially for those of you who showed up a little bit after my gripping initial comments. This is not traditional council rules; it is on the record and, indeed, will be, I believe a transcript and audio will be posted to the CFR website later, so you'll want to know that as you ask your questions and engage in lively debate.
Please identify yourselves when I -- when I call on you and -- and wait -- well, you don't need to wait for a microphone, because the table's miked and we're very small.
So, why don't we start with Miss -- Ms. Realuyo?
QUESTION: I'm a professor of National Security at the Parry Center at NDU, where I actually teach terrorism and crime and the strategy on transnational organized crime, which I wanted to comment on, 'cause that actually try -- was an attempt to neutralize and convert the idea of just a drug war.
Of drug trafficking organizations to transnational criminal organizations to kind of mollify or may become a -- correctly to describe these as very agile business enterprises that we're encountering and that's why they're adjusting to the supply and demand, particularly in drug trafficking, moving out from cocaine to meth and heroin, and also going much more global than just the United States.
What we've seen, though, is because of -- and I spent a lot of time in Latin American and I just came from West Africa, which is starting to see huge flows. And I was just in Europe, earlier this past week, taking a look at, now, the huge flows of cocaine going into -- it's more -- more developed and more sophisticated, particularly Russia, so it's pretty interesting.
Talking about DEA agents; there are more going that way than south. But the bigger question is, every time we confront or, more importantly, are confronted by, as U.S. officials, going downrange, the whole question of, well, you actually legalized -- you know that's -- it's a different interpretation. And then you have to kind of school them on what's decriminalization or legalization.
CALABRESI: Right.
QUESTION: What we see is a real inconsistency on the talking points, what the federal is doing and to confer with the -- the president in Guatemala, Pena Nieto, the day before yesterday and made some illusions to legalization in Mexico, 'cause they keep portraying themselves as the victims of our consumption.
So, if you were to sit where you used to sit, Russell, and also, General McCaffrey; what do you think is the better way, going forward, to kind of reconcile a lot of these?
We look kind of schizophrenic, in terms of -- and I think this discussion has kind elucidated that; on the federal versus state, but more importantly, the -- kind of the view from the -- the outside world of what U.S. policy really is, and is -- whether you're using euphemisms, like transnational criminal organizations or drug cartels that kind of are just in the business of making money?
CALABRESI: So how do we message our confused position?
(LAUGHTER)
MCCAFFREY: It's not -- it's not messaging.
CRANDALL (?): (Inaudible)
MCCAFFREY: But we are confused.
(LAUGHTER)
Just astonishing to me. I had a long conversation with Eric Holder, you know, and my board of directors, when I was on DCP, were -- included Joe Biden, who was sort of like the chairman of the board, both nonpartisan-bipartisan support.
We got tons of money and continue to do so, for, you know, demand reduction, prevention, education, treatment grants (ph). So, to some extent, that's all doing quite well.
But the notion that -- you know, now I sat in -- I -- 'cause I actually think what's going on is we've had about 300 people -- that's a number I artificially pegged, but 300 (ph) billionaires who've been supporting drug legalization for the last 25 years and it's been very clever, very effective.
They moved the needle very deliberately. They have fungible money; they can throw $15 million at a campaign, buy prepackaged TV ads, sue government officials for misuse of office; Lieutenant Governor, Washington. They can buy people to be on TV.
When I watched the legalization campaign and -- and -- from Seattle, the former U.S. Attorney I work with, Kay Plummer (ph), the former FBI SAC; they were all on TV, very clever ad. So it's working. We're normalizing the use of marijuana, to our peril.
We will see, without any question, in the coming decade, rising rates of poly-drug abuse among adolescents, followed by chronic addiction, for some subset of them. So I think it's a mistake in policy, driven in large part by another number I invented; maybe 15 percent of the American electorate feels so strongly about the legalization of drugs that they will vote that issue, to the exclusion of all others.
They'll vote for you or against you, if you're the sheriff, if you're a state representative, a local prosecutor. And I think politicians are saying, look; I barely made it through my last election, with four percent, I'm in office. I'm not getting in front of this train.
And that's applying to both political parties. This is not a liberal Democrat versus conservative Republican. They've all gone mute. The one name I just put on the table, Dr. Kevin Sabet, and I think CFR's got his presentation. He's a young guy, bright guy; I think University of Florida and he's out there talking about ways of understanding the drug issue.
Another one is Dr. Nora Volkow; if you want to understand what drug addiction does, go to NIDA, $800 million a year budget. They know a ton about the -- you know, the actual medical and -- and social aspects of addiction.
So, I don't know; get facts on the table. It needs to be an informed debate, but rising rates of drug abuse among adolescents will prove to be bad policy for the United States.
CALABRESI: The view from the neighborhood; do you have a question?
QUESTION: So I'll try to address some of the issues that have come up. First of all, what are we doing internationally that's different, maybe from the war on drugs, as you suggested?
And the perception is I think we were taking a much more holistic approach and -- and recognizing eradicating coca fields is not going to solve the problem in the United States and it's, frankly, not going to deal with a lot of the issues in countries such as Colombia.
So we have a holistic approach that's looking at strengthening the rule of law in justice systems, you know, throughout the -- the -- the whole chain of -- of these countries, starting with the police, which you know, you've ridden on the helicopters and seen the -- the -- the glamorous, sexy side of that.
But it also includes training prosecutors, judges, correction systems; if you don't have effective corrections, you're also -- you're not going to fix the problem either.
And we're also working on kind of exporting the drug court model. We have a -- done a lot of that in -- in Mexico. A lot of this is through OAS. And interestingly, the drug courts in Mexico also deal with alcohol abuse as well, so it -- it's a -- maybe even an improvement on -- on what we're doing here. And Colombia is now interested in looking at the drug court model as well.
CALABRESI: Yeah.
QUESTION: And then we're also focusing on -- 'cause -- because, as -- as General McCaffrey mentioned, we have kind of the lead -- world's leading experts on drug addiction and -- and dealing with prevention, treating drug addiction, so we're trying to export that mileage (ph) as well, to help countries, including Afghanistan, Colombia, Mexico deal with their domestic drug issues.
Because you mentioned, you know, that there's a perception that we've got a lot of answers now for dealing with the drug issue and I -- and I would never say that, you know, it can be solved. It can be...
CALABRESI: Right.
QUESTION: ... contained and managed in a more effective way. And in Latin America, the debate is often about, well, let's -- if we legalized, you know, this will solve the problem.
Or something we've heard more in -- in recent months is let's reduce or maybe eliminate a lot of the -- the drug sentencing problems for drug users. And that is working in the United States, because we have the infrastructure, the public health, social services infrastructure to help those people once they're being diverted from the justice system.
CALABRESI: Yeah.
QUESTION: A lot of countries do not have that infrastructure.
CALABRESI: Right.
QUESTION: So it's important, if you're going to, you know, embark on an experiment like that, to think it through and have the services necessary to deal with -- with the consequences.
MCCAFFREY: I might add to -- to your statement, though -- 'cause I agree with what you said, but one of our major problems in the United States is, if you believe your own numbers -- I always start with do you believe your own numbers you're putting out?
If you think most of us don't abuse drugs -- you can include alcohol, but there's maybe 20 million plus that do have a serious substance abuse problem. It's always poly-drug abuse. Then you need treatment; science-based treatment, not nonsense treatment, outcome evidence-based treatment.
We got maybe 3-1/2 million people have access to treatment in a given year, so our capacity is de minimis. The drug courts system, even with close to 3,000, with maybe 120,000 people in treatment on a given day, say well, wait a minute. You're off by orders of magnitude, so we still have a huge way to go.
But your point still is right on target and if it's Honduras, for God's sakes, you know, the violence, the depravity, the chaos, the lack of governmental capacity in every arena is so great that it's not too useful to tell them why don't you start drug courts; that'll solve the problem.
CRANDALL: Just a -- a quick one, and those are very well taken; your -- your -- your points, so thanks. And you're sort of at the flavor, the nuance of the -- the -- the international interdiction side. It's not simply spraying plants. And that's -- I think that's to be applauded.
Marketing, messaging, I think absolutely. You know, I think if -- let's hope that, you know, the Hondurans, the Afghans kind of don't read Maureen Dowd's column...
(CROSSTALK)
(UNKNOWN): Chocolate overdose?
(CROSSTALK)
CRANDALL: ... you don't have to go to Afghanistan; you just go to Colorado...
(CROSSTALK)
CRANDALL: And it was so matter of fact, in the sense that this is the new reality where -- and I think part of it might be that the interdiction side is inertial. You know, it's -- it's got a lot of -- of -- of -- of years behind it and the -- the poppy (ph) just kind of popped up out of nowhere.
It wasn't that (ph), but it -- relatively speaking. And so that's out in front of, kind of conventions. It's out, sort of our international talk and we've got. And so either we keep this inconsistency and we just message it better. Oh, no, actually, you know, it's just, you know, this thought's (ph) different or some way we can get beyond that to keep this.
Or we take a step back and say OK, this should change, because it's no longer plants. It's no -- it's going to be drug courts in Colombia or something like that.
MCCAFFREY: I'd like to take the liberty...
CRANDALL: I don't know. Maybe they're already doing it (ph).
MCCAFFREY: ... liberty of asking you a question directly; flip it around a little bit on the specific subject of the conversation today, which is, you know, as somebody on the frontlines, are you seeing, overseas, specific effects and what are they, from the changing policies here, other than just sort of the specific, fine grain issue of how do we convince them to do drug courts?
But what -- what is -- what is the broad view of what the effect of liberalization here is having on our foreign policy?
QUESTION: Well, you mentioned the U.N. conventions and that's one area that I've been working on for the last several months. And the -- the charge that we're out of compliance is something that we've had to deal with.
And when you actually look at the conventions, there is a certain amount of flexibility and deference to...
MCCAFFREY: Constitutional...
(CROSSTALK)
QUESTION: ... sovereignty and constitutional -- when the...
(CROSSTALK)
QUESTION: And so we've been arguing that, because of -- of our federal system, the -- the -- number 1, the federal controlled substances act remains in effect, so from that standpoint, we are still in compliance with our treaty obligations.
Secondly, because of the constitutional principle of dual sovereignty, you have to recognize that -- that drug enforcement is predominantly a -- a state level responsibility. And so we've said that the -- and the -- the federal government has issued its guidance to federal prosecutors on how to deal with marijuana innovations at the state level.
And those -- and -- and those priorities that we have articulated are consistent with our international obligations. They (inaudible) track very closely to the aims and objectives of the 1988 treaty on -- on -- on illegal trafficking in -- in narcotics. So we have prosecutorial discretion. We have that federalism (inaudible), so that's the legal basis that we go forward with.
In terms of the politics of it, I think certainly some countries are -- are criticizing us and accusing us of hypocrisy, but that's really nothing new. And I think the -- the broader goal is to -- to say hey, these-- these treaties are the most effective form of international cooperation that we have.
We need to preserve them. We need to recognize that there is some flexibility in these treaties. There is an opportunity here to tolerate different approaches that sovereign governments are taking in order to deal with their specific problems.
And, fourthly, we want to maintain the international consensus on the transnational organized criminal drug trafficking organizations that are the cause of all the -- the violence and, in some cases, they're threatening to undermine the sovereignties (ph).
(CROSSTALK)
CALABRESI: Thank God for the squishiness of international law.
On the -- on the -- on the other effects, are you seeing any of the -- my colleagues are -- and I'll include myself in the category; quick to see trends where they may or may not exist. The trends -- economic trends resulting from liberalization; are they real? Are you seeing data to support that or is that largely a, you know, sort of initial reporting yet to be confirmed?
(UNKNOWN): Trends...
CALABRESI: We'll say drops in marijuana cultivation in Mexico as a result of liberalization in the US; is that affecting heroin cultivation and things like that?
I've seen other reports...
(CROSSTALK)
(UNKNOWN): I -- I think the heroin poppy cultivation is continuing to increase as the market increases. I have not seen any signs of -- I haven't seen any data either way on -- on marijuana...
(CROSSTALK)
CALABRESI: Any effect on cartels? There's been other reporting I've seen about the cartels, you know, losing...
(CROSSTALK)
MCCAFFREY: Well one of the things we're seeing, by the way (inaudible) always (ph), when you -- in terms of heroin addiction, it has gone up dramatically. I -- you know, I -- I'm -- I'm a major behavioral healthcare company.
We watched heroin addiction treatment rates plummet for 10 years in a row; now it's going back up. It's in direct relationship to incredibly enhanced DEA activity and state law. Florida was producing 94 percent of the country's diverted opiates. They changed their law; things have gotten a lot better.
So now, instead of 40 bucks for an OxyContin pill; you go to high-quality heroin out of Colombia or Mexico. So again, I'm -- our argument has always been we don't care why you're leading a drug-addicted life with these devastating consequences to your family and the community. What we want to do is address all those at the same time.
And you know, good look to you...
(CROSSTALK)
CALABRESI: Question from...
(CROSSTALK)
CALABRESI: Thank you very much for your patience.
QUESTION: I'm a Latin America specialist and have played a variety of roles in my career.
But what -- it -- it seems to me that one of the issues that we haven't discussed is the coordination of the efforts of the multiple different actors, whether it's the OAS or the Inter-American Development Bank and -- and others.
And I'm struck also that the relationship of drug production and then trafficking and so forth also has to do with kind of development economics. And one of my favorite stories is -- and this was reported by the ONDCP in one of its Andean (ph) studies that, in the case, Columbia, the farm gate price for cocoa leaf was less than the potential farm gate price for commercial, edible crops.
But there weren't farm-to-market roads to get the commercial crops to market. And we have -- we still haven't gotten to the point where we're thinking about these backward linkages on the -- the problem, it seems. And I think it would be interesting to get some -- some comment on -- on that.
And then, General McCaffrey, what happened to ONDCP? I think your -- it was to your comment, I think that it's not what it used be.
(CROSSTALK)
MCCAFFREY: Question I brought out and I answered (ph).
(CROSSTALK)
MCCAFFREY: You know, one of the studies -- Margaret's been around this issue a long time and I -- I did a study when I was South Com Commander that showed the -- the amount of money we were putting into Bolivia, if I remember the study as (ph).
And there was a direct correlation between the amount of money we spent as it increased, and the increase coca cultivation. And it turned around, because we had some Bolivian leadership; Quiroga (ph) and others, young guys who got in there and said wait; this has to be Bolivian policy from the bottom up; not U.S. policy from the bottom -- from the top down.
And they organized themselves and they said, look; we're victims of this criminal conspiracy. We're devout Catholic, hardworking, family-oriented people, which they are. That's what Bolivian families are like and they organized themselves and it turned around on a dime.
Now my friend Evo Morales is in there; things are not quite as positive, but...
(CROSSTALK)
MCCAFFREY: You know, I would suggest that U.S. policy has -- the older I get, the less I believe we can affect almost anything in the world, outside our own borders. You know, there just -- our ability to change the realities on the ground.
The reason Colombia looks so good isn't a billion dollars a year in planning (ph) Colombia, which was a key asset; helicopters, primarily. It's because the Colombians had courage, political will and got sick of having their young people kidnapped and held in the jungle for five years.
So you know, I always like to turn this thing around and tell Mexico, look; you're the ones with a drug problem that's skyrocketing. You're the ones with crime on the street and we ought to be willing to support them, a fellow democracy, 'cause we're in the same lifeboat with them, but the solution to these problems isn't U.S. policy.
CALABRESI: We have time for -- for one more question; please.
QUESTION: Much of what I hear and what I read on -- on -- on issues of drug policy seems to go between debates around interdiction, legalization or something in between.
What I wanted to ask you folks and -- and some people around the table can also answer this; where is the language around comorbidities with drug use? And maybe I'm asking you to read my mind, in a sense; the harm reduction aspect of all of this?
Because, for example, we went to Afghanistan and we were so focused on -- on supply reduction that we totally missed the fact that Afghan was -- Afghanistan was having a blooming HIV academic around its drug use.
And while we were busy trying to get Afghan farmers to change their production and training Afghans actually to improve their criminal justice system to interdict these issues, we were forgetting that part of their society was potentially getting eroded, certainly in a generational sense, because of this growing epidemic.
So what are we doing in Afghan, or, for that matter, in New York City in the '90s with -- with, you know crystal meth and HIV issue? Where is this arm (ph) reduction sort of comorbid debate?
MCCAFFREY: Well, I think, you know -- you know, comorbidity; I thought you were going to talk primarily mental health...
(CROSSTALK)
QUESTION: And also sort of mental health, of course...
(CROSSTALK)
MCCAFFREY: ... 'cause I think that's really a huge issue. And the United States -- by the way, there's (ph) enormous importance in the government people around this table; most of my time as the National Drug Policy director -- becoming a student of NIH on it.
If you are chronically using drugs and you're 17 years old, chances are significant that you have a mental health disorder, which we might have diagnosed at 10 or 12 and might have intervened and -- and -- and dealt with it.
Conversely, if you're 15 and tried pot or crack cocaine or meth, you're going to like it, a lot. And you're going to run around telling your friends, so we get this medical model in which it spreads. And if you start using drugs and you use them until your mid-20s, you now have a mental health problem also.
So -- and yet when you -- in the U.S. government, at the federal level or state level, these two pots of money; mental health and -- and drugs are -- my principal job, according to my constituents, was fighting for drug policy money against the enemy, which was the mental health community.
I'm slightly overstating it, but not much. So I think your -- your major point is, if you want to address drug addiction, you have to take a holistic, science-based approach, which includes mental health, malnutrition, AIDS, tuberculosis, leg sores, unemployment; whatever.
To understand the drug issue, I tell you, if you're in a community -- everybody at this table; let me just offer a thought to you. Go to an A.A. meeting 10 times, or N.A. Got to a -- I take mayors into drug treatment facilities all the time and they're shocked.
They're waiting to see somebody else's people are in there. And what they're looking at is their own community. So, you know, at the end of the day, poor Honduras; God, my heart goes out to Latin Americans. Mexico and Canada; thank God we've got these two nations as neighbors.
At the end of the day, what we got to deal with is prevention and education targeted at adolescents, followed by effective, science-based drug treatment. That's what the -- that's what the issue is.
CALABRESI: Foreign policy begins at home.
Thank you very much. That's all we have time for. And thank you to the Council for organizing the...

Can you tell me if there is any Frost on the back panel behind the food in the freezer? Also is the fan running in the freezer?
My first thought was since this is a seemingly erroneous signal tripping the temperature alarm circuit could this be a failure of the control board? I'm not that sure of how to test for such a problem.
This is not my personal freezer but I'm going over to see it again tommorow. I'll let you know what I see.
Any thoughts on the control board? - Thanks
Hi Bryan,
Looks like the problem has been narrowed down to the door switch or the control board. Here's what's going on.
Freezer temperature is correct on the display according to my readings (1 degree). No frost build up on back panel. Fan working fine.
When I put it into diagnostic mode it showed the door open/ajar when door was closed. That part is clear cut and looks like a bad control board or a bad door switch.
My question to you is, does the door light switch communicate this information to the control board or is there some other sensor that does that job?
Can you think of anything I may be missing here? - ThxSenator Charles Schumer speaking at a ILIR event Photo by: ILIR

The Irish American community have given a warm welcome to the new immigration reform plan coming out of the Senate.
Democratic Senators Charles Schumer (NY), Robert Menendez (NJ) and Harry Reid (NV) have drafted a proposal that would legalize undocumented immigrants in the U.S and also provide new employment-based visas.
However, the legalization program would be delayed until so-called benchmarks are reached involving border security.
Ciaran Staunton, the President of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, said the bill was a long-overdue first step in restoring the Irish American community and he paid tribute to Senator Schumer.
"Schumer has always been a good friend to the Irish in New York," he said. "We deeply appreciate all his heart-felt work for us on the issue."
The "RSM" proposal would provide temporary Green Cards to illegal immigrants who register with the authorities.
The plan also includes a high-tech ID card for immigrant workers and "tough sanctions" against U.S. employers who hire illegal immigrants.
Democrats hope to attract Republican support by being tough on the border.
Staunton said this meant the ILIR would be renewing its efforts to reach out to Republican Senators.
Just Thursday, Staunton led a key ILIR delegation to meet with Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) in the Capitol.
The "RSM" proposal is a direct response to the furor over Arizona's new immigration law, which some have criticized as "racial profiling," and would also prevent states and local governments from creating their own immigration laws.
Speaking in Washington Thursday, Reid said, "Democrats and Republicans can all agree that our immigration system is broken," and called for bipartisan cooperation to fix it.What are we “about”? We are about our customers..

Blooming Nonsense: Experiment Reveals Louisiana's Florist Licensing Scheme as Pointless and Anti-Competitive
Blooming Nonsense: Experiment Reveals Louisiana's Florist Licensing Scheme as Pointless and Anti-Competitive
By Dick Carpenter II, Ph.D.
March 2010.
In the floral design experiment, judges were 18 randomly chosen florists—eight from Texas and 10 from Louisiana. All of the Louisiana florist-judges were licensed. Fifty floral arrangements were purchased from randomly selected retail floral stores. The retailers had no idea that their designs would be judged by other florists, which means the arrangements represented typical products purchased by consumers on any given day. Half of the arrangements came from Louisiana stores, and the other half were purchased from Texas shops. All florists were given a “theme” for the arrangements—sympathy—and some general parameters in which to work: Arrangements were to be within $50 to $75; the arrangements were to be in a basket, vase or bowl; and the arrangements were all to be different. Otherwise they were free to be creative in designing the arrangements.
The experiment looked much like a floral design competition. The 50 arrangements were randomly ordered on tables in a hotel conference room with identification numbers. Florist-judges were given rating sheets and asked to score all 50 arrangements based on the printed criteria, such as proportion, balance, color, form and workmanship. Judges did not know any arrangement’s state of origin or even that arrangements had come from different states. Possible total scores for each arrangement ranged from 10 to 50. When all judges finished rating all arrangements, they participated in a 30-minute focus group and answered questions about their perceptions of the arrangements, opinions of quality based on state of origin, and attitudes about licensure.
The judges’ ratings of floral arrangements were essentially the same no matter which state the arrangements came from, regulated Louisiana or unregulated Texas. Data were analyzed using multiple regression, a form of statistical analysis that tests the relationship between two variables—here, judges’ scores and whether arrangements came from Louisiana or Texas—while controlling for the effects of other variables. This analysis controlled for the state of origin of the judge, the freshness of the arrangement and the cost of the arrangements. Controlling for these variables removes the “muddying” effects they may have on the relationship between arrangement state and ratings. For example, if Louisiana arrangements were more costly (because, for instance, they used more or better flowers or other materials), they might be judged better primarily for that reason rather than any differences in quality of design or workmanship that might (or might not) have resulted from licensure.[4]
After controlling for cost, the scores of the arrangements were essentially the same no matter where they came from. As Figure 1 indicates, Texas arrangements, on average, received a rating of 25 out of a possible 50, while Louisiana arrangements scored an average of 24.05.[5] The difference between the two average scores is not statistically significant; in other words, they are essentially the same.[6]
Figure 1: Louisiana and Texas Ratings are Statistically Equivalent
Results illustrated in Figure 2 indicate that consistency was strong regardless of whether it was all judges rating all arrangements, Louisiana judges rating Louisiana arrangements, Texas judges rating Texas arrangements, Louisiana judges rating Texas arrangements, and so forth.
In this figure, taller bars indicate more consistency. Perfect consistency would result in a bar reaching the top of the graph. For the ICC numbers, results of .70 and greater typically indicate strong consistency; the closer to 1.00 the results, the stronger the consistency.
As indicated, all bars are near the top, indicating high levels of consistency. Moreover, all ICC numbers are greater than .70, and all but one exceed .80. Of particular interest is the first bar—all judges across all arrangements. These results show consistency that is quite strong, greater than .90. This means that whether the judges were licensed or not, they gave the arrangements very similar scores.[7] It appears that Louisiana’s licensing law does not produce more discriminating florists.
This view held even after it was pointed out that Louisiana requires a license and Texas does not. Again, almost all of the judges—including the licensed florists from Louisiana—expected no difference in the quality of arrangements because of Louisiana’s licensing law. They noted that quality of work was a function of the standards set by individual businesses rather than a licensing regime, and those standards themselves were a function of consumer demand and market competition. As one florist commented, “If you don’t do good work, you’re not going to have any business.”
Most Louisiana florists in particular thought little of the value of the license due to the required testing regime. All of them derided the test as outdated and irrelevant. Aspiring florists are tested on skills and knowledge that bear no resemblance to contemporary floristry, requiring test-takers to demonstrate proficiency with techniques that were abandoned decades ago. Moreover, the Louisiana florists dismissed the floral designs required on the test as “old school” and “ugly”—nothing a contemporary consumer would ever demand or want.
Many in the focus groups thought that instead of producing quality florists, the licensing scheme served two purposes—raising money for the state and shutting out competition. The license generates revenue from florists or aspiring florists through testing fees and annual licensure renewal. Test-takers pay the state of Louisiana $150 each time they take the full test and $100 each time they re-take the design portion. Annual licensure renewals cost florists $75.[8]
The second purpose, shutting out competition, was frequently mentioned by focus group participants. Most referred to it negatively, but a few supported the idea of a license excluding competition from “amateurs”—those who work out of their homes—or “freelancers”—people who buy flowers from the same wholesalers but then create and sell arrangements through means other than a traditional florist shop or store.[9]
Despite these few, however, most spoke disparagingly of the anti-competitive effects of licensure. One even shared how a competing floral shop across the street from her store repeatedly called the Louisiana Horticulture Commission, the agency responsible for administering the florist license regime, with trumped up complaints as a way to harass and damage her business.
Finally, the suggestion that the purported “gate-keeping” effects of licensure might be beneficial as a way to protect the public from poor quality or unsafe florists or floral products drew skeptical laughter from florists in the focus groups. As one Louisiana judge concluded, “You really can’t hurt anybody with a flower.”
Not surprisingly, there is a complete dearth of evidence for the law’s benefit to anyone other than already-licensed florists and the state’s revenue stream. This experiment found no difference in quality of arrangements between those created in Louisiana and those from Texas, a neighboring nonlicensing state. Further, the judgments made by licensed Louisiana florists were no different than those made by unlicensed florists just across the state line. And the derisive laughter and comments made by the licensed Louisiana florists in our focus groups suggest that licensure is not needed to protect public health and safety from any supposed dangers associated with unlicensed floristry.
The ultimate and most important measure of quality and accountability remains the customer. Leslie Massony, a floral designer in Monique’s store, took and failed Louisiana’s test twice; yet she has been published in floral design books and boasts a list of celebrity clients. “The customers are the people that really count,” she says. “They are the ones who pay the bills and who I really have to keep happy.”

[4]In fact, the Louisiana arrangements in this experiment cost, on average, $14 more than those from Texas. Even though the floral shops were asked to provide arrangements within the $50 to $75 range, some of the Texas arrangements cost less than $50. I also controlled for freshness because the experiment took place over two days, so later judges’ scores may have been influenced by less fresh flowers.
[5] These are the adjusted averages after controlling for cost and the other covariates listed above.
[6] The precise regression results are included in the table below. Cost and freshness were centered; dichotomous variables (arrangement state, judge state and their interaction) were coded using effect coding.
[7] These results were consistent with the aforementioned regression analysis, which included a variable that measured the judges’ state of origin. As the table in endnote 6 indicates, the difference in ratings based on judge state was not statistically significant.

This guide shows how to replace the pressure gauge on a typical pool cartridge filter.
The first step is to turn off the pool pump to stop the flow of water through the pool cartridge filter.
Next you will have to relieve the pressure that has built up in the pool filter. To relieve pressure turn the air relief valve on top of the filter counter-clockwise. Water will spray out initially as you see the pressure on the pool filter pressure gauge go to 0 psi.
Twist the base of the pool filter pressure gauge counter-clockwise to remove the gauge from the top of the pool filter head. You may have to use an open end wrench to loosen the gauge. If you twist too hard from the top of the pressure valve, you may break the valve.
Wrap the threads of the pressure gauge with 3 layers of plumbers Teflon tape. Wind the tape CLOCKWISE as you face the open end of the fitting, beginning at the end of the fitting. DO NOT use Plumber's Pipe Dope.
Hand tighten and then turn the base of the gauge 1/4 turn with an open end wrench. DO NOT over tighten.
Turn on power to the pool pump to repressurize the pool filter.
The air relief valve should still be open. As the pressure builds, air will be released through the relief valve. When water starts to spray out of the valve, turn the valve clockwise to close it.
Check the pressure gauge. It typically reads between 10 - 20 psi but this will vary according to the make of pool cartridge filter or its age.

Playwright-director Arthur Laurents regrets giving Warner Bros. permission to adapt Gypsy for the big screen.
In an interview with Behind the Curtain's Frank Rizzo, Laurents, who wrote the original 1959 Broadway musical and directed three Broadway revivals of it, said composer Stephen Sondheim talked him out of pursuing the remake.
"He said, 'What is the point of it?' " Laurents says of his conversation with Sondheim.  concludes, "So I don't want it now. I don't want a definitive record. I want it to stay alive."
The original Broadway version of Gypsy was made into a film starring Rosalind Russell and Natalie Wood in 1962. Barbra Streisand was in talks with Warner Bros. to star as Mama Rose in the remake, with Joel Silver attached to produce.
"I think [Streisand] is disappointed. She wanted very much to do it," Laurents says. "That would have been a good exit for her career. [King's Speech director] Tom Hooper wanted to direct it. I think he's wonderful."
A source says Streisand was "seriously engaged in the idea of doing it," adding that Laurents is "notoriously prickly." He goes back with Streisand to her first Broadway performance in I Can Get It For You Wholesale, which he wrote and directed in 1959.
The observer notes that at 93, Laurents was probably overwhelmed by the prospect of making the film and dealing with Streisand (known for her perfectionism) and the often-demandingBroich back to A-League best: Roar
Depending.Let. Given that the web is indeed global, then anyone from London to Lahore can view your carefully crafted web pages – and if you want to appeal to a global audience, it may be best to design your site so that it’s easier to convert for international visitors.
Arabic, for example, has around 300 million native speakers around the globe, and as an official language in 26 countries (the third most after English and French), it’s clear that Arabic is a language that shouldn’t be ignored for those seeking to make serious inroads into international markets.
Using Unicode
Fancy graphics and cool colour schemes will certainly help sell your site to the masses – but ultimately, the old adage that content is king certainly rings true for most websites.
With that in mind, even if the plan is to build your website in English only, if you design using Unicode from the start, you will be well positioned to adapt your pages for other languages later on. Unicode is the only sensible character-set option that enables websites to support different scripts. UTF-8 is compatible with over 90 written languages (‘scripts’) and has a range of over a hundred thousand different characters.
Importantly, UTF-8 is supported by the most common browsers (Explorer, FireFox etc) and Operating Systems (Windows, Linux, MacOs), whilst the likes of Apple, Microsoft, IBM and other industry lynchpins have all adopted it as a standard.
Even if you don’t plan to use a non-Latin script on your site such as Arabic, the German alphabet, for example, contains an additional four characters: Ä, Ö, Ü and ß. Many other European alphabet systems use even more characters – which is why using Unicode is important.
Green Hats: Cultural and Colour Considerations
If you are setting up a website primarily to be aimed at audiences in the US or the UK, that’s great. But what if your strategy changes later on? It’s much easier to develop the aesthetics of your site from the start, rather than re-designing it later on.
Clearly, you can’t structure the aesthetics of your website to please everyone. But you can choose a culturally sensitive colour scheme – remember that different colours can mean different things in different cultures.
For example, in the United Arab Emirates and other Arabic cultures, green signifies holiness or luck, whilst blue represents immortality and is deemed a ‘protective’ colour. Orange has religious connotations for Protestants in Northern Ireland, and whatever you do, you might want to avoid placing a green hat anywhere on your website, as this means that a man’s wife has been unfaithful to him in China.
A light-coloured background with dark text is a safe bet across the world – it’s easy to read. Any other graphics, patterns or colour schemes you use should be chosen to reflect any markets you plan to enter: as a general rule of thumb, it’s best to avoid anything that is potentially divisive, such as religious, political or sexual symbols. A picture of a partially clad lady may go down a storm in the West, but in many eastern cultures, a dim view may be taken of this.
Layout & Navigation
Not all languages read from left to right. Arabic is one such language that reads in the opposite direction (right-to-left) and as such, this can throw up some issues when converting your design for specific markets.
If your navigation bar is vertically positioned on the left-hand-side of your English language website, then in Arabic users will obviously have to read from the right to left which means the navigation bar may not appear in your preferred position in relation to the direction the user is reading.
Of course, it’s not the end of the world if you have to shift the navigation bar to the other side of the page for your Arabic site, but for simplicity – and uniformity – you may favour a horizontally positioned navigation bar instead. This means the rest of your design and layout templates can remain the same across all your sites.
Bandwidth Barriers
This may be hard to believe, but not all countries have high-speed broadband internet access yet. Much of South America, Africa and even parts of Asia are still on internet connections that most people in Western countries would deem ‘slow’. With that in mind, you may want to avoid really heavy graphics and bandwidth-sapping Flash animations – it’s unlikely web users will hang around for ten minutes for a picture to load on their screen.
This doesn’t mean you should build text-only websites, but it does mean you should perhaps provide two options for web users: a simple HTML only version and a normal, flashy ‘bells and whistles’ version.
Multilingual SEO
You might have the most beautifully designed website in the world, but if nobody can find it on the World Wide Web, then is there any point in it being there?
Visibility is everything on the internet, which is why search engine optimisation (SEO) plays such a crucial part of any web content strategy. The issue of SEO is probably best left for another article, but for those who already optimise their English language site, it’s worth bearing in mind one golden rule of thumb when optimising your site for international markets: never translate your keywords directly.

It was four years ago, and you’re sure it was put in the right place, but you’ve since changed systems, and you’re having trouble remembering how the old one worked, or you think the final version may have been saved on Gary’s laptop, because Gary loves to have final review, which is generally a good thing …

Renovations in the Works for Second Floor Reference Area
- Each time the Weinberg Library conducts a survey, whether by informal means or by the nationally recognized LibQual instrument, additional group study rooms are always at the top of the most requested improvement list. As more and more professors assign projects that require collaboration, the Library struggles to keep up with the requisite equipment and environments to meet the students' needs. On the eve of the Weinberg Library's 20th anniversary, a small ad hoc committee has been formed to oversee a redesign of the second floor of the building as a way to address the growing desire for more group study areas and utilize space that houses materials that have seen decreased usage due to advances in technology – print indexes, abstracts and reference books. Comprised of reference librarians and administrative staff, this group has been meeting regularly to determine how to best retrofit the second floor for optimal use. Students who use this floor on a regular basis seem to like the excellent lighting, proximity to computers and printers, and the moderate presence of noise that emanates from the Reference Desk transactions. Students choosing to sit at the tables near the desk can and do engage in conversation while studying or working on group projects. Nearly all of these tables are filled during fall and spring semesters whenever the library is open. Comfortable couches, single carrels, and some moveable tables and chairs complete the furniture arrangements in the reference area on the second floor.
-
- The first step in planning for the design began last summer when the reference librarians identified books in each subject area in the reference stacks that could be moved to circulation, replaced by newer editions, or recycled. This process has been progressing throughout the fall and intersession semesters. Consultation with the academic departments will be conducted before the final decision to move the volumes will be made. Our next step was to examine the microfilm area – what equipment is still functioning to full capacity, what cabinets can be condensed, and how we can make that area into additional group study rooms. Help from both the Acquisitions and Serials Departments has been invaluable in determining how much space will ultimately be available for our renovations. As word of the redesign has spread throughout the library, additional suggestions for improvement have been made. The interlibrary loan staff asked if the remaining bound journals could be moved to the second floor, thus housing all formats of serials (current, microfilm, and bound) in one location. This idea was studied and may be implemented, thus freeing up additional study space in the new 24-hour room on the first floor.
-
- The committee is striving to make the changes both cost effective and flexible. Trends in information access make predicting how patrons will utilize both equipment and space difficult to foresee within the next six months, let alone trying to imagine how the next 10 years will evolve. Therefore, flexibility is key in light of the considerable costs of recarpeting, constructing new floor- to- ceiling walls, and changing lighting and HVAC to accommodate major renovation projects.
-
- With the assistance of equipment and furniture vendors, the committee has made a wish list of various moveable partitions and versatile furnishings which should result in an attractive, cost-efficient, and welcoming group study areas on the second floor. Once the condensation of microfilm equipment, holdings, and reference materials has been completed, the actual implementation of the plan will begin. Stay tuned for these improvements as the year progresses.

8 Century Tradition of Hand Blown Glass in Tuscany Italy DYING OUT!
(1/1)
InfinityVetro:
Hello
My name is Isak Lystad I am a glass artist from Seattle, Washington, however 5 years ago I moved to Tuscany, Italy.
We now have an initiative live online to raise funds to establish a non profit artistic glassblowing school in the historical center of Florence Italy.
The realization of our vision would carry on the 8 century tradition of blowing glass by hand in Tuscany which has all but died out.
With only one glassblowing factory left, learning on the job is no longer a sustainable method to transfer this traditional knowledge in the region. No independent schools our public glass studios exist as the history here has been almost completely industrial.
Please take a moment to watch our video to learn more about the project:
To learn about Tuscan glass, and the artistic approach we would like to introduce to Tuscany/Italy please watch this video:
We welcome and appreciate any and all types of support and constructive criticism.
Please do not hesitate to contact me for any reason.
Thank you for your time and attention.
Kindest Regards,
Isak Lystad

Cole Barkocy, Garrett Bronn, Edgar Chavez, Dominik Chece, Carlos Duran, Remy Edstrom, Nikolas Getzinger, Andrew Grabowski, Benjamin Kassel, Alexander Kern, Cade Klusendorf, Alex Lee, Gavin Rathjen, Sean Reardon, Justin Rutherford, Kevin Winslow; Coach: Kristian Rockall
After winning the U14 Boys Illinois Presidents Cup, Crystal Lake Force Elite rolled thru the Midwest Presidents Cup going undefeated, scoring 13 goals while only allowing two. Although their goal differential wasn’t as great at the National Presidents Cup, Crystal Lake played well enough to earn a spot in the National Championship against Cal South’s Downtown SC Black, who they had tied 1-1 24- hours earlier.
In the final Crystal Lake jumped out to a 3-0 first half lead. Cade Klusendorf notched a pair of goals (8’ and 19’) as did his teammate Nikolas Getzinger (14’). Downtown SC started to make a comeback in the second half, with goals by David Orellana (45’) and Gomez Frank Barrios (55’), but Crystal Lake’s strong defense helped maintain the 3-2 win.
"The biggest feeling associated with this achievement is one of pride," Kristian Rockall, CL Force Head Coach said. "I am proud of my team and what they have accomplished, not just for themselves and for Crystal Lake FORCE, but also how well they've represented Illinois and Region 2 along the way. It's great when a local team like ours, (where all the players live within 10 miles of each other) are able to compete and experience success at the Regional and National level.
"We're thankful that the President's Cup has created a platform for teams such as ours to play on such a grand stage. The President's Cup experience has been remarkable all the way through from Rockford to Overland Park and finally Florida. The tournament is very professionally run and the organizers do a great job of making it a special experience for the players. The facilities, the fields, the officiating and the media coverage have all been excellent and certainly helped to give our team an truly amazing experience that they'll never forget."
For the tournament, 4 Crystal Lake players finished in the top 10 of goal scorers: Getzinger (3), Klusendorf (3), Carlos Duran and Justin Rutherford (1)
Emma Hughes, Katie Juhlin, Boyd Kendall, Sara Kinsella, Maddie Klintworth, Sameena Koriala, Rachel Mays, Taylor Parriott, Riley Ross, Alie Smith, Carolynn Smith, Shea Sullivan, Karmen Vicari-Endres, Macy Vorreyer, Beverly Watson, Kendall Ziel; Coach: Rhett Mays
After falling to Elite SC Black in the finals of the Illinois Presidents Cup, it looked as if the SASA Spirits' Presidents Cup journey was over. When a Wild Card spot opened at the Midwest Presidents Cup, SASA seized the opportunity and went on to bring the Regional title back to Springfield.
SASA opened the National Tournament with a 1-1 draw against Pennsylvania's WCUSC Predators 98. From there on SASA would go undefeated in group play, beating Platinum FC Sanchez of California South and Florida's Cape Coral Cyclones en route to a rematch against the Predators in the National Finals.
In the championship, SASA was down 1-0 in the first half, but tfound their vigor in the second half and shifted the game in their favor. Within ten minutes, Maddie Klintworth (42'), Kendall Boyd (45') and Macy Vorreyer (50') all scored to give SASA the 3-1 advantage and the win.
"The girls are very excited," said Rhett Mays, SASA Head Coach. "The President Cup was an overall positive experience. It has the feel of a national championship for smaller clubs like ours. - like 1A in high school soccer in Illinois."
Boyd finished as the tournament's top goal scorer with three goals. Illinois Presidents Cup for Girls U15-U17 is held in the Fall and for Boys U13-U17 and Girls U13-U14 in the Spring.Open Manage Value ListsOpens the Manage Value Lists dialog box, where the user can manage new or edit existing value lists.This script step is the same as choosing File menu > Manage > Value Lists.Use this script step to open the Manage Value Lists dialog box for users if you have restricted their access to FileMaker Pro menus.The following script displays a message box that asks if the user wants to create or edit a value list, and opens the Manage Value Lists dialog box if the response is Yes.Show Custom Dialog ["Do you want to create or edit a value list?"]

The soundtrack also enjoyed time on the Billboard hits charts. Hamlisch died suddenly on August 6, 2012. His death was initially a mystery, but was attributed to lung failure.
The respiratory failure happened in mere minutes and was caused by oxygen failing to reach his brain and high blood pressure, notes The Daily Mail.
The 68-year-old composer long suffered from hypertension and had sustained brain damage when oxygen failed to reach the organ. After the In Memoriam montage to the industry’s friends who were lost in the last year, Barbara Streisand took to the Oscars stage and said:
“Marvin Hamlisch was a composer of extraordinary depth and versatility. He was also a very kind and generous friend who could always make me laugh. Over the years, we shared many adventures together. Marvin left us way too soon, but I’ll always have those wonderful, wonderful memories.”
She then launched into “The Way We Were,” as a way of remembering the good times with Hamlisch. The In Memoriam section also saw famous names like Michael Clarke Duncan, who tragically died of a heart attack last summer.

Fernando Sousa only managed six minutes against Georgia last summer during the Qualifying Round but could be something of a potential ‘X-Factor' if selected. He's only ever played for his hometown team throughout his career and has to let his ability speak for itself rather than his experience. He is a very versatile player whose key has always been his consistency. He is a smart player who can put the ball on the floor, make incisive passes or shoot from outside. During the last couple of seasons he has made more and more of an impact in the Portuguese League where he is one of the best small forwards. As well as several appearances as an All Star, he has also played for his country at the World University Games. What he might lack in international experience, he can add in heart and focusing capacities. He's also a strong defender particularly around the perimeter. He was expected to play more minutes last season, but an injury put him out of the team.

Ismaninger Str. 21, 81675 Munich, Germany.P. (+49-89) 78 06 08-0 F.:(+49-89) 78 06 08-59This week credit unions will be receiving information regarding the LSCU’s 2012 board elections. Elections will be held for four director seats expiring this year as designated by the LSCU board of directors to ensure compliance with LSCU Bylaws. This year in Alabama there will be one Class A seat and one Class C seat up for election. In Florida, there will be two Class A seats up for election. The membership size categories are as follows:
The LSCU Bylaws state that the board should have equal representation for the makeup of our credit unions. That’s why we have two seats in Classes A, B, C and D in each state. This gives all of our credit unions an equal voice at the governance level of the League. All three Class A seats are open with no incumbents running. So, we’re looking for three new board members. The only incumbent seat we have is Class C in Alabama currently held by Five Star CU CEO Bob Steensma. The official Nomination and Certification Form must be received no later than 4 p.m. CST/5 p.m. EST on Friday, April 20 to be eligible for nomination. After all candidates are properly certified to run, we will be sending out an electronic ballot this year in an effort to both increase participation and make the voting process as easy as possible.
I highly encourage eligible credit unions to consider submitting a nomination for the board or running yourself. The LSCU board meets approximately four times a year; basically once a quarter. The first- and fourth-quarter meetings are usually held in the League’s Birmingham office. The second-quarter meeting is in conjunction with the AC&E in Orlando and the third-quarter meeting is held in conjunction with the board’s fall planning retreat, which could be either in Alabama or Florida. Travel cost for these meetings are covered by the LSCU.
For those considering running, it’s important that you be prepared to be actively involved in the credit union movement – at the Chapter, League and CUNA levels. The LSCU board of directors are the League’s ambassadors. That means attending Chapter meetings and many of the League functions for credit unions like the State GAC in your state, the CUNA GAC, the AC&E, our fall Hike the Hill and the Development Conference. You are considered a leader in the Alabama and Florida credit union movement when you’re on the League board and many credit unions will be following your lead and expect to see you at these events.
By being actively involved in the credit union movement, board members ensure that the board is conveying to League senior management the views of member credit unions. It’s also important that our board commits to attending many of the League events to let the other credit unions in their Chapter know what the League is doing on their behalf and encourage more to become actively engaged.
Look for the nomination forms by the middle of this week. I hope you will take some time to identify a qualified and eligible credit union official(s) that you think will best represent the interest of our Alabama and Florida credit unions on the LSCU board of directors. Being on the board can be a rewarding experience; especially for those willing to be active and engaged ambassadors.
I welcome your thoughts and feedback.

La Pine's video message: Call your senator today about MBLs
LSCU President/CEO Patrick La Pine emailed a video message late last week asking credit unions to contact their senator and ask them to support member business lending. With a vote coming possibly in April, it's important credit unions contact Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Richard Shelby (R-AL) and ask them to support raising the MBL cap. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) is a co-sponsor. Visit the LSCU Video Room to view the video.

Alabama Legislative Update
With the legislative session officially at the halfway mark,
the League expects to see the lawmakers in Montgomery begin to address issues
such as the Education Trust Fund and General Fund Budget as well as continue
with the 2012 theme of creating more jobs.
So far, the session has had very little controversy and with Republicans
controlling a super-majority in both houses, the second half should not be much
different. Of course there will be minor
disagreements on certain non-partisan bills, and there still hasn’t been the
annual Jefferson County delegation meltdown, but at this point all signs are
pointing to a smooth ending.
This week many of you will be in Montgomery to attend the 2012
State GAC, and the League is excited to be hosting this event again. There are many informative work sessions, a
legislative reception, and a trip to the Alabama Statehouse in order to see
your legislators face-to-face and watch them work. Whether it is five minutes or 30, the
time you spend with legislators is important. With public deposit legislation
being introduced for the first time, a bill filed to raid the Alabama Credit
Union Administration, and numerous other attacks on financial industries
(mainly aimed at banks, but unfortunately credit unions are affected as well),
it is crucial that credit union CEOs and staff build a relationship and even a
friendship with those that represent you in Montgomery. These friendships open doors for discussion
and ensure that credit union-friendly legislators are looking out for you on a
daily basis.
We look forward to seeing all of you in Montgomery this week
and if you haven’t registered for the 2012 State GAC, you can do so by clicking here. You will
not regret it and your involvement in the political process is essential to the
credit union movement.:
The state's new redistricting map, which had been sent back
to the legislature by the Florida Supreme Court after being ruled
unconstitutional, was completed during a special session, which culminated with
the March 27 61-to-47 vote in favor. The vote was closer than the previously approved
map because 11 Republicans, mostly from the Miami Delegation, joined Democrats
in opposition of the plan. The Republican opponents argued the Senate map
violates a Fair Districts provision in the Florida Constitution that protects
minority voting rights. They said census figures easily would support a fourth
Hispanic district in South Florida, yet, the map has only three. The previous map
had no incumbents placed in the same district, while this map has only two incumbents set to face each other, Sen. David Simmons (R-Maitland) and Sen.
Andy Gardiner (R-Orlando), though Simmons has already said he will move to
avoid facing Gardiner in the primary. Once the Attorney General petitions the
Supreme Court for review, they will have 30 days to either approve the map or
redraw the map themselves. The League’s Governmental Affairs (GA) team will continue to monitor the
redistricting situation in order to help shape the "Get Out the Vote" activities.
More information will be forthcoming.
The GA team will also continue to focus on meeting with district members to educate them on the importance of credit unions, what its priority
issues will be heading into the 2013 Legislative Session, and why it believes
credit unions are the best choice for consumers.

Rep. Jo Bonner (R-AL) greets Azalea City CU CEO Ola
Anise.
Nearly 140 credit union officials from Alabama and Florida
participated in these important meetings, discussing three major legislative
initiatives with elected officials. Increasing member business lending
authority for credit unions, legislation to better ensure fairness in the exam
process for credit unions, and legislation to allow credit unions to accept
secondary capitol were all discussed in each office.
Since those meetings, seven members of the League’s two
delegations have signed on as co-sponsors on one or more of the bills for which
credit unions asked their support.
After the meetings, Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) signed on as a
co-sponsor of H.R. 3993, to allow credit unions to accept secondary capital,
joining Rep. Jeff Miller (R-FL), who was already a co-sponsor.
Also since the CUNA GAC two weeks ago, six more co-sponsors from Alabama and Florida have been added to H.R. 3461, the Exam Fairness bill. Since the Hill visits, Florida Reps. Debbie
Wasserman-Shultz (D), Sandy Adams (R), Allen West (R), Ander Crenshaw (R), and
Kathy Castor (R) have signed on as co-sponsors, bringing the Florida delegation
to 15. From the Alabama delegation, Rep. Jo Bonner (R) has joined Rep. Spencer
Bachus (R) as a co-sponsor of the bill. In total, the bill now has 154
co-sponsors. In follow-up conversations
with other offices, the League expects to see more members go on one or both of
these bills in the coming days.

The
League recently announced an exciting opportunity for credit unions. The
Florida Capital Access Program (FL-CAP) is a new program developed by the
Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO), in conjunction with the
federal government. The FL-CAP will work with credit unions and other eligible
financial institutions (Lenders) to increase capital opportunities for
entrepreneurs and small businesses who might not otherwise qualify for
conventional financing. The FL-CAP aims to build the Florida economy by
allowing more small businesses to expand their operations and create new jobs. The
League will be hosting a webinar in conjunction with the DEO on Monday, April
10 at 10 a.m. To register for the webinar click
here.
FL-CAP
provides matching loan-loss reserves for loans that fall just outside a lending
institution’s normal underwriting standards, by depositing the funds into a
pooled account at the participating Lender’s institution. It is expected to
enable up to $200 million in business lending. Businesses located in Florida
with 500 or fewer employees are eligible for loans under the program. The
maximum loan amount is $5 million.
Loans
may be used to finance any business purpose including start-up costs, working
capital, business procurement, franchise fees, equipment, inventory, as well as
the purchase, construction renovation or tenant improvements of an eligible
place of business that is not for passive real estate investment purposes.
Nonprofits must have sustainable financial operations. The program has some
limitations on passive real estate and refinancing of existing debt.
The
FL-CAP will be funded at $20.6 million over the next two years. Gov. Rick Scott
designated the DEO to administer the Florida program.

No peeking.
Presumably the California School Boards Association will introduce the new adherents to the ways of the educational bureaucracy. Topics will include unconditional respect, union coddling, collaborating, achievement gapping, revenue generation, tax enumeration and the proper operation of trite awards ceremonies.
CSBA 2010 Annual Education Conference and Trade Show Guide
It’s loaded with ads for lobbyists and political consultants eager to help young board members navigate the challenges of passing new school bonds and local property taxes.
So will our new school board members drink in the delicious Kool Aid of California’s educational establishment? Or will they withstand the temptation of vacuous adoration from their new group of friends, holding their promises of independence above the cheap thrill of being “liked” by their peers.
I suppose we’ll find out soon enough.

#4 by Colony Rabble on December 1, 2010
Here’s the real catch. Appointed and elected office holders must go through ethics training (like anyone pays attention to that class) and so lobbyists have figured out how to offer it during these conferences, thus taking the burden of payment off the shoulders of the board or its members, while holding members captive at the rest of the event, where they are shmoozed by those that ethics training should be indoctrinating them against. If there’s a way to game the system, special interests will find it.

Hollis, I fought it and relented to do 1 of 4 days at the sincere urging of the Super. 2 hours in however, I am having to pop Gaviscon. The indoctrination is coming fast and hard. Currently listening to how far below average California spending is. Haven’t heard much about the challenges of managing schools as a result of CTA power. In fact, the current Consultant just complimented the CTA’s passage of prop 98. To be honest Hollis, I’m glad I’m hearing this once just to confirm that it is as biased as I assumed. The sense of entitlement is just staggering.

Maybe you should pay attention when being sent to these functions. You weren’t voted in to sit back and be a blogger for Tony. This all seems to be a joke to you but it’s not a joke when it comes to my kid’s education. This was my biggest fear having a blogger voted in to any position. All you want is the approval of your beer drinking friends. Pay attention and do your job when your supposed to. What a waste of money if you only went to 1 of 4 days.

Just curious? I know the last time a conversation like this ended, you hid behind the fact that the super and the board agreed to the terms on the contract. So now your throwing Mr. Thompson some sort of insult by stating he should have an open mind……while attending an agenda filled event.
Open your mind……enough is enough.

Thanks for the insight, Colony.
#19 by Joe Sipowicz on December 2, 2010
Concerned, what does this idiotic indoctrination session have to do with your kid’s education?
Oh, right! Nothing! It’s about spending a few days in the City on the taxpayer’s dime and getting one’s mind right – just in the off chance that it wasn’t right to begin with.
And you think going for all 4 days was the only way to get the taxpayer’s money’s worth?
Ha. Haha. Hahahahaha!

P.S. Going to conferences isn’t Thompson’s “job.” His job is to deliver a responsible and accountable education system to the citizens of Fullerton.

Chris, here is your lovely bag.
I wonder if you have to claim it as a gift?
#22 by Chris Thompson on December 2, 2010
Concerned, you can rest assured that I am as serious as a heart attack about this. Know that the District was able to pay only for the event I attended and one night at the hotel. I will move that we discontinue our relationship with this organization as its advocacy seeks a short sighted cure (more of our money) which will kill the patient. As for blogging at the event, I felt comfortable turning my attention to my Blackberry as the CTA cheerleader was explaining that fellow board members will draw conclusions based upon the tone of my voice and the look on my face rather than the words that I use. I chose the more valuable use of my time at that point.
Incidentally, I should have sent a shot of that lovely bag giving credit to the company which provided it. Piper Jaffray – School Finance.
The CSBA fights to raise taxes and supports legislation which makes it easier to take our money. A quick review of the parcel tax and bond election results for California’s November 2nd election reveals that passage of Prop 39 in 2000 cost voters $1.4 billion in new taxes (Just in Tuesday’s election) as a result of the 28 bonds that passed under the lower 55% threshold which would not have passed under the old 2/3rds threshold. A mere 55% of voters are allowed to tax only property owners. Tragic. The data is gleaned from the California School Boards Association website at:

Compiled by Daily Star staff
Wednesday, October 04, 2006
Israel's national infrastructure minister said on Tuesday that war with Hizbullah might restart in a few months, and called for an enhancement of the Israeli Army's capacities. Benjamin Ben-Eliezer told Israeli public radio that the deployment of the Lebanese Army along the border with Israel "will not ensure safety for Israel" and that Hizbullah still presents a threat to the Jewish state.
Meanwhile, Britain-based Jane's International Defense Review reported that Hizbullah received direct intelligence support from Syria during the month-long Israeli offensive on Lebanon, using data collected by listening posts jointly operated by Russian and Syrian crews.
Hizbullah was also fed intelligence from new listening posts built on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, which are operated jointly with Iran, it claimed.
Israel has also alleged that Russian anti-tank missiles procured by Syria were reportedly transferred to Hizbullah and used during the war.
Syria's centrality to the collection and transfer of intelligence to Hizbullah is based on separate agreements Damascus signed with Moscow and Tehran on intelligence cooperation, the Haaretz report said, adding that the deal with Russia is much older than the one with Iran, which was signed earlier this year.
The intelligence cooperation agreement between Syria and Iran is part of a broader strategic cooperation accord that was achieved in November 2005 and confirmed during Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinjead's visit to Damascus in January 2006, Haaretz said.
According to the Jane's report, in its agreement with Syria, Iran insisted that no Russian intelligence officers should be allowed access to the new listening posts, in spite of the long-standing deal between Damascus and Moscow.
The Russian Embassy in Beirut was not available for comment. A Hizbullah spokesperson said his party had no comment.
In another development, Hizbullah held a funeral on Tuesday for one of its Lebanese fighters, who was also an American citizen.
Radwan Saleh, 35, was killed in July during the early days of fighting. Hizbullah members found Saleh's body on Sunday in the village of Maroun al-Ras, one of the last areas Israeli troops left in line with a UN resolution to end the war.
His wife and four children, who live between Lebanon and the United States, flew in from the US for his funeral.
Hizbullah sources said that Saleh joined the resistance in 2000. He lived in California with his wife and children until 1998 before moving back to Lebanon. - AgenciesMilitary Statues

A two-day consultation organized by the Planning Commission and the UNDP aimed to arrive at a conceptual understanding of inclusive growth and the key determinants of an inclusive growth framework that can guide countries, development agencies and communities in the coming years.
Inclusive development strategies will require more inclusive growth processes that involve those on the "wrong side" of the income divide say participants of a UNDP-Planning Commission consultation in New Delhi.
Highlights
- year
- The consultation was organized by the Planning Commission and UNDP
New Delhi, 24 October, 2011: "Inclusive growth means much more than poverty reduction. Issues of equity, both inter-generational and between rich and poor, regional inequities and the needs of minorities need to be factored in," said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission.
He was speaking at a two-day consultation organised by the Planning Commission and the United Nations Development Programme which began in New Delhi today. years.
According to Ajay Chhibber, UN Assistant Secretary General, UNDP Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, "Special affirmative action programmes that address discrimination will not be sufficient to achieve inclusive growth if the overall growth process is not intrinsically inclusive, i.e. if it does not encourage employment or reduce rural-urban growth disparities."
As concern mounts over the need for policies that promote economic growth and lead to better human development outcomes for people, Patrice Coeur-Bizot, United Nations Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, India, said, "There is now a growing recognition that countries need to simultaneously focus on economic growth and socio-economic progress, and it cannot be assumed that the former will pave the way for the latter."
Tracing the trajectory of theoretical frameworks to understand growth and development, Rathin Roy, Director, International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth said, " Inclusive growth processes target better inclusion of citizens – as workers, entrepreneurs and consumers of public and private goods - in the delivery of growth. An inclusive growth strategy views growth as a target, and relies on the intensive use of factors of production of groups on the wrong side of the income distribution divide such as labour."
The resounding message emanating from day one of the consultation is that a more inclusive development strategy will require a more inclusive growth process itself. Unequal growth accompanied by social programmes for those left behind will not be enough. Social policies play a critical role in the interventions that can enable people to participate on the "right side of the divide."

Mixed martial arts professional Ian Gregory McCall will serve 32 days in Orange County jail for a probation violation that resulted in his arrest last week, his attorney said Tuesday.
Laguna Beach detectives working with federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents as part of an ongoing investigation took the 28-year-old Irvine man into custody on Tuesday, Aug. 14, in Irvine, said Laguna police Capt. Jason Kravetz, who declined to describe the nature of the law enforcement inquiry. Bail was set at $16,500.
The fighter nicknamed “Uncle Creepy,” who competes in the 125-pound flyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, outstanding warrants related to a 2008 drug charge and a suspended license.

A newly appointed state director of an atheist activist group said that he will fight two national Christian-based organizations for what he alleges to be proselytizing at public schools while "targeting the impressionable minds of our children."
Al Stefanelli, the former president of United Atheist Front and presently the Georgia state director for American Atheists, Inc., said he will take action against the Child Evangelism Fellowship and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes this year. Both groups conduct after-school and break-time activities on school campuses throughout the United States with the approval of school officials.
When asked by The Christian Post as to what actions he would take against these groups, Stefanelli said, "I cannot get into specifics at this time, as we are still in the planning/strategizing stages. You can be confident that we will, as always, operate within the law, using peaceful means."
In a statement posted last week on the American Atheists Website, Stefanellis writes that in his new capacity as director in Georgia he will "bring new fights against those who would not only abrogate the First Amendment, but do so to the detriment of our children."
"Make no mistake, these will be difficult fights, as these organizations are large, well-funded and very influential in our schools. The fight will be worth it, though, because what is at stake is our future," he adds in the post.
Stefanellis told CP that his cause is worthy, basing his opposition to Christian organizations using school facilities for activities by claiming the First Amendment guarantees the separation of church and state.
"The groups in question are national organizations that utilize the public school systems as a platform for proselytizing and evangelism," he said. "They are operating by using loopholes, which is unethical and immoral, and my goal is to have their methods classified as illegal."
Christian legal group Alliance Defense Fund responded to the Stefanellis' proclamation headlined "Some of My Activist Targets for 2012" by saying First Amendment rights protect Christian groups as well.
"Just as atheists are free to challenge any government action they believe is improper, the Alliance Defense Fund has the same right to oppose them and to stand with those who believe free speech is for everyone, including Christians," said said.
He added, "ADF will be on the lookout for any attempts by atheists who use threats of litigation to bully schools into conforming to an anti-religious agenda."
A spokeswoman for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes said her group is aware of Stefanellis' plans to target the organization and provided CP with a statement about ministry access in public schools.
The statement reads, "FCA student clubs or Huddles are granted access to public schools and colleges by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Equal Access Act ('the Act'). Passed by Congress in 1984, the Equal Access Act states that whenever a school or college recognizes a single non-curriculum related school club, it must also provide the same access, privileges and benefits to all school clubs. This Act protects religious clubs, like FCA, by giving them equal footing with all other student clubs. This 'limited open forum' is available during non-instructional times, such as before or after school and lunchtime."
"In order for FCA to be a qualified student club, it must be student-initiated and student-led. Many schools require faculty sponsors. As a result, coaches and staff may monitor, facilitate or supervise FCA meetings. Faculty cannot lead or be directly involved in the meetings," the statement concludes.
Stefanellis also has issue with church and ministry organizations, which he says often shine in humanitarian efforts within communities, but are out-of-bounds when it comes to operating within the public school system and government.
"Regardless of majority demographics, not everyone is Christian and these two groups in particular use nefarious methods of passive-aggressive proselytizing that affects the children of non-Christian parents who should be able to send their kids off to school without the worry that they will be exposed to religious propaganda (magazines, tracts, fliers, etc.) that these organizations leave behind, or via the training they give school teachers and administrators to integrate into their daily activities," he said.
"While I am a proponent of adults being free to choose whatever path of enlightenment suits them, I am opponent of child evangelism and indoctrination. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. A child should be given all the facts over their formative years so when they reach adulthood they can make informed decisions about their spirituality without being scared into a belief system under the threat of eternal damnation," Stefanellis added.
ADF's Cortman sees a paradox in Stefanellis' argument.
"The atheists claim that children shouldn't be exposed to religious views, but anti-religious views are apparently fine," he said. "Our children will be taught someone's morality, the question is simply whose will it be?"Google's CR-48 Chrome laptop was a rough draft of the kind of computer people will be using eventually—lean, fast, utterly and completely connected—but it had its problems. (Oh lord, the trackpad.) Samsung's Series 5 Chromebook is like version 1.0.
It's not a netbook, Google will tell you. (Vocally.) But your hands will tell you differently. It's squishy in the middle, when you press on the upper section of the trackpad. Almost like it's hollow. The rest of the plastic body bends like stale bread. It's at that weird intersection between meh plastic and good plastic. And it's thin, notably but not remarkably so.
The trackpad is better than the last Chromebook. It clicks distinctly, forcefully—but also cheaply. Like they were trying to overcompensate for Google's last trackpad while using lower quality parts. (The action isn't as seamless, as say, a MacBook Pro's.) It's still better than the CR-48's by a wide margin, with two-finger scrolling and general tracking working just fine. The keyboard? Great. Soft, in that good way, like some of my favorite Logitech chiclet keyboards, and spacey.
The 12.1-inch, 300-nit screen is nice enough. It plays YouTube videos in 1080p okay, not amazingly.

But that's Flash for you, even with hardware acceleration. Normal tasks—tons of tabs loaded with web apps—totally fine. The 2GB of RAM and dual-core Atom chip are clearly capable, though not Olympic in strength.
All in all, it's about exactly what you'd expect for $429 of computer in the shape of a laptop. No more, and not much less. (To be less ambiguous: An iPad and Samsung's own Galaxy Tab feel like higher quality devices, by a sizable margin.) But hey, I hear these things print now, too.1.

The allegations were made by longtime former CBS News investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson.
According to a story published by The Gateway Pundit, Attkisson appeared on CNN to discuss her recent departure from CBS News after winning journalism awards, particularly with regard to her investigative work on the Fast and Furious scandal that plagued the Obama administration. But apparently the news division gave less and less publicity to her reports, often entirely overlooking extremely damaging information concerning the administration.
Attkisson had already told CNN that Media Matters was being paid to attack her reporting that was perceived by the group as negative toward Barack Obama and his administration. But that, says the Gateway report, is common knowledge. Media Matters, as a matter of course, is paid by political operatives to smear reporters and media outlets that report news that is damaging to Obama and the Democratic Party in general.
But the thing that stood out in Attkisson's statement to CNN on Sunday was that Media Matters is directly involved in producing political news stories at CBS News and for other left-leaning, collectivist outlets. Again, while it has been widely known that Media Matters routinely attempts to spin news stories by working closely with cooperative reporters and producers, never before has the direct allegation been made that the group is actually involved in producing those stories at major liberal outlets.
Attkisson stated,
 –“
Media Matters, of course, denied the allegations. And CBS News reported that their former reporter "can't produce any proof" that her allegations are true.
The problem, however, is that allegations of this nature are very difficult if not impossible to prove. Slick organizations like Media Matters know how to cover their tracks almost as well as CIA operatives, and anyone who blows the whistle on them will be discredited in spite of the truth of the allegations.
But the latest revelations concerning Media Matters only serves to corroborate what many conservative reporters have already known since 2009. For nearly six years it has been known within the beltway that George Soros meets regularly with the major mainstream news outlets and White House operatives to coordinate the spin on news stories, if you can call them "news." A better word is propaganda..Detail Information

A near-record crowd sampled ingredients healthy and exotic.
With 23,296 attendees, this year's IFT Annual Meeting and Food Expo was the second largest IFT show in its 67 years, surpassed only by the 1999 show (also held in Chicago) by a mere 1,000 registrants. There were 986 exhibiting companies, who outdid themselves providing delicious solutions for attendees.
Best-selling author Jason Jennings kicked off the meeting this year with an energetic keynote address on the four secrets of leadership. In a nutshell, the world's best-performing leaders:
- Have a cause that has nothing to do with money;
- Have mastered the art of letting go, which makes them better able to deal with change;
- Get everyone in their organization to think and act like an owner;
- Are stewards of workers, customers, capital and resources.
Health and wellness was the theme of the show, in fact some 40 technical sessions addressed that issue. Hot ingredients this year included omega-3 oils, fiber, vitamins, trans fat-free oils, salt substitutes and probiotics. Exotic fruits acai, goji and pomegranate were in abundance, along with a new player, lucuma, showcased by Van Drunen Farms (), Momence, Ill. Native to South America, lucuma has a pumpkin-like pulp and color with a maple-like flavor and is rich in beta carotene and niacin.
IFT is not all about ingredients. Tetra Pak displayed packaging solutions in its booth.
Also on the flavor front, if you never heard of buchu, baobab or bissap, those are new flavors to watch in the next few years, according to the Innova Database Taste the Trend report. Meanwhile, a scan of yogurt and dairy drinks launched between January 2005 and December 2006 found traditional flavors still dominate new product activity: fruit flavors (5,552) and dairy flavors (1,670).
Food safety was a hot topic in many technical sessions and products. To recognize the critical role suppliers play in ensuring food quality and safety, Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) sponsored a visiting grower delegation to the show. Growers from Illinois, Minnesota and North Dakota listened to a food industry overview and learned more about products developed by ADM using their food crops.
"Food safety is of greater concern today than perhaps ever before, and suppliers play a critical role in keeping our food safe," says Mark Metivier, director of sales at ADM Specialty Food Ingredients. "ADM knows our suppliers and values our relationship with them. Because of our strong, vertically integrated position, we're able to unite suppliers with food manufacturers to provide consumers with consistently safe and high-quality food ingredients."
Walking the floor
It wasn't football on display at the NFL booth. Instead, attendees were treated to a belly dancer by the innovation and new product development company National Food Laboratory. The entertainment highlighted Chef Teresa Landros' Casbah-By-the-Bay spice, containing turmeric, coriander (courtesy of McCormick) and sea salts. For bone health, the Moroccan Mobiliti-Tea was green tea with vitamin D, calcium, boron, organic agave and organic honey.
"Texture changes everything" is the apparent theme this year for National Starch Food Innovation. "We believe it's the most undervalued attribute of a food," said Anthony DeLio, vice president and general manager. Marshall Fong, National's director of marketing, cited market research that indicates the use of texture descriptors -- such as thick, creamy, smooth -- is on the rise, now being called out on 12 percent of products, up from 8 percent in 2003.
To address those concerns, National Starch announced a worldwide alliance with Avebe Group. The Dutch company's potato starches will fill a gap in the National Starch portfolio. Plus, National will begin building a Texture Center of Excellence in its Bridgewater, N.J., headquarters to devote more effort and research to the subject.
With beer on tap just before quitting time, United Soybean Board's booth was popular late in the day.
Kraft Food Ingredients unveiled several flavors at the show. Pasteurized Premium Cured Cheddar Blend is a high-performance cheese blend that yields an authentic, balanced, aged cheddar profile. It blends well with sauces, soups, side dishes and entrees. Fire Roasted Flavor imparts the taste of "old-world, wood-fired oven cooking." And an Organic Grill Flavor delivers an authentic-tasting charbroiled flavor -- in an organic form.
The cranberry already ranks high in antioxidant and antiadhesion benefits, says Ocean Spray Ingredient Technology Group. New research suggests cranberry components offer benefits in the prevention of dental and gum diseases. With demand for this sweetened, dried fruit increasing, the company now offers a lower-sugar/high-fiber cranberry and diced and double-diced pieces.
GTC Nutrition wants to assist processors in "building a bone-healthy brand." Its NutraFlora prebiotic fiber -- recently added to the National Organic Standards Board's list of organic ingredients -- is the subject of a "get hip to hone health" marketing campaign, targeting both returning school children and adults.
Edlong Dairy Flavors unveiled three new items. CremeLong is a heavy cream replacer meant to help processors offset rising dairy costs; it has less half the fat content of heavy cream. Ed-Vantage is a line of non-diacetyl dairy flavors; they give the mouthfeel, aroma and buttery flavor that are characteristic of diacetyl-containing dairy flavors but without added diacetyl, which is coming under increasing scrutiny. Natural Savory Salt Potentiator is what the name implies: a water- and oil-dispersible, Kosher-certified flavor that boosts the perception of saltiness in low- and no-sodiumWhat's the narrative technique in Animal Farm?
1 Answer | Add Yours
Orwell writes this novel in third person narration, choosing to look upon the action from a detached viewpoint. In addition, what characterises his style of narration is the way in which he writes very simply, and avoids using lots of flowery language that could be use to mask intentions and obscure what is really happening, which is of course one of the dangers of communism that he writes about in this book. Note, for example, the following quote:
Boxer's face did not reappear at the window. Too late, someone thought of racing ahead and shutting the five-barred gate; but in another moment the van was through it and rapidly disappearing down the road. Boxer was never seen again.
The economy of language in this quote, as with all of the novel, is to be admired. The leaving of Boxer, and of course his ultimate death, which is such a tragic moment in the novel, could easily have been written in a much more florid way. However, note how it is only "Too late" that the animals think of closing the gate, somehow deepening the tragedy. What Orwell loses by not being florid he gains massively in return through simplicity and impact. Orwell's narrative style is therefore very simple, but it loses none of its power through this simplicity.

There shouldn't be so many ipi's with everything locked down on one cpu but I'm guessing they are just scheduler wakeups because the scheduler code isn't optimizing for processes locked down on particular cpu's.

I found it to be a plausible, but still early-phase, "lite" PC approach for people whose work requires just a browser to access Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365, and the like, while maintaining access to their mobile apps such as email, media playback, and social networking. It could be many mobile workers' desktop PC.
But the Atrix add-on that has gotten the most buzz is the $400 Motorola Mobility Lapdock, a dumb laptop into which you plug the Atrix, acting as its brains. I've now had a couple days with the Lapdock, and I have to say it makes a lot more sense to me as a lightweight laptop or netbook replacement than Google's promised Chrome OS-based laptops. It will even prove more compelling to some users than a tablet such as the iPad or Xoom.
[ See how well the Atrix 4G fares as a "lite" PC, how the Atrix 4G stacks up against the iPhone 4, and how the Motorola Xoom tablet stacks up against the iPad in InfoWorld's tests. | Stay up on the key mobile trends with InfoWorld's Mobilize newsletter and Mobile Edge blog. ]
The Lapdock-Atrix duo in action
The Lapdock works like the Multimedia Dock in my earlier test-drive: You plug the Atrix into it, run the Webtop Connector app on the Atrix, and see two windows on the Lapdock's LCD screen, one a mirror of your Atrix's screen and the other a Firefox browser window. Two rows of on-screen buttons -- one similar to the Mac OS X Dock and one to the Mac OS X menu bar -- provide quick access to settings, peripherals, and the Lapdock's screens and apps.
The Lapdock provides access to the full Firefox 3.6 browser, so you don't get the limitations of a mobile browser when using it -- mostly. The Atrix runs a Linux instance (you can't install other apps to it), which means it runs the Linux version of Firefox. This Linux instance only runs when the Atrix is plugged into the Lapdock or the Motorola Atrix Multimedia Dock, so you can't access Firefox from the Atrix itself. Also, the Atrix' Linux environment doesn't support some Firefox plug-ins such as Oracle's Java and Oracle's Moonlight (the Linux version of Microsoft's Silverlight), so some Web and cloud services won't run in the Firefox window.
Although the Lapdock has a keyboard and trackpad, it also has two USB ports that you can use to plug in an external keyboard and mouse, or you can opt for Bluetooth devices paired with the Atrix's Bluetooth radio. The Lapdock's integrated keybpard is awkwardly placed, and the keys are scrunched (especially vertically), making for unpleasant typing. I used it to report live from the Apple iPad 2 announcement earlier this week and found myself making many more typos than usual; looser key spacing and keyboard backlighting would have helped. You should plan to hook up an external keyboard for any serious use. Note that the Lapdock's trackpad does not support gestures, so your interaction with Android apps is unfortunately limited to mouse-style clicks and movements.).

cancelled super night fun
I love this show, give it a different time slot.
Just found out that Killer Women has been cancelled. Can’t tell u how disappointed I was to hear that! I really liked watching the show. The network should of given it a chance, I mean 3 episodes isn’t enough. I was looking forward to next week’s episode & now it’s not on anymore. That just sucks!!
I am so disappointed that the show “Killer Women” has been canceled. I thought it had a great story line and would have like to seen it run for the whole series. I had told many of my friends how good it was and suggested they watch. I don’t think the time slot was right for the show, pitting it against established series. The network should have given it more time to develop a following of viewers. Thought the acting was great and the story line kept me wanting more. Bad move taking it off.
I really like the show it was much better than a lot of others that have been allowed to stay on. Show was just starting to get interesting. Good cast I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND JUNK LIKE “SUPER FUN NIGHT” STAY ON and this is cut off
We
really have enjoyed watching Killer Women. Tricia Helfer is a natural beauty portraying a Texas ranger. She and all the cast deserve to stay on for all 8 episodes. Also this was poor planning airing it against 2 other known top shows.
Love it! Love it! Love it!
Can’t wait till next week’s show.
Hope this is a keeper!!!
Just started watching the series. Watched E1 and E2 on-demand tonight, and DVR’d tonight’s show. E3 was great. I hope ABC doesn’t cancel another series, before giving it a chance to catch on like some of the other shows they have cancelled. Give it at last a season. People don’t always hear about the show before the first few airings!
I liked Killer Women. It wasn’t like the rest of the drivel tv today seems to think the public want to see. It wasn’t formulaic, it had an all new concept. A woman who held her own in a male dominated field without having to constantly remind the viewing audience, ‘see I’m a better shot and smarter than any man’. Sex, sure there was sex, you can’t get away with out it in today’s tv, but at least it wasn’t glorifying the wonderful life of the same sex couple. I’m not against same sex couples, I just don’t like to be constantly reminded of how wonderful same sex is. As for the lead actors, I’d never seen Tricia Helfer before, but felt she did a good job and as for Mark Blucas, what’s not to like about him? I swear he can kiss better than any other actor on tv today – gay or straight. Hate to see the show end. Evidently ABC wanted the show to fail putting it on on Tuesday nights agains CBS’s most watched shows. Why didn’t they put it on on Saturday nights until it could find an audience? At least let those of us who did find it and enjoyed it should get the chance to see all 8 episodes. Shame on ABC.
I will not give it the benefit of the doubt and will not watch any more new shows on ABC since they now are cancelling “The Assets” after one episode. Too much violence on TV and way too much in the real world. Who needs to watch this crap.
Meh.
About time we’re having some great TV shows on the air. The sitcom garbage has to go! Love the 8-episodee idea. Same with Assets. Great show and will be finsihed in 8-episodes.
love it.
One show doesn’t make a series so will have to see what happens.
i don’t know about this show. it’s very violent. very guncentric. it’s texas where all the crazies live. i think it promotes gun violence. but i will give it another week and see but don’t think it shows much promise. i think it’s a miss for ABC.

Valentines, Crafts and Manners/not Manners
Every Valentine's Day I make spaghetti with meatballs, breadsticks, and a dessert with the hope of teaching manners. I use my china and make the kids get all dressed up. This year I made individual heart shaped cherry pies, and they were delicious if I should say so myself! Luke my 8 year old said you aren't going to have candles are you!? I said, "no, if you don't want me to." He said, "no, go ahead." (I knew he really wanted them.) I made some cute Valentine boxes for my mom and mom in law. I had the boys give Grammy and Nana flowers. This was part of the manners lesson. Then Ryan gave Maranda flowers and I (the beginning of ruining the night) gave my boys hovering remote helicopters! I didn't mean for them to open them right then! However, dad and both grandads had to put batteries in them and test them out right that minute!!! Gabe, (my 6 year old world champion pouter) crashed his into the kitchen island and it broke a wing, propeller or something like that! He went into crazy high pitched crying and annoying bird noises! I was trying to finish setting the table and ready to bust some butts!!! However, "Grammy to the rescue" was able to get him to the table. Luke made annoying fart noises if we mentioned any country other than the USA when discussing the olympics. (This was while he finished his spaghetti in a record 2 minutes and begged for more.) Gabe had another breakdown and decided to leave the table briefly. Finally, Maranda went to get a napkin and came running back to the dinning room and fell. She had a mouth full of Grammy's yummy chocolate cake that she had to spit into her fresh napkin so that she didn't choke. Why did I even try to work on manners? Once the kids left the table to go play we had a lovely conversation and I few of us enjoyed one of my favorite bottles of B.R. Cohn wine. I am working on the end of it now:) Happy Valentines Day Everyone
Oh you crazy lady..helicopters are always gonna win out over a fancy dinner..who wants a boring ole dinner to remember...bring on the laughs.Your decorations were so cute and dinner sounded great,with homemade cherry pies..WOW!!!I'm impressed.Good job girl!
Hilarious, Shelley! But you did such a pretty job with your table and all your garlands and crafts. I love how special you make this day. Even though they acted like lunatics, you and your kids will always remember these days and they'll be special. And they'll do the same thing for their kids. Very sweet. I may copy you and do something like this next year.
I feel like I have just been through a hurricane on coffee. Good for you to do the hosting and the mosting. I hope you managed to enjoy it. XO
You are hilarious Miss Manners.........Your table setting looked lovely and all the decorations turned out superb. You are definitely heading those kids in the right direction. Keep up the good work Super Mom.
Those memorable family disasters are called "bonding." Gary Smalley says bonding experiences are the ones that you CANNOT laugh at during, immediately after, or maybe even a week after, but much later you look back and just roll on the floor over it. The pictures look like it was still pretty fabulous! I was watching a recipe with Guida on TV: she made little raviolis with wonton wrappers and Nutella! I think I need to make those next Valentine's Day!
Hi Shelley! It's nice to meet you - and am excited about really meeting you in Savannah! I can't wait! Jenn is just a doll - I know she's going to just make it as special as she possibly can!
It is my understanding that the gift exchange can be whatever you want. From something you make to something you buy - but remember you have to have enough for everyone that is participating. We are waiting on an exact number of how many gals will be there.
Hope that helps . . . it's so vague I know - but nobody really gave a good answer . . . I asked the same thing!
Looking forward to April . . .
Karen
Some days are diamonds
Thanks Shelley for the comment on the stick pins. You will love using them. I think Cindy was going to order more.
Ok- I was sitting in the dentist office (waiting on Will) and I literally laughed out loud when reading about the "manners" lesson. I swear I love hearing about other peoples wild and crazy children. Makes me feel so much better!
The table looked great and the pies "yummy". Great idea! Can't wait to see your stuff when I come to OK.Net Price Calculator

St. Albans Gas and Light
The St. Albans Gas & Light Company, later known as the Vermont Lighting Company, manufactured gas from 1870-1953 in a residential area on property it had purchased that included five buildings. In 1971, three 20-unit apartment buildings, collectively known as the Colony Square Apartments, and two single-family homes were built on the site. In 2005 and 2006, EPA cleaned soils contaminated by the former coal gasification plant located near the two residential properties.
Heavy rains in the spring of 2011 overwhelmed the sump pumps in two of the Colony Square apartment building basements. Groundwater containing coal tar entered the basements. The VT Dept of Environmental Conservation and the St Albans Fire Department initially responded to the tenants' complaints of odors in their apartments and water in the basements. In early May, 2012, EPA analyzed about 250 soil and air samples and identified soil contamination. Elevated concentrations of coal tar compounds were also detected in occupied apartments. EPA determined that water drawn by the sump pumps contained coal tar constituents that were being discharged onto the lawn outside the buildings, and were also affecting indoor air quality.
The clean-up work started July 11, 2012. The top two feet of soil were excavated, then backfilled with topsoil replaced for all the grass areas. The 22 tons of the excavated contaminated soil were sent to the landfill in Moretown, VT. In addition, a test pit was excavated to search for a tank containing contaminants that was rumored to have been buried there. Another 230 feet of soil on the eastern bank of Steven's Brook were excavated and sent to the Moretown landfill. The stream bank was covered with geo fabric and covered with stone rip rap. On Sept. 4 and 6, 2012, EPA and its contractor made minor changes to the air mitigation systems and addressed some landscaping issues. On October 25, 2012, EPA concluded its work at the site.

Until now these were just rumors, but new light has been shed on the possibility. The Korea Times has reported that both Samsung, and LG have provided Apple with high resolution displays for quality assurance testing at a Chinese Apple facility.
In all rumored cases, and according to the Times anonymous source, these displays will remain 9.7 inches, yet have an effectively quadrupled screen resolution. The source tells the Times reporter, “Apple’s upcoming iPad 3 will feature an improved display to support quad extended graphics (QXGA), a display resolution of 2048 pixels by 1536 pixels with a 4:3 aspect ratio to provide full high definition (HD) viewing experience,”
This rumor has some pretty strong backup, as a tipster lets TechUnwrapped know that both the iOS 5 Twitter, and Newsstand frameworks contain massive images matching the 2048 x 1536 resolution rumored to come along with the iPad’s new ‘Retina’ display.
Apple is expected to begin testing these displays during the 3rd quarter. For more information be sure to keep posted!Wild or triguero asparagus is highly prized and in Spain is always small and has an intense aroma and flavor.

It's easy to forget Stamkos is just 23 years old and still figuring things out in the NHL. It was March 2 when the game's top goal scorer over the previous three seasons learned a hard lesson that cost the Lightning a game.
With the score tied 2-2 on the road late in the third period against the Boston Bruins, Stamkos led a shorthanded 3-on-2 rush, carrying the puck along the right wing. He ripped a shot that missed the far side of the net, rimmed around the boards, and sent the Bruins away on a 2-on-1 chance.
Brad Marchand buried a pass from Patrice Bergeron, giving the Bruins a 3-2 win and sending the Lightning to their fourth loss in a row.
Afterward, Lightning coach Guy Boucher wasn't happy with his defense jumping into the rush in that situation, but he was just as displeased with his superstar's wide shot that served as an outlet pass for the Bruins.
“We're not thinking the right thing on that one,” Boucher said. “It hits the net, no problem. We've seen this a thousand times. … I knew that if the puck misses the net, it goes right around, and that's exactly what happened. I've seen this so many times. We can't do that. We just can't do that. That's what we get.”
Stamkos entered 2012-13 averaging 52 goals per season over the previous three. Despite reaching an elite level at such a young age, he proved his willingness to quickly adjust and improve in the five games that followed the Bruins debacle.
Through his first 21 games, Stamkos missed the net 35 times. That comes with the territory of being a sniper and high-volume shooter -- not every shot will hit the target -- but it had him among the League's worst in that category. In his past five games, he has missed the net twice while scoring five goals.
Incidentally, those two misses were harmless – one was against the Winnipeg Jets when Stamkos shanked a shot from in tight and the other occurred Tuesday when he flubbed a backhand shot with an empty net in the final seconds against the Panthers.
It's a scary thought, but Stamkos is actually getting better.
NHL players tend to hit their prime right around the age of 25, yet here's Stamkos, who has only been 23 for a month, in his fifth season improving on his 60-goal campaign. Twenty goals in 26 games put him on a pace for 63 goals in an 82-game season, and he's doing it with a career-best shooting percentage of 22.0. He's also on pace for 120 points in an 82-game season, 23 more than his career best of 97 a year ago.
Stamkos made a name for himself during his 51-goal season of 2009-10 by driving home most of them with one-timers from the left face-off circle. His scoring from that area was so frequent that it became known as the Stamkos Spot, but he's continued to evolve his game and no longer relies on his heavy, accurate one-timer to get his goals.
Five of his 20 goals this season have come from that spot, four during power plays, with the fifth with the Lightning goaltender pulled for an extra attacker. A greater percentage of his goals this season have come on the power play -- 7 of 20 after 12 of 60 last season -- but he's getting most of his goals from right around the crease or from between the hash marks.
His 20 goals this season have been more about consistency and less about scoring onslaughts. His longest stretch without a goal has been five games and he has failed to score in nine games. He has goal-scoring streaks of five, six and he's on a three-game goal-scoring run. He has yet to register a hat trick in 2012-13; he had four in his previous two seasons.
None of Stamkos' 20 goals this season have been placed into an empty net.
Despite scoring at a career-best pace this season, 50 goals is very likely out of the question and 40 will be tough to reach. He's on pace for 37 goals, but that's with a shooting percentage that's about 5 percent higher than his career average. Stamkos is averaging 3.5 shots per game this season, a slight dip from his 3.7 last season, so he'd likely have to raise his shooting percentage even higher or start hitting the net with greater frequency.
That doesn't mean Stamkos can't catch fire over his final 22 games and reach 40 or 50 goals. With elite playmaker Martin St. Louis feeding him the puck and excellent passers Teddy Purcell and Vincent Lecavalier on the ice with him at times, no number is unreachable, especially if Stamkos continues to learn and grow at an incredible rate and has a similar finish to last season, when he had 10 goals in his final nine games.

It has been awhile since I recapped a debate. Mostly because of that pesky drinking rule that came with “9-9-9″, but since it was only invoked two or three times tonight, I am still sober enough to present to my twelve loyal readers a recap of the debate @GaltsGirl style! If you are interested in what people other than myself think about the debate, (unlikely, I know) you can search the twitter timeline for the finally settled on hashtag #IowaDebate or check out @VodkaPundit’s ever entertaining live drunk blog of the whole mess here.
Without further delay, some of my favs from the night:
No Johnson. No Huntsman. #GOP2012
Sawyer says “Jobs in America” like it’s a mythical unicorn… wait…
Paul on Jobs: Know why we have a recession, and yanno…correct and don’t repeat. Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble!
Santorum on jobs: I campaigned EVERYWHERE in Iowa. There are no jobs… I double checked
Romney: See Newt’s big gov’t record. Gingrich and I disagree: like Moon Rocks! Children as slaves! Eat the rich!
Newt Rebuttal to Romney: You lost to Kennedy in ’94. So you had to get a real job. #FACT.
Paul on Newt: Single Payer, TARP support. Freddie Mac (hiiiissssssss) , and how’s that taxpayer dividend working for ya?
Newt to Paul: Heck yeah, I wanna audit the Fed. And yeah… I advised Freddie. It was a J O B. .. now let’s break em up!
Bachmann: Im 55 and a Constitutional Conservative ( nevermind me getting into your bedroom and marriage! )
Bachmann: Newt wanted Obamacare before Obama did. Romney did Obamacare! Newt / Romney are our problem **Kudos here to Bachmann for creating the fastest meme in history
( there was some #debatepillowtalk in my timeline here… also, I think I poured drink #4 about then)
Romney: I’m not Newt! But I play him on the campaign trail!
Romney to Perry: You’re kinda right, except where you aren’t. Obamacare is FAR worse than Romneycare! So there!
Santorum: I’m a leader… just dont check the polls!
Ron Paul: I take my oath(s) very seriously. Seriously enough that I sometimes end up voting by myself. Jerks
Gingrich: Yep, Ive made mistakes, and I go to God for forgiveness. So there. **This was on the fidelity question. Smart play by Newt, because … who is gonna argue with God?
Dear Ron Paul: Mitt Romney just expressed your FP in 30 seconds… please, tell me you took notes! ** To recap here.. I agree’d with Mitt!!! The stance on standing by our allies but not speaking for them was pretty gutsy by Mitt.. even if Paul has been saying it since the wheel was invented.
Romney: I didnt grow up poor, but my Daddy was. So, I am not a witch, I am you!
Romney: “States can do whatever the heck that they want to do.” *** Yes, that is an actual quote. Which rocked.. then he started talking about RomneyCare and I kinda zoned out a little.
And then, somehow, ABC decided that a debate should be a love-fest and tried to make each of the candidates say something nice about the other candidates. Ron Paul got lots of love.. and then Bachmann trotted out the 9-9-9 one final time. It was all really kinda of gross and not informative. I also may have gotten my last drink at some point here.
ABC commentators called Newt as the winner almost immediately. I’m not 100% sure I agree. Santorum did pretty well here ( it is, after all, time for his 15 minutes and I am doing my part) and Romney scored some points with me on his foreign policy statements. Ron Paul got the most applause, as usual. His people where there. Of course!
So that’s it, folks. Only 343,994 more debates to go… or something.
Once again Gov. Perry got under Mitt’s skin and rattled Romney into making a serious mistake.
If Perry can rattle Romney he can rattle Obama.Stephanie Tanner's house just got a little less full.
Former sitcom star Jodie Sweetin has filed for a legal separation from her husband of 16 months, Cody Herpin, E! News confirms. The duo tied the knot in July 2007 after just two months of dating.
The 26-year-old Sweetin filed the separation papers against her 31-year-old film transportation coordinator husband in Orange County Superior Court on Wednesday. It was the Full House star's second marriage. (View the petition.)
As it is, word of the split comes just seven months after the couple welcomed their first child together, daughter Zoie.Results 1 to 5 of 5

--------------------------------------------------------------
Key: HADOOP-3605

Project: Hadoop Core
Issue Type: Improvement
Components: contrib/ec2
Affects Versions: 0.17.0

Reporter: Al Hoang
Priority: Minor
I wanted to test out playing with the ec2 contributed shell scripts to kick off a Hadoop EC2
cluster however I found that without a set AWS_ACCOUNT_ID the script would still continue
to run but not properly set the authorization groups due to the lack of an AWS Account ID
parameter.
I have attached a quick patch to launch-hadoop-master to double check the existence of AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
and abort the script as early as possible and present a useful error message to the user.

India, Trek & Walk, 16 days - from £1,095 (land only) - from €1,535 (land only) - from $1,780 (land only)
By: Peter Holmes, Lincolnshire, UK
Good quality and variety of food. Good walking pace for group.
Great leader. Enthusiastic, efficient and knowledgeable. Very personable.
Fairly remote but still passed through local villages, got invited into houses on several occasions for a cup of tea.
By: Ann Rogers, Herefordshire, UK
Thoroughly enjoyed the holiday. Overwhelmed by the level of support from the trek team and tour leader. As a local leader Kunsang was excellent with local knowledge as well as an excellent awareness of the needs of the group. He was particularly supportive where members of the group had off days. The trek crew were very well organised and worked really well as a team - they couldn't do enough for us as guests.
Loved the mix of seeing India's culture, village life as well as the spectacular Himalayan scenery.
By: Patricia Pudsey, Cumbria, UK
As usual we are not disappointed. KE are second to none. Special thanks to Lucy for helping us choose this holiday.
A beautiful, thrilling trek. Perhaps the most leisurely we have ever done.We never felt under any pressure and there was always plenty of time to take photos and take in the amazing views.The trails were particularly beautiful but the icing on the cake was the amazing airy traverse on the last day. The weather was great too! The first time we have managed to wash clothes and get them dry! Also to have a dry trek towel was luxury in the extreme.Raj Kumar and assistant cook Sanchaman Rai must be the best cook in the world. Many and varied delicious dishes appeared each day. The birthday cakes were incredible.The tents are spacious and good quality. The Florence Inn is clean and comfortable and the food is excellent
I cannot praise Kunzang Sherpa enough. He was a delight. He is extremely well educated, his English is impeccable, he is totally unflappable.He loves his country and is very knowledgeable about all aspects, environment, politics,cultural variations etc. I have never learned so much about India as I did in this trek. Perhaps I was fortunate that being at the back most of the time we were able to ask Kunzang and Palzor questions. There was a great deal of interaction with local villagers on this trek and Kunzang and Palzor were invaluable for translation. It appears that not many white trekkers pass this way, which wa s refreshing, we were as much a source of fascination for the locals as they were for us! Kunzang is a star and we would love to trek with him again.
I enjoyed the beautiful trails and landscape, the delicious food, the enthusiastic trek crew, our charismatic leader, Kunzang, the interaction with local people en route, the cultural experiences,and particularly the Arti ceremony in Haridwar, that will stay with me all my life;magical. The long drives on the hairy roads were thrilling too.
We have always used KE and always will. Good value for money!
By: Sarah Wong, Hong Kong
The camping experience and support crew ensured that this trek was a great success. Their speed, efficiency was excellent. Mark (our leader) was very experienced, he had great rapport with the support team, and his understanding of the language and culture is a great asset.
By: Barrington White, Somerset, UK
A very enjoyable trip, espeically the Kauri Pass and the spectacular walk out on the last day. It's my 26th trek with KE since I started travelling with you in 1985.

Most enjoyed - Kuari pass and final day along balcony path - superb views.
Better than expectations, overall service better than previous treks we have done with other operators.The acquisition of liquor licences will be decentralised starting next month, with operators of beer outlets able to make applications online.
Operators have in the past complained that the issuance of the licences was centralised in Harare and they had to travel long distances to the capital to obtain the documents.
Secretary for Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Mr Killian Mpingo said yesterday that operators would from next month simply download application forms online and submit them using the same medium. He was giving oral evidence before the parliamentary portfolio committee on Local Government on the Ministry's budget performance.
"We are introducing e-Government so that people can apply for the licence using this facility," said Mr Mpingo.
"A person in Binga needs not to come to Harare to get a licence to sell three or four crates of scuds per day when he might probably be getting a profit of 50 cents. By March, we must be online."
Mr Mpingo said before the project was implemented, there was a need for publicity campaigns to inform people of the facility so that it does not turn into a white elephant.
He said many operators were doing business without the licences after failing to travel to Harare.
"Yes, people would operate without licences because the building to use would be there, the beer is there and those to partake the beer would be there except for the licence," he said.
This was after Members of Parliament raised concern that many operators were complaining that applications were taking long to be processed.
Mr Mpingo bemoaned poor funding by Treasury of the licensing board despite its potential to meaningfully contribute to the fiscus.
He said Treasury was not adequately funding his Ministry, a situation that crippled Government activities, especially on the role of provincial administrators and district administrators who ought to convene meetings.
Mr Mpingo said DAs in Mhondoro and Mbire had no offices and were being housed by Zimplats and a Tsetse spraying firm respectively, a situation he said compromised their professionalism.
Glen Norah MP Mr Gift Dzirutwe (MDC-T) said some PAs, DAs and village heads were involved in partisan politics. He gave examples of Harare PA Mr Alfred Tome whom he said was on national television advocating for people to vote for a certain political party. He also gave another example of a DA in Makoni whom he accused of doing the same.Teacher Ornament - Engraved Teachers Change The World Wooden Oval OrnamentShow your hard-working teacher how much they are appreciated with this Engraved Teacher Wooden Ornament.

Professors Rao, Somin Testify at Sotomayor Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings
Two Mason Law professors were among those appearing as witnesses at the July 16 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor.
Professor Neomi Rao and Professor Ilya Somin were among those whose names were included on a witness list released by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Both testified for the minority.
Rao's comments centered on issues of judicial philosophy. She was most recently Associate Counsel and Special Assistant to the President during the George W. Bush administration. After law school, she clerked for Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and for Justice Clarence Thomas of the United States Supreme Court. She also served as counsel to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, where she was responsible for judicial nominations and constitutional law issues. Prior to her work in the White House, Rao practiced in the London office of Clifford Chance LLP, specializing in public international law and commercial arbitration.
Somin's comments involved property rights issues, with Sotomayor's 2nd Circuit ruling in Didden v. Village of Port Chester in particular. Somin's research focuses on constitutional law, property law, and the study of popular political participation and its implications for constitutional democracy. He previously served as the John M. Olin Fellow in Law at Northwestern University Law School, and he clerked for the Hon. Judge Jerry E. Smith of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
The full witness list for the hearings contained an interesting cross-section of individuals, many with familiar names. Those appearing as witnesses included Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York; David Cone, former Major League Baseball pitcher; Louis Freeh, former director of the F.B.I.; Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel; Representative Nydia Velázquez of New York, chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; Linda Chavez, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity; Sandy Froman, president of the National Rifle Association; and Frank Ricci, director of Fire Services in New Haven and the plaintiff whose discrimination case was decided in his favor by the Supreme Court in recent weeks.

Just like you, plants need food to grow! But what is plant food, and how do plants get it?
Plants turn water and air into food.
Water from the ground is sucked up by the roots.
Carbon dioxide from the air is breathed in by the leaves.
Energy from the sun is collected by the leaves.
The energy is used to turn the water and carbon dioxide into food.
The waste from making plant food is oxygen.
Animals, humans included, need oxygen to survive. So, this process is very important for plants AND animals. This amazing process, of using the sun's energy to make food, is called photosynthesis.

Microsoft has been criticized lately for remaining mute about the release after pledging during the lengthy development of IE 7 that it would be more transparent.
"For IE 8, we want to communicate facts, not aspirations," Hachamovitch says.  wrote that an internal build of IE 8 recently passed the so-called "Acid2 Face" rendering test, considered a key milestone for those concerned with standards compliance. This will cheer Web developers, but Hachamovitch also pointed out that a key goal of IE 8, as with IE 7, is that the browser doesn't "break the existing Web." As always, Microsoft is more backwards concerned with compatibility than whizz-bang features.
That said, Hachamovitch's posting was a not-so-veiled two-pronged attack, one on critics of the company's silence, and one on Opera, the niche browser maker that recently launched an antitrust suit against Microsoft. In its complaint, Opera said that the EU should force Microsoft to make IE more standards-compliant. So it should come as no surprise that Microsoft's first public revelation about IE 8 was that it had passed a key standards compliance test.
While Microsoft has been uncharacteristically quiet about IE 8, I can tell you that I've seen recent internal mockups of the browser, which reveal a few interesting design changes. As with Office 2007, IE 8 will use a single main menu button in the upper left corner, along with a Quick Access Toolbar in the "outspace" area to the right of this button. And responding to criticisms of IE 7's non-customizable and non-standard toolbar layout, Microsoft has removed the IE 7 Command Bar and returned all toolbar buttons to the main toolbar where they belong. Microsoft had briefly toyed with an Office 2007-style "Ribbon" user interface, but dropped that idea when it tested unfavorably.
I blogged about the new IE 8 user interface back in late October. This post includes a mockup of the then-current IE 8 design.Print Page

Before using biological samples in downstream molecular assays (such as PCR or gel electrophoresis), they must be extracted to isolate and purify the nucleic acids you are interested in studying. For example, DNA extraction is the prerequisite to genotyping and sequencing experiments. RNA extraction is required before use in gene expression analyses such as real time RT-PCR.
If you are extracting a sample other than blood or bodily fluid, tissue homogenization must be performed prior to the extraction protocol. Then, extraction is performed using either an “in-house” protocol or an extraction kit. Kits are generally “idiot-proof” and easier to use compared to in-house protocols; however, they are almost always more expensive. Kits are highly recommended for RNA extraction, because RNA is more sensitive to contamination and degradation.
Once your DNA is extracted, it is relatively stable and can be stored frozen for years. RNA samples are less stable and must be carefully stored to avoid freeze-thaw cycles until they are reverse-transcribed to produce cDNA.Things are sure to get spicier at the White House as pop-starlet Shakira is set to join the ranks of thePresident’s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanics.
Jokes aside, how dismal does the state of the U.S government and its department of Education have to be, in order for it to nominate a hip-shaking pop-star to advice the president in a field so fundamentally important as Latino education?
The most recent census of 2010 highlights that 308.7 million people resided in the United States on April 1, 2010, of which 50.5 million (16%) were of Hispanic or Latino origin. At large the “Hispanic population increased by 15.2 million between 2000 and 2010, accounting for over half of the 27.3 million increase in the total population of the United States.”
Hence one would figure that a President’s Advisory Commission, seeking sound solutions for such a huge demographic group would fill its ranks with the finest and thorough individuals.
The administration rather has opted for Shakira and her philanthropical record, (Shakira founded the Barefoot Foundation in 1995, which helps fund schools in her native Colombia, as well as in South Africa and Haiti).
It seems as if the White House has decided to emulate the cosmopolitan United Nations by opting for celebrities as their poster boy, or in this case, their poster girl. This becomes evident when one considers the fact that Shakira is currently also the “Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund”.
However the fine difference in this case is that whilst Shakira gets to reel in good publicity for the U.N, she will actually be able to actively participate in the policy making this time.
Also, with her prime residence being located in the Bahamas, one is set to be skeptic as to how knowledgeable a world-touring pop artist is to the everyday hurdles, troubles and cultural barriers many Latino’s continue to experience in the U.S.
In the meanwhile Shakira, who is happy as a clam, has issued a statement, in which she said that the appointment is a “tremendous honor” for her and that she hopes that her “philanthropic experience could be helpful” for the administration.
It is rumored that several female state employees are already eagerly awaiting their new Zumba partner.
You want “advise”, the verb, not “advice”, the noun.
And education just does not seem to be a priority for Hispanics. Spare me the counter-trend inspirational anecdotes, or the usual excuses (poverty, bigotry) that did not hold back Jews and East Asians. The overall picture is damning..
Your point?
Maybe he was trying to prove that hiring Shakira is a good idea?
How *is* hiring a Colombian pop star for American education a good idea?
American Renaissance? Isn’t that like citing James Inhofe as an authority on climate change?
Oh, wait…
What a grouch.

Well, yeah, I happen to be a fan of hers too as to her performance and her other pursuits, but – she’s from a different country; her expertise is really not in this area, and people get tired of this sort of thing. I agree with the below:
“Also, with her prime residence being located in the Bahamas, one is set to be skeptic as to how knowledgeable a world-touring pop artist is to the everyday hurdles, troubles and cultural barriers many Latino’s continue to experience in the U.S.”
I’m trying to figure out if this is more “well, I need something to rile up the partisans, let’s make this non-issue an issue” or more “oh crap, my column is due in 15 minutes, what can I slap together real fast?”
Given the poor grammar, I’m leaning towards the latter.
Seriously, even if it was a slow news cycle (and given the events both domestic and foreign, in military and economics it sure isn’t) how is this worth writing about? Particularly when there is stuff like India’s new treaty with Pakistan to cover.
Wingers can’t stand popular culture. They especially can’t stand it in the White House. Well, unless it’s someone like Hank Williams, Jr. or some other plain vanilla country-western star.

It is obviously a symbolic position. The role is obviously to help get the attention of hispanic youth. Someone to be an ambassador to draw attention to the issue.
This post is such a cheap shot. Can’t the author use his brain power to think of something more constructive to write about?
So they couldn’t have gotten the attention of young Hispanics with Ellen Ochoa, who was an American Hispanic astronaut?
We also have thousands of young Hispanics attending our best universities, majoring in careers in science and engineering. They couldn’t have gotten the attention of Hispanic youth either?
This is what’s wrong with American culture. We glorify rock stars, Hollywood starlets, and sports figures. They become the role models for our youth. Not astronauts and engineers like Ms. Ochoa.
Or, how about an American pop Latino pop star?
This is rich given the adulation of Palin by Republicans and their rejection of science based policies.
sinz54,
I am sure they can use the Astronaut as well, but you do not live in reality. An astronaut is not going to grab the kinds of hispanic kids that need grabbings attention. A pop star will. How old are you?
By the way what is wrong with Shakira as a role model? She has accomplished a great deal in life. Not a bad person to look up to.
As the post above says, she has been very successful in writing and selling music. This is a woman how speaks five languages and is a singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, dancer, and philanthropist.
Good for her. Sanjay Gupta of CNN was asked to be Surgeon General and he turned it down partly because it would mean a cut in pay.
Read up, educate yourselves. Somebody who cares deeply about educating children is probably a good person to have involved in furthering the education of children.
-1 for Robin Tim Weis, I’ll think twice before clicking on another of your articles. Note to Frum: The more authors I have to say this about the less likely I’ll be to visit this site.
I think the title of the article which objectifies a highly successful woman by declaring her only ability is one part of her body pretty much sums up the arrogance and misogyny of the whole thing.
I think he wanted hits and figured that would be a good hook.
Oh, please, the title is cute. It’s referring to a song. Notta big deal.
ah, I don’t know the reference
One of her big hits is “Hips Don’t Lie”, with Wyclef Jean.
It is an interesting appointment on a number of levels in terms of what it says about the culture.
Shakira is clearly a woman of great talent and extraordinary beauty. In terms of genetic ancestry, however, this fair-skinned beauty has little in common with most of the people who live south of the Rio Grande, and this fact is evident from her picture.
Of course, it is her right to speak out for the Hispanic/Latino majorities that are descended from the Americas’ indigenous peoples if she cares to, but she is clearly not of that majority herself in terms of genetics.
Just as Marco Rubio is a Caucasian man of Cuban descent who traces his ancestry to the Iberian peninsula, Shakira is of European descent as well (Iberian Spanish, Italian and Greek), and I believe some Arab or Lebanese also. Lebanon is even further removed from the Americas than Southern Europe.
So here we have a woman of mostly European descent appointed to an org that is intended to help mostly people not of European descent.
From a cultural standpoint, it’s fascinating how some people seem not to care at all about their European ancestry and heritage. Barack Obama is a great example of this attitude; he goes out of his way to identify as Black even though his mother was White. He has a 50% Northern European genetic heritage yet calls himself Black.
It’s also interesting from a cultural perspective that they selected a pop culture icon instead of someone such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Sinz’s astronaut.
It’s pretty telling, really, when the only way to reach the youth demographic is through pop culture rather than through serious literature or science.
The fact that they pay too much attention to pop culture and not enough to science, literature and other topics that require difficult study is the problem in the first place.
A pop culture appeal reinforces the counter-productive idea that pop culture entertainment is more important than those other things.
On a different note, it’s a tragedy that there is no Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for White Americans.
There are plenty of impoverished and struggling White Americans out there who could use some inspiration and help narrowly focused on their specific challenges and obstacles as disadvantaged White Americans.
An even greater tragedy is that even if someone did form an Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for White Americans, it’s unlikely that Taylor Swift, Hank Williams, Jr. or any other music celebrity that pulls a mostly White audience would care to participate.
The influential in this society have a truly deranged hostility to specifically assisting poor White people. They never form organizations to offer poor White people the same targeted help qua White people they provide for other groups qua their group.
- DSP
Another of DSP’s race obsessed little homilies in which poor little whitey is once again done down by the forces of ethnic diversity. Sad isn’t it.
Otto checks in with no substance to add and a sneer that proves my point about unnecessary hostility.
- DSP
SP,
“Hank Williams, Jr.”
That is a good one. The man who just called our President, Obama, Hitler.
By the way here is a program that primarily targets white kids:
“Rural Education Achievement Program”
That program is not explicitly geared to White kids the way these other programs are explicitly geared toward other groups. That program is for rural residents White or not, and it ignores the needs of White kids who lives in urban areas or suburbs.
I don’t have a problem with programs that are open to everyone, but it’s unfair these kids don’t get their own narrowly focused programs and other groups do.
Williams apologized, so that is the end of it for me.
I sneer at you because you’re entirely worthy of being sneered at. Exhibit 1 your little racist homily at 1.56 pm.
“Williams apologized, so that is the end of it for me.”
Naturally, it would be for a person of your heightened sensibilities.
Otto checks in again with no substance. He labels my comment racist. Ok; what, where, how?At Gemvara, we believe that the perid peridot key jewelry with meticulous attention to detail.

Two Arab marauders were killed and seven Israeli soldiers were wounded yesterday in a fierce clash near Kibbutz Hamadiyah in the Beisan Valley. Bloodstains found in the battle area indicated that one or more guerrillas were wounded and carried back across the Jordan River by their comrades, a military spokesman reported. Israeli soldiers combing the area after the battle were fired on twice from Jordanian positions on the East Bank. A quantity of arms and ammunition was found as well as bazooka shells coupled to a timing device and aimed at Hamadiyah. The latter were timed to fire in the early morning hours. They were dismantled.
An El Fatah member was sentenced to five years by a military tribunal in Nablus today after he told the court that he became ill with arthritis while undergoing commando training at an El Fatah camp in Syria. Twenty-one year-old Moayed Kammal was found guilty of membership in the Arab terrorist organization. He said the training that caused his illness was a course in crossing rivers under fire. It was instituted, Kammal said, because of the heavy casualties suffered by El Fatah bands while trying to infiltrate Israeli territory across the Jordan River. The Syrian trainers filled canals with ice-cold water and had the recruits plunge through while their instructors fired machine guns over their heads, Kammal said.
Defense Minister Gen. Moshe Dayan and Brig. Gen. David Elazar, the northern area commander, inspected strategic settlements in the Golan Heights area today. They were accompanied by Jewish Agency settlement department officials. They showed special interest in the living conditions of the settlers and in prospects for agricultural development in the area.J by Jasper Conran Designer grey spotted night shirt

This place was surprsingly delicious. And the price was good too. It was like a mix of many cultures. Kind of European with some old time American ice cream ideas yet in Thailand.

The place serves basic breakfast as well in addition to the many ice cream desserts. We went twice during our vacation in Patong. I had the banana split for dessert. The staff is very friendly and attentive.
Walked by and stopped due to the heat, no regret. The ice cream was really nice with nice fruits and. Also had a coffee which was really good. The personnel was also nice and serviceminded. Yes, it is quite expensive compared to the rest of restaurant/cafés I have visited bt it was totally worth during this warm day.
We visited this ice cream parlour in November 2014 and then went back time and time again. We had met up with family from Australia and everyone agreed that the service and ice cream choice here was brilliant.
We tried a variety of flavours including sorbets and milkshakes and could not fault any of them.

ALCOA — Gibbs High School’s Jay Cade admittedly is not a great free-throw shooter, but during Saturday night’s Region 2-AA quarterfinal at Alcoa, he looked like one.
He also looked like a big playmaker, as the senior scored four of the team’s final five points — including two free throws — to propel Gibbs (20-7) to a 61-59 victory over the higher-seeded Tornadoes.
“It’s amazing, man,” said the senior, whose team will face Austin-East on Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at Carter in the region semifinals. “This senior class, I love them and it felt great knowing I could do my part.”
Cade’s heroics began with about one minute remaining. Alcoa (16-12) had a one-point lead and the ball, but he jumped in front of a pass, grabbed it and scored a layup to put Gibbs up 58-57.
Then, with just more than 16 seconds remaining, he was fouled after a missed Alcoa shot and made both free throws to give the Eagles a three-point lead.
“I’m usually not a good free-throw shooter,” he said with a laugh. “But I felt like I had to step up and knock them down as a senior.”
Alcoa senior Kenny Dean then made a two-point shot to cut the lead to one with six seconds left.
Gibbs’ diminutive guard Aaron Corum, who had 18 points, then made one free throw to increase the lead to two. Dean missed a two-point shot as time was about to expire, and the Gibbs’ players began to celebrate.
“I’m so proud of them,” said Gibbs coach Timmy Meade. “I’m so proud of their fight.”
For Alcoa coach Tony Jones, it was a disappointing finish on the season.
“In the end, they made one play and we didn’t, and when it’s tournament time, you go home,” he said.
While Cade was the hero with 22 points,Dean was the star. The senior finished with 31 points and looked impressive scoring in multiple ways.
“It was just an unbelievable performance by Kenny Dean,” said Jones. “He scored every which way.”
Besides catching the eyes of the fans, Dean also caught the attention of Meade, who decided to put in a 1-3-1 defense at the half to stop him. It worked, as he was limited to seven points in the final two quarters.
“Originally, I was not planning to do that at all,” Meade said. “But I felt like that kind of got them out of sync offensively.”May 302014

PAT: Because I think there’s some concern I don’t think you can tell us, can you, Basil, that — hasn’t it been suggested that maybe you shouldn’t run for President already? Has it been suggested?
BASIL MARCEAUX: Well, they want me to run for governor in California. I have a guy in West Virginia that wants to give me all his property so I can run for Virginia in West Virginia because up there all you have to do is own property to vote.
PAT: There’s a ground swell. A grass roots ground swell.
BASIL MARCEAUX: There’s a website out there that says Marceaux and Palin in 2012.
PAT: That’s what I suggested. So, I guess we’ve got to get this out of the way first. Now, if elected governor of Tennessee, I mean, will you serve for, like, a year and then start running for President of the United States?
STU: Is this just a spring board for your national aspirations?
BASIL MARCEAUX: It takes a lot of signatures to become a candidate for President. If I get enough support from everyone out there to get me signatures, I’ll give it a shot because I don’t think anyone else is going to have guts to fix the country the way I want to fix it, where we all say a pledge to the republic and we actually mean it and we fly the real Betsy Ross flag.
STU: The gold fringe one.
BASIL MARCEAUX: I think it was Roosevelt who said you cannot desecrate our quarries. If we desecrate our quarries, then I say we might as well shoot the eagle.
STU: Yeah. That’s a really good point.
PAT: It’s a lot like Davy Crockett said when he said the declare naked quote.
GLENN: Basil?
BASIL MARCEAUX: Yes.
GLENN: You wear a badge around your neck. Were you a police officer or a sheriff — what is that badge that you wear around your neck?
BASIL MARCEAUX: Okay. In fact, I’m the only one in the United States who wears it. Several years ago, as a matter of fact, I started my year, the same year you started your radio show, 2001, when a law enforcement officer put a gun to my face at a stop sign and pulled my friends out of the car and kicked the crap out of him. He was a Navy Seal like Rambo. I’m sure Rambo wouldn’t have liked that much. So, I told the officer then that I was going to look for a law that allowed a marine to arrest anyone who breaks the Constitution. After three years and six months, I found Federal Law 241, the emancipation proclamation proclamation, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and the (inaudible.)
PAT: And this is why you’re going to ban all traffic stops, right?
BASIL MARCEAUX: No. Actually the traffic stops itself is the second part, where you get out of the car, what are you doing in this part of town, who have you got there, what’s underneath your seat, Hey, what’s that dead body in the trunk.
PAT: I hate it — they ask me that.
STU: Yeah.
GLENN: Basil, shouldn’t we Basil, Basil
BASIL MARCEAUX: Why don’t they just take a minute and go over to the judge and get a warrant and assume they have enough evidence first?
STU: Exactly.
GLENN: I agree with that, but
BASIL MARCEAUX: kick me in the head.
GLENN: I agree with that, but if he can see the dead body in your trunk, he doesn’t need the search warrant, does he?
STU: He won’t see if there’s no traffic stop
BASIL MARCEAUX: It’s the way you interpret our Constitution. The Constitution says if you you have to have look through my window or through my keyhole in my trunk bed, you have to have a warrant to go through my papers
STU: Thank you. See, Glenn?
GLENN: If somebody says what about that dead body in your trunk, isn’t that something maybe if a cop knows there’s a dead body, I don’t want him opening up your trunk untorn, because if you have a dead body in there, it might be a good thing, but I don’t want a cop to be opening up your trunk without a warrant, et cetera, and they can’t do that. You’re right on that, but, I mean, if he says to you while you’re sitting in the car, what’s up with the dead body in your trunk and there is a dead body in the trunk
BASIL MARCEAUX: Well, I just have to say to him I would have to say to him, you can’t look through my keyhole or my window
STU: Yep. I agree with you on that.
GLENN: Bingo.
PAT: It’s like Melissa Ethridge says, come through my window.
Glenn: Where does the badge come in?
BASIL MARCEAUX: Back to the badge. I found the emancipation proclamation I’m kind of tired right now emancipation proclamation that says the United States government and the military and the Navy to maintain and recognize such person to keep people free from slavery and no act should stop them. And we all know if I’m 4th Recon marine, the best soldier in the world, everybody knows I maintain for life and my oath is for life to protect and defend, but I have no power. I should be able to arrest people who break the Constitution. This was my oath. So, I went looking for the law to see if a marine can arrest Constitutional violators and I came upon (inaudible) 39th Congress (Inaudible) Page 38, 41, and 42. That’s the same law that gave African Americans four eighths of a mule.
GLENN: So, you made the badge. What does the badge say?
BASIL MARCEAUX: It says okay. On the third prong it says if you’re an Army or Navy civilian, you are a great man. You’re immune from all crimes, including murder. You’re above civil law. You’re protected by the military. You can go into any court in the land and say, Hey, Judge, you’re under arrest for breaking the Constitution and when I rule, there is no appeal for you and you should be scared of me because if you if you don’t get off the Bench when I tell you, I have to treat you like a bank robber. That’s why we printed it in our
PAT: That seems to be a lot of power, Basil
STU: Yeah, it is.
BASIL MARCEAUX: But (inaudible) it says that there is when this draw is apprehended by the citizens of the future, the outcry will be just as powerful as it was when the now dominant party invaded our country and ordered republic restored in the future by a great man going to the ballot box
STU: This goes along with Basil’s policies.
PAT: Very small writing.
STU: And he will bring larger badges to Tennessee, if you just elect Basil Marceaux.
Glenn: Good luck today.
BASIL MARCEAUX: Thank you.

The live cd is 'ok', but because most of the 69 tracks i already have it's only the 70's ones that are new...and a few of those are pretty stuffed up versions too. So bit an odds & ends cut and paste performance sounding cd actually.The demo disc is EXACTLY as Kristians brilliant review says...why i might even listen to it more than once-great insight into how Elvis changed HIS versions of the songs!!! I would say the sheer quality of the thick book makes it a fantastic read and for sure i'm buying this package- really tremendously put together!

I can't really answer why the dictionary or other resources say this. By definition - (from the American Psychological Association), homosexuality is your sexual orientation. If you had rather be with a man, and you have relations with other men, then it would be considered as such. Again, it is all in what you prefer. But just sitting around randomly thinking about what it would be like to have sex with another man doesn't automatically make you gay. I thought you meant you just had a passing thought or two about homosexuality. Now, if you are constantly thinking about having sexual relations with men and that is what you want, then that is a different situation. I thought you meant you have just had passing thoughts about fantasies with other men. You may have no desire for the opposite sex and strongly desire men - in this case, you could consider yourself homosexual...some people do this for years before they 'come out' and let it be known. Are the thoughts serious thoughts -as in, a way of life, or just a curious type of thing?
I only think about men sexually and not women. If I am gay what would be the healthy thing to do about itD.

Big business will do whatever it takes to make more money at the expense of the consumer and environment. Unfortunately, some of our state “representatives” are more than willing to help out.
Haven’t there been enough deaths, pain, suffering, destruction and expense associated with the consumption of alcohol without making it more available at every convenience and grocery store?
Cigarette smoke at the Kansas Star Casino is nauseating, and getting worse. The place reeks. Haven’t they heard of air filters?
Do you know why unions went to payroll deductions? It’s because they knew that if their members had to physically pay the dues, they would realize they weren’t getting value. However, the union leaders in their big houses are.
So they call it daylight saving time, but in the process we all lose an hour of sleep. The government had to have a hand in that.
It’s ironic that the far right mocks support for public broadcasting and Big Bird. The ostrich is the perfect symbol for its positions, with its tiny brain in a head buried to any evidence of science, experience and common sense.
It is clear that the government is doing all it can to punish the American public for its very minimal budget cuts. When this type of baloney is identified, the responsible government employee should be terminated. That is the president.
“TSA asked to rethink allowing small knives.” Yep – land of the free, home of the brave.
Sports teaches us there are winner and losers, which in turn describes our everyday life. I’m sorry to all you Jayhawk fans for sharing a crown that is rightfully yours.
I would rather KU add another power conference game to its schedule than WSU. Doesn’t it already play teams like Fort Hays and Pittsburg State? Isn’t that enough charity?
WSU has the greatest basketball teams. Wichita should be proud of both the men and women, and give them a lot of support.
I read that Wichita has good museums. I wouldn’t know. I can’t afford the admission.
Those all tattooed up like the funny papers have identity problems. “Look at me! Look at me!” I would never hire, date, do business with or befriend someone like that.

Jockamo’s Mick McGrath Goes After a Bigger Slice
The pizza vet adds on to his Irvington flagship location.
Photo by Tony Valainis
One of the four founding owners of Jockamo Upper Crust Pizza in Irvington, Mick McGrath knows that a wait list and a packed room are signs that business is good. He also knows that when the wait becomes a nightly occurrence that sends customers off in search of quicker eats, it’s time to make some adjustments. “We had gotten to the point where we were bursting at the seams,” says the industry veteran, who opened the neighborhood pizza joint—with his wife, Nancy Duncan, and their former Irvington neighbors, Bob and Laura Stark—in 2007. (An Old Town Greenwood location followed in 2010.) So he expanded the bustling pizzeria into the available slot next door, a former consignment store, adding a little more than a thousand square feet, about 60 seats, a bigger bar with twice the taps, and a party room.
Along with the renovation came a couple of menu additions, like the Jockamo Special, a pizza that gets a drizzle of balsamic reduction after it comes out of the oven, and goat cheese–stuffed peppadew peppers in chili oil. The only thing McGrath did not want to change was his flagship restaurant’s location. “The neighborhood has been very supportive. They treat it like it’s their own place,” McGrath says. “I wish I could find another Irvington to open one more store.”
Mick McGrath’s Favorate Things
1) Anchovies on pizza: “The saltiness goes well with a good local beer.”
2) Blend cigar bar: “It’s my favorite bar in the city.” (Cigar of choice: The Montecristo Toro.)
3) Chef Layton Roberts at Mesh on Mass (formerly at Meridian): “He’s my nephew.”
4) The Legend: “When my wife and I go out to dinner, we almost always sit at the bar.”

Clinton Karcher & Benny Ed
Eleutherophobia isn't a word (technically it means fear of freedom) used often in our vernacular, it sounds made up, but I don't think that matters when the band who adopted it for an album title—recently opened for Lenny Kravitz and Sting. Doesn't seem that important now, when you consider that.
The band in question is Ready Never and Eleutherophobia is the name of their very first full-length CD. The duo consists of Benny Ed and drummer Clinton Karcher, neither of which are by any means harmful on the eyes. With their co-conspirator composer Rudi Meibergen, sharing writing and producing credits. Together they are spearheading a new sound, they like to call EDM Rock.
What does EDM Rock consist of? Performances that meld catchy indie electro-pop songs with DJ, house and dub-step interludes; all combined together with rock n' roll—live. But how? By utilizing drums and bass guitar, EDM sounds, with DJ equipment to trigger sequences within the show. And this is how good it sounds. Initially, Ready Never was a virtual music project, but the viral response online encouraged them to start a live band. Prior to that Ed had been touring extensively with Grammy award winning singer Beto Cuevas, as his bass player and musical director. He used his film background to make several light hearted music videos for Ready Never, including Take that Pill (see video here). Which he describes as "a satirical take on our modern A.D.D obsessed, pill-popping society; and it's love for pharmaceuticals, technology as a religion and multi-tasking."
Ah, good times.
Is it me or does that pill look like Hitler?
Is it me or does that pill look like Hitler?
Ready Never’s live shows take on two forms Ready Never Live—featuring Ed on vocals/bass guitar and Karcher on drums—and Ready Never Remix, DJ-based sets featuring Ed and Sean Mahaffey.
Quite the tongue there young man For a new band that crowd is packed!
Quite the tongue there young man
For a new band that crowd is packed!
"We wanted to write songs and make electronic dance music," says Ed. "But we wanted to be able to perform the music, not just play it back; which is what makes our live sound quite different from our studio sound."Music that you can dance to, play and sing. Now there's an idea!

Gates Foundations Seeks Innovative Health-Solutions Proposals
One of the primary objectives of Grand Challenges Explorations is to involve scientists around the world who do not typically work in global health.
[International: Health]
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced yesterday that it is now accepting grant proposals for Round 2 of Grand Challenges Explorations, a five-year US$100 million initiative to encourage bold and unconventional research on new global health solutions.
Proposals for six topics will be accepted online at through November 2, 2008.
Round 2 follows on the heels of the initiative's first funding round, which closed in May of this year, and generated nearly 4,000 applications from scientists in more than 100 countries. Two new topics are being introduced in Round 2 along with the initial four topics from Round 1.
One of the primary objectives of Grand Challenges Explorations is to involve scientists around the world who do not typically work in global health. This includes those with innovative ideas in Africa, Asia, and other parts of the developing world; people working in the private sector; and young investigators.
The initiative uses an agile, accelerated grantmaking process. Applications are two pages, and preliminary data about the proposed research are not required. In addition, the online application process has been streamlined for Round 2.
The topic areas for which proposals will be accepted in Round 2 are: create new vaccines for diarrhea, HIV, malaria, pneumonia, and TB; create new tools to accelerate the eradication of malaria; create new ways to protect against infectious diseases, including alternatives to traditional vaccination; create new drugs and delivery systems to limit the emergence of resistance in the disease-causing agent; create new ways to prevent or cure HIV infection that fall outside current research on vaccines and other biomedical and behavior-change strategies; and, explore the basis for latency in TB, with the goal of discovering new ways to identify and eliminate latent infection.. Round 1 grants are expected to be announced in October.
Full de scri ptions of the topic areas and application instructions are available at.."Marlene - from Logansport, IN
It sounds like the consistency of your icing is too thin. As you know from making buttercream roses, your icing should be a stiff consistency. Because these icings have different ingredients, the feel in your hand may be different. The royal icing may feel as stiff as the buttercream, but it will need to be stiffer if your decoration goes flat.

Interesting future note: if LSU and Kentucky win this week, they may have to go to Kentucky next week. There is no other comparable game. It could be an LSU victory tour if they don't lose.
Oops, I meant West Lafayette, not Columbus in the previous post.
And you KNOW they'll be in Tuscaloosa on November 3rd for Saban Bowl.
PS. Gary Danielson looks like he'll be MIGHTY busy during the 8:00 hour.
If Notre Dame can't do it this week, 0-8 is in the bag.
NBC may have to schedule a live primetime matchup between Notre Dame and the cast of "Friday Night Lights" to get them a win.
bf,
I believe the correct term is $aban Bowl.
Ron Franklin, home sweet home in the Big 12
Kirk Herbstreit, Gary Danielson same thing right?
THe Dillon Panthers would kick the shit out of Notre Dame.
Man Gary Danielson two games at once. Sweet gig!
Pam Ward -- GREAT!!! I hate being 1-4.
Duel Danielsons?
wow...my apologies for the mistakes.
Herbstreit's always with Musburger, I guess I was just longing for Musburger/Danielson since Gary was actually...good then.
unfortunately for all the big ten fans, brad nessler/bob griese/paul maguire won't cover you guys this week
Pam Ward just gave a Sportscenter 30 at 30 update. I wonder what else she's up to while hanging around Bristol today.
i assume ALL of these posts are from women.
i can't believe one man has not said we need MORE pics of those Florida female fans. and some close-ups. i pray EVERY Florida home game is played in 90 degree temps so they show more skin!!!
Anon at 12:59 must be a Big11Ten guy. Because we SEC partisans know that virtually every SEC venue has its own section of hot chicks. So it doesn't come as a surprise to us, nor is it exactly unique to us.
Great. The last thing the Tar Heels need is a visit from Pam Ward.
Holy SHIT
Erin Andrews is going to be in the State of Illinois tomorrow. No wonder I can't stand up.

[2]Cellcom Premium Widens on Cheaper Plans: Israel Overnight
Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL) surged the most on record, narrowing the gap with U.S. shares on speculation that an investor is preparing to buy a stake and after announcing a plan that may boost fixed-line revenue.
The shares advanced 8.4 percent to 26.55 shekels, or the equivalent of $6.73, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. Cellcom, Israel’s largest wireless provider, closed at $6.94 in New York trading on July 6.
“There are rumors in the market about potential buyers for a holding in Cellcom,” Liat Glazer, an analyst at Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd., said today by phone.
Cellcom, the worst performer in the TA-25 benchmark index this year, is selling all-inclusive voice, data and messaging packages for families, after mounting competition in the telecommunications industry slashed revenue. Israeli providers from Hot Telecommunication System Ltd. (HOT) to Golan Telecom Ltd. are offering customers unlimited packages at reduced costs.
Gilad Alper, a senior analyst at Excellence Nessuah, said that while he couldn’t comment on who may be interested in a Cellcom stake, “a new controlling shareholder can fix the business model to make the company leaner, increasing the net income significantly.”
Discount Investment Co. (DISI) currently owns a controlling 47 percent stake in Cellcom. The holding company is owned by IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH) and is part of Israeli businessman Nochi Dankner’s corporate investments. Dankner said in a Channel 2 interview in May that he would be willing to sell some companies under his control to pay back debts to investors.
‘Weak’ Liquidity
On May 14, Standard & Poor’s Maalot downgraded IDB’s credit rating three levels to ilBBB-, the lowest investment grade, from ilA-, citing “weak” liquidity.
Cellcom’s package for families will include unlimited local and international fixed-line services and Internet, the company said on July 5.
“Investors like the new package because they expect this may increase Cellcom’s growth in the fixed-line sector, where it is weak, and may help curb its loss of share in the wireless market,” Gil Dattner, an equity analyst at Bank Leumi Le-Israel (LUMI) Ltd., said by phone.
Rami Levi Chain Stores Hashikma Marketing 2006 Ltd. (RMLI), a supermarket operator that started mobile-phone services in December, said last week it will offer unlimited wireless packages at lower prices. Partner Communications Co. (PTNR), Israel’s second-largest wireless provider, said on June 20 it plans to set up a new low-cost wireless brand.
Cheap Offerings
The operators join competitors Hot and Golan, which started offering unlimited plans for less than 100 shekels a month, or about $25, in May.
Cellcom will probably post sales of 1.6 billion shekels in the third quarter, the first three-month period in which revenue from the family package will be reflected, according to the mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That compares with sales of 1.7 billion shekels in the year-earlier period.
Partner shares added 2.3 percent, their biggest increase since July 1, to 15.29 shekels. Hot added 2.9 percent to 31.06 shekels. Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp. (BEZQ) fell 0.2 percent to 4.10 shekels.
Partner has declined 55 percent and Cellcom has fallen 58 percent since the beginning of the year. That compares with a 2.3 percent decline in the Bloomberg Industries Index of 16 wireless providers in the Middle East and Africa.Bill Gates Still Believes Speech Will Replace Keyboards
from the the-product-of-the-future... dept
Bill Gates has been an incredibly successful businessman, but that doesn't mean he's particularly good at predicting the future of technology. Remember his claim that spam would be gone within 2 years... which he made in 2004? However, if there's one prognostication that Gates just can't let go of, it's his belief that speech recognition will replace keyboards as the preferred input device for computers. He's been saying it for years and years and years, without much to show for it. I had thought (hoped?) that he'd realized maybe he was wrong on this one, but apparently not. In a recent speech, he's insisting that speech recognition (and touch screens) will start to surpass keyboards as the input method of choice for many people. I was going to go back and put together a list of the times he had predicted that in the past, but it appears that Matthew Paul Thomas already did that a few years ago. Note that his earliest predictions (starting in 1997) were that speech would surpass keyboards within a decade. This quote is from October 1997:
"In this 10-year time frame, I believe that we'll not only be using the keyboard and the mouse to interact, but during that time we will have perfected speech recognition and speech output well enough that those will become a standard part of the interface."If you go to Matthew's site, you'll find a lot more like that, continuing on through the years, with some different prediction time frames. This isn't to say that speech recognition hasn't gotten a lot better, and isn't used in many more ways today than it was in the past -- but it's not come anywhere close to replacing a keyboard for a variety of good reasons that have much less to do with technology than with how people work. Imagine just how noisy your typical office would be if you had to speak to your computer rather than type? Typing isn't used just because it's efficient, but because it lets people work without disturbing others, and without letting everyone else know every little thing that you're doing. Yes, speech recognition technology is getting much better and it's useful in some situations, but it's certainly not the perfect interface for an awful lot of what people do on a computer.

Keyboards and Abacuses
The idea that touchscreens and speech interfaces can't replace keyboards in large offices is just as short-sighted as believeing that the slide rule would have to stay around because it could do logarithms and you wouldn't have to worry about the battery in critical applications.
Maybe we can't see it right now, but we'll find a way to impelement it because speech-based word processing already is a more efficient use of time. You can do more faster, and you can free up your hands for other tasks than simple data entry, such as for information retrieval. That's the bottom line. The only problems we need to overcome are interface control --
and the aforementioned noise factor. But I really don't think it's an insurmountable problem. Besides, the diminishing importance of large workstation farms means that they will not be such an important organizational structure that they will forestall the introduction of the touch/voice interface.
It's coming, ready or not.

Did you read the quote before you wrote this? o.O
Also, in your article, you keep saying that Gates said "voice will replace keyboards" - but if you read that quote, Gates is saying that keyboards and voice would be used in tandem, not that voice would replace anything.
Many, many people use dictation software on a daily basis. I can say "Call Jane" to have my cell phone auto-dial a number. I use voice exclusively when talking to friends online (when once upon a time we used keyboards to send instant messages). If you call just about any company out there, you'll get a message "Please say the name of the department you'd like to speak with". Most public terminal computer systems are touch-screen based... The list goes on and on.
Again, I didn't click through, and so there may have been some larger claims made which didn't hold water, but what you had to say about the quote you quoted was completely off base.
[ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ]
short and long term answer: nope, never
Handicap requirements for accessability and standards, people who are incapable of speaking, people who do not wish to speak, language barriers that are easier to convey messages by typing than speaking. None of those categories are ever going to go away and they are certainly large groups.
With that said, don't expect to ever see speech replacing a keyboard in any lifetime. Not mine, and not the next. I mean really if someone can market (and sell out) 1500$ keyboards that are so well engineered that they represent the next generation of keyboards do you really think that keyboards are going to go away? That is a permanent flourishing market, even if speech recognition (or even brain recognition) goes 100%.
Another failed Microsoft announcement full of lies, just like the "we're interoperating" claim (for what, the 12th time now?)

Gates had a talent for being in the right place at the right time, but when has he EVER done anything to advance UI?
If anybody is right it is going to be Apple. There was some recent speculation that they are going to merge multi-touch, pointing, and typing into a single device.
I for one will NEVER talk to my computer. And I don't want my computer to talk to me. I'm not wild about the idea of people listening to my interactions. Multi-touch is far more interesting to me.
[ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ]
I have no doubt personally, my written communication skills are much better than my oral communications, maybe it's the extra time you have when typing to polish off the concept you are trying to convey and the way you want to deliver it that are more of a benefit to me, can't say. I recall when I was younger when computers were just starting to become 'personal' that one of the things I found most interesting was typing.
Although, voice recognition will have it's place, I don't really find it as desirable of an option as typing, generally.
Heck - even now where I work, the IT staff can always call each other, of course - but most choose to use Instant Messages. Perhaps for counter-intuitive reasons many people actually prefer to type. Or maybe it's really just the convenience offered with a text based communication that, in many ways - at times actually beats oral communications. Just because something is quicker, doesn't necessarily mean it's better or more efficient. If so - why is email even amongst relatives and friends a very popular communication method, when they could just call on the phone?

Speech Recognition
[ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ]
A quick writeup..
So it wasn't long ago (Maybe fifteen months?) when Microsoft closed on the Voice Recognition software company, TellMe.
You have to hand it to them- the final product doesn't look too shabby. Especially considering they've already executed on a go-to-market strategy with software (ResponsePoint), hardware vendors and also engaged a VAR channel.
Having acquired a mature and robust speech engine may help drive more product dev work in this area and replace/complement the keyboards.
I remain more interested in touchscreen application and OneNote.
So someone said something about the Surface Computer, and it seems like a niche product, hopefully it can really improve productivity. So from a product/branding perspective, it probably would have been better for Surface to debut with AT&T or Verizon in addition to TMobile. Why? Well, these carriers seem to have a customer base thats business focused, whereas TMo appears to focus on the value-conscientious customer, so Surface would probably have better day-to-day visibility to businesses who could afford a kiosk or want to implement a kiosk strategy. It's the weekend and I'm too lazy to go research the numbers, but a few searches through some 10K filings of VZ or T may give insight to customer segments.
Anyways, enough rambling. Check out ResponsePoint-

Bill's Predictions of the future
To be fair I admit I use speech recognition (SR) for dictating memos and articles and it works quite well. But I could never use SR for the complex tasks I do like, as someone else here has given as an example, software development.
I design computer embedded medical equipment. I would never allow an SR system interface in life supporting machines.
SR will only work when AI has developed to the point where the computer has rudimentary intelligence, a sort of idiot savant expertize on the subject being controlled by the software. This way an interpretation can be made based on the context. The computer will not interpret "center the asterisk" as "render the asparagus" in a publishing application.
[ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ]
Have you actually tried speech recognition?
I recently bought a popular voice recognition product and, after having stuck with it through the training phase, use it daily for everything from e-mail to writing blog entries. For me, dictating text using this software is now faster and more accurate than typing.
Like millions of people, I work in an office with a door and don't disturb anyone when dictating.
Frankly, I can't believe we're still typing as much as we are when audio text alternatives exist that cost less than $200. I also can't believe voice recognition isn't built into hand-held devices such as PDAs.
[ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ]
Bill is right
It's really not that far off. I remember 5 years ago how bad dictation software was and how its fail rate was. There definately is a vast improvement in the dictation software.
I'm not going to say a timeframe, but I do believe that it's only a matter of time before speech will be the preferred interface control for personal computers in a private office or at home.
There will always be manual inputs, and situtions where speech input is not recommended. Doesn't mean that speech won't become a valuable part of computers in the future.
Bottom line is, Bill may be wrong on timelines, but his goals of integrating speech, and getting rid of spam, are good ones and practical ones. They just take a lot of time to figure out.

1. I'm already crammed into a grid of cubes. Loud phone calls echo throughout the room. A room full of people talking to their computers, non-stop? Shut Up!

I also read The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil, and it was the same thing. Futurism is always just a lot of boring masturbation, no matter who's writing it.

Get your shit straight
Like he stated in his recent speech, he believes the future is NUA (Natural User Interface).
His vision (although I find this a little crazy myself) is that every surface in your office, and possibly home, will be a computer screen.
So if you have to make a note, you take out your special stylus and write it on your coffee table.
After you write the note on the table you can go to your cell phone/PDA and read that note, lets say you write "Pick up Joe from airport March 13th @ 3pm" on the table. Your phones calender now has a new reminder in it, even if its buried in your work bag.
Thats pretty handy for taking a phone message even with no paper or pen around huh?
Another vision of his is: You're writing on your white board and one of your clients sends you a video message. Well just click the new message icon flashing at the top of your white board and watch it right there, no time lost.
So to sum things up, he believes in Natural User Interface to be the future, which includes speech.

Re: Get your shit straight
NUI is cool tech, but if it doesn't add productivity, it's going to be a hard sell. So work backwards, the last think you want to do is shock your customers to another platform because it's unfarmilliar. As a starting point, ask how do you economically get a tablet and OneNote into these peoples hands? Don Tapscott says "Personal Use is the Precondition to Any Understanding." If people see OneNote being used in the office, it will spawn the upgrades. Then once they are comfortable with a touchscreen and you've reached critical mass, consider moving in for bigger fish like NUI.
But it's a drastic change for an "old-timer".
I'm really just throwing this out there- but whats the % of Fortune 100 companies who upgraded to Office 2007? Maybe there's an opportunity.
Here's a thought- If it won't break Office 2003, make available, to the Public, Word08 upgrade for six months or say, 500k copies at a jaw-dropping price with no phone support. (Whatever it is, it must be below the psycological $49.99) Also silently include OneNote.
Once comfortable, whatever they write will look great with the stylesets, and their work product would become a trojan horse for a O2008 site license.
Next, (and here's where the viral thing comes into play) The techies will wonder what this OneNote thing is. To drive tablet adoption, include a $50 instant rebate (Key Point- You got to work out the logistics to make it an instant rebate, and the Rebate Value has to be above the $49.99 psycological pricepoint.) for any touchscreen laptop. I imagine many techies will find themselves eyeballing a new Vista laptop for personal use that has a touchscreen within a few weeks. Then they essentially become your salesperson for a widescale hardware upgrade with their tablet at work.
Anyways, just some thoughts. That's how I'd do it anyway.
Then onto developing the pervasive data strategy, etc etc etc.
Everybody wins.

Minority Report
Visual processing and certain Actions are much faster then speach.
Speach takes up more brain activity then just about any other type of brain function, and is therefore slower.
Language can also be interpreted in multiple ways
The future will be in presenting us with MORE densely layered VISUAL information and allowing us to PHYSICALLY manipulate it.
I know this has all been said before....
Think of Tom Cruise in the movie, "The Minority Report"
Projectors, Layering images, 3D imaging, Holography, etc. coupled with Gesture technology is the true future

Mr. Gates opens a door rather than letting you look in the window by making this announcement- and the point is missed- too easy to understand>??????
Keyboard AND mouse are not any longer necessary (and the speech activation I just leapfrogged until the tech catches up). A tool that has a form factor of a bic ballpoint pen is better- and more natural.
Those with big bucks have inventory to dump and cheesy intermediate versions to hock on you already in the pipeline.
Earlier example of current tech being modified rather than the great tech leap occuring to leach out value and profit away from the purchaser:
"Since CCD, a 4 gig hard disk drive, and DV (digital video in any form, we all could have been using video cameras that do not tax our time (and wear out a hundred times faster) by using tape" I look back and 4 of the last 6 video cameras (one at a time) could have just been a hard disc, CCD, and the DV format"
I liken this article's creator (WITH RESPECT) to the boy who cried "Sheep"- when Mr Gates cried "Wolf" at seeing the wolf take away a baby- (our cash).

Yes, Man is going to be doing a lot of waving of hands in air for next X years- but voice will be back in under ten by far. (Hands will get tired, and laziness being the mother of invention it will happen pronto) (it is already here in most ways) (dragon speak naturally speaking program)
Interestingly, Mr Gates is the wolf also. Might want to pay attention to him.
Again, the Wii-mote and Johnny Lee (CMU) system works great-
It uses, (I use) what looks like a bic ball point pen for "mouse", and I now run my computer by looking DOWN at my desk-with the XP desktop superimposed upon it.
Nothing like a quantum leap forward by leaping backwards reciprocally.
A great idea is like fire- it takes off- some reader out there may realize the immensity of this- and get the word out.
"A return to Pen and Paper" (virtual paper)
Yes, you need a modest low intensity projector- about 400 dollars- but on your existing computer screen it is free.
Typing? Just run the handicapped feature in XP accessibility features and voila! no keyboard on my desktop except a virtual "touch-sensitive" one
In other words the keyboard no longer exists, except as light on the desktop.
Geez 42 dollars is a lot of money to replace a 60 dollar Natural Keyboard and a 50 dollar trackball. NOT
Stop blaming and criticising others when you could fix the problem(s) yourself!
I believe in all of you- get with it.
Best to all.

As "milady" suggests, I should stop telling you about, and tell you what it is NOT:
No physical Keyboard, Mouse, or Monitor.
Just a Bic Ballpoint pen is all the user sees.

predictions
if you try to predict the future you can't be so one-dimensional.
I believe that yes, speech or thought or something else more natural to human interactions will replace or supplement the keyboard. And it already happens, as others here point out.
The simplistic arguments against it remind me of stories they told about when the car or the computer or [name what] was first introduced. Technology changes society and vice versa.

Will SR replace keyboards? I'm sure that at some point it will. In ten years? I don't think so. It's still very buggy. Keyboards have a lot of benefits; I can type without advertising to anyone within earshot what I'm doing, I can multitask (watching TV and typing right now) without disturbing others, keyboards are MUCH more accurate (if you're an accurate typist), and some of us can type faster than we can dictate. I see SR in the next ten years as more of a quality add-on to a keyboard than a realistic replacement.

Parsing it is the trick
We want computers to understand speech, but the grail is understanding natural speech, not carefully worded commands. We are getting pretty good at recognition. Understanding natural speech is a different problem and is the real trick. That's the thing to get working on now.

Re: Hardwareless GUI- 42 dollars and bic pen- no c
Imagine a empty room with a wood desk and chair, and this bic pen- that is all that is INSIDE the room to run XP.
So something like the Nokia Digital Pen SU-27W?
I think that first had it's debut in 2004. Again it experienced Also, many reviews on it didn't come until several years later.
Nokia has long had a facinating legacy of creating a good robust UI, employing features that seem to be well ahead of others. I've had GPS directions (by way of TomTom) on my nokia phones since my Nokia 6600 which came out it 2003.
So it's not surprising when I saw the SU-27W that something was up. I acquired a SU-27U for $50 almost a year ago.
It's an interesting device, but has limitations- for one, it requires specially indexed paper.
But the ability to acquire it for such a low price tells me two things:
1) High R&D costs built into the device caused a non-commitity device. Which led to
2) Adoption challenges partially due to it's high price.
3) The surplus was sold at intrensic value, not at cost.
Again, when discussing new Human Interaction Devices, it takes time and commoditization for it to reach critical mass, and needs a phase-in strategy. Somewhat related: consider acoption rates of with moving to SOA/BPM platforms.

One fact I can reliably state is this:
I will freakin' kill myself if everyone in my office started talking to their computer. I can't get them to shut up without talking to their computer (and some of them do so anyway). Pretty please, Mr. Gates, help me keep my sanity by not giving every idiot in the world an audible voice.

Not that far fetched.
I've used a few speech recognition programs. Although not very smart the recognition bit was actually quite good. On a system a friend had set up! So perhaps it all comes down to how clearly one speaks.
I don't think we'll have voice take over everything. But standard routine commands I have no doubt speech will take over.

Everything must go
If we consider the evolution of man, the evoluion of man's machines, and the evolution of man's relationship with the machines, I think their rate of evolution would increase in the same order. And if that carries on forever then of course keyboards will disappear, then screens will disappear, then speech input will disappear. Eventually, the machines themselves will disappear from our perception, and our thoughts, desires, wishes and wildest dreams will control our surroundings.
On the paths of these lines of evolution, there will be thousands of intermediate stages, and we're on one where there happens to be less clubs and more keyboards. Sure, there'll be people who hang on to past technologies for resons other than technological advancement, 4-track musicians, vynl record collectors, screen printers, baseball players, but chores will disappear. Chores now handled by the machines - washing dishes, feeding the fire, finding food mental calculations - they're almost all gone.
It's inevitable keyboards will disappear, I'd be very surprised if a suitable substitute isn't found within the next few decades.
And I wish they'd hurry up, this took me bloody ages.

Speech Recognition
Video gamers will be able to attest to that all the time.
Playing a RTS or FPS with speech only would be impossible.
You would lose every time.

Think about it.
[ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ]
From the feelings I've seem on it so far - it seems most people don't really care for it. And above everything else, that will be the main determining factor.
Personally, I remember trying 'voice recognition' software like 10 years ago. It wasn't just the pain of configuration that made it undesirable, but the fact that it did depend on speech. It's been around for a while already, really.
I really don't want to get up early on the weekends, go posting on blogs, forums, or whatever and have to talk. Nor do I really feel up to talking physically at work right now. Between the phone and everything else in the 'real world', mostly I just don't feel up to physically talking more. Especially to a computer.
I'll keep the keyboard and mouse as long as I can... If it comes to me shelling out more $$$ for 'voice recognition' they can forget it! lol
[ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ]
Speech recognition may work great for some people, especially those who are handicapped or do dictation all day long. However, a computer tech will ALWAYS need a keyboard. Just imagine trying to write computer code or input complicated commandline sequences using speech. It ain't gonna happen, period.
The key to speech recognition is its ability to understand the English language (or whatever other spoken language you use). Computer code and commandline environments are NOT comprised of basic English. They are not languages that can be easily spoken. Actually, this is somewhat ironic, because it's for this very reason that the people writing the speech recognition software will never be able to use said software to do their jobs.
So yeah, Bill, take your predictions and go sit in a dark corner somewhere, quietly please. For the record, I haven't really taken much stock in your predictions since you said nobody would ever need more than 640K of RAM.

I Remember
While it was fun, it wasn't always practical. I lost privacy when using it, as anyone who could hear me knew what I was doing. Most people, including me change their tones when their mood changes and that would be annoying.
And actually, there were many things where it really was just faster with the mouse or keyboard.
The only place I see voice recognition coming in is security and document writing. Its not really too practical past all that.
It wouldn't be much help with graphic artists, it wouldn't be worth anything to gamers, etc..
It has a future in security, document writing and stuff that isn't a part of the PC (cell-phones, PDAs, etc..)
[ reply to this | link to this | view in thread ]
Kill me now
Speech recognition technology does have practical applications in many situations but it is still very limited. For example, my credit card company uses speech recognition to supplement its voice menu navigation. It's handy but it is a far cry from a viable substitute for simply pressing a number key. Sign me up when I can call in then simply say, "What's my current balance and when is my next payment due?"
For my money speech recognition makes sense when you don't have access to a keyboard/mouse/keypad, but it doesn't replace these entry mechanisms. The real innovation will be when we can control input through a combination of thought, hand motion and eye movement. Now that would be nifty.

Speech recognition software rules!
It is not necessary anymore to subject your body parts to potentially hazardous repetitive movement by continually typing. There is a much better and faster way to communicate to a computer. I originally obtained the software because I hurt my elbow and I was unable to type. By the way Anonymous Coward, it is not appreciated when you call us speech recognition users handicapped. We're actually the smarter ones! I would say that you are the one with the handicapped brain because you are so clueless and say things which are just simply not true. Just for your information, if you do have to make that sort of degrading comment then special-needs is a much better term. In fact I am certain that I can put written text into a computer faster than the fastest typist in the world and I am ready for the challenge. Bring them on! (This text just took me about 20 seconds to dictate) I feel really sorry for all you folks stuck banging away at your keyboards day after day, wasting your time and increasing the likelihood of carpal tunnel or other life changing physically painful problems in the future.
Speech recognition software is like any other software, you have to learn how to use it correctly. It gets better with time as it continually learns to recognize your speech patterns. If you have words that it does not recognize you can train it easily to recognize those words.
I think that most of the negative comments about speech recognition are written by people who have never used it and so they are meaningless. It does help to be able to speak clearly and quickly which some people cannot do. I am not sure if the software would work for somebody who stutters, slurs or mumbles (like Mayor Menino of Boston) when they speak. It is also helpful to have studied a foreign language so that you know how to take care in your pronunciation and to be sure that your pronunciation is very reproducible.
The other thing that is really driving me crazy is that everyone is saying well "I'm going to have to give up my keyboard". That is simply not the case. You can still type and use your mouse but you would find that you never do this once you learn to use speech recognition. However if for some reason you get stuck on a particular word or you get tired of talking you can still type.
Let's hear from other successful speech recognition users instead of this nonsense from people who really know nothing about it.
Thank you for reading my long dictation/composition. I could go on and on and on and on because it is just so simple to put words into your computer when you say them. Effortless in fact. I simply lean back in my chair comfortably and talk to my computer and it does what I tell it to do each and every time.
Bill Gates you are so right and I believe in you and your predictions!

I also have a muscle problem and lost my earning potential since my experience and education relies on computers. I am 47 and have been trying to get another career going, one that doesn't use computers much and I have not had any success.

Speech replacing keyboarding
I teach keyboarding (college) also, and we have lots of students. It's just that they don't know about voice and handwriting and that they don't have tablet computers.
Once tablet computers and phones that use handwriting as well as speech technology are marketed correctly, the use of keyboarding will disappear in a few years.
One of my students showed me her cell phone that has handwriting on it. She just wrote the text message on the screen and it was magically turned to typing as she wrote each word. No mistakes.
A cell phone sales person showed me her cell phone (a model not sold by the company she was working for) that had speech recognition. She told it to "Text Robert." It opened a text message screen. Then she said "Where are you?" It wrote the message in a second. No thumbs!
I was impressed. I am know looking for a cell phone that has handwriting (OneNote particularly) and speech. Does anyone know of one?
Thanks.

Speech recognition
2. Some high percentage of employee output, is chit chat, gossip, tweets, chats, etc. Do they want people in the office to hear that? I for example, wouldn't want my colleague, sat next to me, to hear what I am typing right now on this forum.
3. People have all sorts of noise interference coming from their machines, like music, and sound effects. Typing is immune to any effects of this noise. Voice isn't.
4. With a mouse and keyboard, you can write documents and quickly/efficiently revise/edit them.
5. I bought my first laptop 15 years ago, and got a word recognition package. Seemed like a great idea, but I quickly realised that it was useless. I have not since installed such a package, nor had the desire to.
7. 20 years ago, I studied the paperless office. Hands up anyone, 20 years on, who hasn't got biros, scraps of paper, post.it notes, business cards, , pads, calanders, and wads of paper on their desks? It's hard to simplify a process that is already pure simplicity.
The question is. If typing works, why try to simplify it with soemthing that is intrinsically more complicated, and even less desireable??

Behold the glory of the Justin Bieber Singing Toothbrush. In the past, Rocks Off has tackled music's most effed-up grills, so it seemed only fitting that we try and spread the word to combat it.
Though most of us would rather make music like the Pogues, only an idiot would want Shane McGowan's hideous grin over the flawless glory of Bieber's pearly whites. Ergo, the toothbrush should be worthy of such toothsome perfection, right?
For $9.95, the brush comes with batteries, a detachable and replaceable head, and plays two-minute clips of two Bieber songs. Each song is helpfully labeled as a morning or night tune, because you wouldn't want to get all riled up in the evening with "Love Me" when you could ease into slumber with "Somebody to Love."
The principle behind the brush is actually pretty sound. The night and day options could possibly encourage brushers to indulge in the singing toothbrush twice a day as recommended.
The two-minute duration is also helpful an ensuring that you brush for the proper duration. We were surprised at how much longer you are actually supposed to spend on oral hygiene after playing the songs during brushing.
Also, the head on the brush is definitely not fucking around. It's soft enough to not irritate your gums, but firm enough to really get in there and clean up. If you've spent your whole life using cheap brushes with dollar store bristles, then something a bit more high-caliber will be an eye-opener.
That being said, the Justin Bieber Singing Toothbrush is not without its flaws.
First off, the brush comes apart if you look at it funny. The head, body, and battery compartment have no snaps or tabs. They just slide together, and the damn thing fell apart twice while we were using it.
Then there's the singing feature, which other than collecting every piece of Bieber memorabilia is the only reason to buy the brush.
As you probably guessed, the speaker quality is absolutely terrible. It's impossible to make out the song... though to be fair that might just be us. Even more ridiculous, your hand goes right over the speaker while brushing, muffling the sound even worse.
In conclusion, if you'd rather spend $10 on a toothbrush endorsed by Justin Bieber that will clean your teeth like gangbusters while trying to fall apart and blasting out tinny versions of the Biebs pop hits than, say, on a book that will totally change your life, then go right ahead.
We all need clean teeth, and while pricier than your average toothbrush it at least does good work. If you want to pretend that Justin Bieber himself serenades you every morning when you attend your toilet, this product will aid that fantasy.

WTF!!!!! Who's business is it anyways!!!
This struck a nerve with me because I am in the same boat, I am 25 years old and my husband is 42 and we've been together since I was 19. My mother still doesn't like him but at least my father is nice to him, civil, even friendly. Who's ******* business is it!! MINE! Anyone else in the same boat, unsupportive mother, constantly making snarky comments, rooting for your marriage to fail?? What kind of crap is that, she's supposed to be my MOTHER!!! My husband has never hit me, been abusive or unloving, if anything he's been way more loving and supportive than I deserve.
We have 5 kids between us, (4 are his 1 is mine) from previous marriages. I have never met anyone or been with anyone who understands me and loves me so unconditionally accepting me for me, never tried to change what or who I am, always been supportive, let me be me and I love him for him, he's amazing and I wouldn't change a thing about him. It's a real shame when people can't look past the age difference and see that there's 2 people there who love each other through thick and thin.
Dear Judgmental ******** of the World,
Go **** yourselves!! Don't go judging what you don't know!!
I am 28 and my boyfriend is 42 and we have been together 4 years. He has 2 children from a previous marriage that are both in their teens. I have not been there and done that and i knew when we met and got to know each other he said never never again cos he had a nasty divorce and was basically with the wrong person for 20 years and only stayed with her as she fell pregnant within 6 months of dating so they just worked at it. but he met me after they separated after another row and love just hit him right between the eyes. So it completely changes What u want in life. i was 23 at the time and didn't want children myself or wanted to ever get married through growing up in a broken big family myself, where my mum and dad got divorced as did my aunts uncles and even my gran and grandad..... But over time, love has grown so much ( and he's my longest relationship) that I can't image life without him and i now actually would love to be his wife. and he would be marrying me through love, not cos he had kids with me and it was the done thing to do. he wants this too now and even spoke about children as he knows one day i will want them and leaat this time he would be having a baby cos its planned and through love, not sex and trying to accept it. People will always say he's too old for you or he will start looking old soon or he won't be able to look after a baby at his age or cope with it, but he's in good shape, best body and fitness I've seen compared to my previous relationships with people my own age and younger ! And he's young in his mind . the male version of me. people think its purely about just having that stability with older guys for financial reasons or cos they are more wise and settled and not after partying and cheating on you and tes it is those things but they are just bonus. it's purely about cos we connect. We talk and behave like we are the same age and enjoy the same hobbies so age doesn't really matter whatsoever. It's just a number literally that goes up every year but it doesn't mean your mind gets older. Yeh your body does but I can say at 42 he's still as sexy as he was at 38 and the sex is just as good and as often. Like the above comment said stuff everyone else, they are making you happy if you had to listen and follow everything they said. It wouldn't make you , you and feel alive and in control. It riles me when there is always some debate about this. I only deal with logic in life and its pretty simple to work out. You love them and they love you. End of discussion.

Empirical validation of building energy simulation codes is an important component in understanding the capacity and limitations of the software. Within the framework of Task 34/Annex 43 of the International Energy Agency (IEA), a series of experiments was performed in an outdoor test cell. The objective of these experiments was to provide a high-quality data set for code developers and modelers to validate their solar gain models for windows with and without shading devices. A description of the necessary specifications for modeling these experiments is provided in this paper, which includes information about the test site location, experimental setup, geometrical and thermophysical cell properties including estimated uncertainties. Computed overall thermal cell properties were confirmed by conducting a steady-state experiment without solar gains. A transient experiment, also without solar gains, and corresponding simulations from four different building energy simulation codes showed that the provided specifications result in accurate thermal cell modeling. A good foundation for the following experiments with solar gains was therefore accomplished.- Sarah (Hoffman) Davis's Profile

May 23, 2013
Patch is a new self-watering herb planter seeking funding on KickstarterImage Gallery (6 images)
Patch Planter isn't the first self-watering herb planter to cross our radar: that would be the AeroGarden. But where that product was an all-singing, all-dancing "kitchen garden appliance," Patch is a much more down to earth and affordable piece of design, and one that doesn't require a power supply.
Unlike AeroGaden, Patch embraces good old soil (or better yet, Potting Mix) as its growing medium. The planter uses a method of irrigation called subirrigation, which involves keeping a reservoir of water below the soil, from where water is absorbed upwards.
The planter is simply an open-topped Tyvek cuboid with a perforated shelf separating the growth medium from the water below. In the corner is a cylinder through which the reservoir is topped up, apparently as little as once a week in the early stages of growth, though every 2 or 3 days once they grow large. Whether this meets your expectation of "self-watering" will depend on your outlook. However, Let's Patch (apparently the makers of the planter, but also sometimes the name for the planter itself) claims this renders over- or under-watering impossible, saves water and maximizes yield overall.
Each Patch measures 12 x 6 x 6 in (30 x 15 x 15 cm), holding 4 liters of soil and 2 liters of water (0.9 and 0.4 gallons respectively). But Patch is really more of a bag than a box, folding down to only an inch thickness for postage.
Where this differs from AeroGarden is the lack of built-in lighting, which should be unnecessary for anyone with a bright patch in his or her home. Obviously this much simpler design makes the Patch the more affordable option. At the time of writing a second-tier Patch can be secured for a US$33 sum, rising to $38 when that tier is exhausted (or if you're in generous spirits).
The Kickstarter campaign video below gives a few more glimpses of the Patch, and should serve to mightily confuse you regarding the product and company branding (it did me, anyway).
Sources: Let's Patch, Kickstarter via Inhabitat
I don't get it, instead of watering the plant once a week you get to fill the reservoir every three days?fatalflaw
Neat cube shape, but 'self-watering' pots - with an under-dirt reservoir - have been around for years! Have a couple outside, both large urn-sized terracotta look. Good for tomatoes and a herb garden. I also have one on a windowsill inside at present, approx., shoe-box sized. Holds 2 flowering plants, needs water only twice a week or so. It cost almost nothing at my local '$2' outlet.The Skud“Like” Clip and Follow on Facebook to be be updated on other great freebies and deals!

Macedonius (3) II., patriarch of Constantinople a.d. 495. For an account of his election see EUPHEMIUS (4). Within a year or two (the date is uncertain) he assembled a council, in which he confirmed in writing that of Chalcedon, and openly professed, as he always did, his adhesion to the orthodox faith. In 507 Elias, patriarch of Jerusalem, who had been unwilling to sanction the deposition of Euphemius, united himself in communion with Macedonius. The heterodox emperor Anastasius employed all means to oblige Macedonius to declare against the council of Chalcedon, but flattery and threats were alike unavailing. An assassin named Eucolus was even hired to take away his life. The patriarch avoided the blow, and ordered a fixed amount of provisions to be given monthly to the criminal. The people of Constantinople were equally zealous for the council of Chalcedon, even, more than once, to the point of sedition. To prevent unfavourable consequences, Anastasius ordered the prefect of the city to follow in the processions and attend at the assemblies of the church. In 510 the emperor made a new effort. Macedonius would do nothing without an oecumenical council at which the bp. of great Rome should preside. Anastasius, annoyed at this answer, and irritated because Macedonius would never release him from the engagement he had made at his coronation to maintain the faith of the church and the authority of the council of Chalcedon, sought means to drive him from his chair. He sent Eutychian monks and clergy, and sometimes the magistrates of the city, to load him with public outrage and insult. This caused such a tumult amongst the citizens that the emperor was obliged to shut himself up in his palace and to have vessels moored near in case flight should be necessary. He sent to beg Macedonius to come and speak with him. Macedonius went and reproached him with the sufferings his persecutions caused the church. Anastasius pretended to be willing to alter this, but at the same time made a third attempt to tamper with the orthodoxy of the patriarch. One of his instruments was Xenaïas, an Eutychian bishop. He demanded of Macedonius a declaration of his faith in writing; Macedonius addressed a memorandum to the emperor insisting that he knew no other faith than that of the Fathers of Nicaea and Constantinople, and that he anathematized Nestorius and Eutyches and those who admitted two Sons or two Christs, or who divided the two natures. Xenaïas, seeing the failure of his first attempt, procured two infamous wretches, who accused Macedonius of an abominable crime, avowing themselves his accomplices. They then charged him with Nestorianism, and with having falsified a passage in an epistle of St. Paul, in support of that sect. At last the emperor commanded him to send by the hands of the master of the offices the authentic copy of the Acts of the council of Chalcedon signed with the autographs of the bishops. Macedonius refused, sealed it up, and hid it under the altar of the great church. Thereupon Anastasius had him carried off by night and taken to Chalcedon, to be conducted thence to Eucaïta in Pontus, the place of the exile of his predecessor. In 515 pope Hormisdas worked for the restitution of Macedonius, whom he considered unjustly deposed; it had been a stipulation in the treaty of peace between Vitalian and Anastasius that the patriarch and all the deposed bishops should be restored to their sees. But Anastasius never kept his promises, and Macedonius died in exile. His death occurred c. 517, at Gangra, where he had retired for fear of the Huns, who ravaged all Cappadocia, Galatia, and Pontus.

He went on to the University of Michigan where he majored in chemistry and also earned 6 varsity letters in cross-country and track. He was the Big Ten champion in the mile and two mile events.
He graduated in 1931 and was invited to train for the 1932 Olympics. However, he could afford neither the time nor money to do so, as he went on to graduate School earning a PhD in Chemistry. He married Genevieve Davis in 1933 and went to work as a scientist for Abbot Labs in North Chicago IL.
In the mid 40's he decided to go to seminary at Neshota House in Watertown, WI, and was subsequently ordained as an Episcopalian priest. He served for many years in Parishes in Wisconsin, Texas and Michigan. Eventually he turned to teaching and spent the final years of his career teaching high school chemistry in Toledo Ohio.SAN FRANCISCO, July 7 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMB Property Corporation(R) (NYSE: AMB), a leading owner, operator and developer of industrial real estate, today announced that it has fully leased a 328,000 square foot (30,500 square meter) facility at AMB Hausbruch Industrial Center in Hamburg to BSN medical GmbH, a leading global medical device company. The new lease, effective July 1, 2009, renews BSN medical's previous commitment to 210,000 square feet (19,500 square meters), and increases their lease by 118,000 square feet (11,000 square meters) of additional space.
"AMB adapted to market conditions in our management of this infill asset. We acquired the site as part of our AMB Hausbruch Industrial Center, with plans to demolish the building and develop a modern distribution facility in its place. However, we were able to meet the needs of a highly respected customer for 10 more years, and to significantly expand their leased space," said Mo Barzegar, AMB's managing director, Europe.
"We are extremely pleased that AMB was able to offer us long-term accommodation for our production center at this strategic location, which is close to our Global R&D facility and BSN's head office, ensuring both close communication and a strong talent base," said Dr. Claus-Hermann Wiegel, managing director of BSN medical.
AMB Hamburg Hausbruch Industrial Park is located approximately one mile from the Altenwerder Terminals of the Port of Hamburg and approximately five miles from Hamburg city center. The site has immediate access to the A7 highway, the main north/south arterial through the region that intersects with the A1 highway, connecting Hamburg with the Rhine-Ruhr region, Germany's most densely populated and industrialized region.

Royal Mail to step up dog action

Royal Mail to take tougher line on dog attacks

1. I don’t understand how to wear eyeliner. My last successful eyeliner experience was in seventh grade, and involved an iridescent green Wet’n’Wild eyeliner pencil. I can still remember the flakes of wood scraping against my eyelid due to my sharpener ineptitude. That probably put me off eyeliner for good, come to think of it.
2. Everyone in my house is sick right now, except for The Daddy, who is also conveniently out of town. Convenient for his immune system, that is. This morning, the two-year-old greeted me with the Whitmanesque refrain: “Oh! The green boogers!” He was irrationally – at least, to my mind – enraged that I would NOT allow him to wipe his nose on my shirt. I mean, what’s a mom for, if she’s not going to be there for her kid, you know?
3. Worse, because I have not been to the grocery in a week, we have no kleenex, bread, cereal, eggs, orange juice (my go-to cure for a cold), or coffee. It’s possible that the two-year-old was merely pointing out that the prospect of wiping one’s nose on a generic paper towel is not appealing.
4. I forgot to get a haircut for the past five months, because it requires making a phone call, and I don’t use my smartphone for making actual calls. I use it for storing voicemail.
4. Oh, yes, there was going to be an “Ask a Catechist” series every Wednesday, and I still need to make another Scripture Shorts video about Moses, and there was also going to be a Catechist Chat newsletter, but…I haven’t scheduled the guest posts.
And it seemed like MailChimp was going to be really confusing – like, it would take several weeks of study to learn how to operate MailChimp. I didn’t want to be too hasty. I wanted that newsletter to be PERRRRFECT. So guess what? There’s been no newsletter. I’d like to think the first issue will come out next week, and the title will be something clever like “no, really, you did sign up for this newsletter back in December.” But I’ll make no promises. No announcements of grand behavior modification to come.
(MailChimp is actually way easy. So I have no excuse.)
5. As could be expected, the grain-free Lenten sacrifice has been one big bust. Here’s how it panned out.
Days 1 and 2: This is amazing! I feel so free! Free from the shackles of bread dependence! Free to make omelets, and to put pesto on vegetables instead of on noodles!
Day 3: This is easy! This is so easy, I should amp it up! I’m going to read up on the Paleo diet! I’m going to figure out kefir! I’m going to blog about my success!
Day every day since then: Not. so. much.
6. I do, in my defense, have the excuse that I have fallen head over heels for WordPress and the Genesis Framework (that’s an affiliate link, should you feel like checking it out.) So I’ve been busy getting a web design business up and running. The problem with me is that I am completely oblivious to the concept of “small steps.” And thus have tried to reinvent all other aspects of my personality, except the eyeliner issues, at the same time as launching said business.
7. I don’t care if it’s not the right day for Seven Quick Takes. That’s not what this is, anyway.
8. What this IS…is a manifesto. I need a break. A real break, not a “I’m going to watch my TV shows and ignore the state of my house” break. If you’re in the Boston area and haven’t decided whether you’re coming to the Faith and Family Mom’s Day Away event, I implore you to attend.
Heeere’s Danielle, who surely has it more together than I, issuing an open invitation. I must leave you now, as there’s a runny nose making a beeline for my shirt.
I can’t figure out the eyeliner either, and it irks me, because done right it looks so good. Done badly, it looks… bad.
Yeah, I feel like a Cleopatra impersonator whenever I attempt eyeliner.
All men whose opinions matter believe women are their loveliest without makeup.
I got my hair cut last week. It had probably been about a year since my last haircut. At least five months since I started to think “I really should get my hair cut.” It took my mom coming into town to get me to actually do it.
Melanie, that’s the only time I get my hair cut, too – when my mom’s in town. Except I forgot to go the last time she was here. Pitiful.
My spouse cuts my hair…maybe that’s what y’all should do.
In *theory*, the fringe benefit of my cutting everyone else in the family’s hair is that I can use the “haircut fund” all on myself. In reality, that never seems to pan out.
It’s an epidemic! That’s the only time I get my hair cut too! Except I went to her hair-cutter person the last time we went to visit my parents. It’s not just the making of the appointment, the phone call, etc. It’s the arranging for someone to watch the kids. An additional hurdle I’m just not able to get over.
Also clueless on the eyeliner. I do wear it once a week or so, but never feel like I know what I’m doing with that, nor any other makeup type thing.
By the way, as I was reading this itemized cri de coeur, I thought, “Anyone who pours out the soul with such alacrity can (and must) return to serving as a model for catechists and humans everywhere.”
I’m thinking I may be both a human and a catechist. If so, you may be twice the model…or maybe half the model.
My favorite part is that I accidentally listed two #4’s.
I believe I was attempting to imply that catechists are superhuman.
Dorian! You’re coming to the right place re: eyeliner. I used to want to be a makeup artist, and have spent highly inappropriate amounts of time out of my life studying the art of makeup. Swing by my room and I’ll give you some tips!
Dorian! Where’s my newsletter!
Oh, sorry, I didn’t read the post first.
Hey, I understand…web design is all consuming! And, Genesis is awesome! I need to get some of your Genesis mojo.
I wish I lived close enough to get you some kleenex, though. Want me to mail some?

Ghana Rugby Association’s Message (Rest In Peace H. E. Prof. J. E. A Mills)
The Ghana Rugby Association extends its deepest condolences to all Ghanaians, especially to the family of the late President; H. E. John Evans Fifi Atta-Mills.
We wish to add our voices to all who share our pain and grief in saying that, Ghana and Africa has lost a great presence indeed.
We speak for sports since we live sports, when we say; this was a man who tried to do as much for sports as possible; part of the things we will forever remember him for is his contribution in putting the Ghana Olympic Committee (GOC) back on course with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), after their initial fall out.
If not for anything at all, the lives of a few more people will be made richer in the world of sports because of this development.
We therefore appeal to all Ghanaians to unite and join us, as we aim to keep the dreams of a real hero alive.
We will really miss you Prof. May your soul find rest with the Father Almighty.San Francisco housing crisis a warning for Toronto
Both cities have many neighbourhoods that are incredibly desirable places to live, where the cheapest houses can't be had for much less than $1 million.

Beach residents fought a long battle after plans were announced to build a condo at the site of this Lick's on Queen St. E.
San Francisco is in a crisis and Toronto should pay attention. Over the past few months the Bay Area has seen a kind of class war between well-paid tech workers who are being bussed from San Francisco to jobs at Google and other companies to nearby Silicon Valley, and those who find they’re being priced out of their city, with the tech workers serving as scapegoats for economic inequality.
A recent widely read article on TechCrunch explains the roots of San Francisco’s housing crisis, and though some details differ, what’s happening there should be a warning for us here as the similarities between the two cities are many. Toronto architect Larry Richards has referred to our city as “San Francisco turned upside down,” as Toronto’s ravines are the inverse of that city’s hills and both are defining features of each city’s topography. Consider also: both cities have many central neighbourhoods built around the turn of the last century that have become incredibly desirable places to live, where the cheapest houses can’t be had for much less than a million dollars.
RELATED:
The sprawl of both the Bay Area’s seven million people and the GTA’s nearly five million has consumed some of best agricultural land on the continent, and both cities have large numbers of commuters who cycle and take transit, yet the car is still a big part of life here and there. Even the Prince Edward Viaduct — or Bloor St. viaduct as it is more commonly known — over the Don Valley is as beautiful as the Golden Gate Bridge; don’t let the Toronto naysayers tell you anything different.
A theme throughout the TechCrunch article is that NIMBYism is a big culprit in keeping San Francisco expensive, a Not In My Backyard sentiment that prevents much new development. Like Toronto, San Francisco has a strong tradition of citizen activism born in resistance to destructive freeway and urban renewal schemes in the 1950s through the 1970s. Yet that resistance has morphed into a profoundly conservative culture of “no” in both cities, regardless of political affiliations.
In Toronto, where we do have new construction, there are near-bloody battles on main streets over condo buildings six to eight storeys high that are opposed by nearby residents living in single family homes that cost, at the very least, double what the condos would. This means the barrier to neighbourhood entry is many hundreds of thousands of dollars rather than a few hundred thousand; not cheap still but open to more buyers. Some councillors take principled stands on the side of more people, like Mary-Margaret McMahon in the Beach during the fight over the six-storey condo building planned for the Lick’s hamburger site, a battle so relentless I’ve heard her say it gave her grey hair. If only other councillors mustered the same courage.
Most of the condos built in Toronto are not “luxury” but rather are the only place many people with standard issue, 9 to 5 jobs will ever afford to buy. Want more affordable housing? Make no mistake this kind of NIMBYism doesn’t much care if new residents are paying market price or if it’s geared to income — the message is that this neighbourhood is closed to anyone else.
What’s at stake if Toronto continues down this road to San Francisco is the very idea that this is a place for everyone, a “You Belong Here” kind of city. Do we change that welcoming idea of the city to match its demonstrated conservatism, or do we figure out a way to change the culture of no into one that is more concerned with figuring out how to fit more people into this city in buildings that are well designed and at various levels of affordability?
Condos aren’t a threat to Toronto’s diversity and liveability, but saying no to everything is.

In a 1988 survey people were asked, "Did you yourself, happen to attend church in the last seven days." 47% of the college graduates, 43% of the college incomplete, 41% of the high school graduates, and 39% of the those that had not graduated from high school said they had gone to church. There were several later studies which confirmed the general pattern, education is positively correlated with attendance at religious services.
On the other hand the same Gallop polls show that educated people are less likely to say they believe in God or a Universal Spirit, and less likely to say that God is very important in their lives.
It is a common saying, actions speak louder than words. People normally think that this is a very good rule of thumb, and by this rule of thumb the more educated people become the more religious they become. This is of course directly opposed to the common perception.
One of the common arguments against faith is that educated people are not religious, but these statistics suggest just the opposite. If actions are more important than words and the people are telling the truth then more education means more religion, not less.
Furthermore, this might be an important point to bring up to encourage education. Many religious parents may fear that education will lead their children away from faith. The evidence suggests that education may lead children to atheism, but it also leads to an active, practiced faith.
The number of educated people who say they believe does not exceed or at least greatly exceed the number who say they went to religious services. One reasonable interpretation of the data would be that if an educated person says they believe, and that religion is important to them, they are more likely to act on that by attending religious services.
This may provide us with a clue as to why educated people are less likely to believe. Educated people may feel a greater need to match their actions to their beliefs, while the less educated are more comfortable saying they believe and then ignoring the requirements of their faith. So for the educated religion is much more expensive because they treat the commandments as commandments not suggestions.
It has recently been commented that the 9-11 suicide bombers were a fairly educated group, and the suicide bombers in general are fairly educated. This is a surprise to people who think that educated people are less likely to be religious, but if educated people are less likely to be marginally religious, but more likely to be very dedicated to their faith then the education of suicide bombers becomes understandable. It could be argued that educated people realize their tendency to religious fanaticism and their atheism is a defense against that religious fanaticism.
It should be said that this is not the whole story, it is only part of the story. For other parts of the story you might want to check out some of the other web pages on this site.
I do not know how that would change these statistics. Perhaps the educated people answer more honestly. If that is so then the figures might underestimate the difference in church attendance between the more and less educated. I think this is quite likely the case.
On the other hand, perhaps people who are not really educated claim to be, and furthermore those who lie about being educated also lie about attending religious services. This also seems quite plausible.
Not knowing how to adjust the figures, I have somewhat arbitrarily taken them at face value.

Last updated July 18, 2007Setitie Sorcery is the name used by Kindred of other clans for the blood sorcery practiced by the Followers of Set.
. The trappings, traditions and beliefs vary between the branches and bloodlines of the clan:
Setite sorcery is unlike normal Thaumaturgy, in that its paths don't necessarily require inherent vitae expenditure or Willpower rolls. The power for these paths usually comes from the Western Lands, not from the sorcerer herself. In fact, these paths are more like closed-ended Disciplines than more Traditional thaumaturgical paths, though they are finite and depend on the larger theory of Setite sorcery.
**Note:** Just because a path is fundemantally the same as another (it uses the same system) does not mean that the vampire can learn it from someone who does not know their 'brand' of magic. For instance: Ann the Tremere knows The Path of Conjuring via Thaumaturgy. She cannot teach Jayakar, the Assamite Sorcerer, Jinn's Gift. The process for which each blood magic casts its spell is different.
Set's perversion of traditional Egyptian magic, practised by lector-priests of the mainstream clan.
The game mechanics of Akhu differ from Hermetic Thaumaturgy in several important ways. Most immediately, Setite Sorcery paths do not all use a Willpower roll. Some paths call for an Attribute + Ability roll – always the same roll for each power in the path. All rituals use an Intelligence + Occult roll. Difficulties are usually the power or ritual's level + 3, to a maximum of 9. In some cases, however, a power or ritual might use the victim's Wilpower as the difficulty instead.
Most Akhu path powers do not require expending vitae. The lector-priest draws upon her blasphemy-shrine's power instead. Vitae expenditures within Setite Sorcery often take the form of sacrifices to Set or another god.
A lector-priest character needs at list one dot of Occult and one dot of Linguistics to know the requisite mysteries of Egyptian myth, magic and language. Alchemial rituals demand that the magician possess at least one dot of Medicine or Science. If a character lacks at least one dot of Crafts, the difficulty of all rituals that involve written spells, engraved amulates or other inscriptions increases by one.
Storytellers may impose other difficulty penalties of bonuses upon a player's roll, depending on how thoroughly the character adheres to the full pomp of Egyptian priestly tradition. For instance, rituals that involve writing assume that the character empoys an authentic reed pen, ink and papyrus. She could also draw her inscription on a moist clay tablet and bake it hard. Chiseling the spell into a stone stela and painting the hieroglyphs would merit reducing the difficulty by -1. Conversely, scribbling spells with a ballpoint pen on a three-by-five note card would increase the sending's difficulty by +1. Other factors that could reduce difficulties include the use of genuine Nile water, ancient ritual tools or congregation of fellow Set cultists (such as a personal blood cult). Negative factors include wearing synthetic or animal-derived fabrics (Egyptian priests wore linen), or improvised ritual tools. We recommend that Storytellers not adjust difficulties up or down by more than two.
Some Akhu paths require the use of a material focus. In most cases, the path requires only a small amulet or item of jewelry. A few paths require as much time and preparation as rituals – but they are so fundamental to Akhu that players spend experience points for their characters to learn them.
A vampiric version of Hindu sorcery, practised by the Daitya and other Indian vampires.
Sadhana paths all call for Willpower rolls. A sadhu evokes all path magic by sheer force of will because that's how she believes ascetic magic works: If you gain enough merit through your austerities, what you wish comes true. Most Sadhana rituals call for an Intelligence + Occult roll from the player, just like every other style of Thaumaturgy. The exceptions, like Rakta-Maya rituals of hypnotic illusion, are noted in their sections.
Unlike Hermatic magus, a sadhu needs to learn an additional Ability besides Occult. Sadhana's austerities demand that a practitioner also develop the Secondary Skill of Meditation. A sorcerer cannot employ path magic at a higher level than her Meditation Trait, though she may perform rituals of a higher level. She still knows her primary path to the lefel of her full Thaumaturgical mastery; she simply lacks the spiritual force or focus to use it. When her player raises the character's Meditation Trait, she can use the path to the higher level. Note: This applies to ALL paths learned in this line, including ones "imported" from other paths.
Meditation has many uses in its own right, in accordance with an Indian adept's overmastering will. At the Storyteller's option, a sadhu's player can substitute an Intelligence + Meditation roll for a path power's Willpower roll – but at the cost of the power taking as much time as a ritual of the same level. Meditation is not quick.
The sorcery of the heretical Serpents of the Light.
Wanga operates very differently than most traditional forms of Thaumaturgy. One of the many reasons that the practice is so loathed by conservative and custom-bound Tremere (and other thaumaturges) is that it refuses to follow the rules.
Wanga blurs the lines between rituals and paths. The invocation of its paths often requires the presence of specific materials and the vocalization of names of power – requirements reserved for rituals alone in Hermetic Thaumaturgy. Even the most basic tenet of Thaumaturgy – that it requires the expenditure of blood to invoke – is belied by one of Wanga's paths. Some of the Wanga's detractors among the Warlocks wish to declare it an entirely separate form of blood sorcery, unrelated to Thaumaturgy at all. Wangateurs laugh at this notion; Wanga was separate, after all, until the Tremere spearheaded the effort to bring the practice into the fold.
Except for the path known as The Flow of Ashé, Wanga paths require the expenditure of blood for activation. In addition, any time Wanga is invoked, be it a path or ritual, the wangateur must call upon the spirit appropriate to the intended effect. For instance, a wangateur invoking Lure of Flames might call on Chango, Alternatively, were she attempting to call upon the Path of Weather Control, she might invoke Agarou Tonerre, aloa of thunder.
In addition, Wanga possesses its own unique wet of tools, components and ritualistic items that must often be present for the magic to work. Not every ritual involves all of these tools, but the vast majority of them require at least a few. Listed below are the more common of Wanga's tools, once again, a bit of research on the players' part will turn up a wealth of additional material.
Asson
Used primarily in voudoun. This is a rattle wielded by the houngan or mambo, and is considered a magical and sacred object. It is normally constructed out of a gourd to which has been affixed a wooden handle, and is often decorated with such esoteric items as snake bones and bits of coral.
Ekwele
From the Santerfa faith, this is a thin chain measuring about 50 inches in length, and broken at regular intervals by one-and-a-half inch disks made from a tortoise shell. It is used in the practice of Ifa, a form of divination.
Ese
Also from Santerfa, the Ese are poetic verses used in the interpretation of Ifa. Babalawos often have hundreds of these committed to memory.
Farine
This flour used to trace the veves utilized in voudoun rituals.
Gris-gris
A gris-gris is a charm, talisman or any other small magic item. Many of the faiths refer to such charms as wangas; gris-gris is the voudoun equivalent.
Hounfour
A temple or structure used for ceremonies to the god of voudoun.
Kisengue
A human shinbone wrapped in black rags, this is a common component of Palo Mayombe ceremonies.
Ngana
A large iron cauldron filled with graveyard earth, bones, and sticks and other disturbing ingredients. It is one of the most important components of Palo Mayombe. (This term also refers to a priest or shaman of certain African religions, though it is never used in that context here.)
Peristyle
An open courtyard in which voudoun ceremonies are held. There is often, but not always, a hounfour located on the property.
Poteau Mitan
The pole that stands at the center of peristyle or hounfour. It is often carved or decorated, and represents the center of the universe and its connection with the spirit world. All dancing during the ceremony revolves around the poteau mitan.
Veve
Common to many of the Afro-Caribean faiths but most prevalent in voudoun, this is a symbolic design representing one of the Ioa (or other spirit). Veves are used as the focus of rituals, and serve as a temporary altar when a more permanent construct is unavailable. Although they can be found written or inscribed on all manner of surfaces, they are most commonly constructed by pouring flour on the ground during rituals.
Kindred or kine, you cannot just wake up one morning (or evening) and decide, "Today, I will become a houngan (or tata)." As with any position of authority in any other religion, it takes years of learning and initiation to become a priest of voudoun, Santeria. Palo Mayombe or any of the Wanga-practicing faiths. Many are the steps between a simple practitioner and a recognized master of mysteries.
It is relatively uncommon for a Kindred follower of an Afro-Caribbean religion to learn the secrets of Wanga without being initiated as a priest of the religion. Remember, Wanga is much a religious system as a form of Thaumaturgy, and like any religious secret, it is rarely taught to those who have not gone through the proper steps and initiations.
What does this mean for your Kindred wangateur? For stargers, it can mean years – often as muc as a decade or two – to reach this level of initiation.
Houngans and mambos, santeros and santeras, babalawos, tatas and yayas – they're all religious leaders, which means they have certain social obligations demanded of them by their community and by their own beliefs. In communities where these religions are the norm, the local priest is expected to lead ceremonies on a regular – sometimes weekly if not daily – basis. Many in his community seek his aid, his advice, even his powers of divination. He is expected to his magics to help those around him, to protect them from evil spirits and the influence of malice, or evil spells.
This can cause real problems for those of the vampiric persuasion. Leaving aside the fact that most such events, petitions and requests come during the hours of daylight, bear in mind that such a character is constantly standing on the very edge of the Masquerade. Even if you've managed to explain away your nocturnal leanings, what happens if you frenzy in the midst of a ceremony? Many such ceremonies involve the spilling of blood (albeit anima blood). Between the scent of vitae, the pounding drums, the pulsating pass of humanity dancing their ritual dances – the situation is absolutely ripe with disastrous potential.
There are cultures in which the use of magic isn't inherently a Masquerade breach, where magic is almost common – but most Western princes aren't going to see it like that. You can argue all you want that it wasn't really breaking the Masquerade to use Thaumaturgy in front of witnesses because they were expecting you to do magic, but the local sheriff or archon is still likely to stake first and decide later if she should bother asking questions.
At the same time, such a position of authority offers its own advantages. Herd, Allies, Contacts, even a few dots of Fame or Influence, are all easily justifiable – if not mandatory – for such an exalted post. Your position as a religious leader places all sorts of demands on you, but it opens up an equally large host of opportunities. Don't hesitate to make the most of them.
Some few wangateurs do not bear these responsibilities. Perhaps they have left such concerns behind them after years of practice, or perhaps they serve the spirits in some other capacity. The Storyteller should not feel obliged to include these social aspects if they're going to negatively impact the story.
Wanga is often a group activity. Although most of its rituals can be performed alone, they prove easier and more effective when cast as part of a ceremony involving numerous participants. Only the primary caster need follow the steps of the ritual itself; all others are involved primarily in the drumming, singing and dancing common to these religious. These other participants need not be wangateurs, or even Kindred, but they must be true believers in an Afro-Caribbean faith, they must be willing participants (no Dominated dancers, though thralls subjected to blood bonds are common among certain less-savory wangateurs), and they must know the true purpose of the ritual. If the number of participants is at least twice the level of the ritual, the difficulty of the Intelligence + Occult roll is reduced by 1.
Not the downside to this: Rituals invoked this way take substantially longer to cast. Although the standard casting time for a ritual is five minutes per level, the casting time for Wanga rituals that are cloaked in these ceremonies is half an hour per level. Of course, nothing forces the wangateur to make use of other participants if she's in a hurry.
Wangateurs have access to several rituals of "traditional" Thaumaturgy. These include many wards and other defensive rituals, divinations, various bone-related rituals and those that are designed to cause injury or consternation from a distance ("curse" rituals). In addition, Wanga has its own rich library of unique magics that call upon the spirits and the ashé around them.
To perform a ritual, a wangateur must wield an asson, an ekwele, a kisengue or other religious talisman, in addition to listed components. Wanga rituals require a roll of Intelligence + Occult versus difficulty of the ritual's level + 3 (maximum 9). A failure on this roll indicates that the magic has not been properly invoked; any required components are still consumed, and must be replaced if the caster wishes to try again. Botches indicate the orishas' displeasure and often pervert the intent of the ritual, causing an effect exactly opposed to that which was intended.
Many of the rituals draw upon components and practices taken from a specific religion (Voudoun, candomblé, etc). These are usable by any wangateur; if, however, a character is willing to dray only on one faith, she might have to make use of a modified variation of the ritual. Players should feel free (in fact, feel encouraged) to do some research in that direction if they're so inclined.
Some rituals, such as Grandfather's Gift, Ori Sight, and Shackles of Blood, call specifically upon ancestral spirits. The Ara Orun, while often generous and helpful, can also be malicious and cruel on whim. Any time such a ritual is attempted and failed, the Storyteller should secretly roll the caster's Charisma. If this roll fails or botches, the failed ritual bay be considered a botch, rather than a simple failure – at the Storyteller's discretion; the Ara Orun have proven exceptionally hostile this night.Dump Truck Driver Dies in West Virginia After Being Pinned Between Dump Body and Truck Frame During Trouble Shooting Inspection
Investigation # 98WV029-01
Release Date: December 30, 1998
SUMMARY
On July 20, 1998, a 28-year-old male dump truck driver (the victim) died of injuries sustained when he was pinned between the dump body and frame of his truck. Just prior to the incident, the victim had finished hauling for the day and returned to the shop. It was reported that earlier the victim had problems with the dump body sticking in the elevated position. He elevated the dump body and then tried to lower the dump body using the hand control within the cab. The dump body stuck in an elevated position. This had occurred on previous occasions. When he could not lower the dump body, he got out of the cab leaving the control valve in the down position. The victim then climbed up on top of the truck frame placing himself directly behind the cab of the truck and under the elevated dump body. The victim tried to free the stuck dump body by placing one end of a binder chain on the dump body and attaching was EMS transported the victim to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. The coroner estimated the time from injury to death to be minutes.
The WV FACE Investigator concluded that to reduce the likelihood of similar occurrences, employers should:
- ensure that before making inspections, adjustments, or repairs strong, heavy, positive supports are used to secure the dump body and prevent it from lowering.
- develop, implement, and enforce a written safety program which includes, but is not limited to, task specific safety procedures and worker training in hazard identification, avoidance, and control.
- develop and implement a preventative maintenance program which includes, but is not limited to, pre-shift inspections of all of the vehicle's operational systems and safety devices and the correction of identified defects prior to placing vehicle in service.
Additionally, manufacturers should:
- provide end users with a comprehensive dump bed system owner's manual, including, but not limited to, the proper inspection and maintenance of the system and the safe work practices concerning system inspection and maintenance.
- consider re-engineering current body prop systems so they provide a full range of protection during all phases of inspection and preventative maintenance operations.
INTRODUCTION
On July 20, 1998, a 28-year-old male dump truck driver (the victim) died of injuries sustained when he was pinned between the dump bed and frame of his truck. On August 8, 1998, the West Virginia FACE Investigator was notified of the death by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources via a death certificate. On August 19, 1998, the WV FACE Investigator conducted an on site investigation of the incident. The investigator reviewed the incident with the county sheriff's department, local EMS, and city police. The victim's brother, who also worked for the company, was interviewed. The incident site was visited, but the dump truck involved in the fatality was unavailable for inspection and photography. Photographs within this report are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the vehicle involved in the incident. Other informational sources and contacts included: medical examiner's report, newspaper articles, National Truck Manufacturers Association, an accredited Auto-Diesel College, two West Virginia-based dump bed manufacturers and repair shops, a West Virginia dump truck distribution and repair business, a heavy hauling company, and the West Virginia Division of Highways.
The employer in this incident was a heavy truck repair and hauling company that had been in business for seven years and employed six employees. None of the employees were present the evening of the incident. Typically, the truck drivers were responsible for their own truck's maintenance, defined by the company as; oil changes, grease jobs, etc. Repair, such as disassembly, was the responsibility of one of the company's mechanics.
There was no formal company written safety program or company, site, and task specific safety training. The employer did indicate that on-the-job warnings were used when the employer felt it was necessary. In fact, it was reported that the victim's father had warned the victim numerous times to chock, block or support elevated dump beds. The employer had not previously been cited by OSHA.
The victim's job at the time of the incident was driving and hauling. During the winter months, he assisted the mechanics. The victim had been working for the employer five years when the incident occurred. The victim was a graduate of an accredited Auto-Diesel College. The college offered 48-weeks of 65% hands-on training including two 62.5 clock hour modules dealing with Heavy Truck Preventative Maintenance and Inspection and Hydraulic Principles and Practices, respectively.
INVESTIGATION
At approximately 7:00 a.m., on the victim began his hauling operations. He was driving a 1989 GMC Brigadier tri-axle dump truck. The company was the second owner and had owned the vehicle for the past five years. The company did not have an owner's manual for the truck.
Typically, the dump bed system consisted of a hydraulic fluid reservoir, a pneumatically controlled PTO driven hydraulic pump, a single action telescoping hydraulic hoist cylinder, various hydraulic lines, and a 20-ton capacity steel dump body. It is estimated that the empty dump body alone weighed between four and six thousand pounds. The body could be raised from the cab using a lever which operated the pneumatic valve allowing the hydraulic pump to deliver fluid to the telescoping hoist which in turn raised the dump body. The body could be lowered via the same control valve which simply allowed the fluid to drain from the hydraulic cylinder back into the fluid reservoir. Hydraulic hoist cylinder and fatal injury site were located directly behind the truck's cab. See figure below.
Hydraulic hoist cylinder located directly behind the truck's cab.
Dump body systems are usually equipped with a pull-off cable. A pull-off cable is a section of wire rope which runs along the truck's frame from the pneumatically controlled hydraulic valve to the rear portion of the dump bed. See figures below.
Pull-off cables are designed to override the lever control in the cab and shut off the fluid delivery to the hoist cylinder during raising operations thereby limiting the angle of the raised bed to approximately 45 degrees from the horizontal. This prevents overextending the hydraulic cylinder. Overextending the cylinder can place great stress on the piston within. Often the pistons will become deformed which can lead to binding, thereby causing the dump bed to stick during empty bed operations such as lowering after unloading. In addition, raising loaded dump beds beyond 45 degrees can lead to possible vehicle up ending. This vehicle no longer had the pull-off cable intact. The employer was unaware that it had been equipped with one.
The vehicle was typically equipped with a safety body prop which is used to support the body in the elevated position when empty. See figures below.
The safety body prop was present, but not used, during this fatal incident. It was reported that on prior occasions the empty elevated dump body stuck in the elevated position. Earlier that day, the victim needed assistance from an end-loader in order to lower the empty dump body which had stuck in the raised position. The end loader bucket was lowered in the back of the dump body to force it down.
Just prior to the incident, the victim had finished hauling for the day. He returned to the shop at approximately 6:30 p.m. Reportedly, all of the shop bays were occupied at the time, so he pulled his truck around back and parked it. Evidence suggests that he began an inspection process in order to determine why the dump body system was malfunctioning. He elevated the dump body and then attempted to lower the body using the standard method of doing so via the control within the cab. The dump body stuck in an elevated position as it had on previous occasions. When the body would not return to its lowered position, he left the control valve in the down position and exited the cab. The victim did not engage the truck's safety body prop. The victim also did not use other means of chocking the body, such as heavy timber. With the dump body being supported by the unwanted binding of the hydraulic hoist alone, the victim then climbed up on top of the truck frame placing himself directly behind the cab of the truck. He may have thought that the control valve within the cab was not in the down position and therefore the hoist would remain in that position. His position was such that he was directly behind the cab, standing or sitting on the truck frame with the elevated dump body above his head. The victim was in the beginning stages of attempting to free the stuck dump body by attaching one end of a binder chain on the dump body and had experienced compression asphyxiation as a result of being local EMS then transported the victim to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. The coroner estimated the time from injury to death to be minutes.
CAUSE OF DEATH
The medical examiner's report listed the immediate cause of death as compression asphyxiation.
RECOMMENDATIONS/DISCUSSION
Recommendation #1: Employers should ensure that before making inspections, adjustments, or repairs, strong, heavy, positive supports are used to hold the dump body from inadvertently lowering.
Discussion: In this incident, the victim was working on a truck whose dump bed was elevated and then placed himself under the elevated dump bed without protection. OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1926.600(a)(3)(i) requires that dump bodies and similar equipment shall be fully lowered or blocked when being repaired or when not in use.1 Correctly chocking or blocking the raised bed would have prevented this incident by preventing and/or arresting the energy source before contacting the victim.
Recommendation #2: accessed an unsafe piece of equipment (dump bed system with a malfunctioning hoist) using an unsafe method to accomplish a task (not utilizing engineering controls and safe work practices). Training in the hazards associated with the work environment, and in particular, those hazards associated with working around both functioning and malfunctioning dump body systems and task-specific safety procedures for working on both functioning and malfunctioning dump body systems via a comprehensive safety program, would have given the victim the knowledge necessary to recognize and avoid a hazardous situation. For example, detailed explanations on the how and why dump bodies will suddenly lower and the precautions necessary to avoid this hazard should be part of the company training program.
Recommendation #3: Employers should develop and implement a preventative maintenance program which includes, but is not limited to, pre-shift inspections of all of the vehicle's operational systems and safety devices and the correction of identified defects prior to placing vehicle in service.
Discussion: In this incident, the dump bed system displayed a history of malfunctioning and binding. In addition, the vehicle was operated for a prolonged period of time without a pull-off cable, which ultimately may have caused the hydraulic hoist to malfunction. A comprehensive preventative maintenance program which included pre-shift inspections of all vehicle operational systems and safety devices and an ongoing company policy of pulling defective vehicles from service and repairing before further use may have prevented this incident. OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1926.601(b)(10) requires that all vehicles in use shall be checked at the beginning of each shift to assure that parts, equipment, and accessories are in safe operating condition and free from apparent damage that could cause failure while in use, including operating controls and safety devices.1
Recommendation #4: Manufacturers should provide end users with a comprehensive dump bed system owner's manual, including, but not limited to, the proper inspection and maintenance of the system and the safe work practices concerning system inspection and maintenance.
Discussion: Dump trucks are produced by dump bed manufacturers who acquire the truck as a bare framed vehicle. The dump body itself is then manufactured on site. The remaining components such as the hydraulic hoist, hydraulic pump, controls and lines are purchased from various manufacturers, and the dump bed system is then assembled. The dump bed manufacturers and distributors contacted during this investigation (including the manufacturer of victim's truck) indicated that, at the present time, they do not provide an owner's manual with their product. Furthermore, the hydraulic hoist manufacturer's manual concerning operation and maintenance is also not provided to the end user unless requested. Proper maintenance schedules are included in the above manual to insure smooth and safe operation as well as important safety recommendations. For example, one hoist manufacturer's manual states, "Before making adjustments or repairs to the cylinder when mounted in a unit, use strong, heavy, positive supports to hold the body from accidentally lowering."2 Information transfer is a key element in preventative maintenance as well as controlling the potential hazards associated with the person/machine interface. Having proper information concerning both hoist preventative maintenance and dump bed system safety may have prevented this incident.
Recommendation #5: Manufacturers should consider re-engineering current body prop systems so they provide a full range of protection during all phases of inspection and preventative maintenance operations.
Discussion: Strong, heavy, positive supports are provided by dump bed manufacturers in the form of body props. Body props are non-adjustable and will support the dump body at one position only, which is close to maximum elevated dump angle. Therefore, the need to inspect and/or work on the dump bed at an angle other than the one provided by the body prop places the burden of design and implementation of alternative protection on the employer and the person doing the work. See figures below.
The above methods and materials represent various after-market attempts to provide protection.
It should be noted that those distributors and repair shops contacted during the investigation indicated that the body props are often not used and commonly found rusted in the position of storage. This may in part be due to the fact that many necessary procedures are out of the body prop's scope of application. For example, one hoist manufacturer recommends that the plunger end pin mountings located in the upper portion of the dump bed body be greased regularly. 2 These mountings would be close to 15 feet above the ground when using the body prop as provided. See figures below.
As was stated earlier this may have been in part why the victim placed himself under the elevated dump bed without protection. Manufacturers should consider adjustable body props and/or positioning an additional prop located closer to the cab thereby allowing a greater range of integral protection. Having had the ability to conveniently prop the bed at any point during the inspection process may have prevented the fatal energy from contacting the victim.

In the Guardian, Nafeez Ahmed raises seven points in defense of the Shakhova hypothesis advanced as “likely” by Whiteman, Hope and Wadhams in a notorious Nature comment, and criticized here and elsewhere.
Specifically, Mr. Ahmed writes in response to Chris Colose’s thorough and meticulous analysis of Shakhova’s excessive claims.
I had an interesting Twitter exchange with Ahmed, which contains the following messages:
me: @NafeezAhmed no the ESAS “methane bomb” event is as close to impossible as anything in earth science can be; actual geophysics refutes it.
NA: .@mtobis lol, really? I guess that’s y major scientific review of the issue in Review of Geophysics says catastrophic methane rls plausible
me: @NafeezAhmed ref pls? I believe you may be conflating issues.
NA: Ref is linked here …
me: @NafeezAhmed If you think “carbon releases from Arctic permafrost …between 50-100 Gt this century” supports Shakhova you need a new beat.
and (perhaps more agressively than was warranted) me: @NafeezAhmed illustrates my claim that science matters and that very few non-scientist journalists can report on science effectively.
so I softened it with me: I’m sure you are a nice guy and I share your view that I’m a nasty old SOB. But I’m right on this, and you aren’t.
This exchange went on further, quite a bit longer than a Twitter conversation comfortably supports. Twitter is no place to hash these sorts of things out. As everyone was getting frustrated, Nafeez Ahmed ended:
NA: @CColose @Perwis @PeterGleick @IdiotTracker @mtobis so wiil wait 4 critique response showing my 7 facts r factoids
And given that Mr. Ahmed has a prominent platform, he is indeed due this much.
IN DEFENSE OF MY SNARK
Before I take on his 7 points in detail let me defend my snark.
Ahmed refers in the Twitter exchange to a paper in Rev Geophys, suggesting that Arctic thawing may release in excess of 50 GT of C, a very serious matter, amounting to something like 10% of our remaining margin to a best-guess warming around the best-guess dangerous threshhold of 2 C. This is in keeping with my prior understanding, and make no mistake, it is very bad news – it amounts to more than 50 billion tons MORE of fossil fuel that needs to be left in the ground for a given level of damage.
But Ahmed refers to the paper in support of a very different assertion, that 50 GT of methane would be released. It’s commonly assumed as a rule of thumb that an abrupt methane release is from 20 to 70 times worse per molecule than the same amount of carbon released as CO2. So if true this would be very serious business indeed. 50 billion tons of methane would plausibly be civilization-ending and a massive extinction event. But the paper to which he points triumphantly says nothing of the sort.
So I conclude that he doesn’t really know what he is talking about. Specifically he has already shown that he is confused about the distinction between methane releases and CO2 releases, something that someone on the climate beat ought to be clear about.
THE MAIN ISSUE WITH THE CLATHRATE BOMB SCENARIO
The fact that there’s a lot of methane under the sea floor is not in dispute. The question is whether there is a way to destabilize a whole lot of it at once.
In order to justify this, Shakhova points to a possibility that some clathrates remain in the frozen phase even though they are at an unstable depth. This can occur if they are encased in water ice. A few nodules of this configuration have been identified, ironically because they are a threat to oil rigs, but they have NEVER been observed in the East Siberian sea, and it’s a long way from a few ounces to fifty billion tons. If fifty billion tons of the stuff were distributed just below the sea floor, the scenario proposed would not be wholly implausible. But there is no evidence of anything remotely like that, and no mechanism whereby it might exist.
Anything which does not directly defend the existence of a large deposit of clathrates existing for millennia at pressures where they ought to have long since disintegrated is not a serious defense of the clathrate bomb scenario. And none of Ahmed’s points address this.
THE SEVEN POINTS
Most of the seven points betray fundamental confusion about clathrates. The lay reader should not be expected to understand these a priori; it is the reporter’s job to elucidate them. But to do so, the reporter has to gain some understanding of the material. Sadly, Ahmed betrays little understanding, though he does have the wit to troll the literature for items which superficially support his unease about methane.
1. The 50 Gigatonne decadal methane pulse scenario was posited by four Arctic specialists, and is considered plausible by Met Office scientists
Whether we should be acknowledging the “Arctic specialists” as actually expert is, frankly, the question at hand.
So what about “is considered plausible by Met Office scientists”? This was exactly the point of contention on Twitter. Ahmed has conflated CO2 and methane.
VERDICT: conflation and confusion
2. Arctic methane hydrates are becoming increasingly unstable in the context of anthropogenic climate change and it’s impact on diminishing sea ice
In support, aside from an article in EOS (more a newsmagazine for scientists than a journal) we see a quote from a peer reviewed journal:
“… causing the liberation of methane from decomposing hydrate… If this process becomes widespread along Arctic continental margins, tens of Teragrams of methane per year could be released into the ocean.”
But tens of teragrams is about two orders of magnitude too low to make a difference.
Further, as evidence that the emissions are a consequence of recent climate change rather than part of the background climate, Ahmed offers:
“… has led about 10 expeditions in the Laptev Sea but during the 1990s he did not detect any elevated levels of methane. However, since 2003 he reported a rising number of methane ‘hotspots’, which have now been confirmed using more sensitive instruments.”
Identifying the clear fallacy here is left as an exercise for the reader.
VERDICT: obscure references, confusion about quantities, unwarranted extrapolation
3. Multiple scientific reviews, including one by over 20 Arctic specialists, confirm decadal catastrophic Arctic methane release is plausible
A couple of reviews do give some support to this, but are vague about time scales. The DOE report specifically.”
To emphasize: “The risk of a rapid increase in [methane] emissions is real but remains largely unquantified.”
There is a very wide gap between a rapid increase (which, again, everybody believes possible) and the 50 GT CH4 scenario, because the current release is orders of magnitude less than gigatons per year. That leaves plenty of room for acceleration without hitting the cataclysmic level. Further, this evidence doesn’t support the immediacy of that scenario at all.
VERDICT: While this is the best supported of the seven points, it is far from rising to the occasion on quantities or time scales, and does not in any way support the idea of a large deposit of unstable clathrates near the sea floor.
4. Current Arctic methane levels are unprecedented
Yes, they are at the high end of the instrumental record, but they are not climbing rapidly.
Despite NOAA scientist Dr Dlugokencky‘s reassurances that current Arctic methane emission levels are nothing to be “alarmed” about, his own data shows that Arctic methane levels were 1850 ppb in yr 2000, rising up to 1890 ppb in 2012.
Oh please, this is just silly. A 2 % increase in 12 years, assuming it’s not just measurement noise or random variation,will not get us to a ten thousand per cent increase very quickly.
VERDICT: Hype
5. The tipping point for continuous Siberian permafrost thaw could be as low as 1.5C
In support of this:.”
Yes, this is definitely on the table. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with undersea methane.
VERDICT: Confusion and conflation again.
6. Arctic conditions during the Eemian interglacial lasting from 130,000 to 115,000 years ago are a terrible analogy for today’s Arctic
This is plausible as it stands, but as a response to Chris Colose it is terrible, because Colose is not relying on the Eemian but on the early Holocene as the analogous period. So the refutation is strictly a strawman.
This is backed up by a meandering quote from “Prof” Paul Beckwith, the “Professor Beckwith” who is a grad student at Ottawa U. The one who predicted in May of this year that all the Arctic sea ice would vanish this year. He is a gloomy Gus indeed, but his track record isn’t all that impressive.
VERDICT: straw man
7.Paleoclimate records will not necessarily capture a large, abrupt methane pulse
Now, we swing back to saying that it HAS occurred in the recent geological past, indeed at the time which Colose says is the better analogy. In evidence (evidence which in point 6 were implied to be nonexistent) there is a paper referring specifically to a biotic feedback, and NOT clathrate-related.
VERDICT: self-contradiction, confusion and conflation
PANTS ON FIRE
I am pleased to report, based on knowledge which by happenstance I had before the current controversy, that the specific mechanism Shakhova threatens us with is implausible in the extreme. I am pleased to report that no plausible different mechanism which could rapidly release this enormous quantity of methane has been proposed either. I base the second claim on the fact that people have been casting about for one, and in the end not come up with any.
There is a serious caveat that 50 GT or more of carbon dioxide (CO2) (as opposed to methane (CH4)) may well be released as a consequence of Arctic thawing. CO2 is, though much more common and much longer-lived in the system, less dangerous by weight than methane. But 50 GT is a very large quantity even of CO2. As such, it is a big enough and uncertain enough term that it is a real threat. But it is not a guaranteed catastrophe like the Shakhova hypothesis, and not relevant to it. That Ahmed repeatedly refers to it interchangeably with the Shakhova scenario is telling.
SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS HAS BEEN REACHED
* Gavin Schmidt has been quoted saying “The scenario they used is so unlikely as to be completely pointless talking about,””
* In the same article, David Archer, a coauthor of the first papers on the global clathrate inventory, is more subdued but argues in the same direction:
.”
* Chris Colose:
 direc.”
* Andy Skuce:
.”
* in short, Gavin Schmidt again:
“There is still no evidence of actual (thermodynamically unstable) shallow hydrates on ESAS. Sorry, but I’m not buying it.”
* A comment by Nisbet et al is being submitted to Nature
Clearly large individual events can and probably will occur in the near future, such as major pockmark bursts and perhaps massive submarine landslides on hydrate, while local bubbling may be widespread on shelf seas. But even with such events the geological record shows that the total decadal hydrate-sourced methane reaching the atmosphere is very unlikely to exceed 1 Gt, and may be far less than that. After millennia of cold, Late Glacial hydrates were probably more abundant and more rapidly destabilized by marine transgression and warming than will be the case in the current rapid Arctic warming. A 50 Gt decadal release, at a rate ~100x greater that during glacial/postglacial transitions, is thus improbably large.
WHY DOES THIS MATTER
For those of us trying to cope with public denial, this offers us a case that we can study without having our usual frustrations color our judgment. There is no better way to understand the creation of zombie pseudo-facts among the opponents of climate policy than to see an instance among its supporters.
The key question is why Ahmed is clinging to his illusion about what science says quite so steadfastly. A follow-up essay will relate this to the question of “postnormal”, i.e., politically salient science. Science as normally practiced quietly ignores unsupportable arguments. Political commentary picks them up with a vengeance. In practice we end up with one reasonably harmonious scientific community which makes ordinary progress in the ordinary way, and a public which perceives fringe players as key, and two competing communities at war over a contested hypothesis.
We need journalists who have the ability to make actual judgments. Difference splitting is not the only way to get this wrong. Aligning with a political position and judging evidence on its congruence with that politics is another. There is false symmetry about science, but it results from a real symmetry about political reporting which is indifferent to balancing evidence.
I have no opinions about Nafeez Ahmed outside this incident. In this case he has bet on the wrong horse. This is not without precedent, and people make mistakes. But the tenacity and relative incoherence of his defense is harder to forgive.
UPDATE
Nafeez Ahmed responds. Or tries to, anyway. I respond to his response briefly. I don’t think he’s really changed the balance of evidence on the question.
UPDATE 2: UPDATE: Nafeez has withdrawn his support for the Shakhova scenario. I have verified that it is him via his Twitter account.
I hope you'll take it as a good sign that everything you're writing here reflects my understanding of those questions and the overall situation exactly. Another paradigm like that to my mind has always been James Lovelock's.
Thanks for this, Michael.
One niggle is that when you say: "It’s commonly assumed as a rule of thumb that an abrupt methane release is from 20 to 70 times worse per molecule than the same amount of carbon released as CO2." You should have said "20 to 70 times worse per unit mass". (A CO2 molecule is 2.75 heavier than a methane molecule and those GWP factors are expressed in terms of mass.)
It's a pity that so much science discussion goes on in semi-private, at conferences and in informal exchanges, yet that largely goes unreported to the general public, who have to rely on journalists (who are usually under-qualified, overworked and underpaid). I suppose that science blogs help fill that gap somewhat, but I suspect that, even there, scientists are reluctant to write opinions that they would freely disclose over coffee or beer. There really is a need for more scientific discussion at a level somewhere between the formality of journal articles and the informality of gossip.
> The key question is why Ahmed is clinging to his illusion about what science says quite so steadfastly
Because he has nothing else. He has written his post as though he was an expert, or at least as someone who knew what he was talking about. Confessing that he was completely wrong - which is what you're asking for; that he admit he has based this all on a paper he was unable to evaluate by people whose expertise he was unable to evaluate - would leave his credibility definitively shredded. So his best bet (in terms of his career, of course; he isn't worried or even very interested in truth) is to bluff it out. He's got a pulpit in the Graun, and you haven't. Anyone with a clue on this issue knows NA clueless, but that's a very small set of people. He'll just move on to the next issue. Or perhaps keep bluffing on this one: who knows?
Pingback: Arctic methane ‘time bomb’ could have huge economic costs? – Stoat
" best-guess dangerous threshhold of 2 C"
I wish people wouldn't keep repeating that as if it had the slightest factual basis.
It has a sort of one - it's very difficult to think about this problem without a target, and this target is an intuitive/political compromise between economic and environmental risk.
My guess is that it will shift to 3 C soon enough, because we missed the boat on 2, not because 2 was ever all that safe.
The point is that whatever the final outcome, extra carbon makes it harder for a given damage level, or more damage for a given effort level.
On communication, see David Roberts (a week ago about pulling up a bar stool, and lots else). I'm not sure he's going to survive his withdrawal, tweeting like mad!
This is a bit OT, but since I'm here:
The illustration implies magic thinking, but I think it goes too far to imply ideas about methane have a parallel in followerrs of the Kabbalah (Alastair Crowley like). I have tried to ignore it, but it is typical of the kind of exaggeration that is getting us all into trouble.
It's just that it has seven points - that's the only link, and the image is pretty. All the "pants on fire" images I could get away with were ugly.
ot alert: I had a lovely time checking out comments on Stoat. Always refreshing to see some properly directed snark though the infestation of unreason even intrudes there.
yes, we will have to wait on events, possibly a year or more ... I think pants on fire is too extreme but have (mostly) desisted on the subject for the time being. imnhso the infighting is giving people wanting a target to shoot at the wrong bullseye.
Meanwhile, I found this while looking for something else:
"MIRTHE / CEE Team Measures Methane Emissions in Northern Alaska"
William: Anyone with a clue on this issue knows NA clueless, but that’s a very small set of people. He’ll just move on to the next issue. Or perhaps keep bluffing on this one: who knows?
You were right the first time, he moved on. Specifically, in his latest Guardian piece, he claims that the US motivation to attack Syria is because of gas. The gas in question is, naturally, methane, not Sarin.
There are lots of references, as usual, and I hope that somebody checks them out, because I'm not going`to.
It's not infighting as far as the scientific community is concerned; it's only made to look like infighting by the outsiders. In this way it is similar to denialist pseudoscience.
The swath of the public and the press it targets is different, but the methodology is similar. That's why it's important.
That in turn is why science cannot be simply cut out of the public conversation, much as we all, most scientists included, wish it could be. Detecting junk science is, in the end, not a trivial or easily acquired skill.

He's a journalist; their credibility is regularly shredded, but such is the modern news media, even in the grauniad, that that is irrelevant to their employment. In fact creating more controversy is usually better for them, since more page hits and more angry letters to the editor are a good thing nowadays.

Thank you MT.
The scary-talkers seem to mostly quit mentioning the fundamental assumption (that "shallow" "metastable" "hydrates" exist and in large quantity. Over time, those terms fade out of their blog posts.
If only they'd understand how the volume numbers become very different when those assumptions change.
If there's such a clathrate, then a liter of clathrate turns into 150, 160, or more liters of methane.
If there's no clathrate, then a liter of sediment or permafrost contains less than a liter of methane.
This seems rather like assuming every pressure cooker is a bomb,
then urging panic because department store shelves and mail order catalogs are FULL of them.

The key feature of the BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X is clearly the Hi-Fi audio components. Since the remainder of the board is nearly identical to the BIOSTAR TZ77XE4 we didn’t focus on the overall system performance that we normally do as there is no significant difference. We did do some internal testing to verify this, but we wanted to maintain the focus of today on the audio performance. With that being hear differences with our audio setup. That is one of the issues with reviewing audio features as it is subjective and is dependent on the speakers and environment that you are in. This boards audio solution supports 192kHz 24-bit sample playback, a 7.1-speaker setup and is THX certified. If you use your PC for a home theater system and/or an audiophile then the Hi-Fi Z777X should be on your short list of boards for that next system build.
While we wanted to keep the focus of today on the audio performance, we couldn’t live with ourselves if we didn’t include one of the staples of benchmarking. 3DMark 11 can be a very good indicator of the gaming aptitude of the overall system. The BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X was able to bring home a score of P5210 (performance Preset) and X1635 (Extreme Preset). Both of these scores were just a fuzz behind the BIOSTAR flagship TZ77XE4 Intel Z77 motherboard but well within any margin of error. The performance preset was only 1.5% behind while the Extreme preset was even closer with only a .8% difference. Neither of the two score differences are enough to be concerned about though. Overall I would call the BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X a very capable motherboard when it comes to gaming.
We were pleased to see that we were actually able to see a measurable performance difference between the BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X and the BIOSTAR TZ77XE4. When we first started looking at the BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X, we were nothing short of shocked when we realized that it was using the same audio codec that we saw on the BIOSTAR TZ77XE4. The differences lie in the sub components for the audio. We were happy to see that the BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X lives up to it’s ‘Hi-Fi’ monicker and was able to outperform the vanilla Realtek ALC898 High Definition Audio Codec onboard the TZ77XE4 in our audio testing.
Overall I have to admit that I am quite impressed with the BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X, especially when you factor in the price! The BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X is currently available for only $149.99 +$7.56 shipping. As always, BIOSTAR has you covered if you should happen to have an issue with your board. The BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X is backed by a three year warranty and you can find the details here.
The BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X earns our innovation award for taking integrated motherboard audio to the next level! We also like that BIOSTAR plans on rolling out the Hi-Fi technology on both AMD and Intel boards for the foreseeable future. BIOSTAR has raised the bar in terms of what consumers can expect in terms of mainstream audio performance and quality and we like that! BIOSTAR might not have been the first to have a specialized board for audio, but they are the first to go this far and on numerous boards.
Legit Bottom Line: If you are looking for a better audio solution without breaking the bank, the BIOSTAR Hi-Fi Z77X is a great option for you.8:26 PM PT: My five-year-old (translated): "It was fun when Obama won and everyone yelled 'wooo', it was just like a roller coaster!"

What does the term "bill of sale" mean? What is the definition of the term "bill of sale"?
A "bill of sale" is a document that shows that an asset has been transferred from one party to another, and that the seller's conditions (usually the receipt of money) for the transfer have been fulfilled.
A bill of sale will normally include:
1. Details of the asset
2. Names and signatures from both the seller and purchaser
3. Amount of money that changed hands
4. Date of the sale
5. Location of the sale

NoneANSWER: John the Baptist, the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth, was Jesus' cousin through Mary (Luke 1:36).
His life was unusual, even from before his conception. While performing his priestly duties in the temple, Zacharias was visited by an angel which said Elizabeth would conceive and bear a son named John. When Zacharias expressed doubt because of his and Elizabeth's advanced age, the angel struck him dumb until the baby was named (verses 5 - 13).
The custom, in those days, was to name a son after his father, or a near relative. Zacharias had little choice: accept the name his relatives chose, and remain mute for the rest of his life, or name him as the angel said, and have his tongue untied. Even though John was an unusual name in the family, Zacharias wisely gave it to his son (verses 59 - 64).
John's life would certainly be unique. He would be a Nazarite from birth and be filled with God's holy spirit even while he was in the womb (verse 15). And he would be a special prophet who would prepare the way for the Messiah (verse 76). As he grew into manhood he began to lived in the wilderness, away from the cities (Luke 1:80). His clothing was rough, and his diet was strict (Matthew 3:4; Mark 1:6).
Why did he choose to live with wild animals in the wilderness, rather than in the safety of the cities? It was not likely his choice, but as the holy spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness (Mark 1:12), the spirit likely sent him there as well. Luke 3:2 says much about this. Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests, and to become a priest in the temple John would have tutored under them. But God wanted him to have the pure teachings, so God's message came to him supernaturally, away from the temple priests' influence.
One commentator wrote, " . . . he was not brought up in the schools of the prophets, nor in the academies of the Jews, or at the feet of any of their Rabbins and doctors; that it might appear he was not taught and sent of men, but of God." The Jamieson, Faucett, and Brown commentary agrees when it states " . . . free from rabbinical influences and alone with God, his spirit would be educated, like Moses in the desert, for his future high vocation."
Returning to Gill's notes we read, " . . . and that it might be clear he had no knowledge of, nor correspondence with Jesus, whose forerunner he was, and of whom he was to bear testimony."
If John had no knowledge of, nor correspondence with Jesus, it had to be through the holy spirit that he was able to assert that he was the lamb of God (John 1:29, 36). Later he spoke out against king Herod, warning him his marriage to his sister-in-law was unlawful (Mark 6:17 - 18). For this, he ended up in prison.
After learning that John the Baptist had been incarcerated in Galilee Jesus left for the area (Matthew 4:5 - 12). What few people who study the Bible realize is that, although the Baptist had proclaimed Jesus as the lamb of God, he had not personally witnessed any of his miracles. The Jews in the first century were expecting a Messiah who would free them from Roman control. Jesus' mission had nothing to do with gaining Judea's independence so, in prison, John had time to think and entertain doubts. He began to hear about the works of Christ, and may have wondered why Christ did not deliver him. Eventually, he sent two of his disciples to ask a few questions (Matthew 11:1 - 3) of Jesus. The answer they took back with them was to-the-point.
". . . tell him what you hear and have seen for yourself, that the blind and lame and lepers and deaf are healed, the dead are raised up, and the poor hear the good news of God's kingdom. Happy is he who has no doubts about me." (Matthew 11:4 - 6)
All this was heard by the people who surrounded them. They must have had some doubts about John, since he sent emissaries to question Jesus. But Jesus had no such doubts. He asked them what they went out into the wilderness to see: a weak, spineless person shaken by every wind of doctrine? Or a man in soft clothing? If that is what they expected, they were mistaken. And one has to wonder whether Jesus' next statement was a jab at Herod. He said, "Those who wear silks and satins are in kings' houses " (verses 7 - 8).
Realizing that some of the people went to see a prophet, Jesus commended John the Baptist to them saying he was more than a prophet (verse 9). He was the one Malachi spoke about (Malachi 3:1) who would prepare the way for the Savior.A.
No illnesses were reported in either case, but dozens of Senate workers were being monitored and work in the Senate slowed to a crawl.
Health experts expressed optimism that casualties would be averted in the new attack. None of the dozens of congressional employees who were near the Tennessee Republican's office on Monday when the white powder was discovered was believed to be sick.
"As each minute ticks by, we are less and less concerned about the health effects," said Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The ricin-laced letter addressed to the White House had been detected at an offsite mail processing facility, the law enforcement official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The investigation into that letter continues, and there have been no arrests, the official said. Authorities determined the letter posed no threat to health because of the ricin's low potency and granular form.
On Capitol Hill, all three Senate office buildings were shut on Tuesday and could be closed the rest of the week.
That included the Dirksen Senate Office Building, where the substance was found Monday afternoon by a young worker in Frist's fourth-floor mailroom. A sign stating "Closed" hung from one of Dirksen's main doors. Yellow sheets cordoned off areas inside.
The Capitol building — where heavy security and a persistent case of nerves have reigned since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 — was closed to tourists.
Frist and others said tests overnight showed the substance was ricin, a natural and potent poison made by refining castor beans.
Health officials urged Senate staff to watch for swiftly developing fever, coughs or fluid in the lungs over the next two or three days. When inhaled in sufficient quantities or injected, ricin can be fatal — and there is no known vaccine or cure.
Frist's offices in Tennessee were also closed as investigators checked mail there, said Frist spokesman Nick Smith.
In Washington, senators gave many aides the day off and brought others to work in small Capitol offices the lawmakers normally use as private hideaways.
The FBI and other agencies were conducting other tests. At Fort Detrick, Md., Army scientists were using electron microscopes to determine the size of the ricin's particles — crucial to determining whether any of it may have been inhaled.
Senate leaders made a show of calm and control. They said they had refined their ability to respond to emergencies since the anthrax attacks of late 2001 with better communications and coordination.
"Things are going very well, not perfectly, but very, well," said Frist, a medical doctor who has advised Capitol colleagues about potential terror attacks through the mail ever since the anthrax letters of late 2001.
Frist said 16 potentially exposed staff workers had been quarantined Monday night and decontaminated with showers. But Senate aides, including at least one who was quarantined, said the figure was 40 to 50, including about 10 Capitol police officers and aides to Frist, Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
At a briefing for reporters, Frist said there was not yet information on how dangerous this sample of ricin powder was. Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said tests of air filters showed the chemical had not been circulated through the buildings' ventilation systems.
But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., emerging from a lunch where Frist, Capitol police chief Terrance Gainer and Capitol physician John Eisold briefed Republican senators, said the three had expressed concern.
"There was something specific about this that made them worry," Graham said. "Somebody knew what they were doing. ... Frist said the type, the way it was presented indicated that people understood it goes into the air and gets into lungs."
There were also questions raised about how effectively senators and aides were told about the attack and the potential jeopardy they faced.
"We weren't notified promptly enough yesterday," said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who said one of his aides worked well into the evening in the Dirksen building. "But that's OK, people make mistakes."
One aide who was quarantined — which did not occur until 6:30 Monday evening — said many coworkers had already gone home. This aide said those quarantined were asked to telephone colleagues who had left and tell them to shower and put their clothes in a bag.
Frist and police chief Gainer said investigators were still uncertain which, if any, piece of mail the ricin had come from. Gainer said officials had not yet found any "visible threat," such as a menacing letter. The ricin was found on a device that opens mail, authorities said.
Workers began retrieving mail from all Senate and House offices as authorities worried that contaminated mail may have been sent to other lawmakers. In October 2001, anthrax-tainted letters were mailed to then-Senate Majority Leader Daschle and to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
Officials said there was no evidence of ricin elsewhere in the Capitol complex, though as a precaution the postal facility that processes Congress' mail was shut. In 2001, two postal workers in Washington were among five people who died from anthrax exposure.
Across the Capitol, the House conducted business as usual. Senate leaders decided to hold no votes and canceled all committee hearings, though senators trooped to the chamber floor to debate a highway bill.
"Terrorist attacks and criminal acts of this kind won't stop the work of the Senate or the Congress as we have important work to be done," said Daschle.- Filed Under

FACEBOOK + LINKSEL CAJON, Calif. – The San Diego Christian Baseball team used late inning heroics to sweep the double header and series from Arizona Christian on Saturday.
Trailing 8-2 after the fourth inning in Game 2, the Hawks scored seven unanswered runs, including two in the bottom of the seventh for the victory.
Arizona Christian took the lead scoring six runs in the top of the fourth to give them the six run lead. Two 3-run homers accounted for the huge inning for Arizona Christian. Kenny Zuvela and Seth Neely powered the charge off of reliever Codi Scanlon.
But the Hawks didn't give up and scored five runs in the bottom half of the inning. SDC scored all their runs with two outs. Christian Johnson batted in the first run as he singled up the middle to score Peter Hoyt. Chad Erickson then delivered a 2 RBI single to left field. A Jeff Lusardi double brought the fourth and fifth runs across in the inning to cap off the scoring.
Two and a half scoreless innings later, the Hawks had to score at least a run to force extra innings.
Lusardi led off the seventh with a bang—a solo blast to left field tied the game for the Hawks. Lusardi took the first pitch fastball from Firestorm starter Dean Jackson and hit it well clear of the fence.
The bench crowded Lusardi as he crossed the plate to appreciate his efforts.
Michael Stowers earned a walk as he showed discipline at the plate. Taylor Eichhorst was next who, previously, was 0-3 in the game. He ripped a double to left field as Stowers was on his horse from the get go. A strong throw from left fielder Geoff MacDonald was not on time as Stowers scored from first for the Game 2 win and sweep. Steven Bunnell was credited with the win, his first of the season. He went 3.2 innings after taking Scanlon's place.
J.T Cox relieved starter Dean Jackson but failed to record an out as his only batter he faced was Eichhorst.
Erickson went 4-for-4 in the second game with 3 RBI and two runs. Lusardi went 2-for-4 with 3 RBI and a run, scoring on his solo shot.
Game 1 was less on dramatics but the same result for the Hawks, a win.
SDC led after one inning as Lusardi drove in Gotta on a sac fly.
The Firestorm responded with two runs in the top of the second. Singles from Nick Hartman and Tanner Stokey gave Arizona Christian the 2-1 lead.
The Hawks answered with two runs in the fourth and sixth. SDC also scored three runs in the bottom of the seventh to take a 8-2 lead. The Firestorm scored three runs in the eighth to give the Hawks a scare but David Johnson nailed the ninth inning for the save. Starter Gabriel Hemmer lasted eight innings for his third win on the season. He allowed nine hits and five runs, all earned, while striking out eight. Johnson came in for his second save in as many games.
Lusardi finished the day with seven RBI in both games. Erickson went 6-for-8 at the dish.
With the wins, the Hawks improve to 13-3 and 7-2 in conference. The Firestorm drop to 3-9 overall and in conference play.
The Hawks are back on the field as they host Bethesda University on Tuesday. First pitch is scheduled for 2 p.m.We are the premiere supplier of Safariland holsters for Smith & Wesson 4513 TSW.

MAY 1997 ContentsI collected rocks as a little girl. Not like pet rocks, but pretty geodes and sparkly pyrite. My collection never really grew to its full potential, because like most kids, I moved on to another obsession, and another collection. (Although I guess I never really outgrew that phase, it’s just grown up and turned into Obsession Collections!) But, my love of druzy jewelry goes back to childhood and became a full on adult obsession last year when I fell in love with a Dara Ettinger necklace I saw at Urban Outfitters.
The Wikipedia definition of druzy: In geological usage druse or druzy is a coating of fine crystals on a rock fracture surface, vein or within a vug or geode. My definition: natural sparkly awesomeness.
I was inspired to finally write this post because while in the city this weekend, I saw some beautiful but majorly pricey pieces at Henri Bendel. And since I’m addicted to Etsy, I wanted to share a few shops selling some beautiful and affordable druzy jewelry! (Click the links or banners below to go to the shop!)

Moto2: Redding confident of title challenge
30 January 2013
Marc VDS Racing's Scott Redding says he expects to be in a position to mount a serious challenge for the Moto2 crown in 2013.
Redding is entering his fourth season in the class and although he is still chasing his maiden victory, the British rider enjoyed his best year in Moto2 in 2012, finishing on the podium four times.
And the 20-year-old has described the season ahead as a “critical” one for his career.
“My main goal for 2013 is to really fight for the championship,” said Redding in an official team video interview.
“In Moto2 this is my fourth year, and I feel like I should be at the top of my game now, I just turned 20 the beginning of this month, so this year for me is really critical and I want to make everything go absolutely perfect.
“My 2012 season went really well and I think it was a number of things really.
“The chassis was a real big one, also getting to know the team more, everyone working together really well, all the little things came together, which made 2012 my best season yet,” he added.
“I had a couple of highlights in the 2012 season. One was Silverstone with the battle with [Marc] Márquez. We had also in Phillip Island a good race there.
“At a number of races we had some good highlights through the whole weekend and this is what made it a good season for me.”
Redding feels achieving the breakthrough to earn his first Moto2 victory will be tough, but the Kalex rider is focused on scaling the top step for the first time in 2013.
“The podium situation with me…I got the first podiums, but just struggling to get that first win.
“I think the first one's always the hardest. Going into the 2013 season I want to go as soon as I can to the top step.
.”
The Gloucestershire rider was linked to a MotoGP ride with Ducati following a successful test on a factory GP12 at Mugello last summer, but lost out as Ben Spies and Andrea Iannone joined the satellite Pramac outfit.
"Testing a Ducati in Mugello in 2012 was a good idea to do, so I knew how the bikes were, the power, and everything,” said Redding.
“Lap times were pretty good, but like I say I missed out a little bit for this year to go on a MotoGP bike, but I think all the things were in line to stay where I am.”

HAWORTH, a chapelry, in the parish of Bradford, union of Keighley, wapentake of Morley, W. riding of York, 3 miles (S. W.) from Keighley; containing 6303 inhabitants. The chapelry is situated on the brow of a hill, in a high moorland district, extending on the west to the county of Lancaster, and comprises by computation 10,540 acres, of which nearly one-half is uncultivated heath. It comprehends the manors of Haworth, Oxenhope, and Stanbury. The surface is boldly varied, and the lower grounds are watered by rivulets descending from the moorland hills, and flowing through narrow valleys of romantic character. On the banks of these streams are numerous worsted-mills, in which the population is chiefly employed; many persons are engaged in the hand-loom weaving of worsted stuffs, and there is also an extensive cotton-mill. The village is of ancient origin, and has one spacious street, from which several smaller streets diverge. Fairs for cattle are held on Easter-Monday, and the Monday after Old Michaelmasday, and are well attended. The chapel, dedicated to St. Michael, appears to have been founded prior to the year 1317; it was rebuilt in the reign of Henry VII., and enlarged in 1755, and a gallery was added in 1779: it is a neat structure in the later English style, with a square embattled tower rising to the height of sixty feet. The living is a perpetual curacy; net income, £170, with a glebe-house; patrons, the Vicar of Bradford, and certain Trustees. A church district named Oxenhope was endowed in 1845 by the Ecclesiastical Commission; and a church has been erected at Stanbury, which is in the gift of the Incumbent of Haworth. There are places of worship for Baptists, Wesleyans, and Primitive Methodists. The free grammar school was founded by Charles Scott, who in 1638 built a school-house, and assigned lands now producing £90 per annum, for instructing children in the Greek and Latin classics; the trustees, in 1818, enlarged the schoolroom, and built a house for the master. There is also a school, with a house for a master, at Stanbury, built in 1815, by subscription, and endowed with £600 by John Holmes, Esq. On Crow Hill, the loftiest eminence in the chapelry, 1500 feet above the level of the sea, is a cromlech, evidently Druidical, consisting of one flat stone weighing about six tons, placed horizontally upon two huge upright blocks, now half embedded in the heather.

It formerly belonged to the Drury family, at whose ancient seat of Hawstead Place, now a farmhouse, Queen Elizabeth was entertained in one of her progresses, by Sir William Drury, at that time its proprietor. The estate of Hawstead Lodge was purchased in 1844, for £10,650, by Sir Thomas Cullum, Bart., of Hardwick House, whose family had sold it in 1744, just a century previous.

The village is about two miles from the sea, on the acclivity of a deep and richly-wooded glen called Hawthorn-Dean, through which a stream flows, between rocks of towering height, into a natural hythe or harbour, formed by the projection of a rock called the Skaw, and which might, at a moderate outlay, be formed into a secure haven. On the south side of this bay, which is called Hawthorn Hive, is a lofty eminence named Beacon Hill, whereon fires were formerly lighted to warn mariners of their danger; and on the north side is Hawthorn Cottage, built by Major Anderson, near the site of a former residence, erected by Admiral Milbank, and designated Sailors' Hall.

Here is a very extensive colliery, one of the largest in the county: the whole of the strata wrought in the St. Helen's coal-field, as it is designated, extend under this township, to the number of seventeen workable strata; the colliery has been in operation for a long period, and a sufficient quantity of coal yet remains to supply a very large demand for centuries. There is a patent-rope manufactory. The Newton station on the Liverpool and Manchester railway is three miles distant. Haydock Lodge, built by the late Col. Legh, at a cost of £70,000, is a handsome stone structure, seated in the midst of an extensive and picturesque park. It is now converted into a licensed lunatic asylum, for which its healthy situation, spacious grounds, and facilities of railway communication, render it peculiarly well adapted: it contains about 450 patients, and has a chaplain, a visiting physician, and a resident surgeon.

Haydon, or Heydon (St. Peter)
HAYDON, or HEYDON (St. Peter), a parish, in the union of Royston, hundred of Uttlesford, N. division of Essex, 6 miles (E. by S.) from Royston; containing 324 inhabitants. The manor was formerly held in two portions under two lords, of whom one held the basin and the other the towel at the coronation of the kings of England. The parish occupies the northwestern extremity of the county, and comprises 1239a. 2r. 25p., of which 1155 acres are arable, 70 pasture, and the remainder roads and waste. The surface is irregular, and the lands generally are among the highest of the district; the soil in some parts is thin and light, resting on chalk. The living is a rectory, with that of Little Chishall annexed, valued in the king's books at £18, and in the gift of Lord Braybrooke: the tithes have been commuted for £419. 7. 8., and there are about 50 acres of glebe. The church, a handsome structure in the later English style, with a square embattled tower, consists of a nave, north and south aisles, and a chancel, in which is a sepulchral chapel belonging to the Soame family. Bishop Dove, in the reign of Elizabeth, was rector of the parish; as was also, recently, the Rev. Dr. Thackeray, a late head master at Harrow.
Haydon
HAYDON, a chapelry, in the parish of Warden, union of Hexham, N. W. division of Tindale ward, S. division of Northumberland, 7 miles (W.) from Hexham, 27 (W.) from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and 30 (E.) from Carlisle; containing 1893 inhabitants. The village of Haydon-Bridge, situated on both sides of the South Tyne river, is in this chapelry, and is large and well built, and the scenery around it very beautiful: the bridge consists of six arches, two of which were rebuilt in 1733, and three of them in 1809; it has cost the county at various periods large sums of money, but is now substantially repaired. Two extensive land-sale collieries are in operation, as is also a foundry; and a mile south of Langley Castle, in a desolate situation, stand the laboratories for smelting and refining the ores of lead and zinc raised in the Alston mining districts, under the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital, who are proprietors of a considerable portion of the chapelry, and owners of Hudgill-Burn mine. The Newcastle and Carlisle railway has a station here, immediately behind the chapel. Edward III., in 1344, granted permission to Anthony, Lord Lucy, then owner of the manor, to hold a market on Tuesday, and a fair on St. Mary Magdalene's day and the three following days, both of which have fallen into disuse.
The present chapel, dedicated to St. Cuthbert, and forming a chapel of ease, was built in 1796, on a new site, near the north end of the bridge, given by the Governors of Greenwich Hospital: the old edifice, which was spacious and venerable, and situated on a conspicuous knoll commanding a wide prospect, still exists, but diminished in size, and partly decayed. There are places of worship for Independents and Wesleyans. In 1685, the Rev. John Shaftoe conveyed an estate, now producing £1000 per annum, for the support of schools, which are conducted by a head master, two under masters, and two female teachers; the head master must be a clergyman of the Church of England, and to his duties were added, in 1819, the performance of divine service in Haydon chapel twice on each alternate Sunday. Mr. Shaftoe's trustees subsequently obtained an act of parliament empowering them to erect 20 almshouses, in which 20 men and women receive each half a crown weekly, with a limited quantity of coal, and a garment annually. The school-house is conspicuously seated on the brow of the right bank of the Tyne, and, with the almshouses, and additions of embattled walls, has a very peculiar appearance. The chapel of Langley stood on the south side of the river, perhaps on the ground called Chapel Hill, on which the school-house and almshouses now stand; it was suffered to grow into disuse when the bridge was built. The ruins of Langley Castle form a lone and solemn mass of building, consisting of an oblong square, 82 feet (within) from north to south, and 25 feet the other way, and flanked by a massy tower at each corner: the castle is mentioned in 1365 and 1368, in inquests respecting the Lucys. Threepwood, in the chapelry, was the birthplace, in 1769, of John Tweddell, the accomplished scholar and indefatigable traveller.
Haydon, with Haydon-Wick
HAYDON, with Haydon-Wick, a tything, in the parish of Rodborne-Cheney, union of Highworth and Swindon, hundred of Highworth, Cricklade, and Staple, Swindon and N. divisions of the county of Wilts; containing 367 inhabitants.

E.) from Grantham; containing, with the chapelries of Culverthorpe and Kelby, and the hamlets of Aisby and Oseby, 647 inhabitants. The parish comprises by measurement 2794 acres; the soil is various, in some parts rich, and in others of inferior quality. There is a quarry of excellent freestone, which has been wrought for many years, and from which has been taken the stone for most of the churches and gentlemen's seats in the district. A pleasure-fair is held at Michaelmas, when races and other sports are celebrated. The living is a vicarage, with the chapelry of Kelby united, valued in the king's books at £12. 6. 10½.; patron and impropriator, J. A. Houblon, Esq. The tithes of the two places were commuted for land in 1802; the glebe lands comprise 500 acres, valued at £505 a year. The church is in the early, decorated and later English styles, with a square embattled tower, and contains some ancient monuments, and fine specimens of stained glass; also some beautiful monuments in white marble, by Rysbrach, to the Newton family. In a field not far from the church, are traces of a castle said to have belonged to Hugo de Bussey, sheriff of the county in the reign of Henry I.
Hayes (St. Mary)
HAYES (St. Mary), a parish, in the union of Bromley, hundred of Ruxley, lathe of Sutton-atHone, W. division of Kent, 2 miles (S.) from Bromley; containing 490 inhabitants. The parish is on the road from Bromley to Westerham, and comprises 1148 acres, of which 200 are waste or common. A pleasure-fair is held on Whit-Tuesday.

Hayes Place, near the church, formerly a seat of the family of Scott, was rebuilt by the Earl of Chatham, and was the birthplace of his illustrious son, William Pitt.
Hayes (St. Mary)
HAYES (St. Mary), a parish, in the union of Uxbridge, hundred of Elthorne, county of Middlesex, 2 miles (W. N. W.) from Southall; containing, with the hamlets of Botwell and Yeading, 2076 inhabitants. The manor-house was the palace of Archbishop Cranmer. Near this place is the commencement of the Paddington canal; and the Great Western railway skirts the southern part of the parish. The living is a vicarage, valued in the king's books at £20; net income, £150; patrons, the Trustees of the late J. Hambrough, Esq.; impropriator, J. H. Townsend, Esq. The rectory is valued in the king's books at £40. The tithes were commuted for land and corn rents in 1809. The church, an ancient edifice with a low square tower, is in the early English style, with some small Norman portions: the font is unique in form, and sculptured; the altar-piece is a painting of the Adoration of the Shepherds, and in the chancel windows are some armorial bearings in stained glass; the roof of the church is ornamented with carved representations in wood of the sponge and spear used at the Crucifixion. Norwood, near Southall, is a chapelry to Hayes, in the gift of the Vicar; and a chapel has been built and endowed at Southall Green, by Henry Dobbs, Esq., in whose family the patronage is vested. There are places of worship for Baptists, Independents, and Methodists.
Hay.For the past three years, I honestly believed oft-suspended NHL forward Matt Cooke was a changed man.
Thirty-six months after receiving a season-ending suspension for elbowing New York Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh in the head, Cooke seemed to clean up his act. A player with a history of dirty play and five suspensions on his resume, Cooke earned plaudits for subsequently abandoning his dangerous style, becoming an effective checking line forward.
Ottawa Senators owner Eugen Melnyk’s claims last season that Cooke’s accidentally cutting Senators defenseman Erik Karlsson’s Achilles tendon with his skate was a deliberate attempt to injure were roundly, and rightly, rejected. I was among those who defended Cooke and my opinion hasn’t changed that it was an accident. For me, Cooke had successfully changed his ways. I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
And then came his deliberate knee-on-knee hit on Colorado Avalanche defenseman Tyson Barrie this past week. In that instant, Cooke erased nearly three years of accrued good will, earning a seven-game suspension.
Following his suspension for kneeing Barrie, Cooke claimed it wasn’t his intent to injure the Avs defenseman and was merely trying to finish his check. He blamed it on the intensity of playoff hockey, reminding everyone he’s been a changed man since the McDonagh hit.
Bullshit.
His actions over the past year prove otherwise. There was his boarding of Boston’s Adam McQuaid in last year’s playoffs, kneeing Dallas’s Valeri Nichushkin in March, followed by a late hit on Edmonton’s Sam Gagner.
As ESPN.com’s Pierre LeBrun observed, the Barrie suspension is the sixth of Cooke’s career, for a total of 34 games, plus he’s been fined four times.
Cooke’s dirty hit on Barrie wasn’t an accident or a slip-up, but a move consistent with his style of play for most of his career. Fines and suspensions did nothing to change his ways.
Sorry, “Cookie Monster” (as some pundits and fans call him), but I ain’t buyin’ it. For whatever reason, you just can’t help yourself from deliberately attempting to injure opponents.
Thanks to Cooke’s actions, Barrie’s season is likely done. He’s out between four-to-six weeks with a knee injury. The best that can be said is he didn’t suffer a worse fate. I’m referring, of course, to Cooke’s blindside head shot on Boston Bruins forward Marc Savard over four years ago, which was the beginning of the end of Savard’s career.
Cooke had an opportunity to change his ways. For a while, it looked like he had. Fans and pundits believed he reformed. I certainly did. After the Barrie hit (and those upon McQuaid, Nichushkin and Gagner), it’s apparent he not only hasn’t changed, but has no intention of doing so.
Matt Cooke contributes nothing but unnecessary mayhem. He’s a black mark on the NHL game. A seven-game suspension for deliberately injuring Tyson Barrie was laughable. He deserves is a lifetime ban. Players like him have no business in the NHL.
Matt Cooke must go.
I have always believed that the incident with Karlsson was purposeful. And I continue to do so. A leopard like Cooke doesn’t change its spots. He’s a professional athlete and a highly proficient skater. He knew exactly what he was doing in that instance. Cooke is a disgrace to the game and should be banned for life. He represents everything that is bad about hockey and he does nothing but distract attention from the good aspects of the game. Hopefully he will find himself out of an NHL job very soon.
I was never convinced it was an accident either. I can’t understand why fans and others have continued to give him the benefit of the doubt. His long record of reckless behaviour speaks for itself and it should have / could have been dealt with a long time ago. I hope this doesn’t have a long term effect on Barrie’s career like it has with some of his other victims.
I love how so many people have suddenly gone on the offensive towards Matt Cooke after this hit. The same people who for three years gave him the benefit of the doubt. Yes, the hit was bad, but Cooke has been a much cleaner player for these last few years. He plays on the edge hockey. The type of “good ole hockey” that everyone seems to love and now he gets crucified once again. He’s no different than many aggressive players out there. The type of player that fans thrive on seeing.
Let’s take a quick look at Raffi Torres – another bad boy because of his style of play. Watch any of the San Jose/Los Angelese series and he makes several borderline hits every game. Yet every time he makes one of those devastating hits, the “experts” love him. All it will take is one slip up from him, and he’ll be ostracized just like Cooke is now.
And for what? Playing the game the way that people want him to?
Everyone better sit back and start thinking about how they want hockey to be played. If you want to see good hard hitting, be prepared for the occasional cheap shot by these guys who play this style. The game happens so fast and things change in a heartbeat. Yes, Cooke stuck his knee out to hit Barrie, but on,y because Barrie shifted at the last minute and this would have been a reaction from Cooke to still make a hit. He had what, 1/2 of a second to make the decision?? Before you make him the villain, please take a bit more than that 1/2 of a second to make your decision people.
See but that’s the whole point…that line that people speak of crossing. Some people like Cooke or Torres and you think the line is between a finishing a check on a suspecting player or finishing a player…ie take out the player.
When you look at the types of plays both these players make, it’s usually against a player in a vulnerable position where he can’t defend himself. The difference is players like the two mentioned, think it’s ok to take out that player since that player ‘should know better’ where as other physical players know not to or hit them in a way that it will not injure. The hitting aspect of the game isn’t to there as a green light to injure opposing players but to physically drain them. Guys like Cooke look to injure and that’s why they need to get.
The actions of these players won’t change until the goon mentality fans wake up and honestly look at the game. To pick Torres as another guy to defend shows how ignorant you are regarding hockey. Think back to Torres leaving his feet and launching himself into the face of Hossa or was it Seabrook? Two different players, same result. To suggest that removing the predatorial players will ruin the game is also completely absurd. Quit making excuses for stupid dangerous players.
There are tons of players who play a rough and tough game in this league and do so without attempting to injure people. Both of the above mentioned players do not play that way.
Anytime you leave your feet or aim for a guys head in order to “finish your check,” you have crossed the line.
What they really need is for one of these guys who has his career ended start a lawsuit against the player and the league.
Watch how fast everything changes.
The only caveat to any of these arguments is that they are usually applied to the blue collar players on the third and fourth line like Cooke, Torres, Lapierre, etc., and not to habitual offender-type superstars like Ovechkin and Perry who consistently give out questionable hits and stick jabs and don’t get the treatment the less well-known players get. And who puts out their fighters against the first line players to police the situation? If the league is serious, it needs to make calls consistently across the board. If Ovie has to sit out awhile for being a chaotic wrecking ball out there, so be it.

Fact: $126 trillion in Federal obligations will force the government to come after your money like never before. Plans are already in place…
Dear Friend,
Jack Nicholson once famously shouted...
“You can’t handle the TRUTH!”
But I believe you can. I believe you must! You see there’s an economic H-Bomb ticking in the heart of America that’s already begun to explode.
And it signals the END of American Affluence....
Honestly now... don’t you feel it already? Don’t you feel like the America you grew up with has somehow been transformed into a ghost of her previous glory?
Don’t you wish you could scream before it’s too late and say STOP? And do you long to feel financially and emotionally secure knowing you and your loved ones are set for life? Well, it may be too late for America... but it’s not too late for YOU—because in this report, you’ll discover…
Ask any “expert,” and they’ll say our Federal deficit is about $17 trillion.
That’s an accurate number... but it’s intended only to deceive you...
The real number you need to worry about is our Total Federal Obligations.
That number includes how much money we owe to foreign countries (like the Chinese), how much interest we need to pay and the cost of our social programs like Social Security, Medicare and prescription drugs paid by Medicare Part D.
In other words, it’s a real picture of our financial condition... and it’s beyond shocking.
"Quietly, behind the scenes, the groundwork is being laid for Federal confiscation of tax-deferred retirement accounts such as IRAs..."
According to U.S. Debt Clock.org, our total obligations are a stunning $126 trillion dollars. That’s over $400,000 of debt for every man, woman and child in America today.
Do you have an extra $400,000 cash to spare? I’m guessing the answer is “NO.”
But that doesn’t mean our politicians aren’t eyeing your money. After all, they need your money for use as “handouts” to voters. Your money keeps them in power.
That’s why I believe we are on the brink of the greatest government money grab in human history!
They won't come knocking on your door. They don't have to anymore. Your money is available to them with a few keystrokes on a computer.
Yes, it’s coming THAT soon. And it all will be very clever. Let’s take a close look at exactly how it will happen, and how you can legally tell the government... “Hands OFF my money!”
It’s true. The Federal government is seriously considering “nationalizing” your privately held IRA or 401(k). It’s all for your own protection, of course.
Think this is crazy? Actually... NO. World Net Daily recently reported that...
“Recent evidence suggests government officials continue to eye the multi-trillion dollar private retirement savings market, including IRAs and 401(k) plans, eyeing the opportunity to redistribute private retirement savings to less affluent Americans...”
And in a recent article published by The American Thinker, this little bombshell was released...
“Quietly, behind the scenes, the groundwork is being laid for Federal confiscation of tax-deferred retirement accounts such as IRAs...”
Retirement accounts have already been confiscated in Argentina, Hungary and Portugal. It’s happening right now in Poland. And a dozen other countries— including the European Union—have similar plans in place.
Financial Times commentator Tony Jackson recently reported that, “In the UK governments have long regarded pension funds as an irritant;‘pots of gold sitting passive in the economic landscape, when there are exciting policy uses to which they might be put.’”
Continued below...
"The International Monetary Fund Lays the Groundwork for Global Wealth Confiscation"
The great confiscation is coming. And...
On October 9, 2013, the IMF released a report called “Taxing Times” that recommended immediate global wealth confiscation—especially American wealth held in 401(k)s, IRAs and investment accounts—to reduce global debt and stabilize global bond markets.
The greedy bureaucrats called for a huge “capital levy” on any citizens with positive net worth. Of course, they said, it would only affect the “wealthy.”
What they didn’t tell you is, by global standards, every American is considered “wealthy.”
Bottom line: Greedy governments consider anyone who’s had the foresight and thrift to actually save money as “piggy banks” just waiting to be cracked open. Later in this report, I’ll explain exactly what you must do now to protect yourself—and your nest egg— before it’s too late.
That leads us to...
This is almost unthinkable... but you need to think about it right now because your so-called “safe” savings accounts could vanish at the whim of a politician and banker 1,000 miles away.
OK, now that’s really crazy, right? Sorry... but it’s true. It’s already happened in Cyprus.
When the bankers and politicians dug a debt hole the size of the Grand Canyon, they ran to the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank for a bailout.
And this troika of global wisdom had a “great” idea… Confiscate the savings of people with more than $130,000 in the bank. Bankers don’t call this “theft,” they have a nicer term.
They call it a “bail-in.” In one bank, depositors who had “large” amounts of cash in their savings suddenly discovered they had only $130,000 left. The rest of their money? Gone.
“Most Americans believe that Cyprus-style wealth confiscation could never spread to the United States...WRONG.
“Reuters reported that Poland has already begun confiscating private assets... and the USA recently signed on to this idea at a secret meeting at a G20 summit in 2011. “Worried yet? You should be...”
In another bank, depositors with more than $130,000 lost access to a stunning 90 percent of their money. Later on, after the predictable tsunami of rage, “large” depositors had 47.5 percent of their money converted into potentially worthless bank shares by force.
“Gee, that’s a shame... but it would never happen here in the good, old, USA.”
Baloney. The Cyprus “bail-in” concept is spreading fast. Reuters reported that Poland has already begun confiscating private assets. And bail-ins are now part of policy in many countries including Japan, Italy, Iceland, Spain, New Zealand and even Canada.
And the United States recently joined the club...
In 2011, in a secret room at the G20 Economic Summit in Cannes, the U.S., UK and EU all endorsed the Cyprus “bail-in” strategy as a viable option when banks and politicians mess up.
In a recent financial article, top financial analyst Jim Sinclair revealed the real truth...
Well it may well be that bail-ins are coming to America. But suppose your money was already locked away in a legal, safe place when the government comes knocking?
And suppose they couldn’t touch a penny—if they tried?
I’ll tell you all about this crisis survival strategy in just a moment. First you need to understand...
If you’re getting Social Security checks now or in the near future, the government wants to secretly grab your money. They’re hoping you won’t notice till it’s too late.
It all starts with the CPI, or Consumer Price Index. Traditionally, a version of the CPI is used to calculate the cost-of-living increases you get in your checks every year.
Right now, the government tells us inflation is “tame.” According to the Department of Labor, the inflation index for all items is running around 1.5 percent on an annual basis.
That’s well under the 2 percent inflation rate the Fed says is OK. But it’s a load of baloney!
Of course you don’t. You live in the real world. So when some Washington elite boasts about keeping costs down, you know better. Your shrinking bank account knows better.
So how is it possible that inflation is only about 1.5 percent a year? Simple. It’s a lie.
The Consumer price Index (CPI) is a fraud, pure and simple. The Feds changed the formula used to calculate the inflation to deliberately suppress the truth about rising prices.
It’s called “chained CPI.” And because they don’t have the guts to cut Social Security checks outright, this will help them juggle the books instead.
That way, your checks go DOWN a lot, and you won’t know who to blame!
The proposed ‘chained’ inflation index would cut Social Security increases even though a realistic index of elder inflation would push benefits higher...
Tell the truth? In Washington? You’ve got to be kidding. The article continues...
“Financially.”
Rein in spending? Don’t hold your breath on that one.
So the bottom line is that our cowardly politicians, desperate for money, are secretly tweaking the numbers so they grow richer... while you grow poorer.
Oh and one more thing... Suppose you calculate the real inflation rate, using the real numbers? What’s the result?
A whopping eight percent. That’s how much your costs are rising. And the last thing the government wants to do is give you an eight-percent boost in your Social Security check. They’ve got a better idea, they’ll just confiscate your money and use it to help get themselves re-elected.
I know. This all sounds so crazy... and it makes you feel so helpless. But the less power you have... the more power (and money) for them.
Is there anything you can do? Or are you pre-destined to be a victim of the coming Great Confiscation of American Wealth? No. No. And NO!
And it’s easier than you ever imagined. What I’m about to tell you is the LAST thing Washington wants you to know.
It’s giving them NIGHTMARES to even think you might legally cut them OUT of your financial life.
First, let me introduce myself. My name is Bob Livingston and 45 years ago, I founded The Bob Livingston Letter™.
And ever since that day, I have been a thorn in the side of every money-grabbing, lying politician that ever walked the corridors of power in Washington D.C.—or your hometown.
I’ve also been a ferocious consumer advocate warning you about the drugs, foods, healthcare and hospitals that are doing you more harm than good.
Trust me, I’m not on the Christmas list for the big drug companies, insurance companies or food manufacturers that get rich by making you sicker.
Some call me a consumer advocate. Some call me a curmudgeon. And a heck of a lot of bad folks call me a royal pain in the a#$.
"Thank you for shining the revealing spotlight of truth on the corruption... in all the aspects of our daily lives, from the government to our food supply!
"Thank you [Bob Livingston]... for the excellent work that all of you have done for liberty and privacy and our health!"—Greg H.
But my readers love me. I consider my readers an extended family of sharp, savvy consumers who want to know the truth... instead of sticking their heads in the sand.
Like any precious commodity, the truth is always in short supply—and that’s a big problem.
If you don’t know the unvarnished truth about your money, you’re going to lose it for sure. If you don’t know the uncensored facts about our healthcare system, you die.
If you honestly think you get the truth from your politicians... then you might as well hand over all your money to Washington today.
Maybe, God forbid, you might want to watch it grow... treat yourself to the fruits of your labor... and then pass a hefty legacy on to your children. And I want to show you how.
You see, our editors have just put the finishing touches on a new, FREE financial encyclopedia that is proving SO popular, it’s literally flying off the shelves. It’s called...
The Invisible Money Manual: How to Sidestep the Coming Confiscation of America’s Personal Wealth.
Others have gladly paid $19.95 for this information…
But for you, it’s absolutely FREE.
When you run up a national tab that hits $126 trillion, it’s a safe bet you’re going to be scrounging for cash in every nook and cranny of America.
It’s not some crazy prediction... it’s inevitable. That means there’s only one way to beat the Great Confiscation that’s surely coming. Only one way to secure your retirement nest egg, lock-in your savings and become financially set for life.
That’s why I created this remarkable, financial encyclopedia. It’s also why I’d like to send you a copy right now.
But I recommend you click here to request your copy sooner rather than later!
Why? Because the moment we announced this landmark guide, we received an avalanche of requests from readers like you, and imposed a limit of one FREE copy of The Invisible Money Manual per household!
Now, let’s take a peek inside this FREE volume and see how you can sidestep the hungry jaws of the government money monster...
It should be no surprise really, but the Federal government has created a massive data bank filled with information about tax returns, bank accounts and even credit card purchases.
It’s called FinCEN and it’s short for Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. It’s a branch of the Treasury Department—the same lovely folks who run the IRS.
FinCEN operates by systematically collating and cross-analyzing law enforcement, intelligence, public and financial databases. It can even use the IRS database to see how much income you’ve reported and whether you’ve ever been audited by the IRS.
FinCEN also gets information from your bank. Using just your name and address, or even a charge slip, a FinCEN operator can quickly find your Social Security number, birth date, driver’s license and possibly bank account numbers!
Thanks to the Patriot Act, your bank is now under serious pressure to report any “suspicious” activity to the Feds. As a result, they are “turning in” customers for “offenses” like making heavy use of ATM machines, or sending or receiving wire transfers.
They can also sell your information to third parties, like private investigators, marketers and government agencies.
So much for privacy. Is there anything you can do? Actually, there is…
In your FREE copy of The Invisible Money Manual, you’ll discover a little-known law that allows you to legally STOP your bank from sharing your private financial information.
All you have to do is submit a written request to the bank (find the exact letter in your FREE guide!), and you’ve taken the first step to financial privacy!
That’s a great start, but there’s so much more in your FREE copy of The Invisible Money Manual. Just look...
Most people don’t know this, but there are a LOT of legal options that will give you leverage and privacy when it comes to your overall financial security.
Legal havens can be profoundly effective. When Uncle Sam comes knocking for your savings or retirement accounts, and the money is already gone, he can’t do a thing about it!
In your FREE copy of The Invisible Money Manual, you’ll discover one of the very best ways to secure your security and privacy. Click here to get started today!
It’s an exclusive financial instrument that’s completely legal and available to anyone. And you do NOT have to report it on your tax returns... because your assets would not be considered “income.”
Once your money is tucked away...
Quietly, in every corner of America, ordinary folks like you and me are starting to “wake up and smell the coffee” about financial privacy. It’s not just for the super-rich... or trust fund babies. It’s for smart, hard-working people like you and me!
But there’s still more...
Since 1971, the price of gold has skyrocketed over 3,500 percent. During that same time, the dollar has lost 92 percent of its purchasing power.
With the President and Congress eyeing retirement funds like pensions, IRAs and 401(k)s, you’ve got to start thinking seriously about “cashing out” or converting your money into hard assets like gold and silver.
One thing’s for sure. The Federal government is praying you never do this—even though it’s completely legal.
Make no mistake; the government deliberately makes it hard to get at the money in your retirement accounts. Hard for you. But easy for them.
So here’s a much better idea. How about legally making it hard for them to get at your money... and oh-so-easy for you?
Let me point out—I am NOT a gold salesman—and I have no financial interest or connection with any gold brokers or institutions. So I’m FREE to tell you how to use gold to preserve your nest egg, no matter what happens to the dollar.
And you need to do this exactly right—so your nest egg is protected from confiscation and becomes legally invisible to Uncle Sam.
The real reason gold has fallen is price manipulation by traders at JP Morgan and other banks. That’s why they’re telling you to sell your gold—so they can buy it.
When they’re done manipulating, the price will rocket back to historic levels as the truth about the economy becomes obvious to everyone. And as for risk, it’s just like this…
Suppose, back in 1971 you had $35 of gold (one-ounce), and $35 in cash.
There’s still SO much more in your FREE copy of The Invisible Money Manual. Click here for your copy today and you’ll also discover...
Look, the way I see it, the more invisible your assets are... the safer they are, simple.
It must be the single greatest political lie in American history...“If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.”
Even worse, they all knew it was a lie. It was right there in their own paperwork—on page 34,552 of the Federal Register. Obamacare architects estimated that 66 percent of small business health plans and 45 percent of big business plans will be canceled.
That’s 93 million people who can no longer keep their plans. And it probably includes you, and your loved ones. If yours hasn’t already been canceled, it’s coming soon… along with less coverage, bigger deductibles and a hefty price increase!
In order to control costs, insurance companies participating in the Obamacare “Exchanges” have had to slash the size of doctor networks by thousands in many areas. Additionally, many doctors, possibly yours, have jumped ship.
In a recent CNN report, residents of Concord, NH reported living in a “black hole of healthcare for people buying these plans.” Thanks to Obamacare, they have to drive miles just to see a network doctor—who is a complete stranger!
But wait... it gets even worse. If you need specialized treatment... you can forget about the Mayo Clinic... The Cleveland Clinic... Cedar-Sinai... or any of the truly elite hospitals used by VIPs and politicians...
Because virtually NONE of the Obamacare-approved insurance plans are being accepted! These top hospitals can’t deliver the cutting-edge, life-saving care they’re known for, AND conform to the unimaginable restrictions of Obamacare.
U.S. News & World Report recently ran a shocking article titled “Top Hospitals Opt Out of Obamacare” that revealed the uncensored truth: Obamacare is making it virtually impossible for most Americans to seek care at these life-saving institutions!
Is there anything you can do to get the VIP care you or a loved one may need? You bet there is. The secret lies in dissecting the new medical system so you’re always first in line for the top-notch medical care you deserve.
Because it’s a matter of life and death, we created an easy to understand guidebook that cuts through Obamacare’s medical red tape—so you can access the medical care and doctors you need. It’s called...
You can keep your doctor... we really mean it. Period.
The Government is going to do its sinister best to force you into the arms of doctors you don’t want... surgeons that no one wants... and hospitals that are death traps.
What can you do? You need to be smarter than the bureaucrats.
And fortunately that’s not hard to do—when you follow the free advice you’ll find in your FREE guidebook:
There’s still SO much more in your FREE copy of The Obamacare Antidote: How to Beat the System and Get the VIP Healthcare You Deserve:
Click here for your FREE copy today and you’ll also discover...
I can’t stress this strongly enough: Your medical freedom depends upon the shrewd actions you take now... like following the simple steps in your FREE guide!
How an innocent email you thought was private can trigger a devastating IRS audit.
It was just an innocent email to a friend. You told him all about your new house... and the new car you finally saved enough money to buy. Only your friend wasn’t the only one to read your email.
A vindictive, little bureaucrat working for the IRS decided to read your email too. Then he decided to dig a little deeper... into your bank accounts.
“Hmmm... that’s a BIG savings account,” he thought to himself. “It’s much bigger than mine. It just not fair when the government could use some extra cash right now!”
So he hits a button, an audit notice goes out... and your life becomes a living nightmare.
The IRS has a special manual called the “Search Warrant Handbook,” and when it comes to your so-called “private” email, it’s perfectly clear: A curious, or vindictive, IRS worker can search your emails at any time, and for
any reason, and…
The IRS’s lawyers say it’s OK to search any electronic records that are held on a server somewhere. That’s basically everything.
And that’s one loophole that won’t be fixed—despite your constitutional rights—because electronic spying on private citizens is a financial bonanza for big government!
If Orwell were alive today, he’d be horrified. His “Big Brother” society where your most private thoughts were exposed to heartless bureaucrats is a chilling reality today.
You do NOT have to be a terrorist, tax dodger, drug lord or be suspected of insider trading for the government to keep tabs on you. Why? Because it helps keep you under control... and it’s a big source of easy income.
Right now, there seems to be no limit on government spying. Just look...
The National Security Agency (NSA) just put the finishing touches on the single largest data-mining center on planet Earth. It’s located in Bluffdale, Utah.
And you need to be VERY afraid of what it can do.
In a recent article in Wired magazine, the editors reported... “.....
“It has created a supercomputer of almost unimaginable speed to look for patterns and unscramble codes.”
The bottom line? If it’s electronic... an email, a phone call, a text message, a Facebook post, anything, Big Brother is watching and reading!
The FBI insists it has the right to read anybody’s emails that are more than six months old.
The clandestine PRISM program, according to The Washington Post, allows the NSA to access email, documents, audio, video, photographs and other personal information that unsuspecting citizens have entrusted to well-known companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Skype, YouTube and Paltalk, among others.
Is there anything you can do to protect your personal and financial privacy? Actually... there’s a lot you can do.
You can legally drop off the grid so Big Brother can’t poke around in your private life on a whim... or a vendetta!
Surprisingly, it’s easier than you might think, and anyone can do it... though few do. But that’s just because no one’s ever laid it out, step-by-step, like we did in…
These easy tricks help you drop off the digital grid once and for all!
Government spying on citizens is not going away. It will simply go deeper into the shadows.
But rest assured, you don’t need to be a computer expert to outsmart their snooping into your private life, thanks to the simple steps explained in your FREE guide.
Of course, this is just a glimpse of the information you’ll find when you click here to get your FREE copy of Without a Trace today!
And I promise—if a computer rookie like me can follow these steps, anybody can!
Next is possibly the most important conversation we’ll have today…
This is the story I hoped we’d never have to write. Why? Because it challenges almost everything you’ve been told about “healthy” eating... and because we’re going to sound like the “food police” warning you that everything you eat is going to kill you.
But this time... this one time, I want you to hear us out from start to finish. Why?
Have I got your attention? I hope so. Because this scandal will soon explode when the final dots are connected between millions of chronic conditions and deaths.
And those dots will trace back to a sinister source you never imagined possible… those “healthy” fruits and vegetables you serve your family every day.
You see, most Americans have this quaint notion of “Farmer Joe” planting corn in his family farm, and sending the harvest to market. It sounds quaint, natural and so healthy.
Except that “Farmer Joe” has been replaced by corporate mega-farms, and food manufacturers that have virtually ZERO connection to Mother Nature—and the same goes for their “food!”
These conglomerates produce something called GMOs... or genetically modified organisms.
Just like Frankenstein’s monster, these foods are spliced together using genetic material from different species—including bacteria, viruses and animals—to create a “healthier, more pest-resistant crop.” (More about this in just a moment.)
And just like Frankenstein’s monster... these new, “improved” crops are a biological disaster waiting to happen. And they’re quite literally everywhere...
It all adds up to a disaster waiting to happen. Actually, it’s already happening. There’s no research to prove that these foods are safe and...
That’s the conservative estimate of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group that focuses on health issues.
The group justifiably asks: “If you were planning on eating your body weight of anything in a year, wouldn’t you want to make sure it was safe to eat?” Of course you would!
But don’t hold your breath for the government to take a close look at these foods anytime soon. Why?
That’s the total amount of political contributions paid by Monsanto (the GMO giant in the industry) and other firms during the past decade. And that’s just the beginning.
Contributions have doubled in the last decade, and these companies employ more than 100 lobbying firms to push their GMO agenda.
However, here at The Bob Livingston Letter™, we’ve got this old-fashioned notion that you deserve the truth about the foods you feed your family. So let’s take a closer look at the real threat these foods pose to your health.
OK, suppose you wanted to create a tomato that could withstand cold weather. You simply splice some genetic material together and presto... you’ve got your super-tomato…
In practice, however, serious complications arise that are unexpected. For instance, just recently researchers have discovered the genes technologists insert into plants are often contaminated with unintended material.
That includes viruses. Recently, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) discovered that when lab scientists altered genes in GMO foods they were also transferring parts of a viral gene—and no one had ever noticed that before!
But it’s there... and it’s not coming out. Reports about this virus show that of the 86 different processes being used to insert genes into GMO crops, this virus is present in 54 of them.
That means millions of men, women and children are eating these “contaminated” foods right now—including you.
Will it lead to unforeseen illnesses for millions? The experts are uncertain. But remember, in the History of Humanity, this genetic material has never been found in the foods we eat.
Is that a chance you really want to take with your family? Don’t answer that just yet, because there’s more.
Another favorite project for the genetic tinkerers is producing crops that are naturally resistant to insects.
Again... sounds pretty good, right? Wrong.
The lab “geniuses” have created fruits and vegetables that create their own insecticides. That’s right, the insecticides are now inside the food itself.
You could wash the fruits and veggies all day, but the pesticides are still inside. And once you eat these “healthy” foods, pesticides are inside YOU too.
The food engineers simply assumed your body would flush out the toxins naturally. It turns out that may not be true.
Recent research has revealed that a chemical form of the pesticide (called Bt) used in GMO foods is now showing up in our blood streams.
The chemical was found in...
Researchers are worried that the Bt levels in blood could trigger cellular inflammation and boost your risk for chronic and acute conditions like heart disease, arthritis, and even cancer. It may also be responsible for the recent upsurge in food allergies and other autoimmune problems.
“Dear God... what can I do if these foods are everywhere, and they’re not listed on the food labels”
It’s actually easier than you might think to avoid these foods... and still enjoy the hearty, family recipes you love.
And I’ll tell you exactly what to do, in a new FREE guide we’ve completed. It’s called...
The Smart Shopper’s Guide to Avoiding Genetically Modified, Foods, Fruits, and Vegetables
It’s the essential handbook for healthy living in the age of dangerous, new “FrankenFoods.”
Even though GMO foods are almost everywhere, the tips and tricks in this handbook can help guarantee you don’t feed your family hidden viral genes, chemicals, poisons, drugs and antibiotics.
Right now, the average American eats about a half pound of these untested foods every day. We’ll show you how to get that down to zero!
I urge every family to read this FREE guide! Here’s a glimpse at what you’ll learn when you click here to get started today...
Dear reader, in 20 years, GMO foods as poison will be common knowledge. Except by then, these foods may have wrecked the health of millions of innocent men and women worldwide.

I created a traffic source report in SiteCatalyst Discover recently and wanted to include some basic engagement style metrics e.g. Average Page Views per Visit, Average Time on Site. However, with some high bounce rates, I wanted to ignore those visits that did bounce, with the metrics only calculated for visits that viewed at least two pages.
The general equation for this for any metric is:
(<Metric> minus <Metric> for Single Page Visits) / (Visits minus Single Page Visits)
The four required numbers are generally pretty easy to get at but it is complicated here as the reports are based on Last Touch Marketing Channels reports. As discussed in this blog post on Why SiteCatalyst Visits don’t always equal Entries, not all Marketing Channels Visits are recorded in SiteCatalyst as an Entry and therefore cannot be recorded as Single Page Visits.
The solution is to create an estimated value for this by applying the known Bounce Rate for Entries to the number of Visits (assuming the Bounce Rate is consistent). This equation is:
[Visits]*([Single Page Visits]/[Entries])
This leaves the only missing number as <Metric> for Single Page Visits. Here, we can apply some logic to either eliminate it or use a substitute. Common examples are below:
- Average Time on Site (per visit) – no time is recorded if only one page is viewed so value is zero
- Page Views per Visit – as only one page is viewed, the number of page views equals the number of visits
- Orders per Visit (Conversion Rate) – ignoring an issue with the set-up, you can’t place an order on the first page you view therefore the value is zero
So the set of equations to use in Discover to create the Calculated Metrics are:
Average Time on Site
[Total Time Spent]/([Visits]-([Visits]*([Single Page Visits]/[Entries])))
Page Views per Visit
([Page Views]-([Visits]*([Single Page Visits]/[Entries])))/([Visits]-([Visits]*([Single Page Visits]/[Entries])))
Conversion Rate
[Orders]/([Visits]-([Visits]*([Single Page Visits]/[Entries])))
The final metric there is the conversion rate, again adjusted to eliminate those visits that were never a realistic chance of converting. The conversion action used was to place an order but this could easily be changed to other conversion actions such as Submit Form. It is important though that the action/event would only be triggered once within a visit.
So what do you do with these calculated metrics? You can set up a report for Last Touch Marketing Channels and add metrics for Visits, Bounce Rate*, Page Views per Visit, Average Time on Site, Conversion Rate, Orders and Revenue. And then analyse, interpret and take actions based on the comparisons between channels for these key metrics. Or if you drill down (and have classifications applied to the Marketing Channel Detail values where required), take actions based on the comparisons between different campaigns, affiliate networks, search engines or landing pages.
Note this report is only possible with Discover, not SiteCatalyst, as Single Page Visits is a traffic metric and not available for the Marketing Channels report.
If you would like to know more about calculated metrics, this is a good post on how to create calculated metrics. And, within the Knowledge Base, can be found a list of commonly used calculated metrics for SiteCatalyst.
* If you don’t already have Bounce Rate set up as a calculated metric, bad you. The calculation to use is [Single Page Visits]/[Entries].
4 thoughts on “Useful Calculated Metrics for SiteCatalyst”
Average Time on Site formula can be significantly simplified from:
[Total Time Spent]/([Visits]-([Visits]*([Single Page Visits]/[Entries])))
to [Total Time Spent]/([Visits]-[Single Page Visits]) visits and entries is essentially the same so you dont need to work out the % bounce just factor it out of the equation.
Alternatively I would go even simpler to my version:
[Total Time Spent]/[page depth>1]
Thanks for the response J but these calculated metrics only relate to Last Touch Marketing Channels where visits and entries can be quite different. Entries (and single page visits) are only counted if that access of the site initiated the visit. Visits on the other hand are counted everytime the website is accessed.
Your suggested calculated metrics would work with probably all other reports but not these ones. I didn’t know you could do page depth > 1 as a calculated metric – will need to have a play with that.
Peter
Ah – I skim read and didnt appreciate that – I also had to look into the apparent metric variation in the marketing channel report in OSC – it makes sense once you know how the back end is attributing. I revisited the page depth in calc metrics and it doesnt appear to work – sure it used:Fail …retract previous post. The answer to all this pain arguably I guess is to go with a TMS and not rely on Omniture for x channel attribution.
No problems. Omniture has other solutions for multiple visit attribution, Unified Sources (VISTA rule) and Channel Manager (JavaScript) – although they do have additional costs involved. My concern with any TMS is whether they will capture all traffic sources, not just the tagged marketing channels, and whether you will also get all the visitor behaviour on the website beyond just the conversion event.
Of course, I don’t really agree with campaign attribution being accurate/useful in general due to multiple device use – no system can capture all the touchpoints if you are researching at work and purchasing at home. Instead I think people should be looking to assign value to actions/behaviour on the website and ideally testing impact of marketing somehow (both difficult I know).Third annual Petersen farm fair celebrates rural life

SILVERDALE - Toddler Kamani Bailor's first introduction to the Petersen Farm in Silverdale included riding a tractor, petting a dark gray rabbit and going through a maze made out of hay.
Kamani, nearly 2, and his older brother, four-year-old Keanu Bailor experienced the sprawling 167-acre Petersen Farm during its third annual fall fair on Sunday.
While the brothers took advantage of the day by turning Central Kitsap's largest farmland into their personal play area, parents Dominic Bailor and Adrienne Smith came to the fair to learn more about farming connections in the area.
"Sometimes you go to Google to research stuff, but you can't find everything," said Smith, whose family relocated from San Diego to Silverdale in January. "There's so many resources (at the fair). A lot of good information for farming connections."
Learning about area weeds and wild edibles helps the couple, who'd like to start farming soon, Smith said.
Educating the public about farming is one of the ways fair organizers honor Gerald Petersen, the Silverdale farmer who ran the property until his death in 2009.
"Uncle Gerry really wanted to preserve the farmland and educate," Petersen's niece Dorothy Lind said. She was named the personal representative of Petersen's estate after he died.
This year's fair included walking tours of the two houses on the farm, a display of old-time farming equipment like a homemade wooden rack, 37 food and craft vendors, games and music.
Sandra Staples-Bortner, executive director of the Great Peninsula Conservancy, said this year's fair was the first time the group wasn't using it for purely fundraising efforts. The fair was jointly organized by the conservancy and Kitsap Community Food Co-op.
For the past two years, the Great Peninsula Conservancy has spearheaded an effort to purchase a conservation easement to permanently keep 120 acres as farmland. The fall fair began as a fundraiser.
Last week, the group announced a $285,000 U.S. Department of Agriculture grant.
The USDA grant topped off $415,000 worth of contributions from public and private donors over the two-year fundraising process.
Attendees Brian and Kristen Hill of Gig Harbor brought their four- and six-year-old children to the fair after learning about the event Sunday morning. While the two don't farm, both grew up in farming communities in California. They said they appreciate the diversity farming brings to a community.
Staples-Bortner said that now there is enough money to purchase the land and keep it as a farm indefinitely, there might be more public events in the future.
"People are really starting to appreciate food (that comes from the farming community)," she said.
This story has been changed since it first posted. The original story only listed the Great Peninsula Conservancy as fair organizers.

Friday.
Scared Sacred is the first of Ripper’s film trilogy, which also includes Fierce Light and Occupy Love, which was shown as the closing film at the 2013 World Community Film Festival.
Scared Sacred examines some of the Ground Zeros of our world, including Bhopal, Cambodia, Bosnia, Hiroshima, Afghanistan, the World Trade Center and Palestine.
In each place, within stories of disaster and despair, he finds stories of hope, so that experiences of being scared occur side by side with experiences of the sacred.
The film is a very personal journey for Ripper as well, as he explores the dangerous areas of our world. Rather than trying to wall off the fear in our modern lives, he decides to seek it out, exploring the dark places of our world, while also exploring Sufi and Buddhist teachings to help him make sense of his own experience.
He also spends time with an Interfaith group in Palestine trying to bridge the chasm between Israelis and Palestinians. Parents, who have experienced the intense suffering caused by losing a child to the conflict, can find common ground with those on the other side, who have had the same experience.
The presentation Friday will be at 7 p.m. at Comox United Church at 250 Beach Dr. in Comox. Admission is by donation.

Knox County Sheriff News
Indicted Child Rapist Charged with Solicitation to Commit First Degree Murder
A Lutrell man charged with raping an 11 year old child is in the Knox County Detention Facility accused of trying to hire a hit man to kill the girl and her family. The hit man, however, was a Knox County Sheriff’s Office undercover officer. Twenty-one year old James Wallace Davenport is charged with six counts of Solicitation to Commit First Degree Murder. According to the warrant, Davenport solicited the undercover officer to kill the girl, her fetus, her parents, and her two sisters so the state would not be able to prosecute him on the rape charge. A Knox County Grand Jury indicted Davenport on the child rape charge on November 18 and he was being held on a $250,000 bond. Bond was set at $50,000 for each of the six charges to solicit murder. Campbell County also has a hold on him for violating probation on a theft charge.
The KCSO’s investigation led to information that Davenport wanted to hire a hit man. According to the warrant, Davenport thought the hit man he was talking to was “Jack Moore.” The undercover officer posing as Jack Moore talked to Davenport during jail visitation and recorded their conversation. Davenport was charged Tuesday night with soliciting the murders.Punk rockers Green Day will perform during the team's Sept. 13 home opener against the Baltimore Ravens at New Meadowlands Stadium, according to The Associated Press.
But here's the twist -- the band will not only perform a song off their 2009 album, "21st Century Breakdown," but they'll be doing it with the help of Broadway.
The group will perform the song "Last of the American Girls" along with the cast of the Tony Award-wining rock musical, "American Idiot." The musical is based on the themes touched upon in the band's critically-acclaimed 2004 album of the same name.
While Green Day will be rocking the crowd inside the stadium, Velvet Revolver and former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash and Pussycat Dolls member Nicole Scherzinger will perform outside of the stadium, according to The Associated Press. Scherzinger will sing the National Anthem.

I made my first attempt at canning anything last year with this recipe...my only difference in the recipe...I added a sprinkle of pickling spice to my liquid.
Entered these pickles in the county fair and won 1st PLACE!!! These are great and easy!!!
This was the first time I've canned. These turned out so well, that I made them 3 times to rave reviews. The recipe was detailed enough for a newbie to follow. I also like there are a few ingredients.

As a homeowner, it's essential to maintain awareness of new and changing laws that impact your home and your lawn and landscape. Recently, the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) posted important information on its website regarding Maryland's New Lawn Fertilizer Law, which affects homeowners, lawn care professionals and fertilizer manufacturers and distributors. We've extracted some of the information here and recommend visiting the MDA website for further details.
The MDA website states:
"Maryland's new lawn fertilizer law is designed to protect the Chesapeake Bay from excess nutrients entering its waters from a variety of urban sources, including golf courses, parks, recreation areas, athletic fields, businesses and hundreds of thousands of suburban and urban lawns.
Nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus, are key ingredients in lawn fertilizer. When it rains, excess nutrients can wash off the land and into the streams and rivers that feed the Chesapeake Bay. Once in our waterways, excess fertilizers fuel [homeowners, lawn care professionals and fertilizer manufacturers and distributors]."

Either way, it claims to predict how you’ll vote based on your tweets.
Claiming to offer 80% accuracy (if you’re ‘political’ and 65% accuracy if you’re not), this “political Guess Your Weight game” predicts who you are likely to vote for based entirely on your tweet data.
“The technology observes people on Twitter who we know support Obama or Romney and runs algorithms that find patterns in their Twitter activity,” said Shawn O’Banion, a Northwestern University Ph.D. student who created the technology with Larry Birnbaum, a Knight Lab co-founder and professor of computer science at the McCormick School of Engineering.
“That initial observation allows us to predict the behavior of ‘unknowns,’ or users who we have not already observed and who we do not know to be on one side or the other,” O’Banion said.
Tweetcast “tracks words, @-mentions, hashtags and links in the Twitter feeds of known political supporters and compares those to the same elements in the feeds of other potential voters. The greater the similarity between the two, the more likely they are to support the same candidate,” O’Banion said.What hottest toy on the market, save for a Barbie or two. It came with little packets of mixes to which you added water, along with tongs and little baking pans that would come in all kinds of shapes, including a heart. And when you mixed the batter and put it in the oven, and it started to cook under that red-hot lightbulb, it was about as domestically exciting as things could get for a little girl trying to emulate her mom.
But all things must pass, and so, too, must nostalgia. Because it’s 2011 and Easy-Bakes aren’t what they used to be — the just-released 2011 version, for instance, doesn’t need a light bulb to cook those chewy little delights. Instead of a 100-watter, it has a heating element, just like a real oven, and heats up to a maximum of 350 degrees F, while the outside stays warm to the touch. (Good thing — in 2007, millions of the ovens were recalled because children were burning their fingers.)
It’s apparently part of the big corporate conspiracy to not only save girls from burning their fingers but to rid the free world of the horrors of the incandescent lightbulb.
And the new Easy-Bake has had another facelift, which is the iconic toy’s 11th redesign in nearly 50 years, and this time out looks like some kind of outer space toaster and it’s purple, for heaven’s sake, even though some of us think the original pink and turquoise and white were perfectly fine.
And, of course, there won’t be any more hot spots, which means your little cake will actually be cooked uniformly and where’s the fun in that....

We saw the Kent players trying their hand at visually impaired cricket earlier, well it's just been announced that Canterbury will host British Blind Sport's equivalent of the FA Cup Final this summer - the showpiece of the Primary Club Heindrich Swanepoel Memorial Cup.
The game will be staged at The Spitfire Ground, St Lawrence on Saturday, August 9, the first time in its 36-year history that Kent has hosted the event.
16:45 - HOCKEY
The men might have suffered disappointment (see 14:50) but there was plenty to celebrate for England's women as they came from behind to beat visiting Canada 6-1 in a capped international match at Bisham Abbey earlier.
The visitors went ahead after six minutes when Holcombe and GB keeper Maddie Hinch was beaten, but England soon levelled and went ahead on 18 minutes through a deflected goal from Kent's own Susannah Townsend, once of Sutton Valence School and returning to Canterbury HC next season.
Four more goals followed either side of the break, with Holcs defender Laura Unsworth helping to keep the tourists out at the other end.
The Canadians provide the opposition for four games this week, two of them capped, as part of the preparations for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.
16:30 - TONBRIDGE ANGELS
Tommy Warrilow's final act as Tonbridge Angels manager on Saturday was to help old foes Dover into the play-offs.
Already-relegated Angels held on for a goalless draw against the Hampshire side in Warrilow's final game after six-and-a-half years at the Longmead helm.
Angels lost twice against Dover this season, which helped the Whites sneak into the top-five in Skrill South in the final minutes of the final day of the season, though they did upset Dover twice last term which derailed Dover's title bid.

Gills in the Championship. Remember those days? Peter Taylor does. He'd like to lead another attempt to get the club into the second tier of English football next season, as we've already touched on today.
But he's under no illusions how hard it will be to transform the squad to get them to challenge in League 1 and will take some careful dealings in the transfer market, as he tells Luke Cawdell here.
14:50 - HOCKEY
Disappointment for England. (see 10:50). A 2-1 defeat to Belgium in the Four Nations clash in Glasgow means they miss out on the gold/silver match tomorrow and have to settle for a play-off for bronze against the Auld enemy.

Forget Liverpool v Chelsea, the biggest game on the calendar yesterday afternoon was surely the East Kent Mavericks' Premiership trip to Cambridge.
The Cambridgeshire Cats were early pacesetters in the South section of the national top flight, having won their opening game against Berkshire, however the Mavs - Kent's premier side - produced a battling display to kick-off their own campaign with a road win.
An early touchdown from QB Josh Adamson on the opening drive and a fine catch from star receiver Mark Hughes gave the visitors a healthy 14-2 lead, despite the Cats having forced a safety inbetween the two scores with a tackle inside the Mavs own endzone.
The hosts rallied with three scores either side of the interval, though with two extra-point attempts blocked and another sent wide, the Cats took only a 20-14 lead into the final quarter.
East Kent were not to be denied however and a superb scrambling run wide left by Adamson levelled the score, with Hughes kicking the away side into a one-point lead, before superbly grabbing an Adamson pass in the back of the endzone with little over two minutes to go to seal the win.
The Mavs sit third in the Premiership ahead of Sunday's trip to London Olympians.

- Mrivera4There could be other stresses involved here other than BPD. It sounds as if the moving in together maybe triggered something to me Do you know much about her relationship history? What might be triggering this? By the way, I am adult ADD myself and we can be difficult to deal with at times. When you say after 16 years, are you referring to your time together? I notice you are 64. How old is she?
She's 59, ADD is all of a sudden a do or die situation? I"m not denying I have it but I asking her to do couples conselling and shes basically saying its all my problem She's never been married and had another relationship with a lot of fighting and anger.
Here are the symptoms of BPD as outlined in the DSM. You can find more details at PsychCentral.com.
I didn't really hear this from what you have said. Go ahead and change my mind though. It does sound to me this recent move maybe has brought some stress to her that has triggered this. Do you mind telling me what it is specifically about your ADD that seems to bother her so much? I am sorry for the continued questions, but I do want to be a help.
I started to see a therapist at her urging and he seems to be asking my why am I staying in a relationship with a woman who always in control and whom I haven't had sex with in three years.Which is quite surprising. He seems to be intimateing that she's a problem child and the universe revolves around her. It's all so confusing. She's made ADD more of a monster than it is.
Well, as far as ADD goes, you have my support. I have managed to use it to my advantage over the years. I can accomplish more without thinking about it....literally, than most can while thinking about it. It is all a matter of making it work for you.
Has she always been this way? Could this be menopause? Why do you stay?
Here goes again...
As I said earlier, we ADD folks can be frustrating to live with, but it does sound you are making genuine efforts toward improvement. Sounds to me she needs to make some effort as well. This really doesnt sound like BPD to me, but you are the one living with her. If I were you I would try to find a way to gracefully suggest she see an OBGYN or at least GP. This very well could be related. Not sure I would be upfront about it. A doctor could prescribe meds for anxiety and depression as well. If you wish to continue this relationship, you probably need to give some bounadaries for her. You have attended therapy . It is time she attends with you. It sounds to me your therapist was dead on, but you might benefit as a couple from couples therapy. Dont accept no for an answer. It is time she share at least a little of the remedy if not the blame.
I hope this all works out for you. Let me know if you have questions or want further dialog. I really do want to be a help to you.
Thank you!Breggers Schwanen Hochtal SPA, Bernau

In the world of innovation, there seems to be this belief that we’re supposed to let everybody be free thinkers and let them do whatever they want. But this actually destroys innovation. We need structure. We need constraints. I’ll give you a really simple example… 
I recently spoke at an event called Crowdopolis. The topic was crowdsourcing. This has become one of the hot buzzwords in business. Companies of all sizes are dipping their toes into crowdsourcing. 
I’s like to talk about a philosophy that I call the “20/80/80 principle.” It’s a way for extracting the greatest amount of value out of what you’re doing, with the least amount of effort, thus freeing you up to do other things. 
The question I get most often from my Fortune 500 clients: “How do we create a culture of innovation?” Although there is no simple answer, here’s a blueprint I’ve found useful to get things started and build momentum. 
People have personalities, and so do organizations. Many would call this their culture. This is an appropriate word since it is related to the word “cult.” Everyone in your organization most likely fits the mold. 
You are alive today. You were alive yesterday. You were alive the day before that. This is good news from a survival perspective. Unfortunately it is bad news from an innovation perspective. Ode to Wildstar - a love poem to a game Flag By: sparrowtm Channel: videogames (More by author: Most viewed, Newest, Most Thumbs) random - Fav + Fav Comment This could have been titled 'Nexus Travel Advisory'.

Schedule of Events | Webcast | TV Schedule | Psych Sheet | Media Kit OMAHA, Neb. - Four years have passed since thousands of elite swimmers gathered for the U.S. Olympic Trials in Omaha, Neb., to earn a spot on the 2008 squad. After months and possibly years of training, the CenturyLink Center is once again filled with swimmers looking to punch their tickets for the 2012 London Olympics.Included in the list of more than 1,500 swimmers are current Missouri State standout Paul Le (Moore, Okla.) and former swimmer Chris Novak (Kansas City, Mo.). The duo will compete in two events each throughout the week, as Le will represent the Bears in the 100- and 200-meter backstroke and Novak is set to swim the 100- and 200-meter breaststroke.The Trials will run eight days, beginning Monday, June 25 and will come to a close Monday, July 2. On each day of competition, the prelims begin at 10 a.m. CT, with finals following at 6:45 CT."Having the opportunity to compete under the United States flag is a special experience for Paul [Le] and Chris [Novak]. The Olympic Trials is the fastest swim meet in the U.S. and it only comes around once every four years," said Missouri State head swimming coach Dave Collins. "The amount of time and effort put in by both athletes is incredible and they deserve to compete with the best in the world. The training is done and now it is time for them to enjoy the atmosphere."Le scored his first-ever Olympic Trials qualifying time at the RAC AquaHawks Long Course club meet in Fayetteville, Ark. when he recorded the exact cut-off time in the 100 back (57.59) on Saturday, April 21. With his 100 back Trials cut secure, the All-MAC first team selection turned his focus to the 200 back, an event in which he was just .50 seconds shy of the qualifying time at the Arkansas meet. Le returned to his home state a month later in Jenks, Okla. to record his second Trials cut and was more than a second under the qualification standard.Novak qualified for the 2012 Olympic Trials in 2010 while competing with his club team, the Tsunami Swim Team of Kansas City. His time of 1:04.69 in the 100 breast was the Trials cut right on the dot, while his 200-meter back time at U.S. Nationals qualified him for the event and was the 50th-fastest time in the nation from October 1, 2009 through August 24, 2010.Prior to Le and Novak, the last Missouri State swimmers to compete at an U.S. Olympic Trials event was Matt Beasley and Josh Wegrzyn in 2004.All but the three fastest heats of preliminaries will be webcast live at USASwimming.org, June 25 - July 1.

Professor’s research lands on cover of ‘Nature’
March 1, 2012Tweet
The town of Gilboa in upstate New York is famous for being the location of some of the earliest tree fossils. But after a new round of excavation, scientists are piecing together a view of the floor of the world’s oldest forest that could shed new light on the role of modern-day forests and their impact on climate change. The findings by scientists at Binghamton University, Cardiff University and the New York State Museum appear in the March 1 issue of Nature, a leading international science journal.
“It was like discovering the botanical equivalent of dinosaur footprints,” said William Stein, associate professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University. .”
The Gilboa area has been a known tree fossil location since the late 1800s, but during the 1920s when construction of the Schoharie Dam revealed a dense stand of trees, paleontologists began to investigate the site in earnest. Named Eospermatopteris, or “ancient seed fern,” by Winifred Goldring of the New York State Museum in 1924, these earliest trees had survived only as broken standing bases and trunks, all around 1, not related to either one. Working in conjunction with Stein, Mannolini also developed a sketch of the ancient forest.
The research team got a huge break in spring 2010, when repairs of the Gilboa Dam reopened the site for another look..
The team also came across a tree belonging to the class Lycopsida, or club mosses, which predates an earlier discovery made in Naples, N.Y.,.
So what exactly did this complex ancient forest in Gilboa look like? Stein and the team figure − around the Middle Devonian period, about 386 million years ago − Earth experienced a dramatic drop in global atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the associated cooling led ultimately to a period of glaciation.
“Trees probably changed everything,” Stein said. “Not only did these emerging forests likely cause important changes in global patterns of sedimentation, but they may have triggered a major extinction in fossil records.”
For Stein, it all comes down to one thing – how much we don’t know but need to understand about our ancient past.
“The complexity of the Gilboa site can teach us a lot about the original assembly of our modern-day ecosystems,” he said. “As we continue to understand the role of forests in modern global systems, and face potential climate change and deforestation on a global scale, these clues from the past may offer valuable lessons for managing our planet’s future.”

Reduction in weight and better aerodynamic can help promoting economy and performance.

Statement of
Marcilynn Burke
Deputy Director
Bureau of Land Management
Department of the Interior
Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee
Subcommittee on
S. 268, Forest Jobs and Recreation Act
May 25, 2011
Thank you for inviting the Department of the Interior to testify on S. 268, the Forest Jobs and Recreation Act of 2011. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) supports the wilderness designations on BLM-managed lands included in S. 268.
The vast majority of the designations and other substantive provisions of S. 268. 268
Title I of S. 268, applies solely to National Forest System Lands. Accordingly the Department of the Interior defers to the Department of Agriculture on those provisions. The majority of the designations in Title II of the bill, are also on National Forest System Lands, and again we defer to the Department of Agriculture.
Section 203(b) of S. 268 designates five wilderness areas on lands administered by the BLM in southwestern Montana: the Blacktail Mountains Wilderness (10,675 acres), Centennial Mountains Wilderness (23,700 acres), Humbug Spires Wilderness (8,900 acres), East Fork Blacktail Wilderness (6,125 acres), and Ruby Mountains Wilderness (16,300 acres). The BLM supports these designations and we appreciate the Sponsor and the Committee working with us over the last year to refine these boundaries.. We continue to encourage the Sponsor and the Committee to consider expanding the boundaries of the Centennial Mountains Wilderness in order to protect this area as a single coherent corridor, thereby providing enhanced benefit for the genetic diversity of the fauna inhabiting the Greater Yellowstone Area and the Bitterroot Range.
Furthermore, we support the transfer of administrative jurisdiction over the 660-acre Farlin Creek area to the Forest Service for inclusion in the adjoining 77,000 acre East Pioneers Wilderness Area.
Section 205 of S. 268 proposes to fully release four BLM-managed wilderness study areas (WSAs) in Beaverhead and Madison counties from WSA management thereby allowing the consideration of a full range of multiple uses. In addition, in five other WSAs, some areas would be released from WSA status and other areas would be partially designated as wilderness, as noted above. In all, over 66,000 acres of WSAs are proposed for release, and nearly 66,000 acres are proposed for wilderness designation; we support these provisions.
Conclusion
Thank you for the opportunity to testify. We look forward to working cooperatively with the Congress to designate these special and biologically significant areas in this dramatic corner of Montana as wilderness.July 6th - Website Defacement Day? 483

First, fixing the page is probably the least important factor to consider.
Since it's kind of a 'contest', who defaces the most websites, how much can you bet that a large % of them will be medium to small sites? Most will also be e-commerce related sites, since their security is often compromised by badly written e-commerce software.
Now, take the normal MomAndPops.com, which sells apple pies. Client comes to the site expecting to buy apple pie and then find out that the site become a Hacker Advertisement site of some sort, or even worst, says that Apple Pie causes cancer. What will they say? "I'll come back later when the website is restored"? I don't think so. Most probably: "Shit, they stopped selling apple pie because it gives cancer!". It's sad, but a lot of people are gullible.
So, the real problem is loss of sales because of it, and/or traffic/readership, and/or reputation or anything the website is based on. The longer the site remains defaced, the more the website loses. This is the real killer, especially for small to medium websites/e-commerce, and most of these aren't run by evil megacorporations.
And your attitude of saying it's not that big of a deal because the corporation has enough money to fix it, or won't pay the guy in overtime, is not very wise. Sure, most of them exagerates the 'cost' of hackers and such, but it doesn't mean it isn't substancial, or that it just costs a simple fix of the website.

And you seem to want to have it both ways; on the one hand, large corporations somehow exaggerate what it costs to recover from a hack, and on the other hand anyone who *is* hacked is incompetent and deserves what they get.
In fact, in the unlikely event that IBM's site is defaced, it would certainly cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars.
There's a lot more to recovering from defacement than you seem to think. Hint: you are not done when you copying the original HTML page back in place.
For a large company, it means doing a massive project to determine what other systems could have been accessed using the defaced server as a middleman. And then examining those systems for signs of intrusion.
In the much more likely and frequent instances of a small business being defaced, it may or may not be financially ruinous, but it's certainly a lot more than the minor and greatly exaggerated inconvenience that you paint it as. These businesses don't have large IT staffs, and/or the technical know-how to slap themselves on the head and say "Damn! We should have installed that latest IIS hotfix."
It's an ugly situation, but it is absolutely an expensive one and has far wider repercussions than you seem to think.

Once they got in, they put in a rootkit called ZK and started setting up a hidden webserver where they were trying to sell web space on MY box.

The play was well acted by all. The comedy is apparent right from the beginning with Miss Skillon's complaints about the decorations of the pulpit. I identified with Miss Skillon's character, as annoying as she was trying to be proper. Great job there Therese Rudroff. Ray Shea played his part convincingly and he was about as stuffy as a Bishop could get. And Tim Cunningham played his character so well, you felt empathy for his confusions. The script unfortunately loses some steam towards the end. The character of the escaped Russian felt very contrived to me and the character motivations and behaviors seemed not to fit well to an otherwise excellent script. Sergeant Towers (Reginald Pierre) appearance in the last act to solve the case and to perhaps hold things together, was a lofty request, by any script. But despite it all, I still thoroughly enjoyed this play. The credit must go to the director Betsy Burnett-Belanger. She took some talented actors and some interesting characters and put it all together so the audience could get a good laugh.
The set was elegant, yet simple. There were stage exits representing several areas of the home, the upstage French doors leading out into the garden, the stairs leading into the rooms, the closet door, the exit right into the kitchen and the exit left for the entrance of the home was well thought out and put together. I liked how the set conveyed the scene in just one acting space of the living room. Good work by John Hann and Betsy Burnett-Belanger. Betsy was also responsible for the costumes and I especially loved Miss Skillon's costume. "How appropriate!" I thought. Light and sound was adequate. There was no need for anything fancy in this play and it all worked well together.

He also suggested that this dialog should be held by the language of the West. This could be done through training future preachers at the Azhar in English so that to be able to converse with Westerners and talk to them about Islam.Jessica Grove, who most recently appeared on Broadway in A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC with Bernadette Peters and Elaine Stritch, will join DUETS with The Write Teacher(s) at 54 Below on May 2.

President Obama has sent clear signals that he will pursue initiatives that he can move forward within existing laws and without the need to wrestle with Congress. Now is the time for the president to take action to protect communities from the threat of chemical disasters.
Until Congress stands up to the chemical industry lobby and does the right thing by reforming the Toxic Substances Control Act, parents everywhere will continue to read books about the issues, educate themselves about safer alternatives and take action. That's not hysterical. That's heroic.
The U.S. has identified safer ways to limit mold growth on citrus in Florida and California. The U.S. should demand the same from our overseas suppliers.

Peter King appears more interested in political posturing and appeasing chemical industry lobbyists than tackling real terrorist threats like the risk of a poison gas disaster in New York.
The EPA may be the most effective agency in the Obama administration and they are delivering on their legal mandate to protect the environment and human health.

The newly-constructed car completed its certification run earlier this month and was declared ready for residents and visitors.
"San Francisco's iconic cable cars are cherished throughout the world and bring many people back year after year to visit our city," said Mayor Newsom. "Those San Franciscans lucky enough to live or work near the cable car lines have arguably the best commute in the world."
Cable Car 15, which will serve the Powell-Mason Line, was built from the ground up using original blueprints by SFMTA artisans from the Woods Carpenter Shop, the Cable Machinery Support Shop, the Special Machine Shop and the Running Repair Shop.
Car.
The new cable car took four years to complete and cost $823,000 for materials and labor. The SFMTA Cable Car Rehabilitation program refurbishes and rebuilds San Francisco's cable cars and is funded from local, regional and federal capital sources that cannot be used for Muni operations.Asperger Syndrome

ARS scientists have developed a
genetic test that can tell the difference between a damaging pig virus--the
culprit behind Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS)--and a
harmless strain of the virus contained in a vaccine. The test is accurate and
takes only two days to report results after the virus is isolated.
PRRS is one of the most costly diseases that pork producers face worldwide.
Severe outbreaks of PRRS virus can sometimes occur even in vaccinated herds,
making it important to distinguish field strains from vaccine strains of the
virus. If an outbreak occurs, it's difficult for laboratory diagnosticians to
differentiate between pigs infected with a field strain of PRRS versus pigs that
carry the vaccine strain from routine inoculations.
To solve this problem, ARS researchers at the
National Animal Disease Center in
Ames, Iowa, developed the test, which pinpoints genetic markers in field and
vaccine strains. NOBL/Boehringer Ingelheim
Laboratories of Sioux Center, Iowa, participated with ARS in a Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement to evaluate this diagnostic test. ARS and
the company are negotiating an exclusive licensing agreement for the test.
Previously known as mystery pig disease, PRRS causes late-term fetal deaths,
abortions and the birth of weak pigs, and severe respiratory disease in young
pigs. PRRS virus has been found in 59.4 percent of unvaccinated swine herds
tested, according to a 1995 National
Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) study of 286 herds from 16 swine
producing states.

Why not turn your Santa’s grotto visit into a festive mini-break for the whole family by booking a family room in a low cost, central London hotel? Now is the right time to book your ideal bolthole in the city.
Once you’ve got the accommodation sorted, all that remains is to find your perfect Santa experience. Choose from these top three Santa’s Grottos in the capital for a guaranteed magical time with the kids:
Kids can play in real snow in the ice grotto, visit the wish fairy, dodge Jack Frost and get into a snowball fight with a naughty snowman at the Ice Grotto at Selfridges, and that’s all before they even meet the big guy himself!
Visitors to Selfridges in London from the 3rd September should also spend some time in the Christmas Shop – the store’s biggest ever! A gorgeous fairy-lit shopping wonderland, you’ll even be treated to traditional Christmassy scents such as spice cake, marzipan and pine while you browse.
Hamleys is offering something more than your typical Santa’s grotto experience this year, with the ‘I Met Father Christmas at Hamleys’ attraction. During this hour long experience, which includes a meal (food provided depends on the time of day), children will get to meet Santa and his elves and enjoy some fun Christmas themed stories and activities. Each child takes away a small gift.
Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park is a mesmerising Christmas experience for adults and children alike. A Christmas market, ice sculptures, ferris wheel, circus, ice skating rink and funfair rides all await, but those who want to meet the big guy himself should head straight to Santa Land where Santa waits in his cottage. All good little boys and girls get a small gift, making this a great value free grotto in the city. You may, however, find it hard to sneak little ones past the rides without putting your hand in your pocket!
The approach of Christmas presents a fantastic opportunity to make magical memories with your children. Make the best of those precious early years with a trip to our capital where you’ll find your pick of amazing Santa’s grottos.
Book your family accommodation, pack your camera and the kid’s Christmas lists, and you’re all set!HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — China has unveiled plans to build dozens of new subway and inner-city rail transit links, in what local media reports said would be a major infrastructure initiative to support the economy.
The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planning agency, approved 25 new rail projects totaling 800 billion yuan ($127 billion) over the next three to eight years, according to a report Thursday in the China Daily, which cited statements posted on the commission’s website Wednesday.
China’s state-controlled banks will extend loans to local governments, which are expected to be major investors in the projects, according to the report.
HSBC said in a note Thursday that the investments, equivalent to about 1.7% of gross domestic product, will boost infrastructure investment growth to 20% annualized in the coming months, up from 15% currently.
“Beijing is stepping up efforts to speed up infrastructure investment to hold up growth,” HSBC said.
HSBC said the investment would help to offset weakening property investment and slowing exports, adding that the economic impact may be felt in the October-December period.
Signs of a lost generation in Europe
Euro-zone youth unemployment will remain elevated for at least the next half-decade, say the authors of a report from the International Labor Organization. Photo: Getty Images
“We expect a fast filtering-through process to help generate a modest growth recovery in fourth quarter,” HSBC said.
In a sign that Beijing might be wary of racking up more ill-conceived infrastructure works, the China Daily report also cited an economist’s concern over the high cost of the projects, urging that they first be evaluated for merits in spurring regional investment and drawing higher tax revenues.
The economist said that with due care, the projects could end up adding to China’s bad-debt problem.
About 158 billion yuan will be allocated to extend and enhance subway projects in Shanghai, while 124 billion yuan will go to related projects in Guangzhou, a city in China’s south, the report said, citing estimates from the NDRC statements.
China’s so-called second-tier cities, including the southern port of Xiamen, and the northeastern city of Taiyuan, among others, are also slated to be included in the subway initiative.Anna Julia Haywood Cooper (Raleigh, August 10, 1858 – February 27, ... her PhD in history from the University of Paris-Sorbonne in 1924, Cooper became the ...

Anna Julia Hayward Cooper House at 201 T Street, NW in the LeDroit Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The building is a contributing property to the LeDroit Park Historic District. From Cultural Tourism DC: "Anna Julia Hayward Cooper (1858-1964), an educator, writer, and human rights leader, lived in this corner house for almost 50 years beginning in 1916. Cooper, born in Raleigh, North Carolina, graduated from Oberlin College in 1884. At the invitation of George F.T. Cook, the city's first black assistant superintendent of schools, she moved to Washington in 1887 to teach Latin at the Preparatory School for Colored Youth (now Dunbar High School). From 1902 to 1906 she served as school principal. Cooper also left her mark on Frelinghuysen University, a night school for working-class adults that opened in 1906. Frelinghuysen University was founded by Jesse Lawson (1856-1927) at 2011 Vermont Avenue, NW, the home of Lawson and his wife, Rosetta E. Coakley Lawson. Lawson established the university to provide education and training for poor and working-class adults. It held classes at various locations around the city. Cooper became the second president of the university in 1930, and classes were held in her home. Cooper was a prolific writer and civil and women's rights activist. In 1892 she published A Voice from the South, a book of feminist speeches and essays. She also helped to found the Colored Women's League of Washington, DC, a precursor to the National Association of Colored Women, and the Colored Women's YWCA (now the Phyllis Wheatley YWCA). In 1925 Cooper received the Ph.D. from the Sorbonne at age 66." Hello.

The dog poop got into the carpet in my car and smeared everywhere. Maybe I will make a video about it and the day that I had..lol. I was angry! I wondered why people don’t curb their own dogs.

The movie mode on the F50fd is nothing to write home about. While image size (640x480 pixels, VGA) is in line with most of the competition, the frame rate is at 25fps actually lower than on many comparable cameras including the F31fd (30fps). You're unlikely to notice the difference though and the F50fd produces slightly smaller movie files which gives you some leeway in terms of movie length although a movie file can be up to 2GB large.
The movies are recorded in motion JPEG (.avi) format, with fairly heavy compression; they work out at around 0.93 MB/sec, meaning you can fit approximately 18 minutes of 640x480 / 25fps footage onto a 1GB card.
The movie quality is pretty much what you would expect from a camera of this class and the image stabilization helps with framing at the long end of the lens (although you can't zoom neither optically nor digitally while recording a movie). Playback and recording options are limited to the bare minimum though. Some of the competitors give you more parameters and even editing functions to play with, none of which are available on the F50fd.Address:591 Baltimore Pike Bel Air, MD 21014

Chief Collins replaces Steve Jerauld, who announced his retirement in January.
Chief Collins is a 19-year veteran of the fire service, serving the past 17 years with Palm Beach County Fire Rescue. Prior to his selection, Chief Collins served as a deputy chief and fire marshal with PBC Fire Rescue.
“I am very pleased we found a chief officer within the ranks of the department,” said County Administrator Bob Weisman. The Board of County Commissioners unanimously ratified Chief Collins’ appointment.
Chief Collins is the current president of the Florida Fire Marshals and Inspectors Association. He holds a Master of Science degree from Palm Beach Atlantic University and a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Maryland.
Chief Collins will be just the third chief in PBC Fire Rescue history, following Jerauld and Herman Brice, who retired in 2009. Chief Jerauld began as a volunteer for Palm Beach Gardens Fire Rescue and was hired by Military Park Station 23 as a medic. After consolidation, he worked his way up the ranks, at one point becoming a fire marshall, just like Chief Collins.‘the musical torch’ by alexander schnell sramek, kevin yeo, seung youn lee, amy wallace and elisa magnini
the ‘musical torch’ results of the workshops were displayed for the first time to the world in a playful, exciting and interactive exhibition held at kings place on 3rd march 2012. the children’s hand sculptures provided the secret ingredient on a large-scale painting machine (which resembled a music box of giant proportions) with surprising results — so that the very hands that made the music also made the art. the painting machine was constructed with help from sam neal’s metal workshop completely made from the designer team. the structure was made by using traditional materials such as wood and metal and using old engineering techniques for the actual function. after a successful exhibition at the crossing in central saint martins college of art and the event – celebrating london 2012 evening reception, the muscial torch will continue touring.

Still combing the woods for a connection between Elizabeth (Baley- Bailey) TRENT who md. a William Spurgeon in Wash. Co., VA in 1805. No solid leads yet on where either of them died, but I believe he would have been back (aft.1810-11) in Abbotts Creek area of NC. She may well have also died there, but we now have a Patrick Co., VA dowery-land settlement event in 1811 that has an Elizabeth connected to it. I don't know if she was in NC or VA? Has any more turned up on this William Spurgeon - William B.(ailey) Spurgeon line or any more info to better back up the old Spurgeon Family Bible information? Sure would like to tie all these together and prove their connections to me. ThanksReviewed By Harry F (Newberry, FL) Reviewed for a 2011 Chevy Colorado —4/27/2013 9:21 AM

A scratchy recording of a vaguely familiar tune plays in the small University of Miami classroom where Paul Austerlitz lectures to a handful of students on the social history of Caribbean music. As a man sings in phlegmy French over lilting guitar and soft percussive beats, Austerlitz explains that the song, "Choucounne," was popular in turn-of-the-century Haiti. Smiling cagily, the teacher turns up the volume a bit, then reveals to his students that this arrangement was later adapted to become the Harry Belafonte hit and steel-pan cruise ship standard "Yellow Bird."
The undergraduate music students stare blankly -- none of them has ever heard of "Yellow Bird." Never mind. The professor shrugs and turns to a stack of videos on the table in front of him. Today's class is dedicated to merengue, the ubiquitous Dominican dance music that Austerlitz has been researching for over a decade. Temple University Press has just published his book on the genre, Merengue: Dominican Music and Dominican Identity. A merengue compilation CD, the companion to the book, is due out this week on the Cambridge-based Rounder label.
Austerlitz's students may not realize it, but "Choucounne" is a well-known example of early merengue, known in French as meringue and called mereng in Haitian Creole. Austerlitz writes these terms on the blackboard, emphasizing that although merengue is now commonly identified with the Dominican Republic, the music is rooted in pan-Caribbean colonial rhythms, particularly the French-derived danza. He turns off the lights and shows a succession of festive amateur videos: Vodou-influenced carnival processions in Haiti and the Dominican Republic; a black fife and drum core in rural Mississippi, followed by remarkably similar footage of musicians playing in a Dominican Christmas celebration; a couple dancing suggestively to a merengue band that plays an African-tinged rhythm reminiscent of Cuban son montuno.
"I want you to hear the entire soundscape that merengue grew up in," urges Austerlitz, a boyish 39-year-old who is spruced up in a suit for a meeting later with the Dominican consul. "You should understand how people felt about this music at different moments in its history."
Austerlitz is passionate about merengue, and in his book he broadens its definition for those who have had little exposure to it outside of the thumping electronic variety commonly played on Latin radio. He documents the complex history and stylistic variations of the effervescent party music -- traditionally played on accordion, saxophone, a drum called a tambora, and gYira (metal scraper). And Austerlitz delves into the social and political significance of merengue in its native country, where for some Dominicans it is a source of national pride, and for others an imperialist form of syncretic music that should be disdained because of its European origins.
A saxophone and clarinet player, Austerlitz started playing merengue by default. He was really interested in Latin jazz; after graduating from Bennington College, he moved back to his native New York City, trying to make some money from his music. "I played in Latin jazz groups and we didn't have any gigs," he recalls. "Since I played saxophone, people started saying, 'You like Latin music. Play merengue. It uses a sax and you can get gigs.'"
He did get some jobs, and even performed with Joseito Mateo, known as the king of merengue, and enjoyed the whole scene so much that he moved to a Dominican neighborhood in Upper Manhattan. Austerlitz, whose mother is from Finland and whose father was a Romanian linguist, learned Spanish and grew a mustache that made him look macho -- he could pass for Dominican. "People called me a Latin wannabe," he laughs. "That was devastating at the time, but it was one of the things that prompted me to think more about what I was doing. It's good to immerse yourself in your subject, but you don't want to lose touch with the strengths you have as an outsider."
Austerlitz subsequently decided to study ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University, where he started his academic research into merengue. Since 1985, he has gone to the Dominican Republic four times for extended periods, most recently on a Fulbright Fellowship last year. On the island, the fact that he could play music along with his sources gave him access to rural musicians who were impressed with his playing and were happy to share their stories.
"Most of my success as an ethnomusicologist has come from being a player," asserts Austerlitz, who recently produced a recording of his original Latin jazz music, featuring Cuban Grammy winner Gonzalo Rubalcaba on piano. He's also looking for a new day job, since his yearlong temporary contract with UM was not renewed. "Playing and researching Caribbean music have been really intertwined for me. I often don't know where one ends and the other picks up," he says.
Merengue compiles the findings that Austerlitz first published in his master's thesis and doctoral dissertation. Unfortunately, the text retains a lot of stiff, academic language; footnote citations that appear in parentheses throughout the book are annoying. Nevertheless, Austerlitz has written a definitive book on merengue that is an important addition to the limited bibliography of informative English-language texts on Latin music. Those who don't want to tackle the book can glean a lot of information from the CD, a sampler of historical and regional styles of merengue with fifteen songs compiled by Austerlitz, who also wrote the explanatory liner notes.
One interesting.”Silence and Solitude
I was raised quietly. My mother was a country girl and loved to hear nature around her, so we never had music playing in the background and had strictly designated times to watch TV. She often avoided conversation too, much to my chagrin when I was trying to get her to answer my endless prattle. So you'd think I would have fallen easily into patterns of silence and solitude when I became a Christian. But I didn't for one reason: the message that came to me loudest when I became a Christian was that I should serve.
And I wanted to serve. As a non-Christian, I'd lived a self-centered life. So serving was a path of discipleship as I died to self and learned to live for others. But as the years progressed, my service became the enemy of my soul, rather than its friend.
My problem was that I thought I had to serve sacrificially all the time. I developed a sort of survivor's guilt that others suffered more than I did so I had to make up for it by laying down my life whenever I was asked. I would only say no if I really and truly had a conflict, and then I felt guilty about it.
My wake-up call came at a particularly busy time of my life when I rarely had a quiet moment and pushed myself to the point of exhaustion. One day, when I was supposed to help a friend decorate for her daughter's wedding, I became dizzy and stayed that way for three months. Sometimes it was so debilitating that I couldn't read, watch TV, or hold a conversation. At times, I had to lie on my back, without turning on either side, or my world would spin out of control. The only option left to me was to lie quietly and listen for God's voice, which turned out to be the best option of all. My experience was summed up in Psalm 62:1-2, "I wait quietly before God, for my victory comes from him. He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress where I will never be shaken." After that experience, I never wanted to live without that kind of stillness again.
When I finally returned to normalcy, I changed my habits. I became a lot more selective what I said yes to; but most of all, I made sure I had times of solitude and silence. Yes, I'm afraid I'll get dizzy again; but even more, I hunger to be in God's presence, even if he is silent.
The Importance of Solitude
We may certainly hear God's voice when we are with others. Perhaps something hits you in a sermon or a friend says just the right thing at the right time, and you know it's meant for you. But we almost all need filters. Sometimes something in a sermon or a friend's word will steer you the wrong way—not because what they said wasn't true, but because it wasn't the message you needed to hear.
For example, when I was unable to say no to whatever someone asked of me, I didn't need to hear a sermon on serving, even if everyone else in the congregation did. Or if a friend enthusiastically talked about volunteering at the homeless shelter, I needed to let that go past me—even though it was the best thing in the world for her. For you it may be that you have a problem with feeling false guilt, so you don't need to hear a sermon on how sinful you are, even though the person sitting next to you is in rebellion and needs exactly that message. Or maybe you battle being over-disciplined, so you don't need to hear how an undisciplined friend is learning to regiment her life.
That's why we need alone time with God. We need to take time to hear what messages he has for us. If you are alone in God's presence, you are making yourself available to hear anything he wants to say to you. You are coming to him open for a change of direction, conviction of sin, a gentle nudging, or an all-out life revision.<<The baseless Statehouse narrative that universities are out of control and ripe for cutting got personal last week for Wichita, which learned that legislative budget proposals could mean the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita would lose the program for first- and second-year medical students and 15 medical resident positions.
Such unacceptable cuts would be as bad for the state’s health as they would be for Wichita’s economy and status as a medical hub, because of the Wichita campus’ crucial role in training and supplying family physicians statewide. And in rolling back the 2011 expansion of the Wichita campus from a two-year to a four-year medical school, KU and the state would be breaking the trust of Wichita-area leaders who were part of raising millions of dollars privately for the expansion.
Other potential consequences at KU sound bad, too, including the closing of the KU School of Medicine-Salina, reducing admitted nursing students by 50 and risking nonrenewal of the National Cancer Institute designation.
But every part of the Kansas Board of Regents system would be affected, whether what prevails is the House’s 4 percent cut (a loss of $29 million in operating dollars and $10 million in salary cuts) or the Senate’s 2 percent cut ($15.2 million less). Briefing the regents last week, the university presidents forecast faculty layoffs, fewer and larger classes, and higher tuition.
“Did we make somebody mad? Why are we such a target?” wondered regent Christine Downey-Schmidt of Inman about the legislative target on higher ed.
As regent Robba Moran observed with similar frustration, other states view universities as promoting economic growth and are stepping up their investment accordingly.
Yet in Kansas, some lawmakers are questioning the return on the state’s investment in higher education and complaining about steady tuition increases – hikes made necessary because overall state funding for universities has dropped 8 percent since 2008.
Much of the legislative budget work ahead is riding on how the two chambers resolve their differences on taxes, and especially whether the House relents and agrees with the governor and the Senate to extend the current 6.3 percent sales-tax rate after July 1. It’s possible that Friday’s slightly improved revenue estimates will give lawmakers more room to work with.
And let it be said that the state’s cash-flow problems are due to Gov. Sam Brownback’s 2012 tax-cut plan.
But Brownback, who will kick off a campus tour Monday with visits to Wichita State University and Butler Community College, recognizes that higher education is vital for economic growth, which is why he prefers to keep universities’ funding flat in the next state budget.
Now, he must make that case to lawmakers starting with House Appropriations Committee Chairman Marc Rhoades, R-Newton, and Senate Ways and Means Committee Chairman Ty Masterson, R-Andover.
And those legislators and others from the Wichita area need to be mindful of the harm that cutting higher ed would do to the region they represent.
For the editorial board, Rhonda HolmanWe cannot always stop our lives every time we are confronted with Arab terror. Arab terror is our daily reality.
If selected for publication, it will appear as soon as possible on Haaretz.com.
A barrage of rockets was fired into Israel yesterday evening, apparently in response to the targeted killing of an Islamic Jihad operative in Rafah earlier in the day. Yet despite the renewed rocket attacks, the Israel Defense Forces said an escalation in the south is unlikely.
Late last night, a rocket was shot down by the Iron Dome system near Be'er Sheva, while another one fell on or near a home on Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, lightly wounding a child.
Seven rockets fired earlier in the evening fell in open areas and caused no injuries or damage.
In a joint Israel Air Force-Shin Bet security service operation, Ismail Al-Asmar, 34, was blown up in his car very early yesterday morning. Two other people with him were lightly wounded.
IDF sources say that Asmar transferred funds to the Popular Resistance Committees activists and the Egyptian terrorists who carried out the terror attack near Eilat last Thursday and who were planning another attack from the Sinai peninsula.
Islamic Jihad fired two mortars into Israel yesterday morning, in an immediate response to the assassination. There were no injuries.
Following the mortars, the Home Front Command instructed residents near the Gaza border to stay close to protected areas and ordered mass events canceled in the south.
In the middle of the afternoon, however, the command decided to reduce the alert level. During a meeting between Home Front Command commander Maj. Gen. Eyal Eisenberg and Ashkelon Mayor Benny Vaknin, it was agreed to allow the four-day Briza Music Festival in the city, scheduled to open last night, to take place.
But as evening approached, the defense establishment got warning that Islamic Jihad was planning rocket launches; the alert level was raised again and yesterday's performances were canceled. A new security assessment will determine the fate of today's scheduled performances.
Other events canceled yesterday included the Jerusalem Festival, scheduled to take place in Netivot; and two soccer games, one between Betar Jerusalem and Hapoel Be'er Sheva, meant to take place in Be'er Sheva, and one between Ashdod F.C. and Ironi Ramat Hasharon, scheduled to take place in Ashdod.
Between 7 and 9 P.M., seven rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel. Five fell in areas belonging to the Eshkol Regional Council, one fell near Ofakim, and the seventh fell south of Ashkelon. The Popular Front claimed responsibility for the Ofakim rocket.
The air force responded by attacking the Islamic Jihad cell that launched the rockets from Gaza City, killing one terrorist and wounding several others.
Hamas leader Mahmoud Al-Zahar, meanwhile, termed the terror attack last Thursday near Eilat "strange," saying Israel had exploited the attack to retaliate in the Gaza Strip.
He noted that no group had taken responsibility for the attack. Israel, however, insists that the Popular Resistance Committees were responsible for it.
Although rocket firings resumed yesterday after two days of relative quiet, the defense establishment believes there will be no major escalation in the coming weeks, as Hamas has a clear interest in maintaining its self-declared cease-fire.
Also yesterday, a woman was wounded when a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip fell into the Egyptian area of Rafah.Results per page:

Google takes a step closer to establishing a monopoly over web services. They have acquired Feedburner, the ultimate in feed management for $100 million. Although Feedburner has less than half a million publishers that use its services to redirect feeds, Google has plenty to gain from their subscriber counts and Feedburner Advertisment Network that monetizes your feeds.
I agree with Amit (Digital Inspiration) that I feel a wee bit uncomfortable with Google’s increasing monopoly especially regarding monetizing options on the web. It is akin to putting all your web revenue options eggs in one basket. Google decides to piss on you and you literally vanish off the web. I understand they operate through a free market mechanism and we are free to go elsewhere if we feel queasy but honestly, there aren’t any viable other options. I guess I’ll just take my chances and hope for the best.
Feedburner is one of my favorite services that I use for this blog and DesiPundit. As I am a complete stat whore, I love the way it keeps a tab of my RSS subscribers through the Feedburner Replacement Plugin [modified version]. Heck, I even sport a Feedburner sticker on my laptop cover. So Google, please don’t mess with a good product and don’t be evil with my data.

The crews, the ambition, the outfits and sense of adventure. This isn't the first time I've mentioned it, it certainly won't be the last. Even in the modern day with the highest spec gear and equipment available, with advanced technology and communication it seems an unbelievable slog, striving for survival in the face of adversity and the most unforgiving of nature at it's most fierce. So it almost seems a preposterous thought that the likes of Scott and Shackleton were going off out into the unknown in hand made boots and wrapped in sheepskin all those years ago.
The BFI have restored Herbert Ponting's record of Captain Scott's tragic expedition to the South Pole for this year's London Film Festival which was the film to see, recently released at selected theatres, this, I'd imagine would be an awe-inspiring event in cinema. A hundred years ago the British Antarctic Expedition (1910-1913) led by the courageous Scott set out on its ill-fated race to the South Pole. Joining Scott on board the Terra Nova was official photographer and cinematographer and all round hero of One-ups' Herbert Ponting, the famous imagery captured all those years ago have fuelled our imagination for many years. Ponting filmed almost every aspect of the expedition: the scientific work, life in camp and of course the local wildlife - including the characterful Adélie penguins. This is one of the most humbling stories of history, as the Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen pipped them to the most vital of posts, so near, yet so far. Captain Scotts tragic story left a lasting legacy for all in the ultimate battle between man and nature.
Most importantly, Ponting recorded the preparations for the assault on the Pole, giving us a real sense of the challenges faced by the expedition. In 1924 he re-edited it into this remarkable feature, complete with vivid tinting and toning. The BFI National Archive has restored the film; the alien beauty of the landscape is brought dramatically to life and the world of the expedition revealed in brilliant detail. Restored with exquisite tinting and toning which adds a new depth combined with added intenisty from a score by contemporary composer Simon Fisher Turner.
The Great White Silence, Directed by Herbert G Ponting, is currently showing in selected cinemas.

While these sunglasses can’t make me as good a golfer as Hunter Mahan, I can at least benefit from the style and performance of the Under Armour Hunter Mahan “Drive” sunglasses.
UA Drive Sunglasses Features
The frames of the UA Drive sunglasses are ultra-light and very tough. They’re made from a hybrid of titanium and the plastic “Grimalid.”
The “ArmourSight” lenses deliver up to 20% enhanced vision and are very tough. They’re roughly 10X as strong as regular sunglass lenses. That may come in handy when some some 37 handicapper shanks one straight at your face. The lenses feature great contrast and “object illumination,” which helps when playing sports like baseball, or…. GOLF!
The nose piece is adjustable and features soft, comfortable pads. That’s a great thing for me since I have a Greek nose which has been broken twice.
If you like to accessorize, like all stylish golfers seem to do these days, the logos on the sides of the shades are removable with multiple colors available.
Most importantly, the glasses provide 100% protection against UVC, UVA and UVB rays.
Colors
The UA Drive sunglasses are currently available in two colors: White and Satin Black. Obviously my model pictured in this review is the Satin Black version.
On The Course – At The Barbeque
The clarity and contrast of the UA Drives is fantastic. The details one can make out on the course are very beneficial. Reading greens is great. Subtle undulations and breaks one may not be able to see with the naked eye are much easier to see.
The coverage of the lenses is such that I don’t really see the edges. No visual distractions. sometimes I forget I’m wearing them because of the wide coverage and the comfort.
The fit of the glasses, especially after tweaking the nose pieces, is great. No slippage or any movement during my spastic golf swing.
Last but not least, the style of these shades is manly and unique looking.
Conclusion
Under Armour has built up a solid and very reputable brand in the sports apparel world. Their products are well known for being high performance, durable and especially stylish. The $134.99 (retail) UA Drive sunglasses continue on and further build that reputation.
Well played.

The rise and fall of the Muslim Brotherhood
By TAYLOR KENNEMORE
05/11/2014
A revolution, an electoral victory and a coup. What’s next for the Islamic movement in Egypt?
The hopeful era of the revolution is dead. In May 2012, Muslim Brotherhood member Mohammed Morsi became Egypt’s first democratically elected president. Just one year later, the Egyptian military staged a coup, ousted the former president, and declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization.
The Muslim Brotherhood, banned from political participation for decades, saw a way out through the revolution. But their seize-the-moment attitude backfired, prolonging the national crisis. How did the Muslim Brotherhood transform so dramatically from political victors to a declared terrorist organization? Morsi’s electoral victory was unsurprising considering the Muslim Brotherhood’s superior organization skills, its close-to-the-people image, and the opposition’s failure to unify. Empty promises and power-grabbing stunts began Morsi’s decline, but his disregard for Egypt’s elite constituents ultimately instigated the military coup.
Morsi fell through on his promises to clean up the city, decrease traffic jams and appoint a Copt vice president.
More importantly, Morsi announced a hasty conclusion to the drafting of the new constitution. A referendum shortly thereafter was nearly exclusively composed of Islamists.
He then made a glaring mistake: ridding the constitutional court judges of their power and declaring the president’s decisions immune from judicial oversight. Cairo resident Koert Debeuf described this constitutional declaration as Morsi’s “mini-coup.”
Morsi also assumed a maverick foreign policy and called for a jihad against Syria’s Assad regime, an event that would have delivered a big blow to Egypt’s already suffering economy.
Morsi was not answering to the will of the Egyptian people, but rather aligning his political actions with the Muslim Brotherhood’s interests. His partyline- first agenda neglected the needs of Egypt’s pluralistic society.
Some suggest that Morsi could not have accomplished anything without his power-grabbing schemes due to the lack of cooperation from the existing bureaucracy. However, Morsi did have the ability to appoint governors, who had much influence over election arrangements. Morsi exercised his Islamist favoritism by filling 10 of the 27 governorships with Muslim Brotherhood officials. The appointment of Adel el-Khayat to administer the district most vital to Egypt’s tourism industry especially fueled accusations of Morsi’s attempt to monopolize political power for the Brotherhood. Adel el-Khayat was a member of al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, a radical religious movement that claimed credit for the deaths of 58 tourists at a temple in Luxor in 1997.
The gravest mistake Morsi made was his comprehensive loss of support from the Egyptian elite and military. These important constituents were the very groups with the ability to oust the president.
In just one year’s time, Morsi managed to first deliver tremendous hope and relief to a nation and shortly thereafter return the country to a state of crisis. On July 3, 2013, the Egyptian army overthrew President Morsi and in December of the same year designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization following a car bombing outside a government security building in Mansoura killing at least 15.
Although parallels can be drawn between the Brotherhood’s ideological platform and that of some Islamist terrorist groups, the Brotherhood does not fall under the same category in terms of its action and strategy. But the army did have much to gain from portraying the democratically elected party it displaced as a terrorist group, positioning the undemocratic nature of the coup itself as less important than Morsi’s corruption.
The Brotherhood’s lack of representation in Egypt’s next political transition will likely force the Brotherhood to resort to violence or terror tactics in order to make their political goals known. To combat this, the Egyptian government needs to offer the Brotherhood a peaceful means of participation in Egypt’s future, namely the right to compete in elections.
Infrastructure must be built from the top-down in order to establish new democratic institutions, and society must accept the democratic process for which they call so vigorously.
But is Egypt ready for democracy? Democracy requires a separation of powers, which often creates a complex bureaucracy that complicates the completion of any task in a timely fashion. What Egypt needs is stability, and it needs it fast. Perhaps there is merit in the idea that democracy is not the first solution to Egypt’s political crisis, but rather a long-term solution after political and economic security have been reinstated.
However, the question here is how the Muslim Brotherhood can reintegrate itself into Egyptian society. Two options exist for the Brotherhood to participate in this stability: 1) Pursue its ideological goals by limiting activity to that of a social movement and giving up on all political involvement temporarily, or 2) Use their influential role to guarantee rights for all, including Islamists, in a pluralistic democratic political arrangement.
On the other hand, Egypt needs to 1) distance itself from its negative Islamist past, 2) reestablish the legitimacy of any working government within the state, and 3) accept the principles of a democratic political system.

Artist: DJ Scrilla
Producer: DeMarvelous Carter [for Legacy Productions]
Album: Untitled (TBD)
Avg Rating:
3.9 ( 22 votes )
I hardly need to tell you this record’s an exclusive world premiere; DJ $crilla makes that crystal clear by personally shouting-out DJBooth.net not once but twice in its 3:41 running time. What I will say is that this record’s original as all get-out, and catchy to boot. Judging by the title, you’d expect I’m Hollywood to center around the subjects of cash and flash, which it does, but don’t get it confused—DeMarvelous Carter‘s playfully off-kilter boardwork and memorable chopped-and-screwed/chipmunk hook sets the tone for a unconventional celebration of the fast life, and $crilla and fellow Cleveland native Money Merchandise more than match the instrumental’s exuberance in their energetic verses. As if that’s not enough to ensure I’m Hollywood stays in your head for the next few days, the twosome even team up for a little line-trading midway through (which, if you tuned in for yesterday’s features, was also my favorite thing about U-N-I‘s Reach for the Sky). This cut can be found on $crilla’s yet-untitled sophomore album when it hits stores and online retailers sometime this fall.

Updated
US soldier Bradley Manning has been jailed for 35 years for leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables and war logs to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. A military court martial last month convicted Private Manning of 20 charges including espionage. Now it's applied the full weight of that verdict on the 25 year old.

TONY EASTLEY: US soldier Bradley Manning has been jailed for 35 years for leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables and war logs to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
A military court martial last month convicted Private Manning of 20 charges including espionage. Now he's been sentenced.
North America correspondent Jane Cowan reports.
JANE COWAN: When he orchestrated the biggest intelligence leak in US history, Private Manning was a low level intelligence analyst freshly deployed to Iraq.
By the time he gets out of prison he may well be a 60 year old man who's spent more of his life behind bars than as a free man.
The military judge Colonel Denise Lind took less than two minutes to hand down a 35 year sentence.
Private Manning stood to attention, showing no emotion. And immediately after the judge banged the gavel and left, the military guards flanking the 25 year old hustled him from the room.
His sister wept and half a dozen supporters in the back of the room stood and shouted words of encouragement, yelling "We'll keep fighting for you, Bradley" and "You're a hero".
Defence lawyer David Coombs says behind closed doors Private Manning stayed calm.
DAVID COOMBS: After he was sentenced, myself and others were in tears. And he looks at me and he says, "it's okay, I know you did your best".
JANE COWAN: David Coombs plans to ask the Obama administration to pardon his client or commute the sentence to time already served. Speaking to reporters, he read a statement from Bradley Manning.
DAVID COOMBS (reading a statement from Bradley Manning): I understand that my actions violated the law. I regret if my actions hurt anyone or harmed the United States. It was never my intent to hurt anyone.
JANE COWAN: The sentence roughly splits the difference between the 60 years prosecutors had wanted to send a message to other would-be leakers and the 20 years Private Manning exposed himself to by pleading guilty to a raft of lesser charges.
WikiLeaks is calling it a "strategic victory", given the charges could have attracted life behind bars. And now with a best case scenario parole opportunity in seven years, Private Manning could be free within a decade.
But it's still the longest sentence ever handed down in a case involving a leak of US government information to the media.
Private Manning's leaks exposed the abuse of detainees by Iraqi officers under the watch of American forces.
Among the more shocking material he leaked was the cockpit video of a US Apache helicopter crew firing on suspected insurgents in Baghdad but killing a Reuters news photographer and his driver.
Michael Ratner is the US lawyer for Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and says the sentence is outrageously long.
MICHAEL RATNER: And I find it particularly a nasty piece of business when the people who actually carried out a lot of these crimes are not investigated or prosecuted. So 35 years for a truth teller and we need more and more truth tellers in this country.
JANE COWAN: Private Manning's case is eligible for an automatic appeal that's likely to start late next year.
This is Jane Cowan reporting for AM.COMMANDER LESLIE HULL-RYDE: Good afternoon, everyone. This afternoon, the acting director of the Federal Voting Assistance Program, Ms. Pam Mitchell, will be joining us to talk about some of the initiatives that they have implemented for this election cycle. As this is Ms. Mitchell's inaugural briefing in the press briefing room, I would ask, please, that you would identify yourselves by your name and the outlet that you represent, please. Thank you.
MS. PAM MITCHELL: Good afternoon. Voting assistance for our absentee military and overseas citizen voters has never been better. Why do I say that? I say it because of all the things that we've put in place by way of outreach and tools to help them register, obtain a ballot, and exercise their vote.
We have online wizards. What are online wizards? Well, think of anything that you do, you go online, you have dropdown menus, and things that literally walk you through step-by-step how to do something, in this case, registering for and obtaining an absentee ballot. The online wizards even go so far as to put in the right address on the mailing envelope that you can then print out and mail in..
We use e-mail blasts starting last January to every member with a dot-mil e-mail address to remind them how they can register to vote and that it's time to vote. And, in fact, as we are here today, we have an e-mail blast going out right now.
We have a call center that operates five days a week from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. that can be used by voters worldwide to obtain assistance on how to file an absentee ballot. It can also be used by state and local election officials for questions. And we have voting assistance officers who've been around for years, and we have installation voter assistance offices which were prescribed by the 2009 MOVE Act (Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment).
Now, you may have heard that there was an I.G. [Department of Defense Inspector General] report just released that calls attention in particular to the installation voter assistance offices. The contact information that they used to try to establish contact with the installation voter assistance offices very simply was outdated. Why was it outdated? Because in a military environment, things change. Military members are reassigned. They may be reassigned to other posts; they may be reassigned on the same post or base. Things change. We have joint bases that grow. We have other kinds of things that happen so that in any military environment, whether the subject be voting or anything else, phone numbers change and e-mail addresses change.
We certainly agree with the I.G. that the most important thing we can do is to find the most effective way to maintain assistance for all of our absentee voters, and we are absolutely continued -- I'm sorry, we are absolutely committed to continue working with all stakeholders, including the Congress, to make sure that voting assistance remains the best it's ever been.
I spent 25 years in the Army, and I voted absentee. And I can tell you that I only wish that when I was in uniform, I had access to the tools and resources that are available to our men and women today.
May I have the first question? Please.
Q: Hi, it's Jennifer Griffin with Fox News. The Military Voter Protection Project says that absentee ballot requests are down significantly, particularly in some of the swing states like Ohio. They gave some numbers. Can you explain why the absentee ballot requests are down this year?
MS. MITCHELL: Well, let me talk about what we know. We maintain a record of downloads from our website of the Federal Postcard Application (FPCA), which is in itself a request to register to vote, as well as a request for an absentee ballot. If we look back at the last presidential election, 2004, for which there was a sitting incumbent in an uncontested primary in one of the parties, we are essentially running neck-and-neck with the numbers of FPCAs downloaded. So between 2004 and 2012, we are very close to running the same amount of downloads.
Now, we do not monitor the universe of the ways in which people may register to vote or obtain ballots, because while they can get them through our website, they can also talk to voting assistance officers, either at the unit or installation level. They can go directly to states and localities, and there are also private parties who maintain websites to offer these services. And I've talked to any number of folks over the last couple of months who, in fact, do go to different places to get this information.
Q: So do you reject criticism that the department has not done enough to help the military voting population get these ballots and vote?
MS. MITCHELL: I strongly believe that voting assistance is the best that it has ever been.
Next, please? Yes?
Q: (Inaudible) with Stars and Stripes. Back to that I.G. report. Is there any reason to believe that the troops have those new updated numbers? I'm sure if there's a forwarding number, some machine that tells folks that number has moved, the I.G. folks would have -- would have called back. Is it possible that none of the troops are going to be able to get through, either?
MS. MITCHELL: That's a great question, and let me tell you what we've done about that. We have personally called all 221 offices, and we are certain that the information posted to our website is correct, with e-mail and phone number information and, in many cases, actual locations of where these offices are on an installation. We are committed, between now and the general election, of calling each of the 221 offices every single week to make sure that we have the most updated information.
Yes?
Q: Hi, Andrew Tilghman with the Military Times. In the I.G. report, it appeared that the department indicated that it really didn't think that these offices were really all that effective and that might be one of the reasons why they hadn't been prioritized. I'm wondering, is that -- you've mentioned social media a number of times. Is it your sense that these offices are kind of, you know, prescribed by Congress as they are, that these offices are not really cost-effective or not as efficient for today's -- particularly the younger voters?
MS. MITCHELL: We're committed to evaluating all of the tools in our arsenal, if you will, to include those offices to determine, what are the most effective things going forward, what are the best ways to reach our absentee voters? And we will work with the Congress and with all affected stakeholders, including the services, to continue to take a look at that and refine the way in which we conduct outreach to absentee voters.
Q: If I could follow up, though, what is the current assessment? Do you feel like those offices are an effective tool?
MS. MITCHELL: I feel that those offices are an effective tool for some voters. So that is to say that they are one of many tools in the arsenal, and our job is to provide assistance to a multitude of absentee voters. So are they effective for some voters? Yes, they are. But we will continue, as I said, to evaluate the best methods of outreach across the universe of the voters that we support.
Q: Can you just outline for a military voter what is the process they should go through between now and the election date? What are the deadlines they need to meet to get an absentee ballot? Just simply outline, what's the easiest way to do this, if you're a military voter?
MS. MITCHELL: Okay. Well, they have a number of options. They can certainly visit with their unit voting assistance officer. They can visit with an installation voter assistance office. Or they can go online to our website. They can also go directly to state or local jurisdiction websites as available. They can use any of those methods to obtain a request to register to vote, as well as to obtain an absentee ballot. And, again, our wizard will actually walk them through the process.
As for deadlines, across the board, it would probably be a good general statement to say about 30 days before the election. But I would rather refer you to our website, where we list the actual information from all of the states.
Q: What is your website?
MS. MITCHELL: It's fvap.gov.
Q: What's your -- what's your metric for success when it comes to Election Day? If we do see that the -- the absentee ballot numbers are lower or even on par with 2004, is that a failure for the office?
MS. MITCHELL: What we are focused on is providing assistance. That means making sure that people have the information, the tools, and the resources that they need to decide to register to vote and to request an absentee ballot and then to cast their vote. At the end of the day, what we're trying to do is to make sure that they have everything they need, again, to exercise that right to vote.
It is a personal responsibility to actually execute that. So we don't believe that, for example, at this point in time, that voter registration is an accurate way to depict whether or not voter assistance is effective.
Do I have another question?
CMDR HULL-RYDE: Ms. Mitchell, thank you for coming today to answer any questions. If you have any questions, please feel free, as Ms. Mitchell said, to take a look at their website, which is, the Federal Assistance -- or, excuse me, Federal Voting Assistance Program. Thank you.
MS. MITCHELL: Thank you.Stage Door Players Present GODSPELL 2012, Now thru 6/8

Lack of ambition will destroy the club as surely as eggs are veggs! The lack of ambition will stop players wanting to come and speed up players wanting to leave! All players want to be seen to be in a winning and ambitious team its good for their market value! Nobody want to sell themselves short, or?
As you say what defines a big club? Well I still see us as a giant, no not a sleeping one, we have proved that given success,we can fill the ground and probably match the geordies 50k which would put us up with the big boys, I still see us as a top 6 club, but you need to be ambitious.
Tom, I think the old fashioned phrase was "it's come to a pretty pass". It has come to a pretty pass when Leeds supporters start to admire the ambition of their local rivals.
Bates and Grayson (Grayson in particular as an avowed Leeds fan) must know how they are winding up supporters with this repeat pattern of no news, no signings, false promises bullshit - it was the same last year and during the January transfer window this year. Why do you think they are doing it? Leeds' greatest asset is its fans and this management regime is not only pissing us off but driving us away - already there is talk on supporters' boards about boycotting games.
Bates may want to wait until 2013 (to suit his financial interests) before Leeds makes a serious push for promotion to the Premiership but we have the 2011/12 season to get through first. If nothing is delivered this coming term, he can forget any ambition he may have for the Club in the future; and forget platitudes about the glass being half full - the glass will be smashed!

Andy there’s nothing bad or disloyal in giving credit where credit is due. Maybe we would not be in such a state if SG had the same backing and support that Clarke had over the last couple of years. I remain optimistic about our future and see no virtue in the opposite. My glass will continue to be half full and will not be allowed to be spilled or smashed. I still believe SG is the man for the job. Judge him in two weeks time when funds will be replenished from the salaries saved from outgoing players. I have heard from a reliable source that a new shirt sponsorship deal has been secured and for a significantly larger sum than first anticipated.?

6. ABS Reaches New Highs in 2009
Deliveries from what ABS Chairman and CEO Robert D. Somerville characterized as a “very robust orderbook” pushed the society to a new record fleet high of 159.5m gt by the end of 2009, the society’s leader told the Annual Meeting of Members in New York. He added that the growth has continued unabated during the first quarter of 2010, with the fleet reaching 162m gt by the end of March.
The year-on-year tonnage increase of 15.4m gt was the largest ever recorded by ABS, outpacing even the rapid expansion that occurred during the last great shipbuilding boom of the late 1970s. Somerville acknowledged that there had been “a manageable number” of orders cancelled during the year but “more significantly, what we found was that many owners worked with the shipyards to defer deliveries or to substitute different ship types or sizes for those on order.”
The result, he told the members attending the meeting, has been beneficial to the society. “We can now look to a more rational workflow over an extended period,” he said. He noted that the society had won new class contracts for more than 10m gt in 2009, during what was the most depressed shipbuilding market in recent memory. The new orders meant that the overall ABS orderbook declined by only 5m gt year-on-year.
“We are very conscious of the cyclical swings, the feast and famine years, of the shipping and offshore industries and the successes of the last few years have meant we are now very well positioned to deal with the expected future softness of the newbuilding market,” Somerville said.
The ABS chief executive told the society’s members that “the future is much on our minds at present.” Referring to the changes in membership of IACS, changes related to equipment certification imposed by the European Commission and other stimuli, he said that “class, in the future, will have to evolve. It is clear to me that, for a wide variety of very understandable reasons, class has yet to position itself for the 21st century.”
Acknowledging the strictures under which class operates, he suggested that “perhaps the hardest challenge will be to convince many in the maritime community to change their approach to class and accept we have a common interest in promoting safety.”
For example, he noted that some forward looking owners have realized “the potency of sharing operational data with class, but they are still the minority despite the potential benefits.”
Somerville went on to outline a future based on a data sharing partnership between class and the operator that has the potential to not only increase safety but also offer the operator a more efficient, less intrusive survey regime over the life of a ship.
He cited as an example, the recent program worked out between class, some prominent flag States and a major container operator whereby, through sharing data, the drydock interval for selected new ships has been pushed back from a five year to a seven and half year cycle.
“We need to move from a traditional policeman role to one where we can more effectively partner with our clients with the ultimate objective of more safely and efficiently maintaining their fleets. The more we share information, the easier it will be to achieve those goals.”The Nike Air Mag auction officially ended Sunday and the money raised for Parkinson’s disease research has been counted.

REPORTER: Gillibrand will be one of several elected officials to address the Hispanic Clergy Organization at their banquet in the Bronxdale section of the Bronx. A spokesman for the new senator says it's part of a number of stops she's been making to understand the issues facing the diverse number of groups in the city. Gillibrand had been the congresswoman from a conservative district in upstate New York. And she was strongly criticized by Latinos and other immigrants groups when she was selected to replace Hillary Clinton in January. Gillibrand had been opposed to amnesty for undocumented immigrants, supported English as the official language and favored building a fence on the Mexican border. She has since softened on some of her positions. Gillibrand will continue touring the city next week, including stops in Brooklyn and Staten Island.

Book: Tales of the Alhambra
by Washington Irving
Moonlight illuminates tile walls and stone lions that are more than 600 years old. The light peoples the walls of the Alhambra with romantic ghosts. Washington Irving knew the evocative power of moonlight. In his book , Tales of the Alhambra, which describes time that he spent in the wonderful building that dominates Granada Spain, he weaves stories that take place in daylight shadows and others that slink through the dark. “…clothing naked realities with the illusions of the memory and the imagination,” as he puts it.
Thanks to Irving’s Tales of the Alhambra, when we went to a bank that sells tickets to the Alhambra, Ken and I bought tickets for both the daytime tour and the evening tour. We lined up at the appointed time for the daytime tour and wandered on cobblestone streets to graceful stone archways, past flower-bordered paths and into the endless intricacy of Moorish rooms covered in jewel-toned tiles.
In one courtyard, we came across a wedding party. The bride, a slightly-past-sell-date dark haired lady stuffed into her white gown, led the mustachioed groom toward a fountain for wedding pictures. On the rim of a reflecting pond, a pair of lovers did what lovers do, oblivious of the throngs of sightseers. The Spanish sun glanced brightly off the fountains and turned the flowers into neon.
When we went back to the Alhambra in the evening, low lights along the paths led us into a world of shadow, where shape, not color, became the star attraction. We saw subtle details of ceilings and arches that daylight’s bright colors distracted us from noticing. But we also saw the possibilities. We knew suddenly why Moorish Spain held such allure for a story teller like Irving and for the Romantics of the nineteenth century.

Tales of the Alhambra is one of my favourite books! And Granada, oh, Granada…simply stunning!
What a beautiful piece of writing – I feel compelled to leave a comment as I am as we speak relishing Washington Irving’s book having become bewitched by this extraordinary wonder of the modern world. Thanks so much for a delicious read.
Amanda: I’m delighted that you are reading Washington Irving. I think it adds so much to the enjoyment of the Alhambra–although with such a wonderful place, it is hard to add any more enjoyment.
And thanks for your kinds words.Oakland animal shelter's staff, volunteers seek more support
By Carolyn Jones | May 5, 2014 | Updated: May 6, 2014 8:27am

- Photo By Michael Macor/The ChronicleVeterinary nurse technician, Apple Lo works with the dogs inside the adoption roomsicleAnimal Control Superintendent Eilena Hocking holds Oakland City Council meeting to demand more support from the city.
Sometimes even the best dogs have to beg.
That's what dozens of mutts and their owners are expected to do Tuesday when they stage a "dog-in" at the Oakland City Council meeting to demand more support for the beleaguered city shelter.
"It's in a constant state of chaos and turmoil. ... Animals that can be saved are not being saved. And that sad reality needs to change," said Emily Fox, a shelter volunteer. "We felt this was the best way to bring attention to the matter."
In response, three council members have proposed legislation intended to improve life for the 6,000 unwanted dogs, cats, rabbits and birds that end up every year at the city's 29th Avenue shelter.
Moving the shelter from the purview of the Police Department to the city administrator's office and creating an animal welfare advisory commission are among the changes under consideration. Those proposals will be heard by council subcommittees this month.
Revolving leadership
Meanwhile, the shelter has endured a revolving door of leadership since February 2013, when the longtime director left for a job in Virginia. After a search process of almost a year, the city hired Gary Hendel, a former shelter director in San Antonio, but he's been on paid administrative leave since early March pending an internal investigation that could last up to a year.
Oakland police Lt. Chris Mufarreh has been running the center since early March and is likely to stay until the Hendel investigation is complete.
Everyone agrees Mufarreh is doing a good job. In fact, the euthanasia rate is actually down this year, to 28 percent, well below the national average of 35 percent and about half what Oakland registered a decade ago. The number of animals transferred to rescue groups is also up, from 34 percent last year to 42 percent this year.
But the lack of consistent leadership has led to low morale among staff and volunteers, confusion over the rules, and too many animals not getting the attention they need, volunteers and staff said.
"We don't even know what our mission is anymore. To warehouse animals? To find homes for animals?" said Martha Cline, a paid animal care attendant at the shelter and a volunteer. "There's not a viable system in place."
For example, a shepherd arrived at the shelter a few weeks ago and growled at another dog. For that, the shepherd was deemed aggressive and euthanized, she said. The dog should have been allowed more time to adjust before being given a death sentence, because shepherds occasionally growl as a sign of nervousness rather than aggression, she said.
A little more patience and stability would improve everyone's morale - animals and humans alike, she said.
Not helping matters is that the shelter has at least six unfilled staff positions, including that of a veterinarian, due in part to the lack of a permanent director. Volunteers, rescue groups and the East Bay SPCA have tried to pick up the slack, but that arrangement can't last forever, Cline and others said.
"We recognize we really need to stabilize leadership at the shelter," said city spokeswoman Karen Boyd. "We plan to move quickly as soon as the personnel investigation is complete."
The Police Department is working to fill the staff vacancies, and the city plans to issue a report in June on shelter staffing issues, she said.
If Hendel does not return, the city plans to hire a recruiter to conduct a nationwide search for a new - and hopefully permanent - director, she said.
'Competing priorities'
Meanwhile, City Council members Noel Gallo, Libby Schaaf and Rebecca Kaplan are all introducing legislation intended to stop the chaos in the Animal Services Department.
"How we got here is due to negligence on the city's part," Gallo said. "I strongly believe the Oakland Police Department should not be managing the shelter. They're busy enough."
Schaaf agreed.
"Our police officers have competing priorities," she said. "We need a shelter that reflects the progressive values of the city. We can do much better than we have been."

I’m getting settled in Atlanta after spending a few days in Charlotte, NC to speak at a conference. (Stay tuned for a full recap from last night’s HBW Happy Hour in Charlotte!) The main reason I wanted to come down to Atlanta this weekend was to root for my mom at the 2012 NPC Bodybuilding Championships. Mom has been a personal trainer and fitness coach for many years and participated in her first competition back in 1994. Since last year, she’s competed in five figure competitions, including this one. Tonight, she won 5th place in a large, nationally-ranked class of women.
I feel so happy that I was able to be here to support her. Seeing my mom achieve a goal she’s worked so hard for – even through the weird diet and constant workouts – makes me smile. She’s determined to win her “pro card” as a figure athlete, no matter how long it takes to earn that ultimate prize.
And that’s what I love the most about my mom.
No matter what obstacles are put in her way, she always presses on toward her goals. My mom gave birth to me when she was 15 years old, then had my sister at age 19. Along the way, she dropped out of college during her struggle to raise two girls on her own. But she never gave up on her goal of getting an advanced education. My mom pushed through and graduated from college not long after I did, 20 years after she first dropped out. She then went on to earn an MBA!
In 2007, Mom quit her executive assistant position at a large consulting firm in DC to launch a fitness consulting business to help busy women live healthier lifestyles. She encountered a lot of challenges after making the leap and along the way, learned a lot of lessons about what works and what doesn’t. Today, her business brings in six figures and is steadily growing each year.
What I most admire about my mom is that she’s been through so much and yet…she keeps on going. She’s made many mistakes in her life, but she has never let them define her. My mom has never allowed anyone to tell her that she’s “too old” to do anything. Or that it’s “too late” to live her ideal life. Mom is a radical believer in the power of her dreams and she continues to inspire me with her ability to overcome the odds and keep moving forward.
My mom has shown me – again and again – that no matter how many times you fall, you can always get back up.
Very inspirational story!! She looks amazing!
Your mom looks damn good! Quite an inspiration.
Your mom is definitely an inspiration. Thank you for sharing this story. Stories’ like my mom are just motivation to continue to push forward. Thank you again :-)
Wow, that’s really inspiring!!!!! And she looks awesome!!! GO MAMA!
Good for mom. It’s great to follow your dreams and be rewarded for it.
That was so inspiring! I received this post as an email. I’m not deleting the email for a while because I want to go back and look at the picture of you and your mom on a regular basis and be inspired. Wow!
That’s awesome…btw you look like sisters!
Your mom looks fantastic. And she is one of the best role models I’ve seen in quite some time. Thanks for showing her. I’m running to her site right now.I’m addicted to sesame -especially anything crunchy that has toasted sesame.
This naturally means I’m drawn to foods like the Sesame Oat Bran Sticks – or just Sesame Sticks – that are sold in health food sections of our grocery store. Am I the only one that thinks it’s odd that we have “health food” sections at grocery stores as if they’re saying the rest is just junk food? Perhaps it’s just me that’s odd. (Only perhaps?)
Occasionally I go to the international foods store – mainly to see the adorable three-year-old who rules the site on her pink tricycle. Her parents own the store, so their tot is often there chattering with people, like me, who need a “kid fix.”
The other night, I asked her what her favorite food was and she was quick to say “third shelf on the left.” Then she escorted me to the site where there were jars of Tahini paste – made from ground sesame. Ah, a sesame soul mate. I smiled in recognition. “Bring your bike next time. A pink bike,” she commanded. And she was off.
So… chicken. I often bake chicken and coat it with something crunchy to keep it moist. This time I grabbed the sesame sticks and made them into crumbs. The Hungry Girl would say to use Fiber One Cereal, which isn’t a bad option, but this had great flavor, as well as crunch. And it had sesame seeds.
Note: I just put the sesame sticks into a baggie and then beat them with my rolling pin. Sure I could pulse them in the food processor but this was easier to clean up and I got to work out my aggressions at the same time.
Ingredients
2 chicken breasts, cut into pieces of about 4 oz each.
½ cup flour
1 tsp salt
½ tsp pepper
1 egg
2 TBS milk
1 cup sesame sticks, pounded into crumbs
2 TBS sesame sticks.
Optional: if you need more kick, add red pepper flakes to the crumbs or another herb, such as sage.
Directions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Put flour, salt and pepper into a baggie.
Whisk egg and milk in a shallow bowl.
Place sesame stick and extra sesame seeds in a separate baggie. Beat to make crumbs.
Spray a baking sheet with Pam or use aluminum foil.
Pound chicken pieces until they are a uniform thickness. Pat them dry.
Dredge chicken in flour, then egg wash and then pop into baggie with crumbs.
Place chicken on baking sheet.
Bake about 20 – 30 minutes or until done.
An easy week night dinner. I added some frozen sweet potato fries, which I baked in a separate pan next to the chicken and then steamed some frozen veggies. This is a fool-proof process for cooking chicken or fish. The coating can be cereal, chips, crackers or sesame sticks! Make them your own.

“Christ:
Cornelius Tacitus (55-120 AD), “the greatest historian” of ancient’s crucifixion:
“Thallus, in the third book of his histories, explains away the darkness as an eclipse of the sun–unreasonably, as it seems to me.” [A solar eclipse could not take place during a full moon, as was the case during Passover added that Christianity attracted persons of all societal ranks, all ages, both sexes, and from both the city and the country. Late in his letter to Emperor Trajan, Pliny refers to the teachings of Jesus and his followers as excessive and contagious superstition. suspicion. passed by without examination, so that these men may neither.”?
This.

Question..
Two.
Not too long ago I was having a discussion with a chemist who claimed that the only thing that is real is what he can put under his microscope. In other words, reality consists only of that which is material. This worldview is often called naturalism, which according to the Oxford Dictionary is “a philosophical viewpoint according to which everything arises from natural properties and causes, and supernatural or spiritual explanations are excluded or discounted.”
It’s not a very popular view on Valentine’s Day. If it were – you might find a Valentine card that says something like this:
Darling, my rise in serotonin level has triggered my infatuation with you. In light of this development, my blood chemistry compels me to love you. Will you be my valentine?
Darling, my rise in serotonin level has triggered my infatuation with you. In light of this development, my blood chemistry compels me to love you. Will you be my valentine?
At the Center for Naturalism’s website in the Q & A section it states that: “Your thoughts, experiences, feelings, decisions, and behavior are all things your brain and body does.” They go on to claim that .
Is that a true basis for relationship – I forgive you because you weren’t at fault??? Wouldn’t that also make the converse true – anytime you did something good or kind, it wouldn’t be your choice either? In fact, naturalism, as I understand it, reduces love and relationships, because it reduces what it means to be human. On the same website a human being is described:
“What’s special about this naturalistic view ourselves, that’s quite different from the supernatural or common sense view, is that we don’t have free will, defined as the power to do something without yourself being fully caused to do it.”
Remember last week I said that Francis Collins, who mapped the human genome, said that he came to faith in God because of all that he could not explain with his naturalistic view of life. Love seems to be in that category to me. A naturalist explains love and relationships in a way that does not fit with reality, reducing it to a deterministic series of choices based on bio-chemical processes.
Biblical Christianity asserts that human beings are relational because they were created by a Trinitarian God who has always existed as three persons in relationship with each other. God’s essence is love. This is not just an ivory tower truth. Just like the naturalist sees the truths of their worldview expressed in the nature of relationships, so does the Christian. God’s nature is reflected in His creation, including man who is made in His own image.
Philosopher Peter Kreeft of Boston College says it this way:
If God is not a Trinity, God is not love. For love requires three things: a lover, a beloved, and a relationship between them.
So buy your Valentine some flowers and chocolate, because you are made in the image of a God who loves, and therefore, even if my chemist friend can’t see it under a microscope, your love is real.

So, he not only blows large quantities of hot air out of his mouth, he actually sells it for a living.

Man, is this ever a hard sell: a former Presidential candidate waxes lyrical on the perils of global warming while his Powerpoint presentation plays in the background, complete with stats, graphs and – gasp – pie charts. Given a choice between this and Clerks 2 et al, the majority of moviegoers will no doubt give it a wide berth.

Having seen the film I think we can put to rest the idea that Gore is using this as some political stunt. This is clearly an issue he feels very strongly about, and has done for many years. If it was merely a political stunt, why travel round the world trying to convince world leaders and students that this is a major issue? As he points out, this is a moral issue, not just a political one.

I was surprised at how little he did mention the presidency race actually. I already knew quite a bit about this subject beforehand but found that it was shown in a new and very believeable way. Whether he is preaching to gain favour or not really isnt an issue. Watching this should make everyone change their thoughts about the environment. Personally I think it should be compulsory viewing in schools!

Inevitably, this includes an "I Was Robbed Of The Presidency" scene, just in case you'd forgotten who he was. However, this is a startling look at the effect that Global Warming is already having and will continue to have unless our governments act soon. Fortunately, it's delivered without sermon, sometimes with humour, but always with intelligence. If you leave the cinema without being affected by at least 1 of the subjects covered, there really is no hope for you at all.

"I feel like we were the forerunners for the women today who are commanding and flying helicopters, and I would like to do it all over again."
Hundreds of veterans, active military members, friends and familiy attended the Veterans Day ceremony organized by the Bay County Veterans Council.
The ceremony began at 11. a.m. Sunday, Nov. 11. at the site of the USS Edson destroyer in Essexville.
Mike Kegley, president of the Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum, thanked veterans for their service. A color guard stood by as a firing squad shot a 21-gun salute.
John DeWyse, a museum member and veteran, helped to organize the event, which is typically held at the war memorial outside of the Bay County building, 515 Center Ave. in downtown Bay City. Dewyse said that the turnout exceeded expectations, and veterans who attended agrreed.
"This gathering is amazing, and it just puts a tear in my eye," said Diane Yearkey, who works for Bangor Township Schools and was called to serve in 2006.
Christopher Yearkey, who has served in the Army for 28 years, said that veterans ceremonies are opportunities for old friends to keep in touch.
"There is a lot of good comraderie here," Yearkey said. "It's a great way to say hello to strangers and friends from the past that you don't often run into otherwise."
"Taps" played as veterans raised the American flag from half-mast onboard the USS. Edson. After the flag-raising, Maillette dropped a wreath into the river as a tribute to those who have served. Don Pletzke, a fellow veteran and member of the Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum, stood by her side.
Clarence Satkowiak of Portsmouth Township said that the gathering of veterans at the USS Edson was much larger than the small group of veterans who attended the ceremony at the former location in years past.
"The Edson is a very nice exhibit for Bay City, and I think that it serves as an important landmark for a lot of veterans," Satkowiak said. "It will do a lot of good for the community."
A flyover of several A-10 Warthogs was scheduled to take place, but as of 2:30 p.m., the planes had not flown by.
"We're very disappointed and haven't heard what happened yet," Kegley said. "I'm sorry that those who stopped by to see the planes missed out."logging in or signing up Tiddalik28 Category: Education License: All Rights Reserved Like it (0) Dislike it (0) Added: January 17, 2008 This Presentation is Public Favorites: 0 Presentation Description No description available.

Mitt Romney is headed toward a fairly big victory in the New Hampshire Republican primary on Tuesday.
The weekend’s debates did nothing to alter the seeming inevitability of his nomination. Though Romney’s lead in South Carolina is smaller, national Gallup tracking polls show him gaining. The five-night moving averages through Sunday show him with 30 percent support, with former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum a distant second at 18 percent. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is third with 17 percent and steadily dropping. Texas Gov. Rick Perry is mired at 6 percent.
It’s hardly coincidental that each of the last five Republican nominees — going back to Ronald Reagan in 1980 — won the South Carolina primary and either the New Hampshire primary or the Iowa caucuses. That statistic can be attributed to momentum or signify that presidential contenders deprived of early victories simply wither and die on the vine. Wins beget money and losses shrink fundraising.
Romney is the only contender with anything remotely resembling the kind of campaign that usually wins nominations, and his odds of clinching the nod are extremely high — pretty close to a sure thing.
Yet, not much makes him such a prohibitive favorite. He has benefited from the insufficiencies of his rivals. This race would have been considerably more interesting if former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty had gained traction. Runs by Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush might also have made it more exciting. Maybe Romney would have won anyway, but with nowhere near the sense of certainty.
Some say Pawlenty erred in dropping out of the race after his disappointing showing in the summer’s Iowa straw poll. It certainly appeared, though, that the flow of money coming into the Pawlenty campaign began drying up earlier, particularly after he pulled his punches in attacks on Romney in the early debates. Had Pawlenty gone after Romney’s jugular or persevered after the disappointment in Ames, he may or may not have raised the money to continue as a viable candidate.
Another “what if” to consider is how things might have differed had Perry entered the race much earlier than August. Although never poised to be a great candidate, he certainly is closer to the Republican Party’s ideological center of gravity than Romney. He also didn’t come to the table with Gingrich’s baggage.
Assuming Romney ends up the nominee, many will say it's proof that Republicans anoint their candidates, nominating whoever is next in line without open and full competition. To be sure, Republican voters — in presidential nomination fights — historically are not as open to new faces as Democrats have been. But arguably in this campaign, they have been more open than ever. At various stages, quite a few contenders who were not household names had a shot. But each came up short.
In 2011, the Republican Party desperately wanted someone far more conservative and stylistically more combative than Romney. Their desire was quashed by the shortcomings of their options. There’s no question that Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachman, pizza magnate Herman Cain, Perry, and Gingrich had their shots—with only the Georgian still standing, and just barely.
Romney is remarkably sure-footed on the campaign trail. He raises tons of money and assembled a first-class campaign. All of these are necessary elements, but not sufficient for him to win the 2012 GOP nomination. The real key is the lack of a strong conservative alternative.
Various rump groups of conservative leaders and financiers are meeting around the country attempting to settle on a single alternative to Romney. This is the political equivalent of closing the barn door after the horses have left. Instead, they might ask why they couldn’t come up with a stronger candidate representing the GOP’s dominant wing. And the tea party might ask: Why didn’t it have more juice in the GOP nomination fight?

The Landscape Bathtub By Yaroslav Rassadin was designed to solve the problem of limited resources of energy and space in near future. The landscape Bathtub will work as a shower deck in the morning and will later transform into a long relaxing bathtub at night for the users to have a good dose or warm dip before going to bed. This ingenious concept offers vibro-massage features based on turbulent pumping arrangement inside the rubber skin.
Who would have thought that a shower deck could be transformed into a bathtub just by using your hands. It only takes and minute and the transformation is complete. Another great and ingenious idea was to include rubber into the design. I love rubber. It’s so…fun. It can be modeled easily and it’s also soft and cozy, plus it’s very easy to maintain clean. What I also like about this structure is the color. That green is so fun and bright, it’s the color of the fresh grass on spring time. It’s beautiful.Two northbound lanes of MacArthur Boulevard in Newport Beach were closed briefly following a traffic collision Wednesday afternoon.

Nazareth improved to 6-0 with a relatively comfortable 41-24 win over Warren Hills in the opening round of the Easton Invitational at Easton Area Middle School.
"I think we're still trying to find our rhythm," Nazareth coach Dave Crowell said.
The Blue Eagles are still finding their legs after missing a week-plus of competition due to skin infection issues that forced Crowell to pull the team from last weekend's Bethlehem Holiday Tournament at Liberty.
"We didn't wrestle particularly well at The Beast (of the East Tournament)," Crowell said. "And missing Bethlehem Holiday kind of set us back."
Crowell's squad showed enough to right the ship -- for now.
Nazareth won nine bouts, including the final four, to put away Warren Hills, which also used tonight's match as a measuring stick.
"We came over here to get good matches," Warren Hills coach Jarrett Hosbach said. "Nazareth showed us things that we need to improve on, namely, working from the bottom and needing to get better on our feet. Those are the things we're here to find out."
The tournament resumes at 9 a.m. Saturday.
The Blue Eagles, who won the only other meeting between the teams 34-27 in 1992, jumped to a 9-0 lead after two bouts. Travis Smith stacked Austin Pidoto for a fall in 5:12 at 106 pounds and Tyrone Klump outlasted Max Nauta 4-3 at 113.
Klump went up 4-0 with a takedown and two-point nearfall. Nauta dominated the next four minutes from the top position, choosing offense in the final period. But he could only muster two back points off a tilt and a point for stalling.
Warren Hills (6-2) rallied to tie the score with a forfeit at 120 prior to Joe Kratochvil's 3-2 triple overtime win over Tyler Tarsi at 126.
PIAA medalist Chase Zemenak collected one of the Blue Eagles' seven bonus point wins -- a 15-0 technical fall over freshman Shane Deemer at 132.
Nick Sevi scored a 20-5 technical fall over Ryan Witner at 195 to seal the match for Nazareth.
"Warren Hills wrestled us tough," Crowell said. "They made us wrestle in some uncomfortable situations. In fact, I think they out-wrestled us in one or two areas and they won two overtime bouts."
The other overtime win for Warren Hills came at 170 and was the highlight bout of the night. Ryan Ostir took Jordan Gray to his back for the pin 50 seconds into the extra period.
There was some controversy as to whether the bout should have been in overtime at all.
The match was tied 3-3 when Gray was called for what actually was his third caution of the bout. Referee John Fidelibus counted it as the second warning and didn't award Ostir the point. Then Gray was given a questionable escape on the edge of the mat as time expired in regulation and was initially awarded the decision.
Hosbach called Fidelibus to the scorer's table, and after conferring with both official scorers, Ostir was given the penalty point and the bout went into overtime.
"I knew for a fact I was right or I would never have argued," Hosbach said.
The fall made the match score 26-21, but Warren Hills didn't win another bout.
The Blue Eagles capped the night with four straight wins, including Connor Williams' major decision at 182, Sevi's technical fall and state runner-up Aaron Bradley's pin of Andrew Pacheco at 285.
Easton rolled to a 44-23 victory over Delaware Valley (Pa.) in its first-round match.
The Red Rovers received falls from Evan Fidelibus (113), Kyler Kilpatrick (145), Dyvon Gibson (152), Evan DiSora (160) and Willie Alford (171) and key victories from seniors Robbie Rizzolino (132) and Tyler Greene (182) to improve to 2-0 on the season.
Rizzolino won a hard-fought 5-4 decision over Del Val's Frank Carrozza, and Greene collected his 100th varsity win with a 10-4 decision over Martin Strenk.
"Rizzolino had a nice win," Easton coach Steve Powell said. "Baker learned a lot in his match, and Tyler (Greene) picked up a really nice win for himself. He joins quite an elite group of Easton wrestlers that have won 100 matches. He's a special kid."

NVIDIA announced today that they are using Google’s Android OS for their Tegra platform. In case you don’t know what NVIDIA has been cooking up, Tegra pushes an incredible amount of GPU and CPU processing capability into mobile devices. We are talking like outputting 1080p resolution with 3D animation systems. By using a new technology called ULP (Ultra-Low-Power), it can retain an impressive battery life which can outlast any cell phone that is currently out in the market. It is very exciting that they have chosen the open source platform Android for their OS as both Android and Tegra natively support OpenGL development. If Apple isn’t on the ball, Android backed by such powerful hardware could certainly become the new smart mobile device king.
Also worth mentioning, once Android gets Flash Player, a Tegra device would be able to play robust developed Flash games and applications that other platforms would be sluggish running.

True, Android rulez, I just love it.
Give me an advice, I plan to get one device. Which one do you think is better?
July 26th, 2009 at 8:25 am
Yep, choice of Android is a big ratification of its potential and growth. I’m an Android developer/supporter and am very excited.
BTW, I think you meant to say “natively” in “both Android and Tegra naively support OpenGL development.” There’s nothing naive about supporting OpenGL.

I would say G1 is better than the “G2″ (or HTC Magik), Victor, simply for the keyboard… its the same thing, but Magik is prettier and only has virtual keyboard, while G1 is uglier and has both keyboards, physical and virtual.

SINGAPORE (ICIS)--Thailand’s PTT Global Chemical (PTTGC) plans to shut another of its high density polyethylene (HDPE) plants at Map Ta Phut in mid-May for a 10-day turnaround, a source close to the company said on Thursday.
The producer had planned to shut a 250,000 tonne/year HDPE plant from end-April for a 15-day turnaround, according to the source.
Once that plant resumes production, PTTGC would shut another of its HDPE plants for maintenance, the source said.
The producer’s two other HDPE plants have a capacity of 250,000 tonnes/year and 300,000 tonnes/year respectively.
However, the source could not confirm which of these plants is scheduled for maintenance in mid-May.

Teacher professional development and classroom resources across the curriculum
In classrooms not too long ago, students worked alone on mathematical problems. Communication was often one-way -- the teacher's role was to show the students how to do the mathematics (usually computation). The students' role was to provide their answers or show how they solved the problem. Working with other students was considered cheating, and discussion among students might have been seen as disruptive, rather than helpful. Students were seldom asked to write about mathematics in prose or to present and explain their work, except when copying their homework answers on the board.
Today's mathematics classroom is very different. Students are encouraged to work together and to communicate about mathematical ideas, in the same way that they communicate about literature or the social sciences. To support this new emphasis on communication, as teachers, we must learn better ways to communicate with our students and help students communicate with one another. NCTM makes a strong case that improvement in communication can make for more effective teachers and better learners. Better communication will also deepen students' understanding of mathematics.
So how does the work you've done so far in this session relate to the Communication Standard? Let's review and expand on what we've covered.

This may be an absurd question, but is this the same KMV that we have been talking about all chapter? If so, it seems like the PD depends on lots of things and I am not quite sure why the equity value is explicitly pointed out as the driver. There also seems to be some circular logic since the value of the equity is a function of the face value of the debt and the value of the firm. And to complicate matters, if the equity increases because of some external factor (like an increase in the mean return rate), wouldn't this increase the value of the firm and possibly even increase the value of the debt? I guess I am having a cause/effect problem that I cannot seem to get around. If this is answered somwehere else I appologize. If so, please do not be afraid to just post a link, but I have been unable to find anything that addresses this dierectly. It is also possible that I am just making this WAY too complicated. Thanks! ShannonMcIlroy takes legal action against Horizon
Sports management company set to vigorously defend actions taken by the former world number one
Rory McIlroy, who has issued legal proceedings against three defendants in Dublin’s High Court.
Rory McIlroy, the former world number one and two-time Major champion, has issued legal proceedings in the High Court in Dublin against three defendants, one of which is Horizon Sports Management. The papers were filed last Friday, the same day on which McIlroy announced his split from Horizon and set up his own management company, Rory McIlroy Incorporated (RMI).
McIlroy, winner of the US Open in 2011 and last year’s US PGA championship, joined Horizon in 2011 – shortly after his breakthrough Major success at Congressional – and earlier this year signed a multi-year contract with Nike worth an estimated €185 million.
He also has signed other blue chip sponsorships with Bose and Omega since joining the Horizon stable, having split previously from International Sports Management.
Although his contract with Horizon was due to run until 2017, McIlroy confirmed last week that he was terminating the arrangement.
File an affidavit
The next step in the proceedings will be for McIlroy to file an affidavit. Disputes worth more than €1 million are likely to be heard in the Commercial Court.
McIlroy has issued proceedings against Horizon Sports Management Ltd, Canovan Management Services and Gurteen Ltd. There are no records of Gurteen Ltd in the Irish or British companies registers.
The last annual returns for Horizon Sports Management in September 2012 show that the directors were Moya O’Beirne, Colin Morrissey and Conor Ridge and the shareholders are listed as Leestreet Ltd (254 shares), Emma McGrath (261 shares), Conor Ridge (395 shares) and Colin Morrissey (183 shares).
Special resolution
Leestreet Ltd (based in Athlone) cancelled its shareholding in October by special resolution. In April of this year, Thomas Donohue and Catherine Clarke resigned as directors of Leestreet and were replaced by Martin and Sylvia Jacob.
Although Leestreet Ltd is no longer a shareholder in Horizon, Martin and Sylvia Jacob are involved as defendants in the McIlroy action as shareholders in Canovan Management Services. Martin Jacob has 99 shares in the company and Sylvia Jacob has one, which up until March of this year was held by a company based in the British Virgin Islands.
Horizon, who have not filed any documents, are set to vigorously defend the actions taken by McIlroy. The company, established by Ridge and Morrissey, includes a number of other golfers – among them former US Open champion Graeme McDowell and Shane Lowry, currently ranked 11th and 71st in the world respectively – in its stable.Switzerland 18 May 2009 Bundesgericht [Federal Supreme Court] (Packaging machine case) [translation available]

Translation [*] by Jan Henning Berg [**]
FACTS
A. Defendant-Appellant [Seller] -- a corporation which is domiciled in Basel, Switzerland -- and the Spanish Plaintiff-Appellee [Buyer] concluded a contract for the sale of a packaging machine on 12 December 2000. The purchase price of the machine as a whole amounted to Spanish pesetas [Pta.] 247,278,337.00 (= Euros [EUR] 1,486,172.74). The packaging machine consisted of ten individual devices as well as several transportation and interconnection systems. [Seller] was also obliged under the contract to install the packaging machine and prepare its operation at the [Buyer]'s works.
[Seller] sought to perform a certification run of the packaging machine after installation was accomplished. In the following, the parties began a dispute about which exact performance of the machine was required under the contract. [Buyer] mainly asserted that an output of 180 vials per minute had been promised by [Seller]. On the other hand, the latter argued that such overall performance was neither possible nor had it ever been agreed upon by the parties. [Seller] attempted on several occasions to increase the performance of the machine which had been well below 180 vials per minute at that time. On 23 March 2003, [Buyer] declared avoidance of the contract and claimed both restitution of the purchase price and additional damages. On 9 February 2004, [Buyer] applied for a writ of execution to be issued with respect to its claims against [Seller].
B. By submission dated 5 August 2004, [Buyer] filed an action against [Seller] before the District Court (Zivilgericht) Basel-Stadt. It requested that [Seller] be ordered to reimburse EUR 495,390.91 plus 5% interest since 22 January 2001 and another EUR 495,390.91 plus 5% interest since 19 November 2001. These amounts should be reimbursed versus restitution of the machine delivered by [Seller] under the sales contract concluded between the parties on 12 December 2000. Moreover, [Seller] should be ordered to pay EUR 110,393.48 plus 5% interest since 25 March 2003, EUR 13,007.20 plus 5% interest since 10 February 2004 and EUR 177,632.37 plus 5% interest since 22 June 2004 (avoidance of the contract; subject to a possible later increase of the claimed sums).
In the alternative, [Seller] should be ordered to pay EUR 1,301,450.77 plus 5% interest since 1 October 2001, EUR 13,007.20 plus 5% interest since 10 February 2004, EUR 177,632.37 plus 5% interest since 22 June 2004 (subject to a possible later increase of the claimed sums). This sum would have to be reduced by the final instalment of the purchase price of EUR 495,390.91 (reduction of the purchase price).
[Seller], on the other hand, filed a cross-action against [Buyer] and claimed the remaining part of the purchase price plus additional damages. [Seller] requested that [Buyer] be ordered to pay EUR 731,675.19 plus interest, subject to a possible later increase of the claimed sums.
On 8 November 2006, the District Court rendered the following judgment on the merits of the case:
Subsequently, [Seller] filed for appellate proceedings before the Appellate Court (Appellationsgericht) Basel-Stadt. [Seller] requested the Appellate Court to repeal the judgment that had been rendered by the District Court. Instead, [Buyer]'s action should be dismissed. [Buyer] should also be ordered to pay EUR 731,675.19 plus interest in accordance with the cross-action. However, the Appellate Court confirmed and upheld the previous ruling by its judgment of 26 September 2008.
C. [Seller] has now filed a second appeal against the ruling of the Appellate Court of 26 September 2008. [Seller] demands that this judgment be reversed. [Buyer]'s action should be dismissed and the case on the cross-action should be remanded to the Appellate Court for reconsideration. In the alternative, both [Buyer]'s action and [Seller]'s cross-action should be remanded to the Appellate Court for reconsideration. On the other hand, [Buyer] has applied before the Court to dismiss [Seller]'s appeal and to confirm the judgment rendered by the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court has stated that [Seller]'s appeal is unfounded.
D. By order of the Presiding Judge of 9 April 2009, [Seller]'s appeal has temporary suspensive effect.
REASONING OF THE COURT
1. By virtue of the present judgment on the merits, [Seller]'s request for temporary suspensive effect of its appeal has become meaningless.
2. [Subject of appeals before the Swiss Federal Supreme Court]
2.1 An appeal concerning matters of private law may be filed as a defense against alleged violations of law in terms of Art. 95 and 96 BGG [*]. The appeal must be sufficiently substantiated. The appeal will not be allowed on points where the appellant has failed to submit a sufficiently reasoned submission . The statement of appeal must contain a brief argument on why the contested act of justice has violated the law (Art. 42(2) BGG). The Swiss Federal Supreme Court will assess an alleged violation of basic rights, cantonal and inter-cantonal law only where such complaint has been precisely laid out and substantiated by virtue of the statement of appeal (Art. 106(2) BGG; BGE [*] 134 II 244 E. 2.2; 133 III 439 E. 3.2).
2.2 An appeal before the Swiss Federal Supreme Court may contest findings in terms of fact only if the respective findings by the lower courts are evidently incorrect or where they are based on a violation of law under Art. 95 BGG and where the asserted impropriety is of relevance for the outcome of the proceedings (Art. 97(1) BGG). The meaning of the term "evidently incorrect" is equivalent to "arbitrary" (BGE 133 II 249 E. 1.2.2).
If the appellant seeks to challenge the factual findings of the courts of first or second instance, he cannot simply replace the contested findings with other ones asserted by him. Also, he cannot succeed just by giving an explanation of how the evidence should have been appraised instead. It is for the appellant to give a qualified and clear account of why the contested findings (respectively, a possible omission to find facts) should be evidently incorrect or why they were based on a violation of law pursuant to Art. 95 BGG. A mere criticism of the findings of fact of the lower courts does not meet these standards and must therefore be dismissed (BGE 133 II 249 E. 1.4.3; 133 III 350 E. 1.3, 393 E. 7.1 p. 398, 462 E. 2.4).
2.3 In accordance with persistent jurisprudence, "arbitrariness" in terms of Art. 9 BV [*] is not present in cases where a different decision might be justifiable just as well or where a different decision might even appear preferable. The Swiss Federal Supreme Court will repeal a decision of a cantonal court on the grounds of arbitrariness only if it that decision can evidently not be sustained, if it clearly contradicts the factual situation, if it blatantly violates a provision or well-established principle of law or if it clearly runs contrary to fairness and equity. Moreover, arbitrariness requires not only that the reasoning of a decision is unsustainable. The same must apply to the outcome of a case (BGE 134 I 140 E. 5.4 p. 148; 133 I 149 E. 3.1; 132 III 209 E. 2.1; each citation with further references).
It must be considered that the lower courts -- which find and evaluate the factual basis of a case -- have a wide margin of discretion (BGE 120 Ia 31 E. 4b p. 40). The Swiss Federal Supreme Court will allow a respective appeal only in those cases where the lower courts have abused their power of discretion, e.g. by drawing evidently unsustainable conclusions or by arbitrary ignorance towards critical pieces of evidence (cf. BGE 132 III 209 E. 2.1; 129 I 8 E. 2.1; 120 Ia 31 E. 4b p. 40).
3. [Application of the CISG]
The Appellate Court has appraised the present case according to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of 11 April 1980 (CISG; SR [*] 0.221.211.1). Neither party has challenged the application of the CISG on their case (cf. Art. 1(1)(a) in conjunction with Art. 3 CISG).
4. [Summary of Seller's argument]
However, the parties are in dispute about whether [Buyer] has effectively declared avoidance of the contract of 12 December 2000 concerning the delivery of a packaging machine on 23 March 2003. [Seller] argues that the Appellate Court has been wrong in assuming a valid avoidance. In particular, [Seller] asserts that the Appellate Court has violated the provisions of Arts. 8, 25, 49(2)(b), 82(1), 84(2) CISG as well as of Arts. 210(1) OR [*] in conjunction with Arts. 116 et seq. and 148 IPRG [*]. [Seller] also raises several complaints against the findings of fact.
5. [Summary of the Appellate Court ruling]
With respect to the subject of the sales contract concluded between [Buyer] and [Seller], the Appellate Court concluded that the parties had agreed on a required total output of 180 units per minute. It was undisputed that the packaging machine had not in fact achieved this performance required by the contract. The Appellate Court confirmed the reasoning adopted by the District Court concerning [Buyer]'s avoidance of contract. [Buyer] was entitled to declare avoidance both under Art. 49(1)(b) CISG because of non-delivery and under Art. 49(1)(a) CISG because of a fundamental breach of contract. The Appellate Court further reasoned that [Buyer] had not forfeited its right to declare avoidance by virtue of Art. 82 CISG and that [Seller]'s argument on limitation was unfounded. With respect to the cross-action, the Appellate Court held that [Seller] failed to prove and substantiate the existence of the asserted claim.
6. [Overview of the reasoning of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court]
According to the Appellate Court, [Buyer] was entitled to declare avoidance of contract because of non-delivery and because of a fundamental breach of contract. The right to declare avoidance because of non-delivery existed as a result of the fact that the parties adopted a meaning of the term "delivery" which is in deviation to the meaning adopted by the CISG. According to the parties, "delivery" should refer to the day when installation of the packaging machine has finished and when the machine is operating to [Buyer]'s full satisfaction. Consequently, delivery of the packaging machine never actually occurred in the present case. [Seller] challenges this reasoning on the grounds that the Appellate Court interpreted the respective provision of the contract in violation of Art. 8(2) and (3) CISG. It may remain undecided whether this argument is indeed well-founded, i.e. whether [Buyer] was thus entitled to declare avoidance as a result of non-delivery (Art. 49(1)(b) CISG). It will be demonstrated in the following that [Buyer] was in any event entitled to declare the contract avoided because of a fundamental breach of contract (Art. 49(1)(a) CISG).
7. [Assessment of Seller's allegation that there has been no violation of Art. 25 CISG]
[Seller] objects to the Appellate Court's conclusion that [Buyer] has been entitled to declare the contract avoided owing to a fundamental breach of contract. The Appellate Court violated Art. 25 CISG by having assumed the existence of a fundamental breach.
7.1 Pursuant to Art. 49(1)(a) CISG, the buyer may declare the contract avoided if the failure by the seller to perform any of his obligations under the contract or the CISG amounts to a fundamental breach of contract. A breach of contract is fundamental in terms of Art. 25 CISG,.
The term "fundamental breach" under Art. 25 CISG is to be interpreted narrowly. If it is doubtful whether or not a breach may qualify as fundamental, it should generally be assumed that no fundamental breach is existent (judgment by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court of 15 September 2000, case docket 4C.105/2000, E. 2c/aa). It must be considered that the CISG in general seeks to uphold the performance of contracts. Primary contractual obligations should be maintained even in case of failures by one of the parties to act in accordance with the contract. Avoidance of contract is supposed to constitute an exceptional remedy. Breaches of contract should primarily be compensated by virtue of a reduction of the purchase price and damages. A party should be entitled to have the contract unwound only as a last resort and if this is necessary to react to breaches of contract which substantially deprive the creditor of its interest in performance of the contract. The specific circumstances of the individual case must be taken into account in order to determine whether a breach amounts to a fundamental breach under the aforementioned standards -- in other words: whether the remedy of avoidance is indeed justifiable (judgment by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court of 28 October 1998, case docket 4C.179/1998, E. 2b with further references).
With respect to Art. 25 CISG, the critical question is whether the creditor is substantially deprived of what he is entitled to expect under the contract. This must be assessed under an objective standard, while mere subjective expectations are immaterial (judgment by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court of 28 October 1998, case docket 4C.179/1998, E. 2a with further references). In general, only considerably severe lacks of conformity will meet the requirements imposed by Art. 25 CISG (Brunner, UN-Kaufrecht - CISG, 2004, Art. 25 paras. 8 and 16; Staudinger / Magnus, Kommentar zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch, CISG, 2005, Art. 25 para. 26). This applies in particular to those lacks of conformity which cannot be remedied within reasonable time and by reasonable efforts to the effect that the goods are practically useless, unmerchantable or cannot be appropriately resold (Brunner, Art. 25 para. 16; Staudinger / Magnus, Art. 25 para. 26; cf. also Schlechtriem / Schroeter, in: Schlechtriem/Schwenzer, Kommentar zum Einheitlichen UN-Kaufrecht, 5th ed. 2008, Art. 25 para. 27). If the goods are essentially inappropriate for the buyer's own production, resale or other needs, he will be entitled to declare the contract avoided. With respect to the question of whether it can still be expected from the buyer to resale or use the non-conforming goods, it must be taken into account whether the buyer is a professional reseller (trader), manufacturer or final customer of the respective type of goods. Generally, it will not be appropriate for a manufacturer or final customer to use or resell goods of inferior quality, if he is not at all engaged in trading the individual components or materials (Brunner, Art. 25 para. 16).
7.2 The Appellate Court has entirely upheld the reasoning adopted by the District Court, which assumed the existence of a fundamental breach. The District Court held that the actual performance of the packaging machine was well below the performance which had been required under the contract. Despite the fact that a maximum velocity of 115 vials per minute seemed to be possible -- as was evidenced by the video clip -- the long-term average output of merely 52 vials per minute had to be considered in accordance with [Buyer]'s line of argument. [Buyer] provided an extensive set of documents in order to show that higher outputs could not be attained. These documents indicated that the average actual velocities had heavily fluctuated from time to time. This was a major indicator of the packaging machine being highly susceptible to failures. This, in turn, explained why the machine had to be operated at only low velocities. The actual output of 52 vials per minute was equivalent to a loss of production of 71% in comparison with 180 vials per minute as had been agreed in the contract. Even if the existence of a breach of contract were not to be determined by reference to the long-term average output but by reference to the maximum performance of 115 vials per minute, the loss of production would still amount to 40% as a result of extended downtimes (assumption: 8-hour shifts and downtimes extended by the factor 1.5). In its statement of defense, [Seller] had stated that the packaging machine was an automated and continuously-operating high-precision packaging machine. According to the District Court, [Buyer] was entitled to expect that the machine delivered by [Seller] would actually achieve the promised performance. However, this was not the case by far. Therefore, [Buyer] was substantially deprived of what it had been entitled to expect. It would not have concluded the particular contract had it been aware of the packaging machine's actual performance. Even [Buyer]'s former packaging machine -- which had been used before in order to process the three types of goods in question -- had been capable of achieving a similar performance. A price reduction could not be considered because [Buyer]'s loss of productivity throughout the expected lifetime of the machine exceeded the purchase price by far. Moreover, it was not possible for [Buyer] to resell the machine and thereby (partially) compensate its losses. Consequently, [Seller] was liable for a fundamental breach.
7.3 It is undisputed that [Seller] has breached the sales contract of 12 December 2000. It had delivered a packaging machine which failed to achieve the performance required under the contract. In the course of proceedings before the District Court and the Appellate Court, a major issue was to determine the exact performance of the packaging machine which was required by the contract. After the Appellate Court extensively evaluated the available evidence, it found that the parties had agreed on the delivery of a packaging machine which should achieve a performance of 180 vials per minute. [Seller] has refrained in its current statement of appeal from challenging this particular finding of fact.
However, [Seller] has objected to the reasoning of the Appellate Court concerning the actual performance of the packaging machine. The Appellate Court confirmed the District Court's conclusion and held that the long-term average performance of 52 vials per minute was the relevant value.
7.4 [Seller] has alleged that the factual finding concerning an average performance of 52 vials per minute is arbitrary.
However, [Seller] has not sufficiently proved the existence of an arbitrary decision by the Appellate Court. Neither the Appellate Court nor the District Court assumed an average performance of 52 vials per minute without any findings of fact and their evaluation. The District Court has in fact appreciated the documents submitted by [Buyer], which demonstrated its manufacturing processes and operation times over a period of two-and-a-half years. It has also considered the video clip submitted by [Seller]. Contrary to [Seller]'s view, it was not an arbitrary decision by the District Court to conclude that the machine achieved a performance of less than 115 vials per minute. The video clip merely indicates that the asserted performance was attainable over a brief period of time. [Seller] has not sufficiently explained and substantiated why it should be unsustainable to take recourse to the excel spreadsheet and other documents submitted by [Buyer] and to base the reasoning on a reference period of several years. With respect to the excel spreadsheet and other documents showing the relevant operation times, [Seller] has merely argued that it would challenge the correctness of their account. [Seller] has failed to demonstrate that and why it should have been arbitrary to appreciate them. Moreover, [Seller] has referred to the fact that [Buyer] refused to perform test-runs of the packaging machine at velocities of 150 and 145 vials per minute. However, this is also insufficient to establish an arbitrary decision. [Seller]'s arguments amount to a mere criticism of the reasoning adopted by the Appellate Court. Its submissions are unfounded (cf. above at 2). [Seller] further asserts that it was arbitrary when the District Court rejected its application to obtain an expert opinion on the actual condition of the packaging machine. This allegation is also unfounded, because it cannot be assumed that an expert would have been capable of determining the past performances of the machine from an ex post perspective. Any expert would have had to take [Buyer]'s documents into consideration. [Seller]'s challenging of the finding and evaluation of facts is unfounded. Consequently, the reasoning of the Appellate Court and the District Court -- which assumed a relevant actual performance of 52 vials per minute -- is upheld.
7.5 It has been found that the packaging machine achieves an actual performance of 52 vials per minute while 180 vials per minute were required under the contract concluded between the parties. This deviation establishes a fundamental breach of contract in terms of Art. 25 CISG. The Appellate Court has not violated Art. 25 CISG by having assumed a fundamental breach in the light of an actual performance of 52 vials per minute compared with a required performance of 180 vials per minute. The packaging machine delivered by [Seller] only achieved 29% of the agreed performance. Given a loss of productivity of 71%, [Buyer] is substantially deprived of what it has been entitled to expect under the contract. This amounts to a fundamental breach. The numerous attempts by [Seller] to cure the lack of conformity also demonstrate that the non-conformity could not be remedied within a reasonable time. Moreover, the particular packaging machine was specifically designed for [Buyer]'s individual needs. Therefore, any resale of the machine has been impossible or at least inappropriate for [Buyer]. Even [Seller] itself assumes that -- based on a performance of only 52 vials per minute -- its breach of contract was indeed fundamental. [Seller] merely asserts that the breach would not be fundamental if an actual performance of 115 vials per minute was to be taken into account. [Seller] has failed to submit any convincing argument against the reasoning of the Appellate Court and the District Court, according to which an actual performance of only 52 vials per minute (with 180 vials per minute being owed) amounted to a loss of productivity of 71% and thus qualified as a fundamental breach of contract.
8. [Assessment of Seller's allegation that there has been no violation of Art. 49 CISG]
[Seller] further alleges that [Buyer] had not declared avoidance of the contract within a reasonable time on 23 March 2003. It is [Seller]'s position that, since the Appellate Court held that [Buyer] had not forfeited its right to declare avoidance, it committed a violation of Art. 49(2)(b) CISG.
8.1 Pursuant. 39(2) CISG provides.
Under Art. 49(2)(b)(i) CISG, the buyer loses the right to declare the contract avoided in respect to any breach other than late delivery, if he does not make that declaration within a reasonable time after he knew or ought to have known of the breach. The question of whether any given period of time may still qualified as "reasonable" in terms of Art. 49(2)(b) CISG must be determined in accordance with all circumstances of the individual case and the purpose of this provision. Inter alia, regard must be had to the nature of goods and lack of conformity as well as the conduct of the seller subsequent to the buyer's notice of non-conformity (Müller-Chen, in: Schlechtriem / Schwenzer, Art. 49 para. 31). Art. 49(2)(b)(i) CISG provides that the relevant period of time commences as soon as the buyer has become aware or ought to have become aware of the breach of contract. This requires that the buyer has fully appreciated the existence, extent and scope of consequences of a breach of contract. Only if he has done so will he be capable of assessing whether there is actually a fundamental breach of contract which justifies avoidance of contract under Art. 49(1)(a) CISG (Müller-Chen, in: Schlechtriem/Schwenzer, Art. 49 para. 34). In general, a period of one to two months will be necessary and reasonable for the buyer to sufficiently examine the situation, unless there is a special case which would objectively justify either an extended or a reduced period (cf. Brunner, Art. 49 para. 12; Müller-Chen, in: Schlechtriem / Schwenzer, Art. 49 para. 32 and footnote 114).
8.2 The Appellate Court confirmed the reasoning of the District Court. The latter has held that [Buyer] declared avoidance of the contract within a reasonable time. The District Court also held that [Buyer] properly notified the lack of conformity in accordance with Art. 39(1) CISG. [Buyer] immediately notified [Seller] of the problems which had appeared after the packaging machine had been installed and after the first test-runs had been conducted. The first of these notifications was given on 5 October 2001. The following correspondence between the parties indicated that [Seller] persistently attempted to remedy the machine's lack of conformity. Until December 2002, [Buyer] sent more than twenty letters which contain detailed accounts of the still existing defects subsequent to the respective attempts to remedy. After [Seller] had undertaken these unsuccessful attempts for more than one year, it declared for the first time on 6 December 2002 that a performance of 180 vials per minute as demanded by [Buyer] could not be possibly achieved. At the same time, [Seller] made further proposals of how the actual performance might be increased. Thereupon, by letter dated 10 December 2002, [Buyer] referred to the extent of its losses which had been incurred until then by virtue of the lack of conformity of the machine. [Buyer] also demanded that [Seller] announce a definite date on which it would have accomplished the installation of a properly-operating machine. After a meeting at [Buyer]'s works, [Seller] made a proposal for an amicable settlement by letter dated 14 February 2003. However, [Seller] proposed a target performance which was once again well below the performance required by the contract. It turned out only by this point in time that [Buyer] would be substantially deprived of what it was entitled to expect under the contract. Therefore, the District Court concluded that the relevant period of time for a declaration of avoidance in terms of Art. 49(2)(b) CISG commenced on 14 February 2003. Since [Buyer] declared avoidance of contract on 23 March 2003, it acted within a reasonable time. It had to be considered that the complexity of the case required considerable examinations in legal and commercial matters before a declaration of avoidance could have been expected. Consequently, [Buyer] had to be granted a period of almost one-and-a-half months.
8.3 [Seller] claims that the Appellate Court has wrongly and arbitrarily determined that [Buyer] had become aware of the fundamental breach of contract by 14 February 2003. [Seller] submits that it had pointed out already in its letter of 6 December 2002 that the packaging machine would never be capable of achieving an output of 180 vials per minute. As a consequence, its failure to perform the contract had become definitive. The District Court was not entitled to conclude that the fundamentality of the breach had become apparent only by 14 February 200. This decision by the District Court was not consistent with its reasoning concerning the letter dated 6 December 2002. In that respect, the District Court came to an evidently incorrect and arbitrary determination of the facts.
[Seller]'s argument is unfounded. [Seller] has ignored that by virtue of the letter dated 6 December 2002, it merely turned out that the performance of 180 vials per minute as required by the contract could not be achieved. It was not readily apparent by this point in time which exact performance was possibly attainable by way of additional attempts to partially remedy the lack of conformity. Likewise, [Buyer] was not aware by that date about whether or not the breach of contract would turn out as a fundamental one. [Buyer] has become aware that the breach is indeed fundamental only subsequent to the meeting with [Seller]'s representatives and the latter's proposal for an amicable settlement. Therefore, neither the Appellate Court nor the District Court can be accused of an inconsistent -- let alone an arbitrary -- reasoning.
8.4 Given that [Buyer] had become aware of the fundamental breach of contract in terms of Art. 49(2)(b)(i) CISG only by 14 February 2003, it has not forfeited its right to declare avoidance by making that declaration on 23 March 2003. [Buyer] has declared avoidance within a reasonable time as provided in Art. 49(2)(b) CISG. Finally, even [Seller] has acknowledged that a period of between one and two months is generally reasonable.
9. [No violation of Art. 82(1) CISG]
[Seller] goes on to allege that the Appellate Court has violated Art. 82(1) CISG by holding that [Buyer] did not lose its right to declare avoidance as a result of its utilization of the machine.
9.1 Under Art. 82(1) CISG, the buyer loses the right to declare the contract avoided or to require the seller to deliver substitute goods if it is impossible for him to make restitution of the goods substantially in the condition in which he received them. Therefore, the buyer is entitled to declare the contract avoided only if it is capable of restituting the goods in mint condition. However, the rule of restitution in mint condition is subject to a twofold constraint. Art. 82(1) CISG itself only requires that the goods must be restituted "substantially in the condition" in which the buyer received them. This provision has the effect that the right to declare avoidance will be lost only cases where the condition of the goods has changed in such a way that it would be unreasonable to expect the seller to redeem the goods (Weber, in: Honsell, Kommentar zum UN-Kaufrecht, 1997, Art. 82 paras. 1 et seq.; Hornung / Fountoulakis, in: Schlechtriem / Schwenzer, Art. 82 para. 6). Normally, long-lasting goods are subject only to insignificant changes in their condition as a result of ordinary use (Weber, in: Honsell, Art. 82 para. 7). Moreover, Art. 82(2) CISG contains certain exemptions from the general principle of restitution in mint condition. In particular, Art. 82(1) CISG does not apply if the impossibility of making restitution of the goods or of making restitution of the goods substantially in the condition in which the buyer received them is not due to his act or omission (Art. 82(2)(a) CISG) or if the goods or part of the goods have been sold in the normal course of business or have been consumed or transformed by the buyer in the course of normal use before he discovered or ought to have discovered the lack of conformity (Art. 82(2)(c) CISG).
9.2 Neither the reasoning of the District Court nor of the Appellate Court gives any indication towards the fact that it would be impossible for [Buyer] to make restitution of the packaging machine in the condition in which he received it. [Seller] has also not brought forward any respective objection to the determination or evaluation of facts.
Consequently, it must be considered that the packaging machine can be restituted substantially in the condition in which [Buyer] received it. The latter has not lost its right to declare avoidance of contract pursuant to Art. 82 CISG. Therefore, [Seller]'s argument on this point is unfounded, as well.
10. [No violation of provisions governing the limitation period]
[Seller] asserts that the provisions of Art. 210(1) OR in conjunction with Arts. 116 et seq. and 148 IPRG have been violated. [Seller] claims that any claims on the part of [Buyer] were already subject to limitation. The Appellate Court failed to apply the one-year limitation period of Art. 210 OR to the present case.
10.1 The CISG does not govern the limitation of claims arising out of contracts for the international sale of goods (Brunner, Art. 4 para. 18; Dasser, in: Basler Kommentar, Internationales Privatrecht, 2nd ed. 2007, Art. 148 IPRG para. 3; Ferrari, in: Schlechtriem / Schwenzer, Art. 4 para. 35; Honsell, Schweizerisches Obligationenrecht, Besonderer Teil, 8th ed. 2006, p. 154; Keller / Girsberger, in: Zürcher Kommentar zum IPRG, 2nd ed. 2004, Art. 148 IPRG para. 7; Siehr, in: Honsell, Art. 4 CISG para. 23; Staudinger / Magnus, Art. 4 para. 38). Therefore, the assessment of whether an asserted claim arising out of a contract governed by the CISG is in fact subject to a time-bar must be decided in accordance with the domestic substantive law applicable by virtue of the conflict of laws rules of the forum State. If the conflict of laws rules of the forum State lead to the application of the substantive law of a Contracting State to the United Nations Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods of 14 June 1974, the issue of limitation is to be determined in accordance with this Convention (Brunner, Art. 4 para. 18; Koller, Die Verjährung von Ansprüchen des Käufers aus der Lieferung nicht vertragskonformer Ware im Spannungsfeld zwischen UN-Kaufrecht (CISG) und nationalem Partikularrecht, recht 2003, p. 42).
10.2 [Seller] has its habitual residence in Switzerland. Thus, the Appellate Court has correctly decided that the issue of limitation of the right to declare the contract avoided is governed by Swiss law (Art. 118 in conjunction with Art. 148 IPRG in conjunction with Art. 3 of The Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to International Sale of Goods of 15 June 1955 (SR 0.221.211.4). Since Switzerland has not become a Contracting State to the United Nations Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods of 14 June 1974, its four-year limitation period concerning all claims arising out of contracts for the international sale of goods cannot apply in the present case. It means that the question of limitation of claims arising out of the contract concluded between [Buyer] and [Seller] is governed by the Swiss Code on the Law of Obligations of 30 March 1911 (OR; SR 220).
10.3 [Seller] has submitted before the Court that the limitation period was governed by Art. 210 OR.
Pursuant to Art. 210 OR, a buyer's claims arising out of a lack of conformity of the goods become time-barred one year after the goods have been delivered to it by the seller. In certain cases, an application of this one-year limitation period (Art. 210 OR) to contracts governed by the CISG will be problematic: It might happen that claims arising out of a lack of conformity of the goods would already be time-barred whereas the period for notification under Art. 39(2) CISG has not even expired. As stated beforehand, the buyer loses the right to rely on a lack of conformity of the goods in accordance with Art. 39(2) CISG if he does not give the seller notice thereof at the latest within a period of two years from the date on which the goods were actually handed over to the buyer. Therefore, legal scholars tend to argue that Art. 210 OR should be inapplicable to sales contracts governed by the CISG (Brunner, Art. 4 CISG para. 25; Dasser, in: Basler Kommentar, Art. 148 IPRG para. 3; Honsell, p. 154; Keller/Girsberger, in: Zürcher Kommentar zum IPRG, Art. 148 IPRG para. 7; Koller, pp. 47 et seq.; Will, Zum Wiener UN-Kaufrecht / Verjährung, SJZ [*] 1998, 146 et seq.). The Court holds that this is an appropriate solution. The one-year limitation period provided for in Art. 210 OR cannot be applied at least to those cases where it would subject a claim to limitation even before the two-year notification period of Art. 39(2) CISG has expired. Otherwise, there would be a violation of provisions of public international law.
There are various possible solutions to adapt the rule contained in Art. 210 OR (cf. in particular: Brunner, Art. 4 CISG paras. 25 et seq.; Koller, pp. 45 et seq.). For instance, some scholars propose that the general limitation period of ten years under Art. 127 OR should apply instead of Art. 210 OR (cf. references at Schlechtriem/Schwenzer, Art. 39 CISG para. 29 at footnote 141). Others suggest that the period under Art. 210 OR should either be extended to two-years (judgment by the Cour de Justice de Genève of 10 October 1997 = cisg-online No. 295) or that the one-year period of Art. 210 OR should not already commence at the time of delivery but only by the time when the lack of conformity has been notified (judgments by the Commercial Court of the Canton Berne of 30 October 2001 = cisg-online No. 956, and of 17 January 2002 = cisg-online No. 725).
In the present case, it may remain undecided which of these solutions should be applied. In particular, it is immaterial whether the relevant limitation period is two or ten years. The Appellate Court has correctly reasoned that the laws of Switzerland also govern a possible suspension of the running of the limitation period. Art. 135 OR provides that the running of a limitation period will be suspended either if the debtor acknowledges the existence of the claim or if the creditor files an action with respect to the claim. The debtor may acknowledge the existence of a claim against itself by virtue of any conduct which may be reasonable understood by the creditor as a confirmation of its liability in law (judgment by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court of 16 May 2002, case docket 4C.60/2002, E. 1.3). By virtue of its final attempt to cure the lack of conformity of the machine on 31 October 2002, [Seller] has suspended the running of the limitation period (cf. BGE 121 III 270 E. 3c, p. 272). [Buyer] has also filed an action with respect to the questionable claim on 9 February 2004. Consequently, the asserted claim would not be subject to a time-bar even if a two-year limitation period were applied.
10.4 Therefore, [Buyer]'s claims and other rights following the existence of a fundamental breach of contract are not time-barred. [Seller] has not raised any objection against the magnitude of the demanded sums. The Appellate Court has made a correct decision also with respect to the issue of limitation.
11. [No violation of law by the Appellate Court in dismissing the cross-action]
Finally, [Seller] argues that the Appellate Court has violated Art. 84(2) CISG and Art. 29(2) BV when it denied [Seller] the possibility to rely on a set-off based on a counterclaim for compensation for use of the machine.
11.1 The Appellate Court decided not to resolve whether the District Court was right to disallow [Seller]'s counterclaim on the grounds that [Buyer]'s obligation to mitigate its losses under Art. 77 CISG excluded any possibility to exercise a set-off in regard to asserted compensation for utilization of the machine. Instead, the Appellate Court held that [Seller] failed to sufficiently substantiate and prove the existence of its counterclaim. The mere application to have the value of utilization determined by means of an expert opinion is not sufficient to substantiate a claim since [Seller] itself would have been well-able to calculate the value of the counterclaim. Apart from this application for an expert opinion, [Seller] merely suggested that one of its own employees be heard by the court. It could hardly amount to useful evidence if that employee were being heard as a witness. Moreover, the evidence offered by [Seller] was ineligible. Witnesses could only be such persons who are actually aware from their own sensory perception of the facts subject to being proven. However, witnesses were not suitable to take the burden of substantiation. Consequently, the Appellate Court ruled that [Seller] neither substantiated nor proved the existence of a counterclaim within the required time which might have been put to a set-off. The District Court had been right to dismiss the counterclaim asserted by [Seller] for compensation of [Buyer]'s utilization of the packaging machine.
11.2 However, [Seller] argues that it sufficiently substantiated the existence of its claim for compensation for [Buyer]'s utilization. It also offered suitable pieces of evidence.
It is correct that [Seller] has in fact provided a precise calculation with respect to its alleged claim for compensation of use by way of its statement of defense and statement of claim concerning the cross-action. In the first place, [Seller] argued that a reasonable compensation for [Buyer]'s utilization of the machine should be determined by way of expert opinion. Nevertheless, [Seller] has later claimed EUR 1,997,416.16 as being the exact amount of compensation with respect to the time between October and September 2005. [Seller] also stated that it offset a rental charge of 2.8% per month relative to the purchase price. Mr. A. should be heard as a witness.
11.3 It appears doubtful whether the Appellate Court correctly concluded that [Seller] had failed to sufficiently substantiate its counterclaim. In any event, however, the Appellate Court was correct in deciding that [Seller] had not complied with its burden of proof in this regard. In its statement of defense and statement of claim with regard to the cross-action, [Seller] has merely claimed the rental charges without having offered any evidence which might support the propriety of the argument. In particular, [Seller] failed to submit documents related to similar rental agreements, any tables of commercial calculation, invoices or terms of business of leasing corporations. [Seller] could have also nominated a representative of the respective industry who might have testified that it was actually common to have these rental charges. Nonetheless, [Seller] merely appointed one of its own employees as a witness and further demanded that an expert opinion be obtained. The Appellate Court has not violated Art. 29(2) BV when it decided to reject [Seller]'s pieces of evidence. A court may do so if pieces of evidence have been offered by one party but are not suitable from the outset to prove the asserted facts (BGE 131 I 153 E. 3, p. 157 with further references).
12. [Conclusion]
As a consequence, [Seller]'s appeal is dismissed as unfounded. The latter is liable to bear all relevant costs in relation to the present proceedings (Art. 66(1) and Art. 68(2) BGG).

**.Go to Case Table of ContentsLeeds Rhinos: Ryan Hall delighted to turn 'new page of history'
Leeds winger Ryan Hall labelled their Grand Final win over Warrington at Old Trafford as "a new page of history".
The Rhinos' top scorer got the game-sealing fourth try, his 27th of the season, to help his side to a 26-18 win - their fifth title in six years.
"People are comparing it to last year's," Hall told BBC Sport. "And we did it the hard way again.
"But we didn't come here knowing we were going to win. This is a new page in our history."
The result gave the Rhinos some payback for their 35-18 defeat by the Wolves at Wembley at August in the Challenge Cup final.
While this was Leeds' sixth Super League title in nine years, they have persistently failed at Wembley in that same period, having lost in six visits to the Challenge Cup final since last winning it in 1999.
Sinfield savours 'incredible' Grand Final
And Hall admitted that the men from Headingley had to draw on their wealth of experience to bounce back from a third successive Challenge Cup disappointment.
"Mentally it was difficult," said the 25-year-old England international. "But we are the right bunch of players to come back from that.
"We got our heads around it and we set our mentality right and that is why we are here today."
Looking ahead to next season, Hall described the boost that being champions again will once again give to their whole squad.
"We'd like to make it easy for ourselves next time and finish first but we probably won't do that," he joked.
"What this does is gives us a great lift because it means pre-season is a great time for us.
"Knowing that we're champions helps you get out of bed for training at six o'clock in the morning when it's raining."
Leeds's reward is another meeting with NRL winners Melbourne Storm in the World Club Challenge in February.
So far, it is honours even, Leeds having beaten the Aussie side once, 11-4 in 2008, before losing 18-10 in a controversial rematch, also at Elland Road two years later.
And the Rhinos will be looking to defend their title, having started this long season with a 26-12 win over Manly, in which Hall's two tries won him the man of the match award, nine months ago.Police are looking for the person who shot and killed a man in San Francisco Sunday morning. Officers responded to gunshots near Hayes and Webster streets around 2:05 a.m. When officers arrived, they found a man suffering from a gunshot wound. The man later died at the scene. Police said they do not know the motive behind the shooting and have not yet made any arrests in the case.
Published at 12:44 PM PDT on Feb 10, 2013David De Gea reassured over Spain role
Vicente Del Bosque says David De Gea's time will come in the Spanish national team, but has suggested the Manchester United goalkeeper will have to wait for the moment.
The Spain coach has included five of Spain’s recently crowned European Under-21 Champions in his panel for this week’s friendly in Ecuador, however there was no place for Premier League champion De Gea on the list.
Speaking at his pre-game press conference the World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012 winning manager said he was well aware of De Gea’s potential but had decided to retain Pepe Reina, Victor Valdes and Iker Casillas as the trio get on so well together as a group, and are also superb 'keepers individually.
“I have been watching the Under-21s and De Gea is a goalkeeper who will mark an era,” Del Bosque said. “At the present I do not find a reason to change the goalkeepers. If Casillas, Valdes and Reina are here it is not because they are funny guys, but because they are good 'keepers. At the Confederations Cup, the attention was focused on the goals because of Casillas’ situation and all worked well. They get on very well together, are good team-mates and I wanted to maintain the situation.”
The five youngsters who have travelled - Isco, Thiago Alcantara, Inigo Martinez, Koke and Cristian Tello - could add new options for him to consider, Del Bosque said.
“If they are here it is because they have the ability to play for the senior side,” he said. “There are good reinforcements coming from behind, who we are going to add in bit by bit. But for sure the block from Euro 2012 still have some distance left to go. We have a stable team with few players over 30. This team has a future.”
The 3-0 loss to Brazil in June’s Confederations Cup final would not lead to any panic or wholesale changes in Spain’s approach, said the experienced coach.
“At the Confederations Cup everything went well,” Del Bosque said. “We were very excited to reach the final against Brazil, but we were drained physically and they beat us there – right from when the hymn began to play.”
La Roja captain Casillas said he was expecting a tough test from Ecuador, who are currently well set to qualify for next summer’s World Cup in Brazil.
"Ecuador is a team with technical ability but also great physical power,” the Real Madrid 'keeper said. “They close up space very well and that becomes uncomfortable. We must run more than them and be accurate.”
Casillas brushed away a suggestion that Spain’s players were annoyed at yet another long trip to South America at an awkward time just before the club season kicked off.
"Neither the journeys nor the kilometres are important,” he said. “To be anywhere with ‘la seleccion’ is a source of pride. We are delighted. The affection with which we are received, especially in South America, is huge. We appreciate it.”
One player delighted to have made the trip is Fernando Llorente, who returns to the Spain squad having slipped out of the picture last season while he was kicking his heels on the Athletic Bilbao bench.
“It is always a very big excitement to return to the national team,” said the new Juventus centre-forward. "I am arriving at a very nice moment for me. Llorente is back with a lot of motivation, as if it was the first day. It will be very difficult [to make World Cup squad], but I am going to try and give a.by FP Staff Jul 31, 2012 19:41 IST

While the benefits of serving on a board are clear, most women have carefully balanced ecosystems that enable them to run their dual careers at work and home—and they would be well advised to assess the commitments, risks and trade-offs, liabilities and reputational risks, before signing up.
Which board?
Target and study the types of boards on which you would like to serve. Board structures vary across countries, responsibilities vary from executive to non-executive. Companies vary from individually or family owned companies and corporations to start-ups and non-profits. Ownership, scale, location and industry are important factors to consider. Lastly, diligence on the reputation, dynamics and antecedents of the board or shareholders is key.
Figure out the process
While board searches are increasingly run by professional executive search firms, traditionally the process of getting on a board can be opaque, driven by word of mouth, family connections or the old boys’ club. Each channel has its own strategy. Suss out whom you know on boards, figure out how you leverage personal and professional networks. Get on the radar with search firms. Get on the board registries. Build and reach out to a network of mentors and influencers.
Get ‘board-ready’
Familiarize yourself with the process of how boards are structured and how they work. At the very least, get financially literate. The next step is to understand what skills and experience the target boards seek, and how you SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) up against that. Apart from professional and personal credibility, do you bring industry or functional expertise? Knowledge of specific markets or customer segments? Significant profit and loss (P&L) management experience? Are you aware of the larger economic issues and global trends? Can you demonstrate strategic or operational skills? There is a perception that women do not always have the breadth of career experience that their male counterparts have—particularly in terms of travel, difficult postings or projects, etc. Think through qualifications and experiences that need to be supplemented. Consider executive education, training. Look at how to position your experience to a board.
Personal branding
By and large, women expect their work to speak for them—and tend to hesitate to proactively project themselves. Branding is about what you stand for, as well as visibility. Google yourself once in a while, and see what shows up. All senior professionals have—or should have—a professional brand statement. Define your proposition, your tag line, and work on your elevator pitch—what do you do—your experience and expertise, your value-add, your goals. How are you projecting your brand? Unfortunately, if you don’t stand out, you are unlikely to get that call—think through how to step this up, particularly outside of your existing company. Do you write, teach or volunteer? What are the companies, committees and affiliations you are associated with? Are you on social media?
Consider how to engage
A board CV generally differs from a regular job résumé—and should be designed to showcase your strategic value-add and brand proposition. How you structure it will depend on your proposition. Recognize that board interviews are also quite different from regular job interviews, often conducted in less formal settings, often over a drink, designed as much to assess compatibility and style as skills. Can you disagree without being disagreeable? Ask tough questions? Over and above this, boards co-opting women for the first time may have additional concerns about commitment, time, availability to serve on committees, etc. Research the backgrounds of board members and seek connects, work with the search firm or your introducer to identify and address concerns.
Recognize that there are assumptions and biases out there. The onus does really lie with the woman to tackle these, learn to navigate the unspoken rules and influence the landscape. Invest, prepare, learn—be proactive, rather than just working hard and awaiting recognition. Seek out opportunities to gain experiences. Mentor and be mentored. Create your circle of support. Find the people who influence board selection, ask for advice, pitch your stuff and ask if they will recommend you. Above all, don’t hesitate to explicitly state your goal of serving on a board to everyone who matters—take charge of the process.
So, hup two three four! As an uncle of mine used to say to me, “Don’t be afraid of the shy.”

A pregnant Kate Hudson holds her belly as she picks up her son Ryder from school in Los Angeles on Wednesday (February 16).
The 31-year-old actress’ next movie to be released is titled Something Borrowed..
The trailer for Something Borrowed has just been released, and the movie will be released on May 6, 2011.Judging by the interest to my last actors post, I thought I’d throw up a piece of code that uses actors anonymously to parallelise a long running operation. Not every operation can be parallelised, most things we work on tend to be fairly sequential. However, sometimes if you can split up the work to perform an operation, you can get some serious bang for your buck.
Let’s take a pretty interesting little problem as an example, working out pi. I first encountered this problem in a job interview a while back (yeah, I thought it was out there too). It’s an example of what’s known as a Monte Carlo Simulation. The general way to work this out is described in detail in this Google Code University tutorial on parallel programming (worth taking a look).
The genaral approach works on the basis of this diagram.
The steps are as follows:
- generate points randomly in the square
- work out whether each point falls into the circle (distance from centre is less than the radius, use Pythagoras here)
- the proportion of points in the circle to those in the square is approximately the same as that of the areas of the two shapes; transpose the area formulas (I’ll show it in the code) to work out an approximate value of pi
It’s a nice little problem, because the more points you generate, the better the estimate gets. It’s also easily parallelisable as the first two steps can be performed repeatedly by anyone. Let’s do a first pass in a single thread:
package net.jakubkorab.pi_evaluator import scala.actors._ import scala.actors.Actor._ import scala.math._ object PiEvaluator { val sideLength : Double = 1 val radius : Double = sideLength / 2 val totalPointsToSample : Long = 10000 def isRandomPointWithinCircleRadius() : Boolean = { val x = (random * sideLength) - radius val y = (random * sideLength) - radius val hypotenuse = sqrt(pow(abs(x), 2) + pow(abs(y), 2)) // pythagoras hypotenuse <= radius } def pointsInCircle(pointsToSample : Long) : Long = { (1L to pointsToSample) .map((i : Long) => isRandomPointWithinCircleRadius()) .foldLeft(0L) { (pointCount : Long, pointInCircle : Boolean) => if (pointInCircle) pointCount + 1 else pointCount } } def approximatePi(pointsEvaluated : Long, pointsInCircle : Long) = { println("After " + pointsEvaluated + " samples, the number of points in a circle was " + pointsInCircle) val areaOfSquare = sideLength * sideLength // areaOfCircle/areaOfSquare =~ pointsInCircle/pointsEvaluated, so val areaOfCircle = pointsInCircle * areaOfSquare / pointsEvaluated // areaOfCircle = pi * r^2, so val approximatePi = areaOfCircle / pow(radius, 2) println("Pi is approx: " + approximatePi) } def main(args : Array[String]) = { approximatePi(totalPointsToSample, pointsInCircle(totalPointsToSample)) } }
At line 20, there’s a nice little bit of map-reduce action going on (fold is an equivalent name). What’s going on is that for each number, we’re generating a random number an determining whether it’s in a circle. Then we fold/reduce the list of booleans returned by the map function to give a count of all the points that were generated within the radius of the circle. It’s a super useful little programming construct.
We then call approximatePi() to do our maths for us.
Running this (I’m doing it through SBT, that’s why the [Info] outputs) we get:
After 10000 samples, the number of points in a circle was 7883 Pi is approx: 3.1532 [info] == run == [success] Successful. [info] [info] Total time: 5 s, completed 30-Jan-2011 13:45:46
Not bad, but we need more points to get a better result. We know that pi should be around 3.14159, but we’re not quite there yet. Scaling up our numbers:
Ok, we’re approaching our known value, but this approach has shown some stress. It’s not scaling too well. It’s slowing right down, but my processor (Intel Core2 Duo T9300 @ 2.5GHz) is showing only ~60% usage. If we could break down the point generation among a number of threads, and then tally up the result at the end, we could make better use of our hardware. Enter fork-join.
Fork-join is probably one of the most common things that you’d want to do with concurrency. It’s a bit of a pain in the butt in Java (task executor framework, futures etc.). It really shouldn’t be. There’s some excellent work going on around a framework for this, and map-reduce too, for future versions of the language. In the meantime, you need to jump through hoops – cue fishing through Concurrency in Practice. In Scala though, it’s really easy using actors. So we rewrite main:
val workers = 10 def main(args : Array[String]) = { // break down the job between worker - there's a rounding issue here, but never mind val samplesPerWorker = totalPointsToSample / workers 1 to workers foreach { (workerNumber : Int) => val worker = actor { receive { case pointsToEvaluate : Long => { sender ! (pointsToEvaluate, pointsInCircle(pointsToEvaluate)) // reply with a tuple } } } worker ! samplesPerWorker } var workersReplied = 0 var totalPointsEvaluated = 0L var totalPointsInCircle = 0L while (workersReplied < workers) { receive { case (pointsEvaluated : Long, pointsInCircle : Long) => { workersReplied += 1 totalPointsEvaluated += pointsEvaluated totalPointsInCircle += pointsInCircle if (workersReplied % 100 == 0) { println(workersReplied + " workers replied") } } } } approximatePi(totalPointsEvaluated, totalPointsInCircle) }
64s is a lot better than our original 189s! And this effect just gets more pronounced the more processors you have (where the optimal number of actors matches the number of processors; at least it should be – feel free to play around with this).
In the second version of main, the actor keyword/block is actually a method on the Actor object that creates an anonymous actor instance and instantly starts it. We ping some messages to it, and wait for the results using receive().
Easy, and you can apply it for a ton of different tasks.This summer the thin diaphanous veil of civilization that we call Brooklyn will be gently, but firmly removed.

Researchers at the University of Manchester School of Dentistry in England have created a way of identifying patients with osteoporosis using dental X-rays.
The Manchester team developed a software-based approach to detecting osteoporosis using routine dental X-rays, also called radiographs, by automatically measuring the thickness of part of the patient's lower jaw.
Health care professionals use radiographs widely in the National Health Service in England to examine third molars and gums for disease, as well as during routine examinations.
To harness these high use rates, the team drew on "active shape modeling" technology developed by the Division of Imaging Sciences of the University of Manchester to automatically detect jaw cortex widths of less than 3 millimeters — a key indicator of osteoporosis — during the radiographic process.
"At the start of our study we tested 652 women for osteoporosis using the current 'gold standard,' and highly expensive, DXA test," Dr. Keith Horner said. "This identified 140 sufferers."
"Our automated X-ray test immediately flagged-up over half of these," Dr. Horner continued. "The patients concerned may not otherwise have been tested for osteoporosis, and in a real-life situation would immediately be referred for conclusive DXA testing."
"As well as being virtually no extra work for the dentist, the diagnosis does not depend on patients being aware that they are at risk of [developing] the disease," Dr. Hugh Devlin explained. "Just by introducing a simple tool and getting health care professionals working together, around two in five sufferers undertaking routine dental X-rays could be identified."
"The test might even encourage older women to visit the dentist more regularly," Dr. Devlin added.

(3/2007)
Classic Graves aromatics of soy, cedar, underbrush, sweet currants and cherries along with a hint of smoke/burning embers are followed by a wine possessing excellent fruit, medium body, sweet tannin, and a seductive, lush personality. It may merit an outstanding score with another year or two of bottle age. Consume it over the next 12-15 years.
(6/2007)
Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot. Mid crimson. Some attractive development and freshness and only the merest hint of toast. Just about ready to enjoy - sweet even if not that subtle.
(5/2011)
Red-ruby. Black cherry on the moderately ripe nose. Not particularly concentrated, but supple, round and fleshy, with a chocolatey ripeness. A rather gently styled wine with good depth and length. In a small group tasting of Graves wines, this was quite appealing, while a number of other wines, a few of which normally perform well at this early stage, came off as distinctly green, inky, clenched or dry, including Fieuzal, Carbonnieux, Latour Martillac, Olivier, Rahoul and Bouscaut.
(5/2005)
One of my favorite lesser-known properties in Bordeaux. The reds are always quite delicious and readily approachable. This 2004 is no exception. Cigar smoke, black currants, plums and Asian spices. Medium-bodied with no hard edges. Expansive, sweet tannins, loads of spice as well as black currant and cherry fruit; it can be drunk now or cellared for 10 moreAn Alcovy High School graduate’s hard work in the classroom and on the field paid off when the United States Air Force came calling.
Robert Bullard accepted a full-ride football scholarship to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy in the fall, an education valued at an estimated $416,000, according to the Academy’s public affairs office.
The Tigers’ defensive cornerback admitted the Academy was not initially on his radar until a recruiting coach contacted him in his junior year of high school.
“The more I learned about the Air Force Academy, the more I learned of all the good things I could get attending there,” Bullard said.
He said once he set his sights on the Academy, he focused on continuing to make good grades and staying on top of his academics.
“I wanted to be the best student athlete I could be,” Bullard said.Even though he was busy with football and schoolwork, he still made time for the FBLA Club and the Distinguished Gentlemen’s Club.
“Robert has demonstrated a commitment to the total school program here at Alcovy,” said Kirk Hoffman, Alcovy’s football coach. “As a football coach, nothing pleases me more than seeing my athletes excel on both the field and in the classroom.
“Robert is intelligent, athletic, hard-working and friendly. He shows equal persistence and dedication in his athletic endeavors as he does in his academic work. He has earned and deserves the honors that he has achieved on and off the playing field. I truly believe that Robert will make Alcovy proud as he takes his athletic talent to the Air Force Academy next year.”
Bullard said he already has his future goals mapped out.
“When I go to the Academy, I want to get my degree in business while playing football, which is a love of mine,” Bullard said. “I want to get a good education and a good job and provide for my family.”
He will attend the Academy prep school his first year then transfer to the Academy for the remaining four years. When he graduates, Bullard will be commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. Ultimately, he said his goal is to gain a job in contracting for the Air Force.
Bullard said he hasn’t decided if he wants to pursue a full 20-year career with the Air Force because he also has aspirations to play professional football.
“I know I have the abilities to make it far,” Bullard said. “In the Air Force, you have to wait two years after you graduate before you can get into the NFL. So if it goes like I want it to, I can see myself doing that.”
He said when he thinks about it, attending the Air Force Academy is a “no-brainer.”
“It’s amazing,” Bullard said. “I don’t have to pay anything, I’ll get a great education, and I get to play a sport I love – it’s just a dream come true.”
Military service is nothing new to Bullard’s family, he said. His grandfather was in the U.S. Army, and two uncles and one cousin served in the U.S. Air Force. His mother, Natasha Bullard, said the entire family is excited for her son and his incredible opportunity to attend the Academy and ultimately serve his country.
“Robert excels in everything that he does,” said Sandra Owens, Alcovy High School’s principal. “His accomplishments at Alcovy High School have opened the door of opportunity to attend the U.S. Air Force Academy. I know he will be successful there, and this family plus the Alcovy community are very proud of him.”The Carl's Jr. restaurant at 2930 F St. recently sold for $1.57 million, according to an Irvine firm that represented the buyer and the seller.

Applications should include a short letter of interest and a resume. These materials must be sent by Jan. 15 to the attention of John Heaton in the CDFA's Pest Exclusion Branch, 1220 N St., Room 344, Sacramento, 95814.Small Animal Stretchers (Less than 150 Pounds)
Our Back Saver Small Animal Stretchers for patients under 150 pounds make transporting a lot easier. If your need if for animals weighing more than 150 pounds, one of our three "Super Stretchers" with 300, 500 and 800 pound ratings should be used. Click here for information about our Super Stretchers.
All three of our Small Animal Stretchers have removable handles. The easy to clean vinyl material between the stretcher poles is reinforced with a fine mesh polyester cord which prevents tearing even if a patient has chewed a hole in the fabric.
Edges are rolled and doubled stitched for added strength and durability. A piece of fabric will be sent upon request. You are invited to try and rip it.
The grips used on our stretchers are made of a soft ribbed rubber with a flange. The soft ribbed rubber design provides a more secure grip on the handle when your hands are wet than would a smooth hard rubber grip. The flange holds the gripping portion of the handle off the floor even when the patient may be resting on the steel support, thus making it easier to get your fingers under the handle for lifting.
Shark Release Using 58 inch Stretcher
All of the stretchers are available in a Post-Op clean-up version with a mesh center panel. If the stretcher is supported on supports spanning a tube, the flow of water used to cleanup a patient following surgery is easier to control. The water flows straight down the sides of the patient, through the mesh, and into the tub. The water is less likely to flow sideways into regions you did not wish to get wet. The mesh center panel does not reduce the load carrying capacity of the stretcher.
All of our stretchers are easy to store when not in use. Simply roll it up and store in a convenient closet until needed.
Standard Sizes: 36", 46" and 58" long. All are rated to 150 pounds.
Feedback from veterinary practices provide the following guidance for selecting a specific size.
A German Shepard can be carried on either a 36" or a 46" stretcher, though the head may need to be supported with the 36" stretcher.
A Great Dane can be carried on either a 46" or a 58" stretcher, though the head may need to be supported with the 46" stretcher.
These stretchers are also finding applications with wildlife and marine management organizations. Common applications are transporting Whitetail Deer, Dolphins, and Sharks. If the animals weigh more than 150 pounds or are to be transported over rough terrain, however, we recommend using our heavier duty Super Stretcher. Feel free to call and discuss your application for advise on choosing the correct stretcher.Secretary-General Yariv Oppenheimer of Shalom Achshav (Peace Now) filed a complaint with Tel Aviv police of threats on his life, Tuesday, according to Israel Defense Forces Radio.

9. THEATER: Trial of Joseph McCarthy
Sen. Joseph McCarthy, known for hunting supposed Communists and others he sees as a threat, and two colleagues go on trial for criminal conspiracy and blackmail charges in the death of Sen. Lester Hunt, who killed himself in 1954 after his son was arrested on suspicion of soliciting sex from an undercover policeman. Think you’ve climbed into a time machine? Actually, this is alternative history presented as theater by the Mattachine Society of Washington, D.C., which has revived the name of that historical gay rights group and undertaken a mission of “archive activism,” telling the unknown stories of LGBT Americans. Hunt really did commit suicide after his son’s arrest, but McCarthy never paid for his complicity in the matter. The mock trial, Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at All Souls Church Unitarian in the nation’s capital, will be introduced by former U.S. senator Alan Simpson and will feature several other political and media luminaries, including lawyer and activist Mindy Daniels, former Barney Frank aide Robert Raben, journalist Jamie Kirchick (whose work has appeared in The Advocate), and, as McCarthy, lobbyist Ed Senn. Admission is free; more info here. — Trudy Ring
8. EVENT: A Queer History of Fashion, Ongoing
From 18th-century French menswear to a Jean Paul Gaultier kilt-and-trouser ensemble, there's no denying that LGBT people have had an influence on the fashion industry. New York's Fashion Institute of Technology celebrates 300 years of the LGBTQ people who have created, inspired, and worn some of the most iconic looks in history. — Michelle Garcia
3. VIDEO: Hi Fashion, "Pupusa"
This crazy duo with queer sensibilities and a gay member have a new video for "Pupusa," a single off their EP, You Are Gorgeous. Just like the doughy Latin American dish, the video is a delicious treat. With bright colors, spastic dancing, and buckets of face paint, "Pupusa" continues Hi Fashion's tradition of ebullient and hilarious videos. — Neal Broverman

What is a Nurse Practitioner?
Although nurse practitioners have been practicing under Oregon state law for over 30 years, many patients do not have a clear understanding of what a nurse practitioner is and how they differ from nurses and physicians. Since nurse practitioners are licensed and qualified to provide many of the same services that patients frequently receive from both nurses and primary care physicians, the confusion is understandable.
Advanced Practice Nursing and the Nurse Practitioner
Nurse practitioners are nurses who have received a master’s degree in nursing, and further education and clinical training in primary care medicine, pharmacology, and skills specific to any area of specialty they choose (such as pediatrics, geriatrics, mental health, or women’s health). Following this additional education and clinical experience, they may take a national certification exam, and be licensed as a nurse practitioner under Oregon law. They are then qualified to evaluate, provide, and coordinate comprehensive personalized health care.
A board-certified Nurse Practitioner is licensed to perform exams, provide holistic health care, manage health problems, diagnose illness, provide health counseling, prescribe medication as appropriate, and refer patients to other health care providers and specialists, as well as other responsibilities. A nurse practitioner is licensed to provide many of the same services as a physician in Oregon. Many nurse practitioners work for physicians to help them serve more patients in need of the most common health care services. Other nurse practitioners work independently and by collaboration and referral with other nurse practitioners, physicians, specialists, and community resources to provide patients with services beyond their own scope of practice.
You’ll find another, more detailed explanation of nurse practitioners from the Nurse Practitioners of Oregon here.
What’s the difference between a physician (MD) and a Nurse Practitioner?
The difficulty in defining the role of the nurse practitioner stems from the fact that nurse practitioners’ work often straddles the line between the work of nurses and physicians. Like nurses, they collect health histories, conduct physical exams, provide disease management, and do certain procedures like giving shots, drawing blood samples, etc. Like physicians they order lab tests, provide diagnosis, prescribe medications, and counsel and educate patients and families.
Nurse practitioners are limited to seeing patients that fall within their scope of practice (a list of requirements that are usually determined on a national level). If a patient requires treatment that does not fall into the nurse practitioners scope of practice, that patient is referred to a physician or other resource for further care. Physicians often have more latitude in handling more specialized conditions or treatments directly, but also refer patients to specialists (like cardiologists or urologists) for specific diagnosis and treatment.
Nurse practitioner’s work is especially geared toward teaching patients about long term health maintenance and disease avoidance. In a setting which allows time for this interaction between the nurse practitioner and patient, this focus on discussing patient’s concerns and providing health education is often the feature that patients will notice most when seeing a nurse practitioner.
Of course, every nurse practitioner and physician are unique, so some nurse practitioners may have specialized education that expands their scope of practice, and some physicians may have a special interest and skill in providing detailed patient education.
Are Nurse Practitioners as good as physicians?
There have been several research studies that compare outcomes such as patient satisfaction, patient care, need for urgent care between NPs and MDs. For more information see the following:
Comparing NP and MD primary care outcomes: Two-year follow-up
…the primary health care delivered by NPs and MDs is equal in quality.
Empathy: An NP/MD comparison

We live in a world where Berlins annual Love Parade grabs control of the streets with cheesy techno, filling the cityillsicsills rap is a patois of vintage consumer brands revived as hipster totems and personal passions, stream-of-consciousness dreamy talk and light, feel-good chattiness. And despite the mellow tone, the untrammeled joy, the embrace of the markets musics miscegenated offspring: L.A.s Cut Chemist, Brazils Amon Tobin, the Netherlands Solex, Germanys Mouse on Mars, Detroits Juan Atkins, Japans Nobukazu Takemura, Englands Smith and Mighty.
The most important thing for me is, were L.A.-based, says McNeill. What we really know is L.A., and what weve tried to do is say, okay, when you tune into Dublab youre getting a snapshot of L.A. His is a deceptive localism, though. But our reach is beyond L.A., its the world. Dublab started out as one station, but hopefully itll grow into satellite stations. If we can do a radio station in Tokyo, and we can find some kids who really know about music in Tokyo, then theyre going to represent Tokyo. If we can find some kids in Sao Paulo who know the music down there, then well start a studio there. Well start a studio in New York. Well 20s, 78-rpm phonograph records didntOLs Spinner.com or Viacoms Radio.Son icnet.com offer near infinite choice, their most appealing features are also their most unfortunate -- with endless a choice and customization of what youre listening to (dozens of channels including Top Country vs. Alt. Country vs. Classic Country; Quality Rock vs. Classic Rock vs. Modern Rock), you too will select your way into a cul-de-sac.
Well be going from very, very few choices to almost infinite choices, explains Buck. And thats Ill go to see the Sugarhill Gang on the Santa Monica Pier, and then Ill go to a Phish concert the next night. I believe that true music lovers listen to all types of different music or can at least appreciate them.
Dublab is positive music that spans all times and genres, says McNeill. On my show youre going to hear Belle & Sebastian followed by Miles Davis followed by 4Hero followed by Gang Starr followed by Burning Spear. What Ive related it all to is new roots music -- it might be from totally different eras, but it still has connections. Our goal is to educate listeners while pushing them forward into new music thats Bucks parents. Right now the station is looking for sponsors, but only ones that might appeal to its listeners tastes: MacIntosh, Adidas, Sony Playstation. McNeill explains, Were not going to say, Okay, lets have Chevron sponsor us, theyve got millions of dollars, because, you know, fuck Chevron.
Buck complains that theyve had a hard time with venture capitalists in part because Dublab isnt looking for enough money; its operating budget is more along the lines of $200,000 a year, rather than the millions of up-in-smoke capital that has, oddly, been taken as a forecast for success among new economy pundits. Yet Dublabs audience, built up entirely by word of mouth, could place it in the thick of Arbitrons new Internet-radio ratings.
Honestly, its easier than people think, says McNeill. I think too many Web sites have fallen into this idea that you need to have a ton of money, you need to spend a lot of money, and you need to have a lot of employees to be worthwhile, and thats bullshit. These companies have no proven product yet are spending millions of dollars each month and have 70 people working for them. We might be only six people, but this is what we want to do.

James Whale mentioned that last time she had been on his show , a cardiologist had rung in to say that she was peddling seriously harmful misinformation and that fats were really bad. She replied that obviously, he wasn't reading up to date studies, papers etc.
I was delighted - the more I hear this sort of thing the better I feel about the whole "movement"!!-

Gay revolution in Federal Way | Guest column
What happens when you send an e-mail to seven Federal Way City Council members? Well, if you’re starting a group for local gays and lesbians, you only get two replies. Maybe I’m being cynical. It’s possible that Linda Kochmar and Jack Dovey were the only council members to reply because they actually do their jobs. Whatever the case might be, my goal to create a gay group in Federal Way had begun.
We’re now holding our first social meet-up at 6 p.m. July 25 at the Federal Way Regional Library,34200 1st Way S. Next month should be exciting too, since we have a celebrity appearance from openly gay actor/model Daniel Skelton.
But first, our journey, it started out simply. Start a free Facebook group (Gay in Federal Way). Create a free website (gayinfederalway.blogspot.com). All very simple. But it isn’t simple to change Federal Way. You don’t see gay people here. There is no gay culture. Even though gay people make up roughly 5 percent of the population, zero tax dollars that they pay go into diversity funding and community building to help gays. That money goes instead to diversity funding and community building for racial, gender, youth and senior folks..
Gay people need this group for both political and social reasons.
Politically because the city council needs to be reminded that gay people live here too. They pay taxes, they have been since the city was founded 20 years ago, and some of those taxes go to diversity funding and community building that excludes gay people. Twenty years of paying taxes and twenty years of being ignored isn’t right.
Socially, we need this because without a group it is very difficult to tell who else is gay, so connecting with similar individuals is difficult. Most gays here can count on one hand how many gay people they know living in Federal Way. A handful of people is not a large enough dating pool to find an ideal match. The easiest way to tell you’re gay in Federal Way? You have to take an hour drive to Seattle to go on dates.
Remember, we’re holding out first social meet-up at 6 p.m. July 25 at the Federal Way Regional Library. We’ll be in Meeting Room One. It’s time for the gay revolution in Federal Way to begin.
Daniel Skelton
We’ll give you updates including when we’ll have the intelligent and breathtakingly beautiful actor/model Daniel Skelton as a celebrity guest in August. Just be sure to add us on Facebook (Gay in Federal Way) and check out our website (gayinfederalway.blogspot.com) for updates.
Be sure to check out him in the movie “Eating Out 3: All You Can Eat” before his August appearance. He’ll be visiting the Seattle area, a place he once lived and now misses. Daniel recently said about his old city: “I loved walking around by myself on a nice summer night getting coffee and stopping in my favorite book store.” Hopefully some coffee from the vending machine and a tour of the library should suffice.

Year after year, Chuck McBreen successfully recruits near his roots.
McBreen, who's from North Bergen, gains a steady pipeline of Hudson County prep talent to join his Ramapo College men's basketball team.
Currently four former Hudson players are competing for the Roadrunners: Elgin Brown, a 6-4 forward from Dickinson High; Jairo Cruz, a 6-2 guard from Emerson High in Union City; Demetrius Boards, a 6-4 forward from Marist High; and Travis Conyers, a 6-0 guard from St. Anthony.
Ramapo, which is No. 23 in the NCAA Division III rankings, carries a 16-4 season record into a Saturday night home showdown against Montclair State (also 16-4). The two teams will duel for first place in the New Jersey Athletic Conference standings.
During his 13 years in Mahwah, McBreen estimated he's recruited 65 players from Hudson County.
"Every year, I usually have four or five,'' said McBreen, who was a head coach at Union Hill High in the 1990s. "One year, when we went to the Final Eight (of the NCAA Tournament in 2003), nine of the 18 on the roster were from Hudson County."
McBreen said Hudson County players share a common toughness.
"The Hudson County kids -- is in my opinion and I am from there -- they are not only great athletes, but very, very tough," said McBreen, a 1982 North Bergen graduate.
"I believe they are physically and mentally strong. Most are raised by a single parent. They have to learn at an early age to be accountable and responsible. I come from the same place. I can identify. . .. I am a very intense type of coach and they are used to that."
Brown joined Ramapo after scoring more than 1,000 career points and becoming a junior college All-American for Bergen Community College. In his first season starting for the Roadrunners, he is averaging 12.3 points and a team-high 8.4 rebounds a game.
"I play physical all the time and I can score from different places on the floor," said Brown. "I think the coach recruits Hudson County guys because he likes our toughness."
Conyers, Cruz and Boards are all reserves for the highest-ranked Division III team in the state, which has won seven of its last eight games, and is atop the 10-team NJAC standings with a 7-1 league record.
"I am the sixth man, the backup point guard," said Conyers, who is averaging 8.6 points along with 61 assists. "I come off the bench to provide energy."
Conyers likes Mahwah, about 35 miles north of his Jersey City home.
"It is a place to get away and be safe," he said. "You can go outside and be safe and not worry about anything."
Conyers started for St. Anthony, and, as a junior, he helped the Friars go undefeated and win the state championship.
"Coach Hurley prepared me a lot," he said. "Coach Hurley is so demanding."
Cruz was a three-year starter for the Emerson Bulldogs and scored 1,300 career points.
"The Hudson County guys bring toughness," he said. "I take charges."
Boards is the newest addition to the Ramapo roster. After scoring more than 1,000 career points for the Marist Knights, he started at Felician College, then attended Sussex Community College before joining the Roadrunners.
"I am an energy guy; to provide a spark, play defense and keep the tempo up," he said. Last summer, Boards said he played in the Audubon Park Men's League.
The four Hudson County players will have a homecoming on Feb. 12. Ramapo plays a 6 p.m. game at New Jersey City University.Two US drone strikes have killed at least five suspected al-Qaeda.Saturday, 11 January, 10:15–11:30 a.m., Mississippi, Sheraton Chicago

We celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary by visiting Key West last week. It was the first time for both of us, and we were amazed at so many people down there. We plan to go back next year and take our bicycles.
We enjoyed the Truman Little White House tour a lot and just walking around town seeing the sites. It looked to us like the economy is doing very well in Key West.
Until next time, look on the bright side.Words formed from any letters in cutch, plus optional blank

Today, being Monday, is going to be a very lazy day for me all day long in comfies, computer not that far away from me, drinking my allotted fluids and Gatorade a day, read more Harry Potter and watch TV recorded programs. Today is my shower day. YAY! More later…

My Last Entry of the Day
It is close to bed time. I am tired — getting there anyway — but watching movies and reading the 5th installment of Harry Potter. So I will be retiring to bed shortly when CKR leaves after visiting for a while. I have been reading Harry Potter and watching recorded TV programs ALL day long. I am going to say good night and God bless now and come back sometime tomorrow.
Good night and God bless! I will be back tomorrow.
Aunt & Uncle
I did get to see my Aunt and Uncle this afternoon. YAY!
A Chilly Day!
Brrr! It is still winter out there here in Wisconsin. More snow, rain, and icy patches out there once again … and I am still hoping to see my Aunt and Uncle from Omro, Wisconsin but if the weather is yucky, they may bypass Janesville and come back another day when the weather is warmer and Spring again. I did get a call from my Aunt and she told me that they were going to make every effort on coming despite the weather as they were leaving the Rockford area as the roads were not so bad. My world feels a little topsy turvy right now because I doing my best at not getting my hopes up too high in case they have to head straight home from where they were calling from. The waiting game is one of the hardest things for me…
Good Night & God bless!
I am getting tired and feeling like dozing off AGAIN. I am heading to bed shortly. So I am going to say good night and God bless now before I ramble on and on all over again. It was a good day all day and tomorrow is going to be another wonderful day once my Aunt and Uncle get here and take me out to eat.
A Lazy Day!
Today was a very day for me all day long. Having been up since 6 am, I ended up taking a little cat nap in my recliner after 2 pm because I had gotten tired and my eyes were … focusing in and out by then for some reason. I was watching a couple of recorded programs on my DVR system at that time, called dad and found out that my Aunt and Uncle from Omro, Wisconsin were visiting – hearing their voices in the background — the familiar laugh my Aunt has is so distinguishable and easy to … find her in a large family crowd in seconds. I will be seeing my Aunt and Uncle tomorrow for a lunch in the afternoon sometime. I am looking forward to seeing them tomorrow. Yay!
6 AM
I had awakened a couple of times during the night and one of the times I had awakened was at 4 a.m.. I was seriously thinking of getting up at at the hour but decided not to and go back to sleep for awhile … waking up at 6 am and finally getting up for the day and begin my day early. I am getting my sleep time back and … getting up early. Yay!
No Plans This Weekend
I have no major plans this weekend … except to visit the community room to see if there is a card game going on … maybe. Otherwise I am going to stay close to home and work on my journals and get caught up again … like I did here this week. With it being Saturday now, I have been watching a program on Nick called House of Anubis. It is an awesome show and I am catching up on the shows I missed last week due to sleeping a lot and recovering from my illness I had the weekend of the 11th – 14th. When I was not feeling very well I did not do a lot of anything such as Facebook stuff, texting friends and family, and watching recorded TV shows, or any reading. I had finally finished reading the 4th installment of Harry Potter and began reading the 5th installment of Harry Potter yesterday afternoon when J left after grocery shopping and meal preparation for the week. Now I have the weekend. CKR will be here around 5 pm to visit for awhile, though. No major plans this weekend, though. More later….
Good Night & God bless!
I am heading to bed now as it is 1030 pm. CKR left a few moments ago and I have run to the bathroom and now heading to bed for the night. I watched Oprah tonight and saw Diana Ross on the show tonight and enjoyed listening to her talk, and see Billy Dee Williams after 30 years – a surprise that happened tonight for Diana. Loved the show and glad to have seen Diana on TV tonight. Loved her when she was Diana Ross and the Supremes. I was reminded of the Pips, another group of girls I like a lot. GOod night and God bless. I will be back sometime tomorrow. I am tired.
My Evening!!
I have had the late afternoon and early evening to myself until CKR, soon to be Caroline Spafford, got here a while ago to visit and borrow the phone to make an important phone call. She will be back shortly because she has to go home again and take some medication and let her kitty know that she is going to be gone for a while tonight. I will write more later.
The Weekend Has Arrived!!
I am so glad the weekend has FINALLY arrived! It was a long week since I have been back from the hospital from the 14th of February to the mid of the week. I am so happy that the weekend has arrived so I can go grocery shopping, have food preparation meals made for the week, and have the weekend to myself. I am feeling secure again FINALLY!! Yay! I have had my friend CKR, aka CS in the future because she is changing her name legally, over ever since I have been back from the hospital everyday as long as she has not been busy and able to help me out because of my back having a pulled muscle and … loneliness has hit the maximum levels due to high anxiety levels until recently. She was over last night for a while and left while I dozed off on the couch and was gone when I had awakened finding the TV tray table put away and the chair she was sitting in was empty of a human body and Bing was not that far away.
KH came by by 10 am and got me in my shower right away and dressed for the day. Today is my food preparation day and grocery shopping morning with J. Today is going to be fairly busy for me.Graduation Preparation
Apply for a degree/certificate
If you are nearing graduation you need to submit an application for degree to the Admissions and Records Office. This starts the process of evaluating your transcript for degree completion. You’ll need to submit a separate application for each certificate or degree you plan to earn.
Ideally, you should complete this application two quarters before you plan to graduate. It must be submitted no later than the start of your final quarter.
Applications for a degree and certificates are available online at under "Advising Documents and Forms" or in paper form at the Admissions and Records Office in the HUB.
Prepare to take part in the graduation ceremony

The film, titled The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America’s First Superhero (for now), is based on the 2007 biography of the same name, which was written by William Kalush and Larry Sloman.
The book tells the tale of Houdini’s life, from his 1874 birth in Hungary to his death on Halloween 1926. In addition to his magical exploits, the biography delves into Houdini’s alleged life as a spy for Scotland Yard and his run-ins with a spiritualist cult. The movie will likely have more of an action/adventure slant than the book, especially with Dean Parisot (Red 2) signed on as the director.

Four East County high school students earned first place honors at a recent skills competition organized by SkillsUSA in Clackamas County.
Nearly 500 students from throughout Oregon competed against each other, showing off diverse skills from early childhood teaching to cake decorating to welding.
Reynolds High School student Nkaouara Thao earned first place in cake decorating.
Kevin Vang from Centennial High School earned a first-place award for his skills in early childhood teaching. His classmate Emma Chinchen took third place.
Centennials Antonio Martinez earned first place for his job interview skills. Reynolds High student Tori Sweetland, got third for job interview skills and also earned a second place award in the prepared speech category.
Reynolds High School student Diyora Saadat got first place in the job skills demonstration category. Cathy Behm, Reynolds SkillsUSA adviser and early childhood education teacher, noted the Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps member demonstrated medical skills currently used in the military.
The competitions are a great opportunity for the students, Behm said, noting they gain self-esteem and experience through being assessed. The competitors engage in team building and exercises on how to follow guidelines and directions.
They have to be dressed in a professional way, use proper etiquette, Behm said. It is amazing preparation for real life. Every student has to do a job interview. When real life comes along, it is not their first experience.
SkillsUSA, formerly Vocational Industrial Clubs of America, helps students gain career-related skills. The SkillsUSA Oregon state leadership and skills conference was held on April 17 and 18 at Camp Withycombe on Southeast Minuteman Way in Clackamas County.
The state contest winners are eligible to compete against the 6,000 participants in the national SkillsUSA Championship held June 22-26 in Louisville, Ky.JW_DISQUS_ADD_A_COMMENTHuntsville Teen Arrested for Breaking into School

He’s charged with criminal trespassing. Police say nothing was stolen or damaged.
According to police, the teen told officers he just wanted to see what was in the school.Search engine marketing strategy
Why does your business need a marketing strategy? If you want your prospective customers to find you online, you need to make sure that you show up in the search results. That’s the only way to promote your products and services on the web. The higher your position on the search results page, the more likely it is that your potential customer will buy an item from your website.
More often than not, being on the second page is already disastrous. Very few people actually click through to the second page, therefore it’s crucial to optimize the site for the search engines and make sure it holds the leading positions. The success of search engine optimization depends on the chosen keywords.
If you’d like to rank well on the first search results page for the chosen keywords, you need to get an idea how search engines work at a whole. It’s not about “fooling” search engines. You need to know what factors search engines use in determining rankings.
In this article I’d like to give you a 3-step plan that will help you to create the quality website content. Remember, content is a very important part of the website and the success of the site directly depends on its relevancy to the subjects of the business and the choice of targeted keywords.
Step One: You need to dominate in your industry niche. To do so, you need to identify your targeted audiences. Clarify your online marketing goals on the basis of the overall business goals, think of the elements that motivate your website visitors to take an action. But what’s even more important is to analyze the market of your competitors and think of the most effective strategies to beat your competitors!
Step Two: Get your rankings as high as it’s only possible. Make sure that your website is search engine friendly. Determine the set of keywords that your potential customers type in when they’re searching for your product or service. Be creative about off-site activities that could help you to promote your website and move it higher in the search results.
Step Three: track and monitor your keyword rankings. Conduct a proper analyze of your website conversion rates. Always make monthly reports with all the details regarding website performance.
If you don’t have time to learn about the techniques that could get you good results, it’s better to rely on the experts. There is a great variety of seo companies out there in the industry that can provide their clients with high quality services.- Eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping.

My poem “Cyprus Delight”, which was highly commended in last year’s New Writer competition, is in the very latest edition of the magazine, on page 49. It’s always nice to see something in print, especially a poem.
The other good thing that’s happened in the last few days is that my workshop at the Get Writing 2012 conference has sold out. I’m really pleased about this because last time I did one, back in 2008, I had an audience of two plus some chums from the Verulam Writers’ Circle who took pity on me. Suppose I’d better get going on preparing my workshop then. But first I have a talk to Harrow Writers to do this Thursday – if you’re in the area, do drop in.

More InfoThe final search engine numbers for 2011 leave us right back where the year started.
ComScore reports that Google continues to hold two-thirds of U.S. search market, as it did throughout 2011. Microsoft and Yahoo, bonded together by a search agreement that has Yahoo slapping the user interface on top of Microsoft's Bing results, rate a combined total of about 30 percent, which is exactly where they started last January.
The only big difference between now and then? Microsoft lost a whole lotta money in the process of going nowhere.
In the course of 2011, Microsoft lost more than $2 billion on its search efforts. Although we won't know fourth-quarter numbers until next week, during the first nine months of 2011 Microsoft lost $1.95 billion on its Online Services Division.
The biggest loser is Yahoo, which now keeps 88 percent of the revenue generated by searches made on its site while the other 12 percent goes to Microsoft. Back in July 2009, when Yahoo and Microsoft signed their agreement, Yahoo had 19.3 percent of the U.S. search market and Microsoft/Bing had 8.9 percent -- a total of 28.2 percent, which isn't much different than their combined total now. Only the pecking order has changed. In December 2011, for the first time Microsoft ran out ahead of Yahoo, with Bing at 15.1 percent and Yahoo at 14.5.
Yahoo's 88 percent share of the spoils is worth much less now than it was in July 2009. Microsoft made out like a bandit -- yet it's still losing enormous amounts of money on search.
For years, shareholders and analysts have been calling on Microsoft management to jettison Bing -- or at least stem the red ink. It's possible that process is under way. In the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2011, Microsoft lost $494 million on the Online Services Division, compared to $558 million in the same period a year earlier. That's an 11 percent improvement. Perhaps the final quarter of 2011 will show similar, uh, restraint.

Now, the Liverpool boys swim team he coached to unprecedented heights in parts of three decades gets to join him in that pantheon.
The Warriors' teams from 1966 to 1983 were named as the Team of Honor for the 2014 class and will be feted on Oct. 20 as part of the 28th annual Hall of Fame dinner at Drumlins Country Club.
Both Funicello and several of his swimmers on those teams were on hand Tuesday at Tully's in North Syracuse for the announcement. Funicello said that the reason his teams did so well was that he emphasized a close atmosphere within the program, with several different sets of siblings finding success.
"Liverpool had a wonderful group of families," said Funicello.
And what they produced in those 17 years was extraordinary. Liverpool competed in 220 meets and won 215 of them, tasting defeat just five times and, at one point, winning 113 consecutive meets and 15 straight Section III championships.
Not once in Funicello's long tenure did Liverpool lose a meet at home. What's more, a remarkable 21 of his swimmers would earn All-American honors by the time they graduated.
Going beyond the local level, Liverpool also won the 1979 Eastern Interscholastic Swimmming Championships in Lawrenceville, N.J., beating more than 100 teams from across the entire eastern United States.
Paul Edwards, who graduated in 1976 and went to St. Lawrence University, said that Funicello was an innovative coach, bringing in aspects like weight training that weren't common in swimming programs at the time he competed.
"Our success was a byproduct of the preparation we put in," said Edwards. "Winning just seemed to happen."
Mark Edwards, Paul's younger brother (he graduated from LHS in 1981), said that work started in the program at a young age, with kids working alongside the older swimmers and picking up all of their good habits that carried over into later years.

URL to article:Jennifer has been visiting this week…as usual, we had a lot of fun, but not as much as the kiddos!!!! Despite some illnesses, they pretty much didn’t miss a beat, and enjoyed each other’s company immensely…oh yeah, except for that one bite mark on Norah’s arm…I’m not mentioning any names!!!:)
Whether Jennifer’s here, or it’s just a normal week when I’m at home with my own 2, I live in the mundane. According to dictionary.com, “mundane” means “common or ordinary” (by the way, you can bet, that if I ever use a “smart” word, I visited dictionary.com before I posted it…I visit there almost as much as google!:) My life is about as common and ordinary as it gets. I wake up every morning and pretty much begin the same routine I completed the day before, and will start over again the next day. We’re common folk around here. I’m a wife and a mom…I change normal diapers, I read ordinary books, I cook VERY common meals, I do ordinary laundry…Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, etc., etc. For this reason, this quote makes MAJOR sense to me…
“And if God doesn’t rule your mundane, HE DOESN’T RULE YOU, because that’s where you live.” -Paul David Tripp
You see, if you’re waiting on the next big thing, or Sunday morning, or 11th grade, or when you eventually get on the mission field, or your next career, or when you’re called into the ministry, etc., etc…if you’re waiting on these things to let the King of Kings rule in your life, then he doesn’t rule you at all. He rules in our everyday, He reigns in our ordinary, He is glorified in the common tasks of changing diapers and wiping bottoms!! What a great God we serve, especially in the midst of our ordinary service!!!
YAY for these! I guess you need to add them to the pics I need. How about make a folder called “Jennifer” and add these to it, along with November, Christmas and wasn’t there another one? Maybe not. But anyway, I expect all of these to be finished by the time I come for the newest cousin! So get on it!
Love you!
these are cute! and that is one of my FAVORITE quotes… you know how i love to love the mundane!
beautiful, just beautiful. thank you for loving Christ above all. thank you for sharing your love of life. you are such an encouragement.
Yes! The mundane can be fun too! Thanks for sharing…great reminder Erin!
I just remembered that I did not get these or the other pics from you! Can you seriously make a folder on your computer that says “Jennifer” so I can remember to get these and any others that would have J&E in them…looks like I was asking for Christmas, November and I guess Macey Jane pics…even though they weren’t there, I was. Ok. So please do that and I will get them from you next time I see you…which will hopefully be SOON! The van needs to go on a ROAD TRIP…and it called and told me that it wants to come to FLORENCE first!

Especially in terms of thinking of the city over long time frames. And that is important. Not knowing how long you've lived in the city... even in 2003, which is not that long ago, the kinds of things happening on H Street today were unimaginable, and had been for 35 years.
The crappy corner building on the southwest corner of H Street (constructed in 2002-3) was the pinnacle of what the H Street CDC believed was the value of the H St. neighborhood, and their website the year before still suggested that part of the Atlas theater complex could be torn down for parking.
Four traditional rowhouse commercial buildings, one building arguably the oldest on the corridor, were torn down by the H Street Community Development Corporation, in favor of this one story building--the second story is fake--funded in large part by Federal Community Development Block Grant monies and a loan from SunTrust Bank. Residents argued for a better building, and a multi-story mixed use building, but the CDC refused to consider such ideas.
I have never seen an adequate "tax yield per acre" chart of different types of land use in the city, and DC is different from most cities where typically residential property runs at a tax loss--more services are provided per dollar of tax revenue generated by residential property--because the city keeps 100% of its income tax revenue. These two images from the Planetizen article, The Smart Math of Mixed-Use Development" cover the issue of tax yield. DC's planning office should be required to construct a similar tax yield analysis for property in DC.
Tax yield study, big box sprawl vs. intense downtown development, Asheville, NC.
Typical tax yield per acre, multi-county study.
For example, all the people clamoring to attract families with multiple children ought to remember that it costs about $17,000/year to educate a child in the public schools, and typically this figure is double the typical tax yield of a house in an rowhouse neighborhood.
The economic impact of a practice facility would almost be like having undeveloped land. Plus, from the standpoint of land use logic (New Urbanists call it "the transect") land in developed areas with access to high quality transportation (the subway) is where you want to put higher intensity uses and leverage the investment (billions) in the transit system.
If you really want a practice facility (I don't, but then, I don't care about professional sports, and as importantly, I really don't like subsidizing professional sports either with money or land), put it in a place like the Armed Forces Retirement Home where you don't have transit and a lot of underused land. (Although I think that land can be better used than that even there, especially with the addition of streetcar service.)
From the standpoint of land use logic, a large campus type practice facility for a low intensity use like a sports team doesn't make sense as a development priority for a center city, let alone the "world class city" that DC all too often claims it is.

But I needed a face to be made over, so I recruited my colleague Kyle Harrington, who works in The News-Gazette's Electronic Publishing department.
Emily Massa, a member of Sephora's Pro Beauty Team, did Kyle's makeup while carefully explaining what she was doing and suggesting alternatives our readers might use.
My story will run a week from Sunday, but I asked Kyle to write a blog entry to tell us about her experience. The photo below is of Kyle, with her makeup done, taken by News-Gazette Photo Editor Darrell Hoemann.
---. But, it wasn't the afterlife I was entering, it was Marketplace Mall's brand-spanking-new Sephora.
OK, that may be a slight exaggeration, but for a makeup guru like myself, Sephora is the Mecca of makeup. The clean, white walls are lined with mascaras, eyeshadows, blushes. The shelves filled with the likes of Dior, Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent. Every imaginable color. Every imaginable shade. A veritable palette of possibility.
My friend and colleague Meg, knowing my love for all things makeup, asked me if I was interested in being the “before and after girl” for a feature she was writing. I've been dreaming about it since.
Sephora Pro Beauty Team member, Emily (or St. Peter, as I think of her) was an absolute makeup genius. Hilariously funny, Emily is a true artist. Working with the makeup brushes with the precision of Michelangelo, playing with color with the bravery of Picasso. Sharing a wealth of makeup knowledge, tips and tricks to help any of us to look our absolute best, all while highlighting our natural beauty, with only a little effort. Encouraging make up users not to get stuck in a rut, but experiment - have fun.
Emily will be here through Friday. Stop by. Visit her. Play. Learn. Discover your inner artist. But most of all, have fun. In the word's of American artist, Bob Ross: “Happy painting.”
And be sure to check out next Sunday's News-Gazette and read Meg's feature to learn all the tricks for a perfect, fresh, summer.The Salon du Végétal at the Parc des Expositions in Angers is a professional show in France geared towards the horticultural supply chain.

Products arrived very quickly. Very efficient service!
I have a very sensitive scalp and am always itchy with other shampoos. Love this product.
excellent product
Really good shampoo, hair feels lovely and very calming on the scalp.
Great
I have suffered with scalp dermatitis throughout my 20's. Some times of the year it is more severe to the point of going to the doctor's to get prescription medication. Since purchasing this shampoo not only has it settled my scalp (whilst using my prescription once a week) but my hair feels fantastic and it is the best shampoo EVER I have used. It is magic in a bottle and I will definitely buy more from this range.
Excellent service, as always! Recommended!
Got this for my daughter who has an irritated scalp...quite drying but nice enough.
très bon service, bonne communication
Great oroduct
Excellent service
Very rapid response for an issue with a voucher
Pleased with the service and will use again.
Évaluation du service : Délai de livraison un peu long (1 semaine) mais ça va si on anticipe ses besoins ou si on prévoit un produit d'avance. Pour moi ce n'est pas un point négatif.Le niveau de prix compense cet inconvénient.
Produit : Le seul shampoing à ma connaissance pour l'instant qui permet d'apaiser le cuir chevelu efficacement et d'empêcher les pellicules. Ce n'est pas un traitement anti pelliculaire mais son action calmante permet de ne plus en avoir. A tester.
I have struggled with dry scalp since moving to the UK and this has really helped. It makes my hair shiny and manageable as well.
An excellent shampoo as ever which is what I have come to expect with their hair products.
Very soothing on my sensitive scalp.
Have had a problem with scalp for sometime and this product has been excellent
Product arrived in a beautifully packaged box.
Lovely. Very pleased with it

I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving. I love it when family gets together don't you? I am glad we don't wait until a holiday to do it. But holidays always make it that much more special.
I found this little park bench on Sunday. It is so sweet that someone loved it enough to replace the second runner with a wavy one. It has just the right amount of chippiness and rust and its size is just perfect.
This is the type of pillows we should have in by the weekend. They will be in this color coffee, drk chocolate and vanilla. They will all be a little bit different and will be on sale for $28.00. If you are interested, just drop me a note so I will have enough for everyone. And just reminder that everything is on sale at Maisonstgermain.com.
These are three of my favorite suitcases. Just the perfect spot for a little white tree decorated in gold. I have been Christmas decorating and will be posting more pictures soon. Nicole's tree is absolutely gorgeous this year. I will post that for sure.
Hope you enjoyed my White Wednesday and don't forget to check out Kathleen at Faded Charm for more white loveliness.

Traynor,LisaNext year’s budget already has a $38 million shortfall
Pettitt
Less money from the state, lower real estate taxes because of declining property values and reduced sales tax revenue is causing Chesterfield County to project $20 million less in revenue for FY11 (the year starting July 1, 2010). The county also anticipates $18 million in new expenditures.
The lower revenue projection is likely to hit county schools the most. The school system’s budget is expected to decline $5 million in FY11, down from $623 million this year and $638 million the previous year. But in FY12 (starting July 1, 2011), there’s yet another projected dip to $598 million.
While there are some positive economic signs at the local, state and national levels, county leaders think it will be 5-10 years before the local economy returns to the prerecession level, and maybe later. Much of the current favorable activity, they believe, is artificially caused by federal stimulus monies, which end next year.
Gecker
While the school system’s budget continues to decline, it’s still experiencing gradual increases in student enrollment. Student achievement standards are also getting tougher. Clover Hill School Board member Dianne Pettitt pointed out that achievement standards for all of Virginia’s public schools are becoming more demanding “just to be accredited.” Pettitt, other school board members, the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors and other county leaders met last week for another joint meeting of the boards to mostly discuss revenue projections.
Matoaca School Board member Omar Rajah pledged not to support any future budget cuts that might lead to teachers losing their jobs, but School Board Chairman Marshall Trammell said it is too early to determine where cuts might be necessary in the next budget cycle. About 64 percent of Chesterfield County Public Schools’ (CCPS) operational budget is for instructional staff and their benefits.
“Home prices have yet to find the bottom,” Budget and Management Director Allan Carmody told the boards. Vacancy rates for Chesterfield’s offices, retail and industrial space are also up.
“When we met with local retailers, they said flat [sales] is the new up,” commented County Administrator Jay Stegmaier. Over the past 90 days, retail sales in Chesterfield are off 7.8 percent over the corresponding period last year.
Carmody said $3.8 million is expected to be cut from state funding, including $2.1 million less from sales tax revenue that goes to CCPS; $784,000 in funds for constitutional offices; and $591,000 for monies earmarked for the Chesterfield Police Department.
Among local governments, Chesterfield is the first to report a shortfall for next year – primarily because its Budget & Audit Committee wants to educate citizens on the tough decisions for FY11. Midlothian Supervisor Dan Gecker and Dale Supervisor Jim Holland, who serve on the committee, are seeking input from citizens before the budget is approved in April next year.
Gecker in particular is pushing the county government and CCPS to give citizens more information earlier so they can be part of the dialogue. He believes the county and school system have not shared enough budget information in the past, and that is a mistake.
Last February, Gecker was the lone board vote against advertising the property tax rate at 95 cents per $100 of assessed value, saying a 97-cent rate would allow the board more flexibility to deal with state budget cuts. County officials can’t increase the tax rate after it runs in a legal notice, but they can lower it. About half of this year’s general fund of $715 million – how the county pays for services – comes from property taxes.
Gecker is now advocating for a 1 percent decline in property tax revenue for next year’s budget. Because property values are expected to be 5 percent lower, after factoring in new development, that would likely mean an increase in the tax rate. Previously, he asked the school board to consider endorsing a rate increase if it encounters budget problems. About half of county revenue goes to CCPS.
Last spring, when the budget was being decided, Gecker said about 90 percent of his e-mails favored no increase in the property tax rate. He acknowledged that hiking the rate 18 months before supervisor and school board elections in 2011 could be risky politically.From Dolly to dinner: your right to know

3.German giants join GM food fight in California
Deutsche Welle, 16 October.
Failed attempts
In the US there have been many failed attempts to require labels for GM foods in various states. But what makes Proposition 37 so significant is not just that California would be the first state to institute GM labels, its California's unique position and history among US states.
With its 37 million residents California is not just the most populous state in the union, but as a stand-alone economy it would be the ninth-biggest country in the world by gross domestic product.
Combine that with California's record as a national and international trendsetter on health and environmental regulation - for example as the first state to ban lead from gasoline, pass anti-smoking legislation, cap green houses gas emissions from businesses - and you can imagine why the food and agribusiness community is worried.
So it's no surprise then that the industry is pulling out all the stops to prevent Proposition 37 from becoming law in California.
Monsanto is biggest donor
Under the leadership of Monsanto, the world's biggest seed producer, the campaign against GM labels has so far raised $35 million (27 million euros), according to public records.
With $7 million Monsanto alone has spent more than the supporters of Proposition 37 have raised collectively so far with $4 million.
While the anti-label donor list with households names like Pepsico, Coca Cola, Kellogg and Mars reads like the Who-is-Who of the American food industry, two German companies stand out and have spent more to defeat Proposition 37 than all of the companies mentioned above.
German firms oppose Proposition 37
BASF and Bayer have each invested $2 million so far in the campaign to block GM labels in California. Only Monsanto and Dupont, the US chemical firm, spent more.
BASF, the world's biggest chemical company, and Bayer, Germany's biggest pharmaceutical company, both have large business units focused on genetic engineering. BASF earlier this year even moved the headquarters of its GM business to the US citing a lack of support in Europe.
This explains why they our outspending most other American and international companies to stop labels for GM foods, says Michael Hansen, the senior scientist at Consumers Union, the independent consumers organization which publishes Consumer Reports magazine:
"These German firms are doing the genetic engineering. So it's their stake in the fight because it's their ultimate ingredient that would be labeled."
Fight against rules resembling EU law
What makes the behavior of BASF and Bayer especially intriguing is the fact that they are investing millions to oppose the very rules that have been in place in their home markets of Germany and Europe for years.
"It's outrageous that German companies are spending so much money to defeat our right to know in California," Stacy Malkin, spokeswoman for the California Right to Know 2012 ballot initiative, told DW per e-mail.
Hansen calls this behavior "situational ethics." He says the firms simply do whatever the laws of the country they do business in allow them to do.
"I think it is really a shame that Bayer and BASF finance a counter-campaign against labeling," notes Heike Moldenhauer, the GM expert at Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND) in Berlin. "Both wouldn't dare such propaganda here in Europe."
"I find it actually a little outrageous that particularly German companies meddle so massively in domestic US policy," says Martin Häusling, agricultural policy spokesman for the Greens in the European Parliament.
He adds that they certainly have the legal right to do so, but that the European and German public should know about their behavior. "I am not sure if this will help the public image of these companies."
Companies say Proposition 37 is misleading
In a statement to DW, Bayer CropScience, the company's GM unit, didn't address questions about its $2 million donation to the anti-Proposition 37 campaign and whether it plans to invest more money to defeat the initiative. The company also didn't respond to questions about whether it has a different perception of European vs. Californian consumers.
"Bayer CropScience principally supports that consumers should be comprehensively and transparently informed," spokesman Utz Klages said via e-mail. But California's Proposition 37 "doesn't create full transparency for consumers," he added. "Instead it creates uncertainty because it creates the wrong impression that there are differences in the safety and nutritional characteristics, when in fact none exist."
BASF also didn't address questions about its $2 million dollar to the anti-Proposition 37 campaign and whether it plans to invest more money to defeat the initiative.
"In order to provide higher transparency for customers and consumers, we welcome any sort of labeling as long as it is not misleading or discriminatory,” BASF spokeswoman Jennifer Moore-Braun told DW via e-mail. "However, we do not believe this is the case with Proposition 37," she added. BASF believes "the intention of the ballot initiative is not to inform consumers, but rather to discriminate against agricultural biotechnology."
Asked about differences between Europe and the US, Moore-Braun said, that "in Europe, we support the existing EU labeling thresholds in food and feed of 0.9 percent for all GM plants approved in the EU." But, she added, "the current legislation in Europe is misleading since there are for example too many exemptions from the labeling requirements."
In the US, said Moore-Braun, national policy doesn't requiring labelling of GM foods since it "would be misleading to consumers because it falsely implies that there are differences in safety and nutritional characteristics, when in fact none exist."
Transatlantic
Despite the fact that GM labels are required in the EU and not in the US, Europeans and Americans generally have similar views on the issue. When polled, both routinely state they want labels on genetically modified foods.
According to an ABC News survey from June, 93 percent of Americans said the government should mandate labels for GM foods. More than half of respondents stated they would be less likely to buy food bearing such a label.
Americans and Europeans are pretty much on the same page when it comes to GM foods, argues Häusling. "The more consumers know about genetic engineering the more likely is their resistance to buying such products, instead of the other way around."
The reason there are no GM-labeling laws in the US is therefore not because the American public trusts GM foods, but because corporations in the US have more influence and can spend large amounts of money to get the outcome they want, say the experts.
Support crumbles
Until recently, polls in California showed large majorities in favor of Proposition 37. But since the No-campaign has begun spending the millions it raised from industry to blanket California's airwaves with ads against GM labels, support for the measure is crumbling. After the beginning of the ad campaign the latest poll last week showed 48 percent in support of labels and 40 percent against it.
"This is a massive fight pitting the people against the corporations, and we are going to do everything we can to make sure the people win, but it is going to be a tough fight," says Malkin. "The pesticide and junk food companies are spending one million dollars a day to bombard California with deceptive ads designed to confuse people about a simple label."
With three weeks to go and millions of dollars to be spent by the No-campaign - practically uncontested by supporters of labels - Proposition 37 could end up like so many other attempts to introduce labels for genetically modified foods in the US: As a fight ultimately won by the deep pockets of Goliath.Submitted by henry robinson on

Why use drama / theatre texts in the language classroom?
Collie and Slater (1987) focused on the positive contributions language learning through literature could make in that literary texts constituted valuable authentic material as it exposes the learner to different registers, types of language use.
Writers such as Maley and Duff, (1978) and Wessels, (1987) have pointed to the values and uses of drama:
'Drama can help the teacher to achieve 'reality' in several ways. It can overcome the students' resistance to learning the new language:
- by making the learning of the new language an enjoyable experience
- by setting realistic targets for the students to aim for
- by creative 'slowing down' of real experience
- by linking the language-learning experience with the student's own experience of life
And drama can create in students a need to learn the language:
- by the use of 'creative tension' (situations requiring urgent solutions);
- by putting more responsibility on the learner, as opposed to the teacher.' (Wessel: 53-54)
Drama provides cultural and language enrichment by revealing insights into the target culture and presenting language contexts that make items memorable by placing them in a realistic social and physical context.
By allowing reading and the adding of some characterisation to a drama / theatre text, learners became personally and fully involved in the learning process, in a context in which it is possible for learners to feel less self-conscious and more empowered to express themselves through the multiple voices (Vygotsky, 1987; Bakhtin, 1981, 1986) of the differing characters. pale imitations of the original writing. The lack of suitable texts in the traditional body of literature, in my view opens the door for the inclusion of drama in language learning curricula as it tends to use much more naturalistic language than in poems and novels. Drama texts help to address the need for sufficient texts for worthwhile reading in which suitable materials can be accessed.
The "a" type analytical approach to drama / theatre texts
As I have suggested, the analysis of language in a text is just one aspect of its use. In the type "a" approach, language is separated into its phonological, lexical components etc and disseminating strategies then adopted. Using this analytical approach, a teacher or course designer would think of a series of structures, language items that were to be 'taught'. A literary text exemplifying these structures was then selected and used in order to practise or raise the learner's consciousness of it.
The "b" type experiential approach to drama / theatre texts
White (1988) identified a second (the type "b") approach. Here, language was not seen as object but as a tool. Much more emphasis was placed upon, for example, the inductive method of learning through 'experiencing' and applying the learner's experience to the text through encouraging comment, responses and expression based on the text or its theme/topic. The theme/topic-based syllabus is often seen as more relevant to language learning. Gower (1996) commented how he felt more focus on form meant students understood less of what was going on.
Learning activities using drama / theatre texts
From a task point of view the learner is faced with several levels of achievement / ability that the teacher can use as a basis for designing multi-level activities for students:
- Identifying the story, characters, plot (achievable at beginner level)
- Identifying the author's / characters' viewpoint, attitude or opinion
- Understanding the work in relation to its socio-cultural and historical-political context
- Giving a personal / creative response (e.g. enacting the text)
- Answering the question: "does it work as literature?" (Extended critical analysis of text)
Classroom method
Below, I outline the stages of a type "b" approach to introducing a drama/theatre text to a class of EFL learners. The process involves linking standard approaches in drama/theatre to approaches suitable for the classroom.
Classroom practice, then, may follow a (1) (physical) warm up - (2) text reading/listening - (3) extension activities format.
Stage 1
Standard methods in the type "b" approach involve warmer activities to get the learner to anticipate what they're going to meet in the language in the text using guessing, pre-discussion, pictures.
It involves little or no stylistic analysis.
Its aims are to stimulate oral communication, reading for pleasure and to enrich thinking and expression for this reason, drama techniques focussing on waking the imagination, and the body including the vocal chords in preparation for reading or even enacting the text could easily precede this stage.
Use of text can be one of the more in-depth and sophisticated drama activities.
Warmers, drama games, role-plays, individual and group improvisation can all be used to support higher-level drama activities such as performing the text in the classroom.
The idea is that the pre-reading/listening stage will sensitise the learner to the language and concepts to be encountered and engage prior knowledge and experience. Pictures, the book cover, prompt questions, learners' own memorabilia etc are used.
Stage 2
The second stage may involve two task types:
1. The while listening/reading task involves the learner having a task to fulfil based on his/her reading, such as finding out a piece of information from the text.
2. Tasks inserted into the text such as one where learners complete the task using their own ideas.
Stage 3
The third stage could incorporate...
1. Comprehension questions such as: Who? When? What? Etc.
2. Multiple-choice questions are useful for evoking possible alternative answers.
3. Text attack questions require the learner to realise certain meanings in the text and the way they are achieved in the language use.
4. Interpretation and response tasks /questions: What's the message from the author? What general meanings can we infer from the antagonists' statements / actions? What conclusions can we draw about the character and motivations of the antagonists? How is that expressed through the language? How do you feel about the character? How did you feel as the character? Response calls for the learner to express an opinion or feeling and to often say why they feel this or have this opinion.
Conclusion
Of the main approaches I have outlined a) Developing literary competence to understand and appreciate and b) experiencing literature, I, like Rod Ellis (2000), believe there is no absolute dichotomy between them. Differing approaches need to be incorporated in language teaching/learning for their relative merits.

DC Comics Co-Pubs DiDio and Lee Talk Company's Move West (Video)
The move for DC Comics from its longtime home in New York to Burbank is still more than a year away, but in the latest edition of DC's All Access video series, DC Comics co-publishers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee discuss what the move means for the publishing division and DC Entertainment as a whole.
"I see the energy and the excitement and the growth that's coming out of the West Coast offices," DiDio explained during the segment featuring the two publishers. "When you're over there, you hear about what's going on on the TV and film side, and I have to admit, you hear about the video games and all the other things that are taking aspects of the stories they're working on [in the publishing division] and putting them out there. And I have to admit, I look at what's going on in the digital, and I get a little jealous."
STORY: DC Entertainment Prez Talks DC Comics Move to California
Lee, for his part, said that despite the move being a "heavy decision," he was "thrilled by the notion to finally be able to work with [DiDio] in one location," adding that there was a "tremendous amount of resources and support on the West Coast," and that "having a united DC will mean some amazing, amazing things for the company."
"In a world where the magazine business, or the newsstand business, is collapsing or books are shifting to digital, we're showing growth in both print and digital. Our stuff is getting bigger," DiDio said. "So from my standpoint, it's a great time to be at DC, to be reading DC, but more importantly, none of that is going to change by making a switch like that. I think that's the key message that we get out of all this. It's the fact that we're gonna be bigger, better and stronger as we see the months, and the years, turning."

In the January issue of Health Affairs, two RAND analysts updated a 2005 study that held out hope for saving $81 billion a year through electronic health record and information technology efficiencies.
“Despite wide investments nationally in electronic medical records and related tools, the cost-saving promise of health information technology has not been reached because the systems deployed are neither interconnected nor easy to use,” the authors concluded in a paper titled, “What It Will Take to Achieve the As-Yet-Unfulfilled Promises of Health Information Technology.”
Arthur Kellermann, a RAND policy analyst, and Spencer S. Jones, a RAND information scientist, said digitization of patient medical and billing records has produced “mixed results” while annual health care expenditures have risen by $800 billion.
“The disappointing performance of health IT to date,” they wrote,  original promise of health IT “can be met if the systems are redesigned to address these flaws by creating more-standardized systems that are easier to use, are truly interoperable, and afford patients more access to and control over their health data,” Kellermann and Jones said. “Providers must do their part by reengineering care processes to take full advantage of efficiencies offered by health IT, in the context of redesigned payment models that favor value over volume.”
The analysts stressed that health information must be retrievable by others, including health professionals from separate health care systems, that patients much have easy access to the records, and that system designs must be “intuitive, so they can be used by busy health care providers without extensive training.”
A spokesman for HHS’s Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology said the report showed how much progress has been made in implementing the technology, although more work is needed to realize the full promise. “Health IT is just one tool that will help in improving how we pay for health care,” he told Government Executive. “We are well along in the journey to put modern information in the hands of clinicians, many of whom already recognize the power of health IT to transform patient care as it is delivered today.”
Dr. David Blumenthal, a former HHS official who advocated including electronic health record requirements in the Affordable Care Act while he was at the agency, said there still is strong evidence that electronic records can contribute to improved care and greater efficiency. But the systems in place do not always work in ways that help achieve those benefits, according to Blumenthal, now president of the health nonprofit called the Commonwealth Fund. “Technology is only a tool. Like any tool, it can be used well or poorly,” he told The New York Times.
On Tuesday, a Washington Post editorial discussing the RAND study noted that the 2009 Recovery Act included $27 billion to incentivize providers to embrace digital health records, and yet some evidence shows that health systems that converted have actually increased spending. “Health care still runs overwhelmingly on the fee-for-service principle,” the Post wrote, “which means that the more doctors and hospitals do, the more they get paid. Digitizing that system may just reinforce it.”
Still, the study is not a big setback for HHS, said Jack Meyer, managing principal at Health Management Associates, who consults for states setting up health insurance exchanges. “It’s a yellow light, a sobering note, but it doesn’t mean we should all go back to being Luddites.”
The primary reason to convert from “the paper chase to an electronic system is that it’s better for patient safety,” he said. While cost control is important, digitation helps avoid medical errors, “which can save injuries and lives.”
Under the old paper system, Meyer said, a tired doctor writing a prescription late at night could misplace a decimal point on the milligram dosage for, say, a painkiller for an infant. The result could -- and has been -- fatal. But electronic systems, which have been around since the mid-1970s, he said, have a “software intercept” that would use existing data on the patient’s characteristics and remind the doctor that he has probably mistyped his prescription.
“The study is a reminder that this isn’t going to be as easy as we thought,” Meyer said. “But the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is trying real hard, and may need to redouble.Smith calls for one NRL referee model Sun 11 May, 2014, 10:54am By Melissa Woods, AAP Tweet Email Print Test and Melbourne Storm skipper Cameron Smith has called for the NRL to revert to the one-referee system following an emotion-charged win over Manly.Halfback Cooper Cronk steered the Storm to victory in the last nine minutes, scoring a brilliant solo try and setting up another for debutant Kurt Mann.Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy didn't front the post-match media conference at AAMI Park, sending assistant Justin Morgan and Smith.Morgan said Bellamy was too "cut up" to attend and that the entire club was upset with the inconsistencies in the refereeing.Morgan, the NRL video referee coach last season, singled out Manly's first half try by Peta Hiku that was initially denied by referee Shayne Hayne before being overturned upon video review.The decision saw a furious Bellamy storm out of the coach's box to try to cool off."We tend to have a lot of decisions that have question marks against them," Morgan said. grey areas."Smith said players were frustrated by the inconsistency between the two referees in the current NRL model.He said the answer was to go back to one-referee system, as was used in last week's Anzac Test, with Hayne officiating.He (Hayne) did a great job and I don't think we had any issue with the refereeing because it was the one guy," Smith said."He knows how he wants to referee the game and he views it the same for both teams."I found that Test match really enjoyable just going back to one referee, which is an international rule, and I felt the game just flowed so much better."The Storm next face Souths in Sydney on Friday night.

By Jackie Burrell
Thursday, March 26th, 2009 at 9:55 am in Other.
Remember the era of goldfish swallowing, raccoon coats and phone booth stuffing? OK, neither do we, but we remember the pictures – especially the iconic shot of 22 St. Mary’s College students stuffed into a telephone booth that appeared in Life Magazine. Well, this is the 50th anniversary of that stunt, so our buddy Matt Krupnick ventured over to Moraga to watch the college kids try to beat the 1959 record, with some kibbitzing from original phone booth stuffers, including Benicia pharmacist Ray Motta. “Several former students,” says Krupnick, … The box, however, was a bit bent out of shape over the ordeal.”
Here’s hoping the kids don’t try to beat any other records. PETA would be all over that goldfish thing.

And here’s some super-rare CHEESE
[Part I]
Part II
Here’s a commodity quotation listing unlike any other, guaranteed. I’m applying heavy automation so that it should be easy to crunch all the math and keep everything updated on a monthly basis.
These goods fall roughly into three categories: scientific marvels, legendary comestibles and personal care items, and outsized bullion coins/platters. Aside from the merely expensive, some additional items beyond the ones that I’m able to quote but will mention are, in fact, so elusive that they have no real market and are therefore literally priceless.
The figures reflect an average of the asking prices of several parties
1
. They should be reasonably close for small, tabletop quantities. Obviously if you decide to stock up on
heavy water
in 55-gallon drums you could cut a better deal. Each graph displays the values for the same given quantity so they’ll compare on an equal footing. To approximate Euros for May 2015, multiply dollar amounts by 0.88; for Pounds Sterling, 0.63.
Uranium
$ 2.47 (↓ 7.7%)
Manni olive oil
$ 6.30 (↓ 6.8%)
Shilajit (Standardized)
$ 9.39 (steady)
Heavy Water
$ 25.11 (↑ 1.9%)
Saffron (200+)
$ 163.00 (↑ 8%)
100-Year Balsamic
$ 173.00 (↑ 117%)
Château Pétrus ‘82
$ 231.00 (↑ 8.7%)
USD / Troy Ounce (% Monthly Change)
As different as these seven items are from one another, I'm listing them first because they all come in at, effectively, under $300 per troy ounce.
Uranium
is normally bought, sold, and stored in the form of its chalky yellow oxide — better known as yellowcake. Back during the Beaver Cleaver era they used to give bottles of the stuff away to tourists visiting the mines. The pure metal itself is by far the cheapest superheavy substance which is the main reason the military craves it for bullets and artillery shells. Unenriched uranium is mildly radioactive and despite much hue and cry pretty safe unless it’s finely divided and inhaled. Which, of course, during warfare, it is.
Are two Ns better than one?
At around $20 per 100 ml (3.4 oz) bottle,
Manni extra virgin olive oil
costs twice as much as uranium and so far appears to be the world’s costliest. Maybe its farmers sing to the trees. Chefs use Manni very sparingly but many insist it’s worth it. Unfortunately for the more workaday product, terms like “extra virgin” have no legal meaning in the US so you can find just about any old crankcase sludge marketed here under that rubric (heads up, Rachael Ray).
Now I also see an oil called
Mani (spelled with
one
N) being sold
. It’s scrupulously labeled as coming from Greece, as opposed to Italy for the legendary two-N version
2
, and you’ll notice it’s also vastly cheaper. The marketplace holds Greek and other non-Italian olive oil in far lower esteem than Italian and there continues to be
a lot of scandal brewing
, if not outright physical violence, over the covert and industrywide substitution of one for the other. For all I know,
“Mani”
may well rival its namesake in actual quality; but as with everything,
caveat emptor.
Shilajit
or
shilajeet
is a highly prized tar that seeps to the surface in the Himalayas during summer thaw. It’s a traditional Nepali tonic and cure-all. In 1870 British explorer Sir Martin Stanley reported that monkeys living in the higher elevations where they could find and eat shilajit aged much more slowly, Lost Horizons-like, than their brethren who did not. Shilajit contains humic acids — large, complex molecules that arise from plant decomposition. So far little or no clinical evidence suppports any benefits. (It’s also worth knowing that quality control of shilajit can be lax to nonexistent and that unacceptable levels of heavy metals like lead and mercury have been reported.)
Heavy water
or D
2
O is water made of the alternate stable isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. It’s used to slow neutrons in some nuclear reactors. D
2
O weighs 11% more than ordinary water and has slightly higher melting and boiling points. It lies midway between ordinary water and skim milk in viscosity, so although it doesn’t taste any different it might conceivably feel a bit unusual in your mouth. Animal studies show that restricting your fluid intake to 50% D
2
O or more would cause no end of grief. Its chemical reactions run a bit slower so your body would have difficulty dividing cells and repairing itself and would give up the ghost before the week is out.
Molecule of Crocin, Chief Active Ingredient in Saffron
Top-drawer saffron
is actually more red than yellow. It consists exclusively of the saffron crocus’s stigmas, not the stalks supporting them which, like
the brine they inject into supermarket chicken
, add little more than dead weight. Technicians grade saffron by how well it absorbs a 440 nanometer wavelength of light, a deep violet-blue, resulting in a correspondingly high reflectance at the other end of the spectrum, red. The best earns an ISO color strength rating of 230 and above. The spice’s chief active ingredient is crocin, a deep red crystalline solid that’s also plentiful in gardenias. Claims circulate to the effect that crocin shows antioxidant and cancer-suppressing potential, so a number of firms are investigating gardenias as a far cheaper source.
You’d probably no more relegate
100-year-old balsamic vinegar
to your iceberg lettuce than you would pour Manni olive oil into a turkey fryer. The classical balsamic — the only one marketable as
Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale
— consists of Trebbiano and/or Lambrusco grape juices that have been boiled for 24-30 hours down to a syrup, filtered, injected with a starter culture, and then ritualistically fermented through a series of progressively smaller casks of varying types of wood. Aging categories break down into 12 years (labeled red), 18 (silver), and finally 25 to 100 or more (gold).
At the century stage the vinegar is thick, almost black, and entirely non-acidic with an intense, indescribably complex flavor. Connoisseurs dollop it gingerly onto meat or fruit or just sip it straight from shot glasses. Clans in Italy’s Emilia Romagna region have been crafting the product which includes
Il Grande Vecchio Mussini
,
Modena Extraveccio
, and other brands for over a thousand years. (The oldest stock I’ve ever seen for sale dated back to the mid 1600s, though despite that it was priced more in line with its century-only peers at around $100 per fluid ounce.)
The red wines of Châteaux Lafleur, Le Pin, and Pétrus figure prominently on most short lists of the world’s most exalted.
Château Pétrus
was served at Queen Elizabeth’s wedding in 1947 and became a favorite of the Kennedy White House. I’m tracking the price of 1982 Pétrus Pomerol on my graph because it was a particularly good year and because there’s enough of it around to assure a sturdy market. $231 per troy ounce approximates $5600 a bottle.
The willingness of prospective customers to part with that kind of cash for something a couple can drink inside of an hour depends entirely on how much they trust the people who have warehoused it. You can infer something by the condition of the bottle’s label and the size of the empty space inside the neck. If the latter (called “ullage”) extends down too low, the cork hasn’t been doing its job and the wine has probably gone bad. Twist tops are vastly superior in this regard, taking an average of three years to leak in each cubic centimeter of oxygen.
Copper
$ 0.04578 (↑ 7.6%)
Nickel
$ 0.00224 (↑ 10.5%)
Zinc
$ 0.00112 (↑ 5.5%)
Manganese
$ 0.00058 (↓ 1.4%)
Dollar Coin Components
Long gone are the days when circulating coinage held substantial bullion value. But what the heck. Here’s the current worth of each of the four base metals in the new gold-colored
US presidential dollar coin
. They total $0.04972 or 1082 Dongs, up 8% from last month. That’s not bad for a one dollar face value. The big money
loser
for the US mint is the nickel, whose metal content alone now comes to about $0.0415.
In 2004 the Austrian mint struck fifteen copies of a
1000-troy-ounce 24-karat gold “coin”
picturing the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra hall on one side and violins, a harp, a French horn and a bassoon on the other. Half the weight of a typical manhole cover, it measures about 15 inches (37 cm) in diameter and 5/8 inches (1.5 cm) thick. At current gold prices its bullion value would be $1,215,000.
Canada went one better in 2007 with five specimens of a 99.999% pure
3215-troy-ounce (100 kg) gold coin
, representing a current bullion value of around $3.91 million. This one is 3 ⅓ times the width of the Austrian number but only twice the thickness. Since gold of that fineness is so absurdly soft and pliable, such a heavy yet skinny platter of it would be vulnerable to dents and gouges at the slightest mishandling.
Australia’s Perth mint answered
that
in October 2011 with a far larger and proportionately thicker (albeit more rustic-looking) specimen. This one weighs 32,537 troy ounces (1012 kg). Multiplying the value of the Canadian article above by 10.12 yields $39.5 million. Naturally it displays the Queen on one side and a kangaroo on the other. One wonders, though, how long they’ll want to keep all that gold bottled up into a single mass.
Currently the world’s largest silver coin is the medieval-styled commemorative European Taler struck by the Austrian mint in 2008. It weighs 645.59 troy ounces (20.08 kg or 44.3 pounds) which at the moment would total around $11200.

Now, the Phoenix Coyotes’ right wing is the captain in a dressing room filled with twenty-something players who are energetic and exuberant, but hardly experienced.
Doan, only 31 years old himself, can’t figure out which he likes better.
“As a leader you realize having older guys like Mike Ricci or Jeremy Roenick or Owen Nolan, those guys from last year, is a huge help. It makes it pretty easy because you rely on them a lot,” Doan told NHL.com. “Now, it’s just different. I don’t know if it’s easier or harder, it’s just different.”
These days different works for Doan, mainly because he knows the other way didn’t.
The Coyotes, who haven’t made the playoffs since 2002, are now the youngest team in the NHL. And Doan, the team’s captain since 2003, not only accepts the responsibility of being its leader, clearly he has found pleasure in handling the role.
“I think he truly relishes it,” Coyotes coach Wayne Gretzky said. “He had some tough thoughts in the summer time. I don’t want to speak for him, but I’m sure he was wondering what is going to happen with all of these new guys, thinking, ‘Are we going to be worse than last year?’ But you know what? He took on the responsibility and came to training camp with a positive attitude and in tremendous shape.”
“Shane has really been the leader,” Gretzky continued. “He’s saying, ‘This is our group, and we’re going to become a good team together.’ ”
Like most humble leaders, Doan says he’s not doing it alone. He credits assistant captains Ed Jovanovski, Derek Morris and Steven Reinprecht for helping him take charge in the Coyotes’ youth movement.
The native of Halkirk, Alberta, which is south of Edmonton, also admits he’s still in some kind of awe over being the captain of Gretzky’s team.
“It’s a very unique opportunity to be on the ice every day with the greatest player to ever play the game,” Doan said. “Every day you have to show up not just as a player, but as a professional. He stresses that, and that’s what made him so good.”
Gretzky also thrived under immense expectations. While Doan hardly is being asked to yield similar results, he understands that he’s the Coyote with the highest expectations of them all.
Doan, who remains the only player still with the organization since it moved from Winnipeg prior to the 1995-96 season, is the player Gretzky and General Manager Don Maloney rely on to keep the younger guys on the straight and narrow.
“If we (the veterans) don’t get the young guys playing well we really don’t have a chance,” Doan said.
So, he leads by example.
Doan is the team’s top scorer, with nine goals and 18 assists, and he leads the Coyotes’ forwards in time on ice with 20:04 per game, a minute more than the next forward on the list. He also leads Phoenix with 66 hits and 25 takeaways.
“Shane is probably one of the nicest, but also hardest working guys I’ve met in my life,” Coyotes 19-year-old rookie Peter Mueller told NHL.com. “He wants the two points just like everyone else, but off the ice he’s a great guy and a great teammate. It’s definitely nice to be next to him on a line and in the room.”
For the first time in a while, Doan feels he’s close to being rewarded for his leadership, and patience.
Instead of wondering about Phoenix’s organizational plan – the Coyotes used to sign veterans for a quick splash that never materialized – he’s already seen enough positive results from the youth movement to think the future is as bright as the desert sun.
“Having the young guys come in like they did and filling such important, key holes for us has been good,” Doan said. “Bringing in a guy like Radim Vrbata has been incredible. Bringing in a goalie like Ilya Bryzgalov has been phenomenal. So, yeah, I’m encouraged that we’re going in the right direction here.
“It’s not us saying, ‘Hopefully this works.’ It is working. It is happening.”

The entry of AKKA Technologies.The Stone Roses may be releasing a documentary this week in celebration of their musical success, but the road to rock victory has not always been so smooth for the I Wanna Be Adored singers. In fighting saw the band split, but the boys managed to kiss and make-up for a reunion in 2011. But which other famous spats have there been within the music world?
We pick out the top 10 music fall outs…
10 – The Libertines
Ah The Libertines. A perfect example of a band burning out fast. Carl Barat and Pete Doherty formed the indie group in 1997, experiencing success five years later with the release of Up The Bracket. Their debut was a critical success and the boys enjoyed sharing stage line-ups with The Strokes and Morrissey. But things turned sour as they recorded a follow up with Peter being lost to the dark side of fame by using a variety of highly illegal drugs. Tensions began to rise until the band were forced to perform without Pete during a European tour resulting in him burgling Carl in a revenge attack. This tactic backfired as Pete found himself going to jail for his actions and the band didn’t survive much longer after this.
9 – Blur
Parklife stars Blur seemed to have it all: rulers of Brit Pop, number 1 records, America on the cusp of being cracked… but behind the well-engineered public image(apparently structured by Damon Albarn to an infuriatingly controlled degree), the cracks were beginning to show. Tensions between band members Damon, Graham Coxon, Alex James and Dave Rowntree were palpable to anyone who entered the same room as them. By 1996, five years after their There’s No Other Way breakthrough, a break-up was looking inevitable with Q magazine noting the boys were ‘on the verge of a nervous breakup.’ However it wasn’t until 2002 that Coxon left to focus on solo work and the others focused on other projects after the release of Think Tank with Damon focussing on Gorillaz, Dave getting political within the Labour party, and Alex James went off to play with cheese. However issues were resolved by 2008 when the band announced they would make a return to music – with reunion performances new singles following soon after.
8 – Drake vs Chris Brown
Ah yes. The classic reason behind some of the most famous feuds in human history. A girl. Rap artists Drake and Chris Brown came to blows in June 2012 when the Take Care singer suggested he had bedded Brown’s ex, Rihanna. Tempers quickly flared and within seconds a full scale brawl was underway between the boys and their entourages at WIP nightclub in NYC. Their feud has still not been settled as the boys have attempted to sue each other over the incident – while the nightclub and a number of injured guests have also field claims against the rappers.
7 – The Stone Roses
The factors to the Stone Roses original break-up are many – and were detailed in a 2004 BBC documentary, Blood On The Turntable – Was Of The Roses. They had been screwed over by their manager from the word go, apparently hardly banking a penny despite million pound record deals, and dissatisfaction within the band eventually led to Ian Brown dreaming of a solo career. Arguments were had, band members quit, and eventually they called it a day in 1996 after a disastrous string of live performances with replacements band members. Still, the groups albums have gone down as some of the best in British music history and in 2011 they buried the hatchet to reunite in time for the 20th anniversary of their debut album. This came after Brown said they would ‘never’ reunite, but the demand from fans eventually won him round and they have had a successful second wind.
6 – The Beatles vs Yoko Ono
Issues with girlfriends don’t just lead to fisticuffs (like Drake and Chris Brown) but can lead to the devastation to an entire band. When Yoko Ono and John Lennon met in 1966 it was the beginning of the end of The Beatles as their most talented member became more interested in purists away from the Yellow Submarine band. The subsequent demise of the band has coined the phrase ‘The Yoko Ono effect’ which is often quoted when a third party’s arrival leads to the destruction of the original group.
5 – Dave Grohl vs Courtney Love
Former Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters frontman Dave has made no secret of his dislike of Kurt Cobain’s wife Courtney Love – and vice versa. The two have been in a long running public feud (mostly over the estate of the late Kurt) which has seen them slogging insults at each other in every medium available: on air interviews, music lyrics, stage announcements and (of course) Twitter. However things hit an all-time low in 2012 when Courtney accused Dave of trying to sleep with her and Kurt’s daughter Francis Bean. Dave vehemently denied the accusation saying it was ‘upsetting, offensive and absolutely unture,’ while Courtney felt the wrath of her own daughter who berated her for dragging her into the feud saying she was ‘gross’ and ‘Twitter should ban my mother.’
4 – Elton vs Madonna
Queens of pop Elton John and Madonna spent a full decade at each other’s throats since Elt dissed Madge for her track Die Another Day, which he called ‘the worst Bond tune ever.’ Over the years he has called her out for miming on tour, asked her to ‘make sure you lip-sync good’ prior to her 2012 Super Bowl performance, and called her a ‘f***ing fairground stripper’. Charming. All the while Madge has kept things dignified, inviting Elton to watch her perform to prove him wrong. However Elton revealed in April that their battle is over after he bought Madonna dinner and apologised to her in person.
3 – The Rolling Stones
Things got very personal between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards when the former stole the latter’s girlfriend. The move created a bitter rift between the boys that still exists today and Keith has often stated that Mick has a small penis in revenge, saying in his 2010 autobiography that ‘Marianne Faithful had no fun with his tiny todger.’ It was even revealed that Keith was forced to apologise for his remarks as a ‘prerequisite’ of the Stones reforming for their current 50th anniversary tour. Honestly Mick, if it isn’t true, why do you care so much…?
2 – Robbie vs Liam
Take That star Robbie Williams decided enough was enough after a series of insults from Liam and Noel Gallagher. But after Liam threatened to break his nose, and Noel branded him ‘the fat dancer from Take That,’ Rob singled out Liam and decided he should put his money where his mouth is, challenging him to a live fight during the 2000 Brita Awards. ‘Liam, hundred grand of your money, hundred grand of my money. We’ll get in the ring, and we’ll have a fight, and you can all watch it on tv,’ he said after picking up an award for best British single. The fight never happened and the boys have since made up.
1 – Oasis
No matter how many arguments the Gallagher’s got into over their years – be it with Blur, Robbie, or anyone else that pissed them off – there was no holding back when the boys finally turned on each other. Arguments erupted on stage, off stage, and everywhere in between until the boys finally called time on their band in 2010. As Liam and Noel are brothers it makes their bitter fall out all the more tragic, but at least they win this top ten for their misery.
TOKYO — Japan logged its fourth straight monthly trade deficit in October as the European debt crisis and strained business ties with China over a territorial dispute reduced exports.
The Ministry of Finance said Wednesday that exports for the month fell 6.5 percent from a year earlier to 5.150 trillion yen ($62.9 billion), while imports slipped 1.6 percent to 5.699 trillion yen. That produced a deficit of 549 billion yen ($6.7 billion)
For years, Japan ran huge trade surpluses – when exports exceed imports – which.
Japan's trade balance has also been affected by increased imports of fuel to offset the shutdown of nearly all its nuclear plants in the wake of last year's atomic disaster in Fukushima..
Automobile exports fell 12.4 percent to 486,111 vehicles. Car exports to China tumbled 82 percent, while exports of video equipment to China also declined.

LOCALITYBalancing Pedagogy and Student Experience in First-Year Engineering Courses.
Abstract
Engineering graduates increasingly require greater appreciation of the social and environmental context in which they practice. Engineering programs must respond to these new demands by threading these broader contexts throughout the courses and embedded them within the development of the graduate capabilities. Students are also increasingly influential in the evaluation of course quality and their experience in their undergraduate program. Responding to these and many other global drivers and influences, we have examined a number of approaches in course design and delivery, particularly in the first year of the program, including problem based learning, project based learning, context based learning, multi-disciplinary integrated programs, and engineering systems based courses. Opportunity created by change, workplace culture, professional development, and ownership and values of academic staff all play an integral role in course designSite : TweetBuyer.Com

BookmarksFrench graduate seeking accommodation near Netherton
I am trying to arrange some accommodation for a 23 year old French male graduate coming to work in a company in Bridle Road, Netherton L30 for 8 weeks from 13th June. Please let me know if this is of interest and I will send you further details. TFrom 2004 through 2012, Penn State has or will open Big Ten play on the road seven times in nine seasons. Meanwhile, the conference has given Ohio State a home opener in league play 70 percent of the time since the Nittany Lions entered in 1993.
The Penn State conspiracy theorists -- who believe the Big Ten has never treated its newest member (until Nebraska) fairly -- certainly would say that sounds a little fishy.
Is it a big deal? Maybe, maybe not. Good teams find a way to win on the road, but clearly the first conference game helps set the tone for the remainder of the season.
The Lions have lost five of their last six conference openers on the road. They haven't been much better at home, though, losing four of their last five.
Whether all this matters much or not is up for debate, but the schedule facts compared to Ohio State do speak for themselves.
In 20 seasons from 1993 to 2012, the Buckeyes have/will be at home for the conference opener 14 times, compared to only eight for Penn State. The entire chart is to the right and shows that only Northwestern (six) and Minnesota and Iowa (seven apiece) have had fewer conference openers at home than PSU.
Where to begin
In a span of 20 years, since Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993 and through the 2012 season, this is how many times each league member has/will open up conference play at home versus on the road:
Team.....Home.....Road
Ohio State.....14.....6
Illinois.....13.....7
Purdue.....13.....7
Wisconsin.....12.....8
Michigan.....11.....9
Indiana.....11.....9
Michigan State.....10.....10
Penn State.....8.....12
Iowa.....7.....13
Minnesota.....7.....13
Northwestern.....6.....14
*Nebraska.....1.....1
*--Joins league in 2011
-------------------------------
How PSU has fared
The Lions have played nine road games and eight at home to start Big Ten play. But with road trips this year and the next two, it will be seven road openers in nine years from 2004-2012 and 12 in a 20-year span. The outcomes since 1993:
Year.....Opponent.....Result
1993.....Minnesota.....W, 38-20
1995.....Wisconsin.....L, 17-9
1999.....Indiana.....W, 45-24
2001.....Iowa.....L, 24-18
2002.....Iowa.....L, 42-35
2003.....Minnesota.....L, 20-14
2008.....Illinois.....W, 38-24
2009.....Iowa.....L, 21-10
ROAD
1994.....Minnesota.....W, 56-3
1996.....Wisconsin.....W, 23-20
1997.....Illinois.....W, 41-6
1998.....Ohio State.....L, 28-9
2000.....Ohio State, L, 45-6
2004.....Wisconsin.....L, 16-3
2005.....Northwestern.....W, 34-29
2006.....Ohio State.....L, 28-6
2007.....Michigan.....L, 14-9
2010.....Iowa.....TBD
2011.....Indiana.....TBD
2012.....Illinois.....TBD
The Lions travel to Iowa to start conference play Saturday. They will be on the road again the next two years and, although they were at home in 2008 and '09, they also were on the road four straight years from 2004-07.
Additionally, the Lions have had four years (2007, 2004, 1998, 1996) when their first two league games were on the road.
On "The NitWits" TV program Sunday night, the Mirror's Neil Rudel brought up the point that the Lions have been on the road to start Big Ten play a lot recently, so we researched how they compare to other teams.
Mark Rudner, who's in charge of scheduling for the Big Ten, said he has never been made aware of that breakdown or that Ohio State has been at home 14 out of 20 years. (The Buckeyes do open on the road this year at Illinois.)
"Very interesting," Rudner said. "Did not know that."
Rudner is associate commissioner of the Big Ten and is in his 32nd year with the league. He's also an Ohio State alum, which the Penn State conspiracy theorists surely will find interesting.
Rudner dismissed the notion that the league plays favorites on issues like scheduling or anything else.
"There is simply no truth to that whatsoever," he said. "It's pure folly to think that, and all we do and all we can do is create schedules based on the parameters that we're given by our athletic directors. They're the ones who approved the schedule."
The scheduling parameters, Rudner noted, that must be followed by the league include:
* Every team plays four home and four road games.
* No team can play more than two consecutive road games.
* The first half and second half of the schedule must be balanced with two home and two road games.
"All I can say is that if it was an issue for our athletic directors or our football coaches, they would have brought it to our attention beforehand and said, 'Listen, we need to make this a priority in our scheduling principles,'" Rudner said.
"But at no time in the last -- well since Penn State came into the conference -- at no time have I been part of any discussion whereby either the coaches or the athletic directors have said you need to balance out how you start the season at home or on the road."
It's not known how PSU feels about the quirky scheduling practices. Penn State spokesman Jeff Nelson sent this reply in an e-mail Wednesday when asked about the schedule:
"The home and away opponent data, playing dates and football scheduling principles are entered into the computer, and then the schedules are reviewed by the Big Ten staff and the athletic directors for final approval."
That means, at some point, PSU athletic director Tim Curley would have signed off on the schedules.
"If any of our athletic directors ... feel like there needs to be a much broader discussion about that or if there's a question about the integrity of the scheduling process, they certainly have the ability to raise those issues when we meet," Rudner said.
Maybe Penn State or no other school has complained, but it's tough to argue that opening at home so often has given Ohio State an advantage.Oct. 27, 2013

Biography. incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/076,334 filed Jun. 27, 2008, entitled “Efficient Method to Simulate Threshold Crossing Events”.
- Top of Page
Computer-based simulation enables the analysis of complex systems before the time and expense of actually implementing the systems is incurred. In general, a simulator is a software application that analyzes a system (e.g., a circuit design) based upon a description of that system to predict the behavior of the system under a given set of conditions or assumptions. Typically, the system description is made up of equations describing the desired behavior of the system. The simulator solves these equations in the context of simulated conditions represented by stimuli applied to the system in order to simulate operation of the system under those conditions.
A circuit simulator typically constructs circuit equations from mathematical models of the components in a circuit. The mathematical models may be provided in the circuit simulator (e.g., the semiconductor device models of SPICE-like simulators), and/or may be specified by a user using a hardware description language (e.g., Verilog-AMS, Verilog-A). The circuit simulator combines the mathematical models of the components with equations that describe the interconnection of the components to construct a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (DAEs) that describe the circuit. In many circuit simulators, the interconnection equations are derived from Kirchoff's voltage and current laws which require that the sum of all currents flowing out of a node at any instant is zero and the algebraic sum of all branch voltages around a loop at any instant is zero.
A circuit simulator may be used to perform many different types of analysis on a circuit, e.g., transient analysis, DC analysis, AC analysis, harmonic balance analysis, Monte Carlo analysis, mismatch analysis and parametric analysis, corners analysis, etc. For a transient analysis, the circuit simulator computes the response of a circuit as a function of time. To perform the transient analysis, the differential algebraic equations (DAEs) describing the circuit resulting finite-difference equations are solved one time point at a time starting from some initial condition. Four integration methods commonly used in circuit simulation include trapezoidal rule, forward Euler, backward Euler, and backward difference formulas (i.e., Gear's methods).
More specifically, transient analysis determines the time domain response of the circuit over a time interval [0, T]. The transient solution to the system of differential equations is computed by dividing this time interval into discrete time points [0, t1, t2, . . . , T], and applying a numerical integration algorithm at each time point to transform the differential equations into equivalent algebraic equations. The circuit simulator solves these nonlinear algebraic equations (NAEs) on every time point of a transient analysis. The solution to the NAEs is obtained by executing an iterative sequence of linearized solutions. The Newton-Raphson method, i.e., the Newton method or Newton iteration, is the most common method of linearization used. The Newton-Raphson method begins with an initial guess for the solution to the NAEs. The NAEs are then linearized about that guess, and the resulting linear system is solved. One common technique used to solve such a linear system in circuit simulators is LU factorization. LU factorization is a modified version of Gaussian elimination. The linear equations of the linear system are represented as a circuit matrix, i.e., a modified nodal analysis (MNA) circuit matrix which is typically a Jacobian matrix, and the matrix is factorized into a product of lower- and upper-triangular matrices. Then, forward and backward substitutions are performed to obtain the solution. Once the solution is obtained, the NAEs are then re-linearized about the solution and the procedure repeats until the process converges.
Threshold-crossing events (i.e., cross events) are widely used in transient analysis. In general, a cross event is an event that is fired during simulation whenever the result of evaluating an expression crosses through a threshold (e.g., 0) in a positive and/or negative direction. In essence, a cross event is specified to cause the simulator to generate a time point, i.e., a crossing time point, at the threshold crossing point, i.e., to cause the simulator to solve the circuit equations at the threshold crossing point. For example, the cross function in Verilog-A generates a monitored analog event to detect threshold crossing and is also used in Verilog-AMS for threshold crossing.
One frequently used approach for detecting and resolving a crossing time point during transient analysis is as follows. At each time point, the circuit simulator checks for all cross conditions. If violation of a cross condition is detected (e.g., the result of evaluating an expression crosses through a threshold), the circuit simulator rejects the time point and enters a search mode to attempt to find a time point where the crossing that violated the cross condition is occurring. The circuit simulator iteratively predicts (via interpolation) and solves the crossing point expression(s) until a time point sufficiently close (i.e., within some error tolerance) to the actual time at which the crossing occurs is found. The iterative prediction is typically repeated for 2-4 time points to locate an accurate crossing time point and may require many more time points. Further, the entire circuit or system of equations is evaluated and solved for each of these time points, which is computationally expensive. Therefore, specifying a large number of cross events may significantly impact the performance of a simulation. Accordingly, improvements in the processing of threshold-crossing events are desirable.
Embodiments of the invention provide for simulation of a model of a system. In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a method for simulation of a model of a system that includes detecting a violation of a cross condition while iteratively refining a first solution of a system of nonlinear algebraic equations at a current time point, wherein the system of nonlinear algebraic equations is derived from a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations that describe the system, responsive to the detecting, predicting a crossing time step, wherein the crossing time step is an interval between a previous time point and a crossing time point where the crossing condition was violated, projecting an initial guess for a second solution of the system of nonlinear algebraic equations at the crossing time point, and iteratively refining the second solution and the crossing time step by jointly solving an equation for the cross condition with the system of nonlinear algebraic equations as a coupled nonlinear system in which the crossing time step is treated as an unknown to compute changes to the second solution and the crossing time step in each iteration, and outputting information regarding the second solution and the crossing time point in human readable form.
In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a computer system that includes a processor and a storage device storing software instructions, wherein when executed by the processor, the software instructions cause the computer system to perform the above described method.
In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a computer readable medium that includes executable instructions to perform the above described method when executed by a processor.
Particular embodiments in accordance with the invention will now be described, by way of example only, and with reference to the accompanying drawings:
FIG. 1 shows block diagram of a computer system for performing simulation in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention;
FIGS. 2A-2D are flow diagrams of methods in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention;
FIG. 3 shows a circuit in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention; and
FIG. 4 shows a graph of the threshold-crossing for a cross condition specified for the circuit of FIG. 3 in accordance with one or more embodiments.
Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying figures. Like elements in the various figures are denoted by like reference numerals for consistency.
Certain terms are used throughout the following . . . .” Further, any reference to “the invention” herein is not intended to be construed as a generalization of any inventive subject matter disclosed herein nor to be considered as an element or limitation of the appended claims except where explicitly recited in a claim(s).. In addition,.
In general, embodiments of the invention provide methods and systems for processing of threshold crossing events in a simulator. More specifically, embodiments of the invention provide an approach to generating a crossing time point that includes solving the equations for a cross condition jointly with the discretized differential algebraic equations (DAEs) describing the simulated system as one nonlinear system in which the time step for the crossing time point is treated as an unknown. Thus, the approach directly converges to the crossing time point without requiring computation of potential solutions at multiple time points as required in prior art approaches. Some embodiments of the invention also provide an approach for detecting the violation of cross conditions using polynomial interpolation rather than the linear interpolation used in prior art approaches.
FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of a computer system for performing simulation in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. Although only a single computer system is presented and described, any number of such computer systems may be connected, e.g., using communication interface 116, to execute embodiments of the simulation methods described herein. Further, while FIG. 1 illustrates various components of a computer system, representation of a particular architecture is not intended and embodiments of the invention are not limited to the example architecture shown. In addition, embodiments of the invention may be used on computing systems having fewer or more components than those shown.
As shown in FIG. 1, a computer system includes one or more processors 108, a storage device 110, memory 106, read-only memory (ROM) 112, and a communication interface 114 interconnected by an internal bus. The storage device 110 is a non-volatile memory device, e.g., a magnetic or optical disk, which maintains data even when power is removed from the computer system. While FIG. 1 shows storage device 110 as a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the computer system, the storage device 110 may be remote from the system, i.e., coupled to the computer system through the communication interface 114. The ROM 112 may store static data and/or instructions for the processor(s) 108. The computer system also includes a display 102 and input device(s) 104 such as a keyboard and a mouse (or other cursor control device) connected to the internal bus. The communication interface 114 provides two-way communication with other computer systems via a communication link 116. The communication link 116 may be, for example, a local area network, an integrated services digital network, a cellular network, and/or a wide area network.
The simulator 120 may be stored on the storage device 110 and read into the memory 106 to be executed by the processor(s) 108. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the simulator 120 may be used to test and validate models of systems. More specifically, the simulator 120 includes functionality to construct a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (DAEs) describing the system from the model. The simulator 120 also included functionality to perform different types of analyses on the system including transient analysis in which the response of the system is computed as a function of time. To perform the transient analysis, the differential algebraic equations (DAEs) describing the system simulator 120 solves the resulting finite-difference equations one time point at a time starting from some initial condition. The simulator 120 also includes functionality to output for each time point any information a user may have requested about a time point. The outputting may include, for example, storing the requested information on the storage device 110 and/or providing the information to another software application using the communication interface 114 and/or displaying the information in human readable form (e.g., on paper or on the display 102).
Further, the simulator 120 includes functionality to detect threshold crossing events defined in a system model and to determine the time points of the crossings that triggered the events and the solutions to the NAEs at these timepoints, the functionality including performing one or more embodiments of the methods described herein. A threshold crossing event, i.e., a cross event, is an event occurring during simulation whenever a specified cross condition is violated, e.g., the result of evaluating an expression crosses through a threshold (e.g., 0) in a positive and/or negative direction.
A computer readable medium may be used to store software instructions and data which when executed by the computer system causes the system to perform embodiments of the methods described herein. A computer readable medium is any mechanism that stores information in a form accessible by a computer system, such as, for example, ROM, random access memory (RAM), magnetic disk storage, optical storage media, flash memory, etc. In some embodiments of the invention, a computer readable medium may also be electrical, optical, acoustical, or other forms of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.).
FIGS. 2A-2D show a method for simulation in accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. Embodiments of the method are presented and described using circuit simulation as an example. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand other embodiments in which the system under simulation may be any system that can be described with a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations, such as a mechanical system, a biological system, etc. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should not be considered limited to circuit simulation.
For simulation purposes, a circuit model is described using a hardware description language. In describing these methods, certain terminology from one hardware description language may be used in describing the methods for ease of explanation. Definitions for these terms are taken from the Verilog-AMS Language Reference. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that different terminology may be used in other hardware description languages without departing from the described functionality. As used below, a circuit model is represented as one or more system. A system is a collection of interconnected components that produces a response when acted upon by a stimulus. A component is fundamental unit within a system that encapsulates behavior and structure. A hierarchical system is a system in which the components are also systems. A leaf component is a component with no subcomponents that connects to zero or more nets.
Each net connects to a signal which can traverse multiple levels of the hierarchy. The behavior of each component is defined in terms of the values of the nets to which it connects. A signal is a hierarchical collection of nets which, because of port connections, are contiguous. If all the nets that make up a signal are in the discrete domain, the signal is a digital signal. If all the nets that make up a signal are in the continuous domain, the signal is an analog signal. A signal that consists of nets from both domains is called a mixed signal. Similarly, a port whose connections are both analog is an analog port, a port whose connections are both digital is a digital port, and a port with one analog connection and one digital connection is a mixed port. The components interconnect through ports and nets to build a hierarchy. A node is a point of physical connection between nets of continuous-time descriptions. A branch is a path between two nodes. Nodes obey conservation-law semantics. A conservative system is one that obeys the laws of conservation described by Kirchhoff's Potential and Flow laws. In a conservative system, each node has two values associated with it: the potential of the node and the flow out of the node. Each branch in a conservative system also has two associated values: the potential across the branch and the flow through the branch.
The method for circuit simulation illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2D includes the generation of a crossing time point in response to the detection of a threshold crossing event specified in a model of a circuit. A threshold crossing event occurs when a cross condition associated with the event is violated during simulation. In one or more embodiments of the invention, generating a crossing time point after a violation of a cross condition is detected includes solving the equations for the cross condition jointly with the circuit equations as one nonlinear system i.e., a coupled nonlinear system, in which the time step from the time point accepted immediately prior to the violation of the cross condition, i.e., the previous time point, to the crossing time point is treated as an unknown. A time step is the interval between two sequential time points. The derivation of the coupled nonlinear system and the resulting equations for solving the circuit equations and for determining the unknown time step are first explained before describing the circuit simulation method that uses these equations.
As shown in Eq. (1), modified nodal analysis (based on Kirchhoff's laws) of a mathematical model of a circuit is used to construct a system of N differential algebraic equations (DAEs) that are solved to analyze the behavior of the circuit,

Xbox Marketplace Update: July 3, 2012
We've got a high-profile platformer hitting the arcade tomorrow, some deals on some map packs, some nice add-ons for some popular games, and a newly added Indie title RPG fans should check out. Hit the break for this week's Xbox Marketplace Update.Q. I don’t really want to go to court, isn’t that what happens if I get a lawyer?
A. Usually not. Filing a lawsuit and proceeding into litigation does not necessarily mean that you will be in a courtroom in front of a judge. Litigation can take years to fully accomplish, and it is not until the very end of that time that a Plaintiff is in an actual courtroom. Usually, litigation is a way a Plaintiff can get an actual attorney involved for the Defendant, instead of an insurance adjuster. The vast majority of civil cases that are filed into litigation are successfully settled before a Plaintiff ever steps foot in a courthouse.
Q. Lawyers cost a lot of money, won’t I make more money in the end without a lawyer?
A. In injury cases, our firm works on a contingency fee, which means that we only receive a portion of a settlement. That means if we cannot obtain a settlement for you, you don’t owe us any fees. On the other hand, having an attorney is what can maximize the amount of money you recover and ease headaches from insurance companies. Lawyers in this business know the value of your claim when you are ready to settle, and a non-lawyer cannot be expected to know those values. The insurance companies know this, and usually will not settle your case for the full amount of money that your claim is worth without an attorney. In most cases a client will receive more money, after attorneys fees, than they would have received without an attorney at all.
Q. I like knowing exactly what is going on in my claim, what do you do to make sure that happens.
A. Communication with the client is our main goal at the Judnich Law Office. A common issue in the industry is how to keep clients fully informed. Our office routinely emails our clients and will provide copies of correspondence from the insurance company and our office. Our office is mostly paperless, which means that almost all documents are scanned into digital format and can be attached to an email. We also pride ourselves on returning the calls of our clients, so no questions go unanswered.
Q. How much is my claim worth?
A. A trustworthy lawyer will be unable to answer that question without a thorough knowledge of your case. There is no magic formula or mathematical equasion that is used to determine value, especially at the very beginning of a claim. Your true claim worth is determined by looking at many factors that include such things as your medical bills, length of treatment, seriousness of injury, response to treatment, amount of pain, amount of treatments, time off of work, and most importantly; jury verdicts. Each state’s juries are different in how they award damages. The same case in California may be worth more than a case in Montana. A good attorney knows why that difference exists and will explain it to you. In the end, your claim is evaluated with many factors that are unique to your individual claim, and cannot be estimated without much research and investigation.
Q. Who pays my medical bills?
A. It depends. There is a correct order in which insurance companies must pay your medical bills. Most people assume that the responsible driver’s insurance company is the one that should pay. It is true, that they will ultimately pay your medical bills, however, that does not mean that they should be the first insurance company to pay them. Often times, your own insurance company should be the one to pay your outstanding medical bills first, then the responsible insurance pays the amount of those medical bills directly to you. Tens of thousands of dollars can be thrown away by not having the correct insurance company pay bills in the correct order or priority.As the RecSysTEL workshop is jointly organized by the 4th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2010) and the 5th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL 2010), registration for the RecSysTEL workshop is expected in both conferences as follows:

He switched to sports broadcasting after spending the last 4 years studying education. He feels he is finally in a field he belongs in and is excited to stud and to be a part of the crew.Sony is really trying to outdo itself this Valentine's Day. Not only is it pushing its " Red Collection ," but it's gone back to the well with its eBook promotion from last year. Fortunately since that campaign, which was decidedly unromantic, Sony seems to have gotten a little clearer on the concept. Instead of the stodgy leather-bound Dooney & Bourke version, this time it's going with a SkinIt "Cross Your Heart" cover--in pink, of course. But the real kicker is 14 free downloads of Harlequin romance novels. Now all it needs is some Fabio wallpaper, and they're off to the races.
(Thanks to Mia for the tip)The Summer of Wrong
It's Aug.
There's about a month and a half left in the baseball season, and even with some rough patches here and there, the Texas Rangers keep fighting for a playoff spot. Unless Ameriquest Field spontaneously combusts, the Rangers figure to at least remain in the wild card race, if not contend for the A.L. West. And who saw that coming? Certainly not me. First I wrote a spring training feature predicting the usual collapse. Wrong. Then I wrote a column a few months after the season began that advised overzealous fans to ration their excitement because the usual collapse was likely closing in. Wrong. Then I said the Rangers would bring about the usual collapse by not trading for a starting pitcher--which was also wrong. If nothing else, I've been consistent. I make an art form of being wrong--it's a beautiful thing in an abstract sort of way..
Forget Quincy Carter for a moment; the biggest preseason shakeup was at running back. I was sure the Cowboys would pass on Eddie George. If head coach Bill Parcells has been adamant about anything, it's that he's not the type to add big names with large price tags draped around their necks. Those kinds of moves, the thinking went, can handicap you for the future. It made more sense that George, the former Titans running back and Pro Bowler, would end up with the Eagles--he's from Philly, and they signed just about everyone else during the off-season, so why not George, too? It made sense that he'd sign with the Birds because they figured to throw more money at him, or at least more contract years..
I've now written supportive words about the Cowboys and the Rangers in the same column. I feel like a shell of a man.
The Mavs have made two trades in the last month or so, but neither was the high-profile deal you probably would have liked. First they sent Danny Fortson to Seattle for Calvin Booth. The same Calvin Booth who used to play here. Then they shipped Tony Delk and Antoine Walker to the Hawks for Jason Terry, Alan Henderson and a first-round pick. Ugh.
Over the off-season, they also managed to recycle Christian Laettner and bring in Jerry Stackhouse and a host of others, running their total of roster players to 57, or roughly the population of Tyler.
The initial thought was that Dallas and Mad Mark Cuban were stockpiling talent in order to trade for Shaquille O'Neal. Too late for that now. Shaq was dealt to Miami. Which leaves the Mavs with a whole lot of players (did I mention they have more players on their roster than they should?) but not many options.
So what happens from here? I'm not sure what will happen, but I can tell you what I'd like to see happen: I'd like to see the Mavs get stuck with each and every player they have, including the two useless 7-footers, Shawn Bradley and Pavel Podkolzin. Then I'd like to see those two goofs fight to the death for the right to star opposite Billy Crystal in a remake of the cinematic classic My Giant.
Is that soMay 3, 2010 WIC Update
SUBJECT 1: Friday, May 7- Truman Holiday- WIC Help Desk Coverage
SUBJECT 2: Entering Non-existent Participants and Men in MOWINS
SUBJECT 3: Reminder - Hotel Reimbursement for Basic Orientation and MOWINS Training
SUBJECT 4: WIC May Invoices
SUBJECT 5: Reminder - New Descriptions for Enfamil LIPIL Formulas
- Truman Holiday-Friday, May 7th- WIC Help Desk Coverage: May 7, 2010 is a State holiday, there will be coverage on the WIC Help Desk from 8:00-5:00 but the rest of the State WIC Office will be closed. If you have questions, contact Mark Davis at Mark.Davis@health.mo.gov or 573-526-5323 or 800-392-8209.
- Entering Non-existent Participants and Men in MOWINS: The State WIC Office has been informed that some local agency staff have entered data into MOWINS on pretend participants as practice in using MOWINS. State Office has also learned that local agency staff has entered non-existent participants into MOWINS as a way of blocking a staff member's schedule when he/she is out of the office. MOWINS has the capability of showing a staff member as "out of the office" in the appointment scheduler. If you are not sure how to do this, contact the WIC Help Desk at 800-554-2544. State Office has also learned that some agencies have entered men who are the custodial parent of WIC infants or children as participants in MOWINS. Instead of doing this, local agency staff should schedule individual WIC participants (child or infant) in the appointment scheduler and place an alert that has the custodial parent’s information on the child or infant record. If agency staff has questions regarding this, they should contact their TA staff. Entering participants into MOWINS who are not real or not qualified to be on WIC must stop immediately. Only “real” participant data is to be entered. Entering false data will increase the size of the database, possibly slowing down the system and make it more likely for fraud to occur. It will affect the data integrity in MOWINS, which in turn will affect future reports. If you have already entered false participants please send Mark Davis (contact information is below) the State WIC IDs so the data can be removed from MOWINS. In the future, State WIC Office will regularly check the database to see if fake names are entered in MOWINS. There will be no sanction if agencies have entered this type of data in the past as long as no checks were issued to the non-existent participant; however future violations will have consequences.
If you have questions, contact Mark Davis at Mark.Davis@health.mo.gov or 573-526-5323 or 800-392-8209.
- Reminder - Hotel Reimbursement for Basic Orientation and MOWINS Training: For agencies whose staff has attended the 2010 WIC Basic Orientation and MOWINS trainings in Jefferson City, please submit your one-time only request for reimbursement for the cost of overnight lodging at your earliest convenience following the training to facilitate timely reimbursement. The LWP should submit an invoice from the hotel showing zero balance due, and complete the attached template using their letterhead. Please refer to the Feb. 1, 2010 WIC Updates for detailed instructions. Submit the hotel invoice and request to: ATTN: Laura Weiler, DHSS-WIC, PO Box 570, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0570 or fax to 573/526-1470. If you have questions, contact Laura Weiler at Laura.Weiler@health.mo.gov.

Obo was donated to the department by a former Department of Corrections K-9 trainer, Joe Nicholas, and his wife, Joi. The donation equals about $7,000.
"Obo's presence on our streets is an effective crime deterrent. He has already assisted in the peaceful surrender of a suspected drug criminal, a burglar and a person wielding a knife at an apartment complex," said Councilman Hector Cabezas.
The dog is trained for tracking fugitives and missing persons, as well as searching buildings. The department also plans to train Obo for sniffing out narcotics.
Obo has big shoes to fill. He will replace K-9 officer Kato, a 10-year-old German shepherd who was retired in April after seven years with the Glassboro police.

``Music is love in search of a word,'' wrote 19th-century
musician and poet Sidney Lanier.
These days the sheer joy of a wedding is openly celebrated
and music is extremely influential in the melding of the
wedding day, helping set the atmosphere in the church, at the
reception and the dance that may follow.
Couples have their own musical preferences, their specific
choice providing a unique texture to their wedding. Genres
vary widely from rock and pop (often selected from a specific
decade such as the '80s!) to bluegrass and country to reggae
and drum 'n' bass. Don't forget the show tunes, hip-hop,
techno and jazz or world music, the latter a superb way to
reflect the cultural backgrounds of the couple.
The possibilities are vast but many opt for the strong and
dramatic classical pieces often chosen for traditional church
weddings, particularly for the processional, when the bride
walks down the aisle and the recessional, when the newlyweds
and attendants leave the church. Played by an accomplished
organist these have a proven track record in providing a
fabulous sense of occasion and exuberance.
Other couples marrying in a church walk new paths, the
results of which can be refreshing and fun. This is often
manifested in the music played prior to the arrival of the
bride and attendants, the soft background background music
creating a warm and mellow atmosphere for arrival of the
guests.
Musical interludes during the signing of the register can
also vary widely, from solo singers through to a musician,
the instrument varying from a guitar or flute to a saxophone.
Pipers often come into their own welcoming guests outside the
wedding venue, or playing the couple and their attendants
into the reception.
Background music for the reception is also a very personal
choice. If classical music is the newlyweds love they may
consider a string quartet, or if they are romantics, a
harpist or flautist. For contemporary music buffs a pianist,
guitarist, a duo or jazz combo are ideal.
Always in high demand are professional DJs. Some couples like
to put together their favourite songs and tunes for the
reception and dance, downloading these onto discs or iPod. In
this case, it is a good idea to have back-up.
Entertainment agencies and sound and lighting professionals
can often help with information about musicians, DJs and
bands. They have diverse stables of talented musicians, bands
and singers to choose from.
Check entertainment and music sites or talk to recently
married friends. They often can recommend a particular
musician or DJ and often have tips
as to what they might have done differently, such as creating
a ``must play'' and a ``do not play'' list.
TIP: When it comes to the dance do not ostracise guests with
your choice of music. Many couples arrange top favourites
everyone knows to start the dancing, moving to more
contemporary sounds as the night wears on. 23, 2013
O'Donnell: Another Tin Foil Hat Candidate
In 1988, he was fired as an auditor with the state for doing township business on the state dime. O'Donnell justified it, saying that no tax dollars were lost and he always made up the time lost. He did appeal his termination through his union, but I have never been able to determine what happened.
What bothers me is his cantankerous, mean-spirited style, which he displayed to County Council right before the primary.
During courtesy of the floor, he got up and gave a campaign speech. In Mccarthy-esque style, he claimed some candidates are inadequate. "I will not name names, but you will know who I am taking about, but I will name names if I am chosen to represent the residents after the primary."
I'm waiting for him to name those names.
O'Donnell, like Controller Steve Barron, likes to claim he's a "certified fraud examiner." That's a fancy way of saying he's not an accountant.
He claims that "if you are not part of the solution, you're part of the problem." Since he has proposed no solutions to County government, other than attacks against people he does not name, I think it's safe to say he's part of the problem.
Notwithstanding the LV Labor Council endorsement, which frankly casts doubt on their own abilities, O'Donnell belongs with Phillips in the tin foil hat brigade.
18 comments:
Tom O'Donnell is nightmare. The fact that he polls well in the county is just unbelievable.
The guy is NUTZ. I think that Phillips, Geissinger and Benol are out there as well. Of the three, I give Phillips credit for being up front and honest about his views. The others are playing their tea party allegiance close to the vest in order to get elected.
However, I think all three Republicans are not stupid or crazy, just out of the mainstream for Northampton County residents. They are running against Obama and the UN, not really an issue this year..
O'Donnell's endorsement by the Labor Council is a joke and so is Borso's. I lost a lot of respect for that labor organization because of the endorsements. How can you endorse nut job O"Donnell and not endorse Hunter? She belongs to a union and endorses union goals and objectives. What has Borso ever done for unions? Is she even a union member? Why do I see Borso O'Donnell signa all over the place/ They are obviously promoting each other. What about the rest of the democrats? There is something real fishy going on behind the scenes. Tell us what this smell is all about Bernie. I'm sure you know.
Let's not do anything hasty here. As Democrats we want to elect Democrats here in our home County. You saw how having a majority of Republican Council persons screwed up the County (including the now infamous swaption). 60 million dollars in a slush fund and they couldn't do the right thing which should have been to cut taxes. If you don't want to vote for O'Donnell and his lady friend Borso, please vote for the rest of the democrats. They are Callahan, Seyfried, Hunter, and Heckman. They will make a dynamic team.

Tom O'Donnell may be a nightmare, to you & The fact that he polls well in the county is just unbelievable, to you. He may be representive of the L.V. demographic & in the mainstream for Northampton County residents.
."
I don't know that Kraft and McClure and behind this. Kraft is definitely supporting Borso. I doubt he is endorsing O'Donelle. As for McClure, his support tends to hurt, not help. Ge gave Borso all kinds of help in the primary and she finished 4th.
I will say that I have seen the signs placed side by side, which means there is a coordinated effort. If true, that's a big mistake on Borso's part, and follows her mistake in being too close to McClure in the primary.
" He may be representive of the L.V. demographic & in the mainstream for Northampton County residents.'
No, that's not true at all. He finished 5th among 5. barely. Heis running in an off year election in which most people do not vote. He has a good name. Anyone who actually listened to him could never vote for him. He is that bad. I would even take Phillips over him.
O'Donnell, who can support this guy? must be the same people supporting Borso. Talk about waste of space. These two fit that bill
Borso says Um more then anything else. Her husband is a SCAB
Makes you wonder how she got the endorsement of labor counsel. I would say she is a puppet with Kraft pulling the strings and McClure bowing to Kraft
"If you don't want to vote for O'Donnell and his lady friend Borso, please vote for the rest of the democrats. They are Callahan, Seyfried, Hunter, and Heckman. They will make a dynamic team."
That will ensure a 7-person Democratic majority on Council. A Council with Werner, Kraft, Parsons, McClure, Seyfried, Hunter and Heckman as the Democrats.
"Borso says Um more then anything else. Her husband is a SCAB
Makes you wonder how she got the endorsement of labor counsel. I would say she is a puppet with Kraft pulling the strings and McClure bowing to Kraft"
I'm sorry, but what do you mean when you say her husband is a scab? The fact that she uses the word "um" should not be held against her bc she has never run before. I am more concerned whether she is her own person, and have told her that.
Bernie I would question Hunter being her own person more than any of the other candidates.
4:03 Anyone who knows Hunter knows that BS. So Charles, Lamont, or Ken stop slinging it.
Hunter thinks she is a queen. We already have Peg for that.
You do realize that on FB, Borzo calls O'Donnell her second father. She thinks he is a really sweet and funny guy. So much for judgment. Wow!!
I have not seen her refer to O'Donnell as her second father. Can you post that exact comment here? I did see multiple references to O'Donnell and they are clearly allied.
4:43pm Having a conversation with yourself again?
You are all screaming for nothing. The only Democrat that will win is Jerry Seyfried. The Republicans will sweep all other offices in Northampton County including Executive. The odd person out will be Seth Vaughn. No other Democrat will win. The county wants new people with a clear vision of saving the government from the progressives.
It is as good as done.
Exactly wrong. Seth will be the only R besides Peg who gets in the county door. The extremists are dead in the water. Bernie has the right 4 candidates who will win seats and left #5 open. Seth is a sane Republican and worth the vote of anyone in the county. I like him.Pixily – Go Paperless!

Startup School 2008 – Friday, […]About
number twenty-three, the one with the burnt frame
there once was a family of four;
a father, a mother, and a pair of fraternal twins.
nothing less and nothing more.
Now let it be known, this story is not meant for the faint of heart,
so if you're ready, let us start.
On a night while mother was away,
working and slaving until the next day.
father was home, but not quite there,
he really didn't notice, and didn't give a care.
while the children screamed and cried for his attention.
This is the part, we really don't want to mention.
With the door locked, their hunger grew,
the little boy knew what to do.
it was when the clock struck eight,
he hoped wasn't too late...
He found the match which would light their candle.
This is the part that is hard to handle.
The little boy was not to blame.
You might have done the same.
With only good intentions,
he hoped the smell would catch his attention,
the flame was fast and burned his finger,
innocently they let it linger
the match fell catching the drapes on fire
The children panicked, screaming louder as the flames rose higher.
Now you know the story begging to the end
and the mother's heart never did mend.
From the ashes arose The Horror Twins,
to scare the masses, so watch your asses.

It’s fitting that for Canadian soccer, 2013 will end with a whimper.
After a year in which the national team sunk to unprecedented depths and few individual players were able to firmly establish themselves on the international stage, most Canadians will be happy to see 2013 drift off in the rear-view mirror.
As it happened, the year’s final week of games saw virtually no playing time for Canadian exports anywhere in the world – though the winter break being taken in Germany (where a large number of Canadians ply their trade) has a lot to do with that.
Pedro Pacheco, one of the few Canadians who is a true stalwart for his club, played the full 90 in Santa Clara’s 1-0 win on Sunday in Portugal. It was the club’s third win in four games, a remarkable turnaround after a lengthy losing streak that had them looking poised for relegation.
Iain Hume came on as a second-half substitute for English third-tier side Preston North End in a 1-0 win over Shrewsbury on Monday, a result that keeps PNE fourth in the League One table and right in the middle of a fight for promotion to the Championship.
While neither of those two were born in Canada, they’ve both put in years of loyal service to the national team. Meanwhile, a pair of Canadian-born fence-sitters – neither of whom has ever suited up for the land of their birth – were also in action this week.
Fraser Aird scored his second goal of the season for Scotland's Glasgow Rangers, as they cruised to a 4-0 win over Dunfermline on Monday. Elsewhere, David “Junior” Hoilett made appearances for Queens Park Rangers on Thursday and Monday, as his club bagged four points from a possible six.
As we look ahead to 2014, could players like Aird and Hoilett finally feature for the Canadian men’s national team? Highly unlikely.
But one thing is for sure – if Canada’s men’s national team hopes to reverse its fortunes in the future, its members will need to find ways to become and remain meaningful contributors to their club sides, wherever in the world those clubs may happen to be.

BKW to hold budget forum on Tuesday
BERNE With the 2012 school-budget vote less than two months away, the Berne-Knox-Westerlo School District will hold a community forum on Tuesday, April 3, to discuss spending for the 2012-13 school year.
The forum will be held in the high school auditorium, and will start at 6 p.m.
This past Monday, the school board got an update from business official Kevin Callagy on the budgeting process.
“We’re still awaiting the New York State budget,” Callagy told a crowd of about a dozen on Monday night. “Whether we like the numbers or not, it’s at least helpful to know what they are.” The governor announced a budget agreement on Tuesday, and state aid figures are expected Friday.
Callagy also told the board that, through working with the Board of Cooperative Educational Services’ Municipal Benefit Coalition, which has been acting as the town’s health insurance broker since last year, the district may be able to save 20 percent $240,000 out of $1.2 million in prescription-drug-service costs.
“They looked at our 2010-11 claim year,” Callagy said of the BOCES coalition, “and, they believe, based on those prescriptions that were used at that point, that we would have saved about 20 percent also. However, it will require us to move from our current provider, Informed Rx, to ESI,” or Express Scripts Inc.
“We’re self-insured, so it’s really just the provider of the services,” Callagy went on. “I’m budgeting as if there is no increase in our prescription drug cost. So, it’s not the full 20 percent, because I’d also like to see it first.”
Callagy gave two sets of figures for the next three school years: The first set showed how the district might budget to meet the current 2-percent tax-levy cap; and the second, what it might be facing if the budget were voted down twice, and the district were forced to budget with no tax-levy increase. New state legislation says there can be no levy increase if a school goes to a contingency budget, as Berne-Knox-Westerlo has after the last two years of budget defeats. The law also allows for a carryover of the unused increase the following year.
Speaking about the new law, Morris Peters, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Budget, said earlier this month, “A carryover of up to 1.5 percent of unused tax-levy growth is allowed within the cap the following year.”
So, using the 2-percent cap from the 2011-12 school year as an example, if a school’s budget were voted down twice forcing the district to default to a contingency budget with no.
Callagy’s projections also included the use of funds from a debt-service reserve, which has not yet been established, but would include unused building aid from the ongoing building project.
Meeting the cap
BKW’s $20.8 million budget for this year depended on $10,681,901 from property taxes, a 3.5-percent increase from the previous year, and used $8,738,003 from state aid.
A rollover budget for next year meaning all programs, staff, and services are maintained from the current year would total $20,205,832. This includes a $162,510 increase in instruction costs; a $30,135 increase in general support; and a $24,070 increase in transportation costs.
A 2-percent increase for the 2012-13 tax levy would bring the total levy up to $10.9 million. With state aid currently projected at $7,827,643; and using $1.5 million from the district’s fund balance, and $245,000 expected from other revenues; the district would have $20,468,182 in total revenue to budget with $262,350 more than the rollover budget.
But, in his projections for the following two years, Callagy sees greater challenges.
Based on those numbers, a rollover budget for 2013-14 would total $21,455,165.
A 2-percent increase in the tax levy would mean $11.1 million in total property taxes. Projecting $7,923,609 in state aid; and using $1 million from the district’s fund balance; $224,000 from other reserves; $245,000 from other revenues; and $300,000 from the yet-to-be-established debt-service reserves; Callagy estimates $20,806,059 in total revenue $649,107 less than the rollover budget.
Then, in the 2014-15 school year, Callagy estimates a rollover budget of $21,276,010.
A 2-percent increase in the tax levy would mean $11.3 million in total property taxes. Projecting $8,021,759 in state aid, and using $1 million from the district’s fund balance; $224,000 from other reserves; $245,000 from other revenues; and $150,000 from the debt-service reserves; Callagy estimated $20,976,478 in total revenues, or $299,532 less than the rollover budget.
Budgeting with zero
Callagy also provided estimates for what contingency budgets, with no tax-levy increases, would look like over the next three years.
Having no increase in the 2012-13 tax levy; and using the projected $7,827,643 in state aid; $1.5 million from the district’s fund balance, and $245,000 expected from other revenues; the district would have $20,254,544 in total revenue to budget with $48,712 more than the rollover budget.
But, in 2013-14, having no increase in the tax levy; and using the projected $7,923,609 in state aid; $1 million from the district’s fund balance; $224,000 from other reserves; $245,000 from other revenues; and $300,000 from the debt-service reserves; Callagy estimated $20,374,510 in total revenue $1,080,655 less than the rollover budget.
Then, in the 2014-15 school year, having no increase in the tax levy; and using the projected $8,021,759 in state aid; $1 million from the district’s fund balance; $224,000 from other reserves; $245,000 from other revenues; and $150,000 from the debt-service reserves; Callagy estimated $20,322,660 in total revenue $521,801 less than the rollover budget.
Board member Vasilios Lefkaditis questioned the near half-a-million jump between the projected deficits for the second and third years.
“It’s the debt payments, Vas, that we will have,” Callagy replied.
“You also applied less from our fund balance in 2013-14,” Lefkaditis said, looking over the numbers as Callagy spoke.
“What I’m doing is, I’m carrying the building aid,” Callagy said. “This year, we’re getting an extra half payment that we really should have received last year.”
District taxpayers will have their chance to weigh in on the process at this Tuesday’s forum.
[Return to Home Page]Mississippi's unemployment rate rose to worst in the nation at 7.9 percent in June, as the state's economic recovery lags behind others.
Gov. Phil Bryant, who has made economic development a central focus, acknowledged the poor figure but said Mississippi's economy has improved since he took office.
"It's not going as fast as I want it to either, but it looks a lot better than it did in December 2011," the first-term Republican said.
The state's unemployment rate rose from 7.7 percent in May, while falling from 8.7 percent a year ago. In January 2012, when Bryant was sworn in, the state's unemployment rate was 9.4 percent. The jobless rate decline since stems mostly from people leaving the labor force. by 400 to 1.12 million in June. Payrolls had risen in May to their highest point since the recession began, up 2 percent since Bryant took office. But Mississippi employers still report 3.5 percent fewer workers than in February 2008, the all-time high.
Both sets of figures — adjusted to cancel out seasonal changes — were released Friday by the U.S. Labor Department.
Economic forecasting firm IHS projects Mississippi won't surpass its previous peak payroll employment until 2016 or 2017, putting it among the slowest-recovering states.
Bryant attributed the slowness of Mississippi's recovery to a surplus of residents who aren't sufficiently educated or trained, which he said he was trying to change.
"I think a lot of them have dropped out of school, a lot of them are not properly trained for advanced manufacturing" Bryant said. "We haven't done as good a job as we should in training workers for the future."
Friday's report found 100,400 Mississippians were unemployed in June, up more than 2,000 from May but down from 112,000 in June 2013. The labor force fell in June, but the number of people who reported they had a job fell even faster, driving up the unemployment rate.
Rhode Island also had a 7.9 percent jobless rate in June, but its rate was slightly lower than Mississippi when calculations extend past one decimal place. North Dakota retained the lowest unemployment rate at 2.8 percent. Jobless rates fell in 22 states, rose in 14 and were flat in 14.
The national unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent in June from 6.3 percent in May. That's also lower than the 7.5 percent rate in June 2013.
Employment fell in Mississippi in sectors including trade, transportation and utilities; professional and business services; construction and manufacturing. Payrolls rose in education and health services, leisure and hospitality, financial activities and government.

Immaculately clean. Fast WiFi. Just be aware there is a lockout period from 10am until 4pm daily and a curfew of 11:00pm, whereby the common room will be locked. This is reflected in my average rating for atmosphere because, let's face it, it's a little hard to relax and mingle with other people when you need to be out all day and then tucked up in bed nice and early. It's a 20 min walk to town at best. My advice: take a torch if you're planning on being out at night. The road is not well lit.

"We are so excited to finally share the cast of Star Wars: Episode VII," Abrams said in a statement. "It is both thrilling and surreal to watch the beloved original cast and these brilliant new performers come together to bring this world to life, once again."
We'll get to the new performers in a sec, because the big news is that Hamill, Fisher and Ford are back, wriggling into their open-necked shirts – if not their gold bikinis – for the first time in more than 30 years. Joining them will be some other familiar faces, including Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) and Kenny Baker (R2-D2), a lineup solid enough to raise Jabba the Hutt's eyebrows (or the skin fold where his eyebrows would be.)
Met up with @HamillHimself in London today. I wonder why he's here. pic.twitter.com/zXpnxWaHyN— Peter Serafinowicz (@serafinowicz) April 27, 2014
The new faces (the ones who will have the lightsabers that say "Trainee" on the handle) are John Boyega, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, Daisy Ridley, Andy Serkis and Max von Sydow.
Speculation over the cast has persisted since, oh, the day this flick was announced. The buzz that Luke, Leia and Han would return was louder than the engines on the Millennium Falcon after the three were all spotted in London – where Episode VII will be filmed – over the weekend. "We start shooting in a couple of weeks and everyone is doing their best to make the fans proud," Abrams said. After seeing this cast, we already are.
Star Wars: Episode VII lands in theaters in December 2015.

Within a year, it would take over for an increasingly inadequate Albany Corporation which had governed the city since 1686. Although city-based, over the next two and a half years, the Albany Committee extended its authority and influence throughout Albany County and beyond.
Although some business was transacted during the latter half of 1774, the committee's first public meeting was held at Cartwright's Tavern on January 24, 1775. Abraham Yates, Jr. was unanimously elected chairman. Members
were named from each of the city's three
wards, from Rensselaerswyck, and from some of the other districts
of greater Albany County. Almost from the beginning, the Schenectady committee met separately but under the general county umbrella. Overall, a structure for extra-legal resistance
was created in the most populous county in the colony.
The next meeting seems to have taken place on March 1. By the end of the month, the committee had selected delegates to attend a Provincial Congress in New York City which in turn appointed delegates to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia.
Beginning in April, the committee met much more frequently. Its principal activities
concerned transmitting information on "the Rights and Liberties of
America" to the outlying districts, to New York, and beyond. By early
May, the committee was meeting in the Albany City
Hall. However, it also met at Widow Vernor's tavern.
As its function evolved in response to a deteoriated relationship between colonies and crown, the committee became the political arm of a growing revolutionary movement for huge Albany County. Its general direction was shaped by the enactments of the Continental and Provincial congresses. But its actual operations were left to the committment of American "patriots" on the local level. The committee was composed of delegates representing each of the county's seventeen diverse and far-flung districts. However, virtually all of its leaders were prominent patriots who resided in the city of Albany.
The colonial city council met increasingly infrequently during 1775 and not
after March 25, 1776. By June, Mayor
Cuyler was a prisoner of the revolutionaries. And by the eve of
Independence, the committee also assumed many of the municipal government's
civic responsibilities - albiet in a more passive way than the pre-war
common council.
From January 1775 to June 1778, the Albany committee met first at various taverns and then regularly at the Albany city hall. While the colonial city council met twice monthly to pass ordinances, issue deeds and patents, and conduct other city business, the Albany Committee of Correspondence represented much more intensive activity - often meeting twice daily to deal with more pressing issues relating to the war and its new political and economic implications. Its members were chosen by the people of the community without fussing over their voting qualifications. Elections were held twice a year but new members were added at different times in-between. Additional community members occasionally attended committee meetings. The composition of its membership and an examination of its activities help illustrate the scope of the political revolution on the local level.
Between 1775 and 1778, sixty-four different men represented the city on the Albany County Committee of Correspondence. Although some of these city people were middle-aged and some of them had served on the colonial common council, this was a new leadership group. With the passing of the community's traditional leaders of pre-war days, the withdrawl or removal of pro-British officials, and the call for upwardly mobile personages to serve beyond Albany, new men stepped forward to take part in public decision-making for the first time. They emerged from the struggle as Albany's new leaders. At the same time, most of the subcommittees and taskforces and virtually all the contractual services performed on behalf of the county committee were undertaken by city people rather than by those of the countryside - although out-of-Albany delegates constituted an overwhelming majority of the overall Albany County membership.
The Albany Committee meet for the last time on June 10, 1778. By that time, the city Corporation had resumed operations and was functioning much as it did before 1775. But in 1778, a board of Commissioners for Detecting Conspiracies had begun to identify and root out enemies of the Revolution in Albany city and county.
This overview is based on a long-term study of the committee's proceedings made possible by religious reading and study of its published minutes. In addition, Stefan Bielinski, Abraham Yates, Jr. and the New Political Order in Revolutionary New York (Albany, 1975), and the sources cited therein represent the most readable usages of the committee's minutes.
The minutes of the committee were kept by its secretary, young attorney Matthew Visscher. The manuscript minutes are said to have been purchased by the State from his descendants in 1848.

Francis Nicoll and Killiaen Van Rensselaer for the Manor of RensselaerswyckSECRETARY OF DEFENSE LEON E. PANETTA: How you doing? Good. All right. Are we ready?
(UNKNOWN): We're ready.
SEC. PANETTA: Okay. Let me just -- let me say a few words about the trip and then just open it up to your questions. (Laughter.) Maybe. (Laughter.).
This is my 18th international trip as secretary. And as many of you know, I visited more than 30 countries, including, obviously, the warzone a number of times, but I've made it a priority to -- as part of our defense strategy, as you know, to emphasize the importance of strengthening our alliances and partisanships throughout the world.
So the goal of this trip is really in line with that. It's to try to strengthen and reaffirm the transatlantic alliance, our relationship with NATO, to reflect on what we've accomplished over the last decade of war, and to also lay the groundwork for the future.
As always, I will also use this opportunity to visit the troops and have a chance to thank U.S. men and women in uniform for the sacrifices they're making. It's been since -- I think nearly three years since a secretary of defense traveled to European capitals to meet with leaders on a bilateral basis. And therefore, I thought it was important to be able to make this trip in order to follow up with our closest allies on a range of topics to obviously brief them on the Karzai visit and some of the discussions related to Afghanistan, talk about some of the common budget challenges that we are facing on both sides of the Atlantic, and how we -- how we can try to deal with those challenges in an innovative way, and also talk about some key bilateral security issues.
Our European allies, as all of you know, are the most capable and closest military partners that the United States has, bar none. And with Afghanistan and Libya, I think we've all seen how crucial that alliance can be in the 21st century.
On Afghanistan, let me note that the nations that I'm visiting have all maintained a strong commitment to that mission. And because of that commitment, we've been able to make significant progress in the effort to try to build an Afghanistan that can secure and govern itself.
As President Obama announced this spring, Afghans will take the lead for security responsibility, and our troops will shift to a support role. That's a significant milestone that is the result of the efforts of -- by the United States, by ISAF, and by the Afghans themselves.
We've had a successful series of consultations with President Karzai about our future commitment to Afghanistan's security, and I look forward to, as I said, updating our counterparts on those discussions.
Portugal, first stop will be Portugal. They are a key NATO ally, important strategic partner in the Mediterranean and beyond. I am told that I -- I'm the first secretary to visit Portugal in at least 30 years, so it's an indication that we do consider Portugal to be a close ally. The U.S. and the Portuguese militaries share a history of close cooperation, particularly in the Azores. And as you know, with the budget constraints that we're facing, there will be some reduced operations that we will have at Lajes, which is the air base there, and my goal is to tell them how we hope to broaden and transform our defense relationship through trying to increase mil-to-mil engagement and exercises and try to focus on the challenges that we all have, like maritime security.
Spain -- I go to Madrid after Lisbon, and both Portugal and Spain have maintained a strong commitment as I mentioned to Afghanistan. Actually, I think Spain has lost something like 90 individuals in -- in Afghanistan. So, you know, they've suffered a real price for their commitment to Afghanistan.
In my first trip to Europe as secretary, I announced the deployment of four Aegis ships to Rota. And the purpose of that is to fulfill our commitment to the European ballistic missile defense system. The deployment is important because it demonstrated how this alliance is making investments to meet the new challenges that we're confronting.
More broadly, Spain is an important leader in NATO and a vital ally to the United States, so in my discussions, I'll have an opportunity to touch on a full range of issues, including greater cooperation with Spain on cyber and the cyber arena.
Italy, next stop is Rome, and I guess it goes without saying that it has a lot of tremendous personal meaning for me, since I'm the son of Italian immigrants. The U.S.-Italian defense relationship is very deep and very enduring. And I am very grateful for the strong support that Italy has provided to U.S. troops that are stationed there. We've got some very important bases in Italy. They've been extremely important to our efforts throughout that region, and we are very grateful for their support. Those bases enhance our collective security of the alliance and are critical to our ability to be able to respond to any crisis in the region.
In Afghanistan, they're a lead nation in R.C. West. They've played a very important role in the ongoing transition in that region. And I'll have an opportunity again to pay tribute to the sacrifices that Italy has made over the last decade with a visit to their war memorial in Rome.
And lastly, the United Kingdom, I'll go to London for my first visit to Great Britain as secretary. Over the course of the last four years, I've seen in my past experience and in my experience as secretary how important the American and British intelligence and military relationship is. We've partnered very closely to confront every major security challenge facing our nations.
And it's in the spirit of that close relationship that Minister Hammond and I have built a very effective partnership, and I'm looking forward to be able to visit him on his home turf. My discussions will focus on how to meet the challenges and the transition in Afghanistan, in the Middle East, the challenges there in North Africa and how to enhance our cooperation so that we can meet those challenges at a time, again, of fiscal constraint.
Let me just say, in summary, you know, after 10 years of war, as I've pointed out, and with the budget constraints that we're all facing, we nevertheless continue to face some real uncertainties and threats in the world. We have to complete our mission in the war in Afghanistan. We continue to confront terrorism as a threat, Al Qaida as a threat to our security. And, you know, whether it's in Pakistan or Somalia or Yemen or Mali, we are confronting some common threats with regards to terrorism.
We continue to face the threat -- threats from North Korea and from Iran. We continue to face turmoil in the Middle East. And we continue to face the challenge of cyber and the cyber threat.
So the point is, we all face the reality of budget constraints. And I think the bottom line is, no one nation can confront these threats alone, that the only way we're going to be able to do it is by strengthening and reaffirming and building new partnerships and new alliances in the world.
The model for that is NATO. NATO is really the oldest alliance we have. It has responded in Afghanistan. It's responded in Libya. And it continues to be a very important model to build future partnerships and alliances.
NATO goes back to 1949. I think the reality is that, you know, there are generations that have been born since the fall of the Berlin Wall that may not fully appreciate how important NATO is as an alliance in the future. I guess one of my objectives is to kind of speak to younger generations there. The speech I'll give in London, as well as the discussions I'll have throughout the area, is to, again, re-emphasize -- particularly to younger generations -- how important it is to be able to pass the baton to them when it comes to the strength of these transatlantic alliances and partnerships that we have.
They are the model. The purpose of my trip is to make clear that we are going to need this alliance today, tomorrow and in the 21st century.
Okay.
MR. GEORGE LITTLE: Lita?
Q: Mr. Secretary, you mentioned Mali very briefly. Can you expand a little bit on the assistance that the U.S. is giving to the French in -- in Mali? And maybe just characterize a little bit for us what you think this conflict is going to look like, how great the threat is, and how well armed you think those rebels are there. How long of a conflict do you think this may be?
SEC. PANETTA: As I've mentioned in the past -- and I'll reaffirm that, you know, we --.
We've been very concerned about AQIM and their efforts to establish a very strong base in that area. We have been working with our regional partners to try to develop plans to confront that threat. I commend France for taking the steps that it has. And what we have -- have promised them is that we will work with them to cooperate with them and to provide whatever assistance we can to try to help them in that effort.
And we are engaged in those discussions. AFRICOM is discussing this with France, and we'll continue to work with them to ensure that ultimately we do stop AQIM and that the responsibility for assuring security in that region will be passed to the African nations to provide a more permanent security for the sake of the world.
Q: But how long do you see this -- how long do you see this going on? And can you be a little more specific about either intelligence gathering, other things that the U.S. is willing to do so far?
SEC. PANETTA: It's hard to estimate, you know, the timeframe here, because obviously, you know, the effort is to try to do what is necessary to -- to halt their advances and to try to secure some of the key cities in Mali. This is being done, as I said, in conjunction with other -- other nations, the other African nations. I know ECOWAS, the African group of nations, is going to be deploying a force there soon. And the hope is that ultimately they assume the responsibility to ensure security in Mali.
MR. LITTLE: Elisabeth?
Q: On that topic, can you talk about, have the French asked for anything in particular from the United States?
SEC. PANETTA: We are -- I've been in discussions with the minister of defense and will continue to have those discussions. And the effort there will be to provide, you know, some limited logistical support to them to provide logistical support and intelligence support where we can to assist them in that effort.
Q: Are you talking about tankers -- (off mic)
SEC. PANETTA: There will be some -- some areas of airlift where we will try to be able to assist them, as well.
MR. LITTLE: Julian?
Q: If -- if on the -- in the intelligence, are you thinking more satellite support or unmanned aerial vehicles? If you do provide drones, would they be armed? And is there a possibility that you could do strikes?
And then if you could also address, is AQIM a threat to the U.S. homeland at this point, or is it more of a regional threat? Or can you talk a little bit about what it does -- what --
SEC. PANETTA: I'm not -- I'm not going to get into the particulars of exactly the assistance we'll provide, other than to say we'll -- we will assist them in the intelligence arena..
MR. LITTLE: Greg?
Q: Mr. Secretary, you know, Mali's a long way away from pretty much everywhere. It's, you know, not very well developed. We don't have bases right nearby. But, you know, this -- this threat with AQIM in northern Mali, it sort of developed pretty quickly after the Libya war. And some people say that one -- I don't know if it was unforeseen, but one unintended consequence of the Libyan war is that this resulted in a big flow of weapons and fighters into northern Mali. And, of course, the guy who led the coup in Mali was a guy who'd been trained in the U.S. The Malian army had received a lot of training.
To what degree could this -- these developments with AQIM in northern Mali been prevented? Would that have been possible? Is this something the United States -- if they had taken some different steps months or years ago -- could have led to a different outcome?
SEC. PANETTA: You know, I think we've always -- going back to my last job as director of the CIA -- we were always very concerned about AQIM, as well as Al Qaida in these other areas, as I mentioned, Somalia and Yemen. And our concern was that I wasn't enough simply to go after the leadership of Al Qaida in the FATA, that it was important that we try to go after Al Qaida wherever they tried to establish a base of operations, and for that reason, I think we have always been concerned about Al Qaida not only in these other nations that I talked about, but in North Africa, as well.
I think -- I think it was -- it's understandable that, as we've confronted them in each of these other areas, that they were going to try to move and establish a base of operations wherever they could, and obviously with the turmoil in Mali, they found it convenient to be able to use that situation to gain some traction there.
I think that was probably going to happen under any circumstances, but the fact is that we've been watching it for a long time, we have been paying attention to it, we haven't ignored the fact that -- that they have made efforts to -- to locate there, and I think when they began offensive operations to actually take on some cities, it was clear to France and to all of us that that could not be allowed to -- to continue. And that's the reason France has engaged, and it's the reason that we're providing cooperation to them in that effort.
Q: (off mic) -- Libya, do you think it was a side result of the Libyan war, an unintended effect?
SEC. PANETTA: I think that -- that there's no question, as you confront them in Yemen, in Somalia, in Libya, that they're going to ultimately try to relocate. So, you know, there's -- you know, that certainly, I think, is a consequence. But the fact is, we have made a commitment that Al Qaida is not going to find any place to hide.
MR. LITTLE: Gopal?
Q: On Mali, are other countries in NATO also providing any support, France? I know U.K. is providing some airlift, but are you asking other countries to provide any support to the French mission, as well.
SEC. PANETTA: You know, I'm not aware of what other countries are providing to France at this point. I know -- I know what we've been asked to do and what we're trying to provide, but, you know, frankly, one of the discussions I'll have in Spain regards their concern about what's happening with AQIM in Mali, as well. And I'll get a better idea of what -- what these other countries may be doing to assist.
MR. LITTLE: Marcus?
Q: Mr. Secretary, you discussed the budget constraints that the U.S. and a lot of these European allies are facing. At the same time, to make up for these reduction in weapons purchases in the U.S., the U.S. has been promoting a lot of foreign weapons sales. To what extent are weapons sales going to be part of your discussions this week? And are there any systems in particular that you'll be promoting?
SEC. PANETTA: Yeah, I think, you know, one of the elements of our defense strategy that we laid out is that we have to maintain a presence in the rest of the world that even though we're going to -- you know, we're focusing on -- on the Pacific, on the Middle East, it's important for us to maintain a strong presence in Europe and Latin America and Africa and elsewhere.
And the main focus of that is to develop our rotational deployments, and it's also to develop the capabilities of these countries so that they can provide their own security.
So, yes, that does involve listening to what their needs are, seeing what kind of assistance we can provide, what kind of military assistance we can provide to be able to increase their capabilities within their own particular budget constraints, recognizing that. But I think -- I think, in each of these countries, there are elements of -- of military assistance that we can provide that I think will be helpful to them to be able to be effective partners in NATO.
MR. LITTLE: Got time for one or two.
Q: In the past, if I recall, you've talked about Somalia being sort of the model about handling some of these different conflicts against Al Qaida in Africa. Is that your view about the way to handle Mali? Or is that still your view about how to handle it? And also, is -- is this -- is this a NATO sort of operation? Or is -- in Mali? Or is it strictly bilateral French, U.S., and sort of multilateral amongst the countries?
SEC. PANETTA: Yeah, I think -- I think right now, it's -- I think right now, it could best be described as an international effort. Obviously, the U.N. has expressed serious concerns about AQIM and Mali. And I think the -- the effort is largely focused now on those nations that have had a relationship with that part of the world and are trying to ensure that it does not become a base of operations for Al Qaida. So the larger focus is on the African nations that border on Mali, as well as countries like France that have a historic relationship to that arena.
MR. LITTLE: I think that's -- one more, Joan.
Q: Secretary Panetta, were you in any way surprised when Great Britain announced their drawdown decision at the end of last year? As it sort of came to a surprise to many that they would do this out of step, it seemed, with the -- with the U.S. and with a NATO decision. And in regards to the recent visit by President Karzai to the U.S., in discussions with your U.K. counterparts, are you going to make them aware of any thoughts coming from the Department of Defense on post-2014 troop numbers in Afghanistan?
MR. LITTLE: (off mic)
SEC. PANETTA: Actually, we had been given a heads-up that they would be making that announcement. And in many ways, you know, I think the numbers that -- that the British are talking about in some ways complement what the United States will ultimately do by the end of 2014, as well. So I think we -- we understand, you know, the path that they're taking. But I think they also agree that it is -- it is very important, as we make this transition to an Afghan lead, that we continue to provide support to ensure that the Afghans have the training, have the capabilities to do counterterrorism and have the enabling capability so that they can -- they can provide the security that's necessary.
I'm confident that Britain -- Great Britain shares that fundamental goal that we have -- you know, that this is a -- this is a long-term relationship. It's not one that, you know, is going to involve simply picking up and leaving at the end of 2014. It's going to be a long-term relationship to ensure that Afghanistan can continue to maintain their security.
Q: Just to follow up on my question --
MR. LITTLE: Okay, Elisabeth, one -- this is it, for real.
Q: Okay. You wouldn't talk about drones. Can --
SEC. PANETTA: (off mic) (Laughter.)
Q: Well, I actually -- well, let me -- before I do that, let me ask --
MR. LITTLE: One follow-up. (Laughter.)
Q: -- you said you wouldn't talk about drones, but you'd talk about logistics and air support. Can you just be more specific, what that means?
SEC. PANETTA: You know, again, I don't want to go into all of the particulars. It suffices to say that we're -- you know, it's basically kind of in three areas that we're looking at. One is to obviously provide limited logistical support, two, to provide intelligence support, and, three, to provide some airlift capability, as well.
Q: What does that mean?
MR. LITTLE: I think the secretary answered --
Q: Okay -- (off mic)
MR. LITTLE: All right. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate it.
Q: (off mic) -- transport planes -- (off mic)
MR. LITTLE: All right. Thanks, everyone.
Q: What'd you think of "Zero Dark Thirty"?
SEC. PANETTA: You know what? I lived it.Glastonbury Festival 2000

Police files detail alleged crack video extortion
Rob Ford's friend Sandro Lisi threatened to put "heat" on the Dixon Road community in the immediate aftermath of the crack cocaine video scandal, the final batch of court documents related to search warrants issued in Project Brazen 2, the police investigation into Ford, say.
"The whole place is going to get heated up all summer until that fucking phone gets back, the whole place... is going to get lit right up," Lisi was heard telling Liban Siyad, an alleged member of the Dixon City Bloods, in a wiretapped conversation. "Put the message out to your people... that whole place is going to get heated."
Lisi has since been charged with extortion in the case. Earlier today, the Toronto Star reported that the Ontario Provincial Police, who recently took an oversight role in the case, disagree with Toronto police over who was the victim of the alleged extortion: Mohammed Siad, who claimed to have filmed the video, or Rob Ford.
There are also allegations in the documents ordered released today by a Toronto judge that Lisi suggested Ford had power over the police in the area.
In another intercepted conversation, Elena Basso, the owner of the house where the crack video was allegedly filmed, said Mohammed Siad was stupid for filming Ford and ruining the business on Dixon Road. "The fucking goof did it [filmed Ford] at my house," she said.
Basso said she warned the Dixon Road dealers about the mayor.
"I told you guys from the beginning, he's a big fucking idiot."
Despite the endless eye-popping allegations against the mayor, it appears the OPP don't believe there is enough evidence at this time to charge Ford with a crime. The CBC says the case is in a "holding pattern" pending new details.
None of the allegations have been proven in court.

Mayor Rob Ford, Councillor Doug Ford and Councillor Mike Del Grande all voted AGAINST the deal.
New campaign slogan for Rob: "I'm gonna done you guys!"
Or maybe "You're fucking dead and everybody on your block is dead!"
So hard to choose.
All of the quotes I'm the article are from Lisi and Basso. YAWN.
"I told you guys from the beginning, he's a big fucking idiot."
HUGE WIN FOR THE CITY! Council Voted 39-3.
Kiss my glorious ass, you POS--in a year you'll be laughed out of our city.
In any case, welcome to the blogTO comments jungle, Mr. Kimmel. Big fan of your show.
Keep watching though we've got alot of great guests coming up.
In many cultures and countries its the norm to have multi generational homes and everyone contributes, spends more time together and everyone can work on their successes.
Here for many years its a status symbol to have the big house and nice car whether you can actually afford it or not AND what's this Grandpa and Grandma can no longer survive on their own, well I don't want them cramping my lifestyle let's put them in a home where we can visit them 6 times a year when its convenient for us.
Maybe it's time you saved some money dude and gave your parents a break by LEAVING???

I TOLD YOU SO!
Gary Giroux, I'm disappointed in you. How could you be so deliberately blind? Guess you're not as good as I thought you were. Don't sweat it. I'm used to being disappointed by the TPS. Just wondering now how solid the evidence is in other cases which have crossed your desk. Let this one go. You are so way off. Who the heck have you been listening to? I told you to be careful, because these people will wrap your head around a poll if you choose to believe their lies. Let it go.Barra, Mario and Cassinese, Antonio and D'Angelo, Pasquale and Carella, Antonio and Roviello, Antonio (2007) Direct current and alternating current electrical transport properties of regioregular poly[3-(4-alkoxyphenyl)-thiophenes]. [Pubblicazione in rivista scientifica]Full text not available from this repository.
Abstract
In this paper, the d.c. and a.c. (ac) elec. transport properties of doped and undoped regioregular poly[3-(4-alkoxyphenyl)-thiophenes], where the alkoxy groups are O-(CH2)n-1CH3 with n = 1,4,6, and 8, have been investigated. The films have been synthesized by an exptl. procedure based on the oxidn. of 3-(4-alkoxyphenyl)-thiophenes with mol. oxygen in presence of VO(acac)2, as the catalyst. Unlike other examples reported in the literature, this approach allows obtaining well structured spin-coated films without the necessity of further processes, such as annealing or exposition to solvent vapors. D.c.-voltage measurements, performed in planar and transverse configuration on 1 m thick films, show both ohmic and space charge limited current behavior, at low and high applied fields, resp. Due to the film ordered structure, a significant elec. anisotropy was found. In order to deeply investigate the basic conduction mechanisms, ac measurements have been also carried out in the frequency range between 100 Hz and 100 kHz. Finally, d.c. and a.c. cond. temp. dependence is discussed in the framework of thermally activated hopping and tunneling models.- Returns

- The BEST for your hands... Review by DBK
- My husband and I both have extremely dry hands in the winter time, and this is the only product we have found that works without making our hands greasy and grimy feeling. It's light, fragrance-free, and makes your hands feel totally soft and moisturized. (Posted on 4/6/15)
- The best hand lotion on the market! Review by Katzenjammerz
- The Quince Hand Lotion is the only product that has ever cleared my stress eczema, and also helped my hands through a Minnesota winter! (Posted on 2/25/15)
- Cannot live without it! Review by Beth
- Hands down one of the best hand creams you could use in those cold months. It 's fast absorbing, not greasy and has a light scent. I love that I can use it while I am driving and throw my hands right back onto the wheel because it absorbs THAT FAST!
(Posted on 11/3/14)
- Great product Review by Sally
- Fantastic product for dry SENSITIVE skin. Works great! (Posted on 7/2/13)
- Better Than a Prescription Review by illbbax
- 8 years ago, I took a position up north while I was living in Tampa, Florida. The skin on my hands would crack in the dry, cold winters of Dayton, Ohio.
I was close to going to a dermatologist for help; then a friend of mine was doing some Christmas shopping and I went along. She went to an apothecary and I asked if there was something I could put on my hands as a man, that would not have an un-masculine scent.
I was directed to the Quince Hand Lotion #007 and have used it religiously ever since. I am a believer in this product. Anyone who complains about the price, doesn't realize how long lasting the tube is, how well it works, and how much a comparable product would cost from a pharmaceutical company prescribed by a doctor or pharmacist.
If you're working on those new rigs in the Dakotas, try it, you'll love it. (Posted on 3/31/13)
- Only thing that work Review by Producer Bill

- GREAT Review by butterfly6801
- I love this for hands, but even more than that I love it for my elbows. It keeps my elbows so soft, I have been out of it for about a month and my elbows really miss it. I can't wait until it's back in stock!!!!! (Posted on 1/16/13)
- Favorite lotion ever Review by Sam
- This is absolutely my favorite hand lotion ever, for two key reasons. First, it's silky and moisturizes really well, but unlike other effective moisturizers, it's not heavy or greasy. Most hand lotions either feel super-slippery or make your hands feel dirty afterwards because they're so heavy. This hits the Goldilocks zone.
Second, it has a fresh citrus-y smell that gives you a pick me up and then GOES AWAY. I'm not a huge scent person so don't like heavy, perfumed hand lotions that stay with you for ages. This is just enough to give a nice whiff of a refreshing scent while you're rubbing it in and then you can go back to your day.
So really, it's perfect. I actually go on and on about this lotion so much that once I was in the NY store at the counter and a woman behind me picked it up to look at it, and I started telling her how great it was until she decided to buy it. Because I had basically just sold a bottle of lotion, the sales lady who was ringing me up slyly put extra samples in my bag. So great lotion AND great store! (Posted on 6/1/12)

#1
Posted 22 February 2009 - 11:05 AM
Just got my CGEM from Astronomics...went to put my C11 on it and found out the rails do not fit. The dovetail does not seem to be deep enough to fit into the mounts saddle. So....someone please tell me where to get a proper dovetail so I can use this beautiful mount.

That said there are a some variables, unfortunately some vendors have machined dovetail rail/plates (the bigger D compatible ones are often called plates instead of a rail) in sizes that can be a problem in other vendor's saddles. Generally you won't go wrong with a "real" Losmandy D plate or one from a good quality vendor such as ADM.
What is on your C11? Something in the back of my mind reminds me that there was something "funny about the saddle on LXD650s ... but I'm not certain about that. I no longer know anyone who has one that I can check with.

Can you provide us with a picture of your current C11 rail and how it attaches to the LXD650?
It turns out that there are a variety of ways to attach a scope to an LXD650, and most likely as Dave is assuming is that your C11 has a vixen compatible rail on it (a vixen compatible rail is 1.75" wide at it's widest point). If this is true then you have a few options.
Add a vixen compatible adapter to your CGEM ... as Dave mentioned Scopestuff has an nice SS_TV2 adapter for $89, ADM has a LOS-VIX for $99.
The other approach that I was suggesting in my earlier post is to replace your existing rail (whatever it is) with a Losmandy D plate (Losmandy DC11) which is available for $95-100.
The adapters won't require any extra work (if your existing rail is really a vixen compatible one) and are a few dollars cheaper. The new plate will be more solid and will put the scope a bit closer to the mount (less counterweight required).
Personally I think a vixen rail on a C11 is ok for visual work but doesn't make sense for imaging, especially if you're going to piggyback a refractor on the C11 as well ... it's just not stiff enough to prevent any flexing with all that weight on it. The larger Losmandy D plates will support quite a bit more weight without any flexing.

Thanks for clearing that part up ... there's obviously no need for any rail/plate 101 discussion.
So your Losmandy D plate doesn't fit well in the stock CGEM saddle ... hmmmm, this is interesting. All the initial reports on the CGEM were that the saddle looked and measured like any other Losmandy D compatible saddle. For comparison the existing CGE (not CGEM) saddle works fine with the Losmandy D plates.
Any chance of a picture of the miss match with your setup?
I do know that Celestron CGE rails and Losmandy D plates are slightly different, the sides of the CGE rail are indeed a bit "deeper". The CGE rail also tends to fit slightly loosely in real Losmandy D saddles but that the ADM D saddles by the nature of their design have enough latitude to handle this, so perhaps the CGE rail is also going to be the one that fits the best in the CGEM's saddle.
It is likely that the quickest fix for you is to use the real orange Celestron CGE rail (they are one piece with no radius blocks) for your C11.

Is the whole angled side of the dovetail in contact with the angled side of the saddle?
Is the lower area of the plate (where the holes are in your picture ... just above the angle side of the dovetail) in contact with the topside of the saddle?
If yes to both questions then I think you are fine. Yes that's a pretty big gap under the plate but some gap is not unusual and if the whole angled side of the dovetail is in good contact (on both sides) with the saddle then that is the most holding power the saddle can exert on the dovetail. The dovetail plate resting on the bottom of the saddle doesn't provide any holding power.
Sure having a dovetail that is in contact with the whole saddle side plate would provide more piece of mind but I don't think it would be any more solid. You will have to ensure that the dovetail is properly seated in the saddle before tightening it down and moving the mount but I don't think that is any different than anyone else with a big scope and a Losmandy D plate.
This picture is my C11 with it's Losmandy DC11 mounted on a CGE saddle. The sides of the dovetail and the saddle line up well but there is a gap under the plate ... in my case it's just a bit more than 1/16".

Obvious poor assumption that you had a CG5 dovetail rail as so many C11s are sold with this rail. Frankly I am very surprised and would have never guessed you were using a Losmandy d series dovetail. I have always understood the conventional widom to be that the Losmnady and CGE dovetails are 100% compatible. So much for conventional wisdom.
I'm still very confused.
I totally agree with the previous post that on a C11, a CGE or Losmandy dovetail fit right to the saddle would be far more secure than an adapter. On my lighter tubes that all have CG5 type rails including the F8 6" achro the adapter works OK, but this is certainly a totally different problem, and one I would have never anticipated. Keep us posted on your solution, and good luck.

I think I'd experiment with the D plate and CGEM saddle and see where the saddle would "let go" of the plate. See just how much the saddle has to open before the plate can slip out. That may help your piece of mind. If it's close and you're still uncomfortable with the setup then I think the CGE plate in place of the Losmandy plate will be the way to go. Either that or replace the CGEM saddle but I don't think that is an option from any vendor ... yet.

Not to be too critical, but should Celestron sell this mount without a mounting plate or rail? Do they expect us to make one ourself? That is a pretty important part for them not to supply. Borderline rediculous to me.
The mount manufacturer has no idea what type of optical tube will be installed - and thus no idea of the kind of dovetail rail (length? radius blocks? flats for rings?) the user will need. Takahashi and Astro-Physics don't provide rails (or even saddles) for this reason but nobody seems to complain. It'd make more sense to blame those OTA manufacturers who don't provide a rail of letting the customer down - but, of course, there are two very common dovetail sizes and the OTA manufacturer doesn't know which you'll need for your mount.
Whatever type of rail is required for a given optical tube, it is readily available from the usual sources - primarily Losmandy and ADM. By the way - Losmandy doesn't include a rail with their mounts, either.

Personal preference. The rail that comes with the OTA that actually comes with a CGEM in the kit is different from the d style. It is indeed a little deeper and fits better.

People Directory > George JohnsonWAILUKU - Mayor Alan Arakawa and officials from Maui's visitor and business sectors said Friday that their recent trip to Japan and South Korea has resulted in some positive initiatives that could help the county's economy and technology sector grow.
Doug McLeod, Maui County's energy commissioner, said at a news conference Friday that the county will be in discussions with Hitachi regarding renewable energy off-grid possibilities, along with smart-grid technology and buses that can run on electric power.
McLeod was one of five county officials who made the South Korea and Japan trip Aug. 19 to Sept. 2. Council Members Elle Cochran and Joe Pontanilla also made the trip.
Officials from Maui Economic Development Board, Maui Visitors Bureau, Hotel Wailea and the University of Hawaii College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) also joined the entourage and paid their own way, the county said.
Harold Keyser of CTAHR said that following the trip and after meeting with South Korean importers, two South Korean businesses will come to Maui to meet with Maui product producers.
He added that a South Korean shopping website also is interested in posting a section on its website just for Maui products, which could include travel tours to Maui.

Launched by the previous administration with the help of 600 mega-companies, planning for this NAFTA-on-steroids pact has been surrounded by secrecy from both the public and Congress.
Even Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the chairman of the congressional committee with oversight of these deals, has been denied access to the proposals. Why? Well, only two of TPP’s 26 chapters have to do with actual trade. Most are devoted to new corporate privileges and rigid constraints on governments’ regulations and consumer protections in the areas of drug monopolies, shipping jobs overseas, natural resources, financial “services,” land use, food and product safety, energy and tax policies, Internet freedom, and invasions of domestic policy.
Corporations and investors will rise to equal status with sovereign countries, and disputes will be settled in closed-door foreign tribunals. A leveling of policies will ensue so that we’re just like Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, Peru and other members.
Notice how past “free trade” deals have edged us toward a Third World economy? The TPP will hugely advance a global corporate take-over of our national prerogatives and natural choices.
The U.S. Trade Representative’s Office would like to get this done before the election. I believe it wouldn’t have a chance if people knew what’s in it.
Rep. Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, is right to point out big problems with the TPP, and he deserves kudos for his support for Maine’s — and America’s — last sports shoe manufacturer left standing.
The fact that McCabe’s presence at the Virginia TPP meeting on Sunday was upgraded to delivering a presentation is encouraging for Maine jobs.

Former WBO junior lightweight champion Adrien “The Problem” Broner, who relinquished his belt on the scales, stopped number one challenger Vicente “Chente” Escobedo in five rounds at the U.S. Bank Arena in Cincinnati, Ohio. After Broner (24-0, 20 KOs) weighed in 3 1/2 pounds above 130-pound limit last night, the fight was placed in jeopardy. A second agreement was reached for Broner to hit the scales this morning. Broner weighted in at 143 pounds, 3 pounds above the renegotiated weight (140 pounds). The fighters behavior was not exactly professional. After a dramatic few hours, Escobedo’s purse was sweetened (reportedly to the tune of fifty percent).
The fight was back on. At the bell to begin the contest, the strength advantage for Broner was apparent. The fighters met in center of the ring and exchanged jabs. Broner ripped off a combination to Escobedo’s body. Escobedo, 30, from Woodland, Ca, connected with a jab that made Broner smile. Broner countered with a left hook. Broner landed another hard combination at the bell. Escobedo, 30, came out quicker in round two. His jab was occasionally connecting, but his right drew air. Broner kept to his game plan of working the body of Escobedo with jabs and right hands. When in close he’d unleash a wicked uppercut. Near the end of the round, Escobedo appeared hurt from another heavy combination. Escobedo countered with a right at the bell. In round three Escobedo continued to jab. Broner’s tight defense was making it virtually impossible for Escobedo to land anything of significance. Holding his left shoulder high, like his idol Floyd Mayweather, Broner blocked Escobedo’s punches and countered back with powerful hooks. Broner was growing stronger as Escobedo backed up. Broner’s left to the side hurt Escobedo. The gutsy Escobedo was determined to be more active in round four. He tried to use the ring and box. Broner, 22, ignored whatever Escobedo did. His much heavier punches were thudding off Escobedo’s body. A big Broner left hook bloodied (and maybe broke) Escobedo’s nose. Broner stepped in to take advantage and just missed a huge uppercut. Broner strutted back to his corner like a man who knew the fight was in the bag. “The Problem” was right. Escobedo, with blood seeping from his nose and a cut near his left eye was being broken down mentally physically. Broner unloaded an uppercut that knocked Escobedo into the ropes. He followed up that onslaught with three straight body shots. Escobedo stumbled and felt another hard right to the head - prompting trainer Joel Diaz to throw in the towel. The time 2:42 seconds of round five. “You been watching Adrien Broner fight for a long time,” Broner said in the ring after faking out everyone (including his girlfriend) with a fake marriage proposal. “That’s that. I’m moving up to lightweight.” Escobedo was gracious after the bout. “He talks and he backs it up. He was quicker and faster,” Escobedo said. “He’s got power.” Heavy handed prospect Keith Thurman (18-0, 17 KOs) stopped journeymen Orlando Lora (28-3, 19 KOs) in round six of a scheduled 10-rounder. The bout was never in question. Thurman, 23, controlled the action with speed and power. In round six, Thurman’s check left hook staggered Lora. Thurman added a right hand that floored Lora. The veteran pulled himself up but indicated to his corner that he had had enough. The referee wavered off the contest. The time was 1:36 seconds.

An amniocentesis is a procedure that allows a small amount of the fluid around the developing baby (amniotic fluid) to be collected. This fluid contains cells from the baby that can be tested for some types of birth defects.
Contents
Amniocentesis (amnio) is one of a number of tests that can be used to detect birth defects in pregnancy.
There are many things to consider before choosing whether or not to have a test in pregnancy. You may choose to have a test because you want to be reassured that your baby is likely to be healthy, prepare for a baby with medical problems or have the option not to continue with the pregnancy if there is a serious medical problem.
It is up to you and your partner to choose whether to have an amniocentesis. You can discuss any questions or concerns about the test further with your doctor or midwife.
An amniocentesis may be offered when there is an increased risk that the baby may have a chromosome problem or other type of birth defect.
Some of the most common reasons include:
Amniocentesis is an outpatient procedure performed by a speciallytrained doctor. No special preparation is needed. It takes about 30 minutes.
Most of this time is spent having an ultrasound and preparing equipment. The collection of the sample takes about a minute.
Your partner or support person is encouraged to attend. It is best that children do not attend.
(Click on image to enlarge)
It is estimated that about 1 woman in every 200 women will miscarry as a result of having an amniocentesis. In other words 0.5% of all the women who have this test will suffer a miscarriage.
The most common test done on an amniocentesis sample is a chromosome test..
If the test shows that your baby has a problem, a medical specialist will talk to you about what this is likely to mean for the baby and what treatments or options are available to.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is another test that allows a baby’s chromosomes to be tested accurately. This test can be done earlier in the pregnancy (10-11 weeks). Please read the topic on CVS for further information about the difference between these tests. It is usual to choose either a CVS or an amniocentesis, not both.
FISH is a rapid method for counting the number of certain chromosomes within cells. It can be used on an amniocentesis sample to get a faster result. It is always followed by the usual chromosome test. A normal FISH test is about 98% accurate in predicting that a baby will have a normal chromosome result.
FISH is only offered in special circumstances that you can discuss with your doctor, or by payment of a non medicare-rebatable fee.

The CNI was set up by Dr Waheed to investigate the controversial circumstances that brought him to power, amid widespread allegations that his successor was forced to resign in an opposition backed coup, aided by rogue police and military officials.
However, Nasheed’s Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) – and subsequently the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) – challenged the credibility of the three member panel appointed by Dr Waheed, and pressured the government into accepting a nominee from Nasheed and a retired foreign judge to serve as co-chair of the CNI. Commonwealth and the United Nations will each provide an expert adviser for support to the commission as well.
Last week the government announced it had accepted the 13th nominee proposed by Nasheed, Ahmed ‘Gahaa’ Saeed.
Speaking to the reporters today, Dr Waheed said, “We are hoping by 15 of this month commission members will be completed.”
“I think new members will have the opportunity to look into previous works of the commission and come up with some ideas on how to proceed with the investigation,” he said, speaking to the reporters after arriving from a trip to London to participate in the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations with other Commonwealth leaders.
Nearly 200 supporters and government officials gathered near the jetty to welcome the President.
During the visit, President Waheed met with British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, William Hague, and Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma, and discussed about the progress of the investigations.
“Everyone wants peace and stability in the Maldives. We expressed our commitment to cooperate with all parties,” President contended.
However, last week’s abrupt release of CNI timeline on the events of February 7, followed by a contradictory report published by two senior MDP members on the same events, has caused additional challenges to the stalled political mediation process.
In May, CNI had announced that it had ceased its work to accommodate changes to its composition, but on Thursday released the time line asking for public opinion.
“It is unacceptable that a committee that has been discredited by the civil society, members of the public and the international community should proceed to make public its findings, ahead of the commencement of the work of a restructured commission,” said MDP’s Spokesperson Hamid Abdul Ghafoor, in a statement on Thursday.
“It is incomplete, biased and reveals the malicious intent of the Commission,” he said, adding that neither former President Nasheed nor any MDP member had given testimony to the commission before it released its findings.
The government meanwhile described the MDP’s report (Dhivehi) as an “act of terrorism”.
CNI’s Timeline findings were gathered by the three member panel which include Chair Ismail Shafeeu, Defence Minister under former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Dr Ibrahim Yasir and Dr Ali Fawaz Shareef.
MDP has repeatedly called for Shafeeu to be removed, citing his connection to Gayoom, leader of government alligned Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM).
However, DrWaheed today confirmed he has no intention of changing Shafeeu or two other members during the scheduled reformation.

Brown University Presidency
In 1764, Manning was sent by the Philadelphia Baptist Association to found a college in Rhode Island, the cradle of American Baptists. Along with Ezra Stiles, pastor of the Second Congregational Church in Newport, who attempted give the Congregationalists control of the college. When the Baptists saw what Stiles had done, the draft was withdrawn and rewritten to give the Baptists control. As punishment,the Congregationalist seats on the board of trustees were reduced to fewer than. Manning's nephew Stephen Gano became pastor in 1792.
Brown University's Encyclopedia Brunoniana offers a more detailed biography of Manning tradtions and a sense of community and global responsibility."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manning, James
James Manning (1738-1791), first president of Brown University, was born October 22, 1738 in Piscataway, New Jersey, the son of James and Grace (Fitz-Randolph) Manning. He studied at the Latin Grammar School conducted by Isaac Eaton in Hopewell, New Jersey, and graduated second in a class of 21 from the College of New Jersey (Princeton University) in 1762. He was licensed to preach by the Scotch Plains Baptist Church, February 6, 1763, and ordained April 19, 1763. He married Margaret Stites on March 23, 1763. That same year he was sent by the Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches to Rhode Island for the purpose of establishing a college to be principally under the direction of the Baptists. The college was chartered March 3, 1764. In April 1764 Manning opened a Latin school in Warren, Rhode Island, and became the first pastor of the Warren Baptist Church founded in November 1764. In September 1765 he was elected the first president of Rhode Island College. Manning was the only professor until 1767, when the increase in students presented a need for an additional instructor. David Howell, a graduate of the College of New Jersey was engaged as a tutor and was appointed professor of natural philosophy in 1769. In September 1769 the first Commencement was held. Seven students received the degree of Bachelor of Arts and 21 honorary degrees were awarded. On the evening of Commencement the Corporation appointed a committee to select and buy a site for the College and to solicit subscriptions. A lively competition arose, as the inhabitants of East Greenwich, Newport and Providence vied for the location of the college in their towns. When the final decision rested between Newport and Providence, depending on which raised the higher subscription of funds, Manning himself favored Providence and entered into the contest by writing an “anonymous” letter to Nicholas Brown, in which he outlined a strategy by which the fact that the Browns could build the edifice themselves at less cost in Providence could be taken into account in calculating the amount of the subscriptions. The College Edifice was built in Providence in 1770, and Manning moved to Providence and lived in Benjamin Bowen’s house while the president’s house was being built. The Revolutionary War soon interrupted the life of the College, when the Edifice was taken over from December 7, 1776 to May 27, 1782, and used as barracks and as a hospital by American and French troops, and left in dilapidated condition. The war left Rhode Island short of food, as a large part of the state was in the hands of the enemy and provisions could not by law be brought from another state. Manning was commissioned to visit Connecticut and confer with the government on this matter, after which the restrictions were removed and contributions of money and provisions were sent to Rhode Island..”
When the war was over, the College reopened, poor, with few students and a damaged building. David Howell had resigned as professor in 1779, leaving the College with no faculty other than the president. A subscription was begun to raise funds for the repair of the Edifice. Asher Robbins, a graduate of Yale, was appointed as tutor. In 1783 John Brown offered to pay half the price of a “compleat Philosophical Apparatus & Library,” and the other half was quickly raised. In 1784 two professors were appointed, Joseph Brown as professor of experimental philosophy, and Benjamin Waterhouse as professor of natural history, both of whom “engaged to give Lectures in their respective Branches, without any Expence to the College while destitute of an Endowment.” A Commencement was held in 1783 for six graduates, who had been students before the war or had studied privately with Manning, but it was not until 1786 that more students were ready for graduation. The number of students increased steadily from twenty in 1784 to fifty in 1786.
In 1786 Manning was appointed by a unanimous resolution of the General Assembly to represent Rhode Island in the Congress of the Confederation. At first he tried to decline but, on the advice of Corporation members who were men of high political standing, he left the College under the care of Perez Fobes as vice-president, and took his seat. He explained his reasons for accepting the appointment in a letter to Reverend John Rippon in England on April 7, 1786, “Pray, don’t be alarmed should you hear that I am in Congress. The motive of my accepting this most unexpected, unsolicited, but unanimous appointment of the State to that office, was the recovery of a considerable sum due to the College, for the use taken of the Edifice, and the damage done to it by the public during the late war.” The years after the war were difficult for Manning, and he thought seriously of leaving Providence. On November 12, 1785 he wrote to Reverend Samuel Jones, who was establishing a school in Kent, before the next Commencement: My feelings have long since prognosticated that I shall not spend all the remnant of my days in Providence, unless they are few indeed.”
He had not been paid his salary as delegate to the Congress and could not obtain payment in good money. He wrote to Hezekiah Smith about the sad state of his affairs on January 18, 1787:
“At the last session I petitioned them to pay my advances, and the remainder of my salary as delegate, amounting to upwards of four hundred dollars. This they offered to do in their paper, but in no other way. ... A more infamous set of men under the character of a legislature, never, I believe, disgraced the annals of the world. And there is no prospect of a change for the better. Of all the arrearages of tuition for the last year, and the quarter advanced in this, I have not received ten pounds. I was taken sick the day after the second great snow, with no provisions in the cellar except one hundred-weight of cheese, two barrels of cider, and some potatoes; with not a load of wood at my door; nor could I command a single dollar to supply these wants. The kindness of my neighbors, however, kept me from suffering. But when a man has hardly earned money, to be reduced to this abject state of dependence requires the exercise of more grace than I can boast of. ... I have serious thought of removing to the farm at the Jerseys, and undertake digging for my support. Should things wear the same unfavorable aspect next year, I believe I shall make the experiment, if my life is spared.”
Added to his financial distress was unpleasantness at the College. He had expelled two students, one of whom had connections with powerful local families, who, advised and assisted by David Howell, had appealed to the Corporation. On July 23, 1787, he wrote to Samuel Jones,
“The College Horizen, to me, is cloudy at Providence, but what will be the final result God only knows. I expect some trying scenes between this & Commencement. ... John Brown .... ... It is the opinion of many that he wishes to displace me from the College. This I believe is the truth; but it not so agreeable to be pushed out.”
Manning did, in fact, spend the rest of his days as president of the College. On July 24, 1791 he was seized by a fit of apoplexy while at prayers in his home and died on July 29, 1791. His funeral on the following day was reported by the Providence Gazette to have been “the most numerous and respectable even attended in town.” He was laid to rest in the North Burying Ground, next to Nicholas Brown, who had died a few months earlier.
A footnote in Reuben Guild’s Early History of Brown University, including the Life, Times, and Correspondence of President Manning, published in 1897, contains this interesting commentary on Manning’s appearance:
“In his youth, says Judge Howell, who knew him well, he was remarkable for his dexterity in athletic exercises, for the symmetry of his body, and gracefulness of his person. Had he lived in our day he could easily have been captain of a base-ball nine or of a foot-ball club. In his maturer years he weighed upwards of three hundred pounds. Concerning his bulk the Hon. Wm. Hunter, one of his pupils, thus writes: – ‘His motions and gestures were so easy and graceful, that ordinary observers thought not of his immense volume of flesh, and those who critised, admired the manner in which it spontaneously wielded.’”
Professor Goddard attested to Manning’s physical prowess, “He sometimes made his own stone wall; and in the use of a scythe, he acknowledged no superior among the best trained laborers in the meadow.” For his wall building services, the Corporation records note that on September 3, 1777, “President Manning laid before the Corporation an Accompt for making thirty two Rods of Stone wall on the College Land.” Manning’s own description of his life as president of the college and pastor of the First Baptist Church was reported thus by Benjamin Waterhouse:
“I shall never forget what Dr. Manning, in great good humor, told men were among his trying ‘experiences.’. ‘I made,’ said Dr. Manning, ‘my own garden and took care of it repaired my dilapidated walls; went nearly every day to market; preached twice a week, and sometimes oftener; attended, by solicitation, the funeral of every baby that died in Providence, visited the sick of my own Society, and, not unfrequently, the sick of other Societies; made numerous parochial visits, the poorest people exacting the longest, and, in case of any seeming neglect, finding fault the most.‘”
He also at times took boarders, among them two sons of Robert Carter of Nomony Hall in Virginia, who wrote to Manning in February 1786 of George and John Tasker Carter, “they to be Sent from Boston immediately upon their Arrival there to your College in Providence. I beg leave to appoint you their Foster Father intimating that my desire is that both my Said Sons shd. be active Characters in Life ... The prevailing Notion now is, to Continue the most abject State of Slavery in this Common-Wealth – On this Consideration only, I do not intend that these my two Sons shall return to this State till each of them arrive to the Age of 21 years.”
There were 165 graduates of the College during Manning’s administration. Of these, 43 were clergymen, 29 lawyers, 19 physicians, 19 teachers, 12 judges, 12 business men, 6 professors, 6 congressmen, 2 college presidents, 2 United States ministers, 1 United States consul, 1 governor, and 1 librarian. Of the 43 clergymen, it should be noted, the majority were not Baptists, as might have been expected. Twenty-six were Congregationalist, twelve Baptist, one Episcopal, one Unitarian, and three of unknown denomination.

President’s Cancer Panel Identifies Urgent Need for Better Understanding of Diverse Populations
President’s Cancer Panel Identifies Urgent Need for Better Understanding of Diverse Populations, Standard of Culturally Appropriate Care
Current One-Size-Fits-All Approach to Cancer is Inadequate in Light of US Demographic and Cultural Transformation
With minorities expected to become the collective majority in the US by 2050, a report released today by the President’s Cancer Panel identifies an urgent need to expand research and improve understanding of the factors that influence cancer risk and outcomes among diverse populations. The Panel’s report, America’s Demographic and Cultural Transformation: Implications for Cancer, states that knowledge of cancer risk, incidence, progression, and outcomes is based largely on studies of non-Hispanic white populations. Therefore, the current understanding of risk factors, screening guidelines, and treatment may not be appropriate for individuals of non-European descent. The Panel also calls for higher standards of “cultural competence” among healthcare professionals to better address cultural and language barriers that can negatively impact the quality of patient care.
“As the cultural landscape of our nation continues its transformation, the one-size-fits-all approach to cancer screening guidelines, prevention, and treatment is no longer appropriate,” said LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr., M.D., chair of the Panel. “A more accurate understanding of cancer risk factors among diverse populations and improved training in cultural competency are critical steps toward reducing the national burden of cancer.”
With cancer incidence among minority populations projected to nearly double between 2010 and 2030, the Panel calls for a more accurate assessment of the effects that a changing demographic will continue to have on cancer incidence and mortality in the coming decades.
Key Findings and Recommendations
* While the impacts of socioeconomic and sociocultural determinants of health outcomes have long been recognized, cancer research has focused primarily on using genetics to identify health differences. The Panel recommends that both biologic and sociologic factors be examined to truly understand diverse populations and resulting health disparities.
* The Panel identifies a need to evaluate current cancer screening guidelines to determine their accuracy in assessing disease burden in diverse populations. In particular, the report recommends that researchers consider the patient population in its entirety and identify common genetic, sociologic, and environmental risk factors on which to base screening recommendations.
* Researchers must examine the impact of changing demographics and expand the current understanding of related factors that influence cancer risk, incidence, and mortality. This knowledge must then be applied for the benefit of all subpopulations so that more accurate preventive measures can be implemented.
* The majority of health care providers do not adequately consider patient sociocultural and socioeconomic characteristics when addressing cancer prevention and treatment, even though these factors can have independent and sometimes profound effects on cancer susceptibility and outcomes in both native and foreign-born Americans. In addition, the Panel found that patient-provider language differences are a significant barrier to the provision of quality health care. The Panel recommends that cultural competency become an integral part of medical and research training curricula, as well as a continuing education requirement. The Panel also recommends that trained interpreters be viewed as essential members of the health care team.
* Though personalized medicine for all is the ultimate goal in cancer care, it is not universally feasible or affordable in the near future. The Panel concludes that research is needed now to identify subpopulations at high risk of disease due to genetic/ancestral, biologic, sociocultural, and other factors that directly relate to risk or response to therapy.
* Weaknesses in existing vital statistics, census, public and private insurer, and cancer surveillance data may thwart efforts to characterize populations in a scientifically meaningful way. To address these serious data deficiencies, the Panel calls for improvements in data collection, as well as standardized data sets and definitions of race and ethnicity.
* There is a need for improved data sharing among government agencies at all levels as well as a need to address issues of data compatibility.
* Additional recommendations include increasing the diversity of the cancer research and care workforces; exploring and evaluating the benefit of patient navigation models; and continuing basic, translational, clinical, population, and dissemination research on cancer health disparities.
The Panel concludes that cancer and other health disparities will be eliminated only when the social determinants of poor health outcomes, such as poverty, low educational attainment, substandard housing and neighborhoods, and insufficient access to quality health care, are adequately addressed.About جنس سوري

Is Bayh Running for President
Whether it's the DLC, the Centrist Democrats, the New Democrats, or the Blue Dogs, Evan Bayh has shown that he is desperate to have some sort of power in the senate as a leader of an ideological caucus. Bayh has proven through his words and his actions that he is frustrated with his relative lack of power in the senate (as many former governors do). Speaking of which, in January 2011 he will have 8 years of experience as a governor, and 12 years as a senator. In terms of an adequate resume, he's already there.
Look at his quotes from after the Scott Brown election. "If you lose Massachusetts and that's not a wake-up call, there's no hope of waking up," he said after the election. While this wasn't uncommon for many members of the party following that election, I think it needs to be given more attention based on his retirement. This is a man that is already running for President. His platform is already written for him. He wants to be the moderate candidate who will, in his mind, will receive some Republican support. In my mind, the only question is whether he's going to primary Obama in 2012 or whether he's going to wait for the open race in 2016. The latter is more likely of course, but I wouldn't rule out the former. Evan Bayh, at this point, is a national politician.2001-09-19 / Sports News

NomuraRichard Koo calls it the "QE trap," a concept he explained in a note following 'trap' argument presented in my last report and which I presented using Figure 1," writes Koo in a note to clients. "However, the official I met with was unable to say anything to ease my concerns.".
NomuraIn essence, Koo says the idea hasn't caught on yet.
"I sensed the Fed’s full attention is now devoted to the question of whether and when to 'taper' its purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, leaving officials little time to think about long-term costs and scenarios," he writes. "The same could be said for the market participants I met with in New York and Boston, where the typical response was 'we haven’t thought that far ahead' or 'it’s tomorrow’s problem.'"
Koo says one way to avoid the "QE trap" is for the Fed to come out and argue that QE never worked to begin with, thereby downplaying concerns over its withdrawal, but it's unclear whether this would be effective, and he admits that it would be "difficult to implement."
"Current chairman Ben Bernanke, who unveiled the policy of quantitative easing, appears to want to at least begin dismantling it before his term expires," writes Koo, "but the reluctant QE 'trap' threatens to weigh on the economy for several years via elevated long-term interest rates."Partner — New York, NY

She was in a bit of a hurry heading home to Staten Island, and when not slowing down as much as she should have while circling an off ramp, she noticed a police car with flashing lights behind her.
Pulled over for the first time, her emotions were running high as an NYC officer approached.
The cop took a double take when getting a good look. Her face and long dark hair seemed so familiar. Then the officer looked in the back seat and noticed a Devils jersey.
“Are you Arlette?”
“Yes.”
“I’m a Rangers fan.”
Uh-oh. She figured she really was in for it now, until the cop spoke up again.
“Oh my gosh! I was just at a Devils-Rangers game. I'm a big fan.”
The cop stood there for a moment, then blurted out, “All right, I can’t give Arlette a ticket.”
A growing quest
Arlette is a long-time popular anthem singer to Devils fans, but also a wife, mother of two … and a singer-songwriter with a growing quest to use her gift to become nationally known.
“My dream, which is going to come true, is I’m going to put on the TV and I’m going to see my video playing on MTV or VH1,” Arlette predicted last week in an interview with NJ.com. “I'm putting it out there!”
Her music has been available to the public for a while, but she never publicized any of it like she is her new single, “Save Me.” The song is available for purchase on iTunes for 99 cents and a video can be watched on her website, SingArletteSing.com.
“It’s a ballad,” Arlette said.
A ballad about the Devils’ 2013-14 season?
“Oh stop!” she says with a smile. “It’s a beautiful ballad that showcases my vocals and my heart. I wrote the song. It's piano and voice.”
For more than 20 years, Arlette has been making a living as a lounge singer in restaurants, most of the time with her sidekick, a musician from Italy who became her long-time husband - Luigi Scapino.
From 2002-06, she put out four CDs mostly of covers, the first derived from being a New Yorker who lived through 9/11, "America Stronger Than Ever." Later came “Christmas with Arlette,” “We’re on Fire” – which is a tribute to the Devils – and with her husband and singing in Italian, "Italia in Black and White."
Arlette and Luigi, now parents to a 7-year-old daughter, Faith and, three-year-old son, Corrado, still do lounge singing acts, often now on weekends at Angelina’s restaurant in Staten Island. But they’re now passing on some paid gigs so that Arlette can focus on new original material.
“I've always been a writer, but you get to a point where you think about what you need to do to pay the bills, so did the whole cover-song thing,” she said. “I'm a lounge singer. I do parties and weddings and all these kinds of things. Then at one point, your creative side starts to knock on the door and say, ‘Hey, remember me?’”
Her stage name simply is Arlette, similar to other female artists who really hit the big time - Cher, Madonna and Beyonce.
“I’m Arlette Roxborgh, but I identity with Arlette,” the 42-year-old said. “It’s just who I am.”
Landing with the Devils
At age 21, Arlette moved from Trinidad to Brooklyn in 1992 to study chemistry at Long Island University, and her SAT scores were so high that she earned a full scholarship.
A natural who has sung since her childhood, Arlette went looking to make some spending money during college and was hired to sing in an Italian wedding band.
She was still working on her chemistry degree and singing at weddings when introduced to her future husband. Luigi told her that he had just moved to New York from Italy, that he played keyboards and sang … and that he was looking for singing partner.
They were performing together pretty quickly, and a year after meeting, they married, the wedding occurring just a week after her college graduation.
For years, Arlette and Luigi’s regular gig was an Italian restaurant that used to be on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on Second Avenue near 81st Street.
Divino Ristoranti, once popular but now shut down, had an open-door setup in which artists could be heard by street walkers, and one day a group that had eaten up the block stopped while passing by to listen.
One of the fellows especially took a liking to the music, and when he occasionally returned, he would strike up a conversation with Luigi during breaks.
“He and Luigi clicked because they’re both Italian,” Arlette said. “He used to make Luigi talk to his mom in Italian. Very cute. They had that connection.”
During one visit circa 1998, the man came clean on who he was. Well, sort of.
“I’m associated with this hockey team and sometimes we need anthem singers,” Devils GM Lou Lamoriello said.
Thrilled even though they knew nothing about hockey let alone the NHL team across the Hudson, Arlette and Luigi were driven by limo to Continental Airlines Arena – the former home of the Devils – for their first hockey game.
Only then did they realize Lamoriello was more than “associated” with the Devils.
That night Arlette sang the Star Spangled Banner for the first time. She didn’t have to learn the words. She’s already knew the song by heart and loved it.
“It has all this stuff going on … the rockets red glare,” she said.
By 1998, Arlette already was filled with as much or more American pride than most people who had been born in the United States.
“I’m very patriotic,” she said. “I was born in Trinidad, but I’m a naturalized American now and I feel such patriotism and loyalism for this country. When I sing the anthem, I’m feeling it all the way down to my toes. If you hear me singing, you can tell that it’s real.”
Devils fans can tell. She received a huge ovation that first night, then kept getting invited back.
'I am the most intense hockey fan'
Eventually, Arlette became a popular fixture at Devils games and a face - make that voice - of a franchise that won two of its three Stanley Cups during her run.
Along the way, Arlette and Luigi became true Devils fans.
“The first time that I saw a game, I was so horrified,” she said. “I remember the guys dropped the gloves and started to fight. I was like, ‘Oh my God, why are they fighting?’ That was my first hockey game. Now I’m like, ‘Yeahhhhh’ Now I get it. I really get it!”
When her schedule permits, she stays to watch Devils’ games after performing the anthem. And when she’s home and they’re playing, she has the television on and passionately follows the action.
“I am the most insane hockey fan,” she said. “Listen, I had to have an intervention with myself. I said, ‘Arlette, you cannot let whether or not the Devils win affect your life like this.’ I’m really into it. It used to ruin my night when they’d lose, but not anymore because now I know there’s the next game.”
Her highlight was Game 7 of the 2003 Stanley Cup Final, the night the Devils beat the Anaheim Ducks to win their third Cup. She was there for it all … singing beforehand, going crazy in the stands with everyone else, then afterward celebrating on the ice with Devils players.
Arlette seems to know every single worker at Prudential Center, the Devils’ home since October 2007. Before a game last week, everyone passing her would wave, which would lead to Arlette stopping in mid-sentence to offer a hello and a smile.
She loves her side job.
But her music career now is No. 1, and she’s hoping her new single is the start of bigger and better things.
“It’s a great time for independent artists right now,” Arlette said. “Now you can pretty much chart your own course. Of course it always helps if you have a record company behind you … or in my case, the Devils organization behind you!"All About Cameras & CamcordersWhether you’re a beginner or a pro, you’ll find the perfect camera at PC World.

Steve Horn [2] | July 17, 2012
By Steve Horn [2] • Tuesday, July 17, 2012 - 01:08
At the Clinton Global Initiative in 2008, former Vice President Al Gore called [3] the possibility of fossil fuel corporations extracting oil shale [4] “utter insanity [3].”
Insanity, though, doesn't serve as a hinderance for deeply entrenched and powerful [5] fossil fuel interests.
Oil shale, also known as kerogen [6], should not be confused with shale gas or shale oil, two fossil fuels best known from Josh Fox's “Gasland [7].” As explained in a report  [8] the Western Resource Advocates. Furthermore, like tar sands production [9] and shale oil/gas production [10], oil shale production is a water-intensive process [11].
Adding insult to injury, in the 100 years of attempted commercial production of oil shale, the fossil fuel industry has yet to seal the deal, motivating an April 2012 report by Checks and Balances titled “A Century of Failure [12].”
Greenwashing? Red Leaf's “EcoShale” Oil Shale Extraction Process
For the past century the oil shale public relations line has resembled that of a “science fiction story [13].”
The latest chapter of the science fiction story is currently being written by the Salt Lake City-based Red Leaf Resources [14], the developer of “EcoShale In-Capsule Technology [15].”
Red Leaf is the oil shale industry's Schlumberger [16] and Halliburton [17]. That is, its business model [18] is the equivalent of oil field services, or in this case, “oil shale services,” with its “EcoShale” equipment.
It claims [15] “ [19].
Next Steps for Red Leaf's “Eco Shale” Equipment Usage Include Road Block
In March 2012, the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining in Utah granted Red Leaf a production permit [20] to extract oil shale in eastern Utah's Uintah Basin [21] utilizing its “EcoShale [22]” equipment.
Red Leaf Resources, explained the Utah Tribune [20], “is proposing to begin large-scale oil shale extraction on close to 1,500 acres in the Uintah Basin and ship the extracted oil to customers in Utah, Wyoming and in the Gulf Coast region.”
With over 17,000 acres [20] worth of mineral rights in its name, “Red Leaf has said it will be ready to hit the production stage some time later this year, churning out an estimated 9,500 barrels a day,” wrote [20] the Tribune.
In late April 2012, Red Leaf struck gold, signing a joint venture production-sharing deal [23] with French oil and gas industry giant, Total S.A. [24]
“Total SA, Paris, will fund 80% of the cost of an early production system to demonstrate the commercial scalability of a proprietary process owned by Red Leaf Resources Inc.,” wrote [23] the Oil and Gas Journal. The Journal continued [23], [25], Red Leaf decided to back away from the legal challenge and suspend its plans [26] until it conducts further scientific analyses.
“It is unknown when the analysis will be completed and the meetings can continue, although it should be before year’s end,” explained [27] the Center of the American West [28]'s Oil Shale in the West blog.
It seems the future of oil shale is up for grabs and whether there is a faux-Green “EcoShale [29]” future or an actual sustainable clean energy future in North America remains to be seen.
“Utter insanity” or not? That's the real question on the table.

According to Law no. 9870 on Standardization of 4 February 2008, the General Directorate of Standardization (DPS) is the recognized National Standards Body of Albania, in charge of organizing all standardization activities at the national level.
DPS is a legal entity of public law depending on the Minister responsible for the economy, with offices in Tirana. It represents the Republic of Albania before European and international standards organizations.
DPS is responsible for the development, adoption, approval, and publication of standards in all fields except that of telecommunications.
DPS is managed by the General Director, who is appointed and dismissed by the Minister responsible for the economy, and by the Board with representatives from all interested parties.
All standards published by DPS have voluntary status.
DPS is the WTO/TBT National Notification Authority and Enquiry Point for technical standards, for regulations and for conformity assessment procedures which have an impact on trade.
DPS is a correspondent member of ISO, an associate member of the IEC and an affiliate member of CEN & CENELEC.
DPS has been the first public institution in Albania to be certified to ISO 9001.Two Colorado state senators, both Democrats, were ousted by voters Tuesday, apparently because the legislators were pushing gun control initiatives. The recall effort is seen as a major victory for gun rights activists.
For the first time in Colorado history, Republicans petitioned for a recall to remove State Senators John Morse and Agnela Giron before they had completed their terms, Reuters reports. Morse and Giron both pushed for legislation that would have banned ammunition magazines with more than 15 rounds and required background checks for all private gun sales. The gun control push was motivated by a series of deadly shootings in the state, including the massacre at the Aurora movie theater last year.
Polls taken before the vote suggested that many Colorado voters considered a recall to be an inappropriate response to a policy dispute; according to one, 60% of Colorado voters said that constituents should wait till re-election to unseat a legislator. Donors from around the country, including New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, contributed to the anti-recall coalition.
But it appears that the $3 million raised to oppose the recall may have fueled the gun rights campaign. Bernie Herpin, the Republican who unseated Morse, told Reuters, “In Colorado, we don’t need some New York billionaire telling us what size soft drinks we can have, how much salt to put on our food, or the size of the ammunition magazines on our guns.”Looking at ”Secrets of the Sideshows”

Alan Kerr’s May 29th, 2010, Vintage’s Release – Tasting Notes
May 29th brings yet another cluster of Argentina wines to the shelves of the LCBO albeit several of which are very tasty and will work well with barbecued foods in this unusually timed, but most welcome, heat wave. In addition to the Argentinean release also in perfect time for this summertime heat, the second feature of the release showcases some exceeding good whites from the Loire Valley. One in particular is really dynamite and it sells for under twenty bucks. Read the rest of this entry » »
Viticulture Students’ Strip Down
I truly have a great job. I get to teach what I love to do. My campus, in the heart of Niagara’s wine country, primarily delivers cooking, horticultural and viticulture programs. Hell, we are even starting up a Brewmeister program in the fall. One of my former students from Fanshawe College, Ben Andrew, who graduated Culinary Management program moved down to Niagara and enrolled in the wine making program.
Ben introduced me to some of his classmates and I have, on several occasions, tasted a wine or two with them. Now I figured it was my time to pull a few corks and play the role of host. Read the rest of this entry »
Touring California Wine Country ~ 2010
Five appellations, with six appointments in fourteen days. That was our calendar in late April through early May, and we couldn’t have asked for a finer return to California wine country for the first time since 2002. We decided right from the get-go that we were going to do it right this time; no exhaustive three of more appointments per day, and not even one appointment every day. We were going to enjoy ourselves, take our time, see some of the state and concentrate on a select group of producers, two of whom were new to our experience and three with whom we were very familiar.
Our travels took us to Napa Valley, Dry Creek Valley, Mendocino County, Paso Robles and the Santa Cruz Mountains. On off days, we simply toured or renewed acquaintances with old friends like Allan Bree, Frank Joyce and John and Pat Wolf. And of course, there was never any lack of good food and wine, as we’ve already detailed with recent blog entries.
Our site visits were all marvelous, and included appointments with John Olney at Ridge Lytton Springs, Julie Johnson at Tres Sabores, Mario and Danelle Storm Rosati at Rosati Family Winery, Jason Haas at Tablas Creek Vineyard, Paul Draper at Ridge Monte Bello and Sean Thackrey at his barn… OK, it’s REALLY Sean’s office-auxiliary storage facility outside of Bolinas and equipped with a kitchen many would envy.
We made extensive use of the video camera, and indeed, some of our reports could have stood on that footage alone – candid as they are, but there are always anecdotes and tasting notes to be included.
Our trip report begins in reverse, with accounts of our last two visits, with Paul Draper and Sean Thackrey. We met with the two of them just a few days apart, and couldn’t help but be struck by the differences in style and technique of these two otherwise brilliant winemakers. Subsequent reports will follow individually in quick succession. Read the rest of this entry »
Three French Rosés
There’s nothing quite like drinking good French rosé in Napa Valley in the springtime. I don’t mean that in a smarmy thumb-your-nose-at-Napa-because-the-French-make-better-rosé-than-the-locals-do kind o’ way, because that’s not necessarily true. It’s just that there’s something amusingly ironic about going to the heart of California wine country, only to drink French wine as the weather warms and the growing season starts to get into full swing. It also bears pointing out that these three cost less than anything made locally that we happened to run into, not that we searched every nook and cranny in a quest to price comparatively. These three are simply the ones that looked the best to us in our travels, so they’re the ones we bought, and as it turns out, all were quite satisfying, starting with a producer that’s new to us.

Two ’93 Domaine Tempier Bandols
On our last night in Napa, we took Allan Bree to dinner at Bistro Jeanty, a delightful restaurant in Yountville that he had introduced us to during our last trip out. Allan brought along two equally delightful wines from one of our very favorite producers, Domaine Tempier in Bandol, which we proceeded to enjoy with a succession of delicious appetizers and entrees, including Chef Jeanty’s famous cream of tomato soup, deep fried Great Lakes smelt, a marvelous artichoke heart terrine with lemon pesto, Epaule De Porc (slow roasted pork shoulder), steak tartare and a lovely little duck tart.

A few nights after opening the two Dehlinger Bordeaux variety wines for us, Allan Bree followed that up with an 11 year-old Pinot Noir. We have much more experience with these, so in a way, it was like welcoming an old friend back in our glasses, even if we hadn’t had this particular vintage. We’ve never had a Dehlinger that we didn’t like, and this was certainly not the one to ruin that track record. Read the rest of this entry »
Hospice du Rhone 2010 Friday Seminars – S. African Syrahs and Cote Rotie
Both Friday seminars are presented in this post:
“We’ve Come a Long Way Baby!
The Past, Present and Future of South African Syrah”
One of the best things about Hospice du Rhone is the world-wide focus of the event. Sure, domestic wines are front and center, especially from the Central Coast, but HdR has always celebrated the WORLD of Rhone varietals, both here, their home in France, and in all of the wine-producing countries in the world. So it was appropriate that HdR 2010’s seminar lineup kicked off with an in-depth look at South Africa, one of the oldest wine-growing regions, and yet one of the newest, too, particularly as a producer of high quality Rhone varietals and blends.

We did it twice, a few weeks apart, and learned quickly to get there earlier in the year with more water! The first time the level (from the Gov't site) was just about 2 1/2 foot, the second time just barely 2'. My wife and sons had little difficulty even in the flat rocky sections, while I had many times (being a rather portly 240# then) where I was 'bumping' my way along. And several times I would go the wrong way around a large rock and end up playing teeter-totter trying to get off a rock! But, knowing the water was never over our knees, except in 'pools'-we had a hilarious run. Very rocky, and some good areas we considered 'fast'. 2003 we are going out as soon as the water is around 3- 3 1/2 foot deep. Being a narrow river, more water than that and it is going to be fast and furious.
Great farm areas to go through, beautiful covered bridge to go under, and wildlife and birds all over. With higher water, we plan to go all the way to the Broad Street landing right at a dam in downtown Claremont-not 4 blocks from our house. With low water, you can't really get beyond the first takeout-the field with a cement block building and rusted old tank truck and a practice tower for the local fire department. The river starts to spread out and lots of sandbars-so we want high water for the final couple of miles. Overall, great 'beginner' experience to learn about working around rocks, how to flood your kayak and empty it (yup, it was me-twice on the same rock-now I use the skirt) and how to pick a good channel. Anytime you want, you can literally just get out of the yak and walk to the shore and take a break.
Note: Read the river height on the USG site-gauge is actually in West Claremont. Under 2 foot-forget it. Over 4 foot, be experienced and wear helmets! Many BIG rocks you won't see in high water!���

Patent auctions will do little to help independent inventors sell their patents Those seeking ways to generate revenue from their patentable ideas will find the recent NY Times article entitled “Patent Auctions Provide Protections for Inventors,” written by Steve Lohr, to be an interesting read. However, as someone who works with entrepreneurs and corporations wishing to monetize their patent rights, I find it necessary to comment on the assertion that patent auctions can operate to “provide protections” for independent inventors, as well as the underlying premise that these it is generally possible for non-corporate inventors to generate value from their patent rights irrespective of the underlying subject matter of the patents.* As an initial matter, the NY Times article states that “[independent inventors] can often find themselves in court, battling big corporations, spending piles of money on lawyers and leaving it up to judges and juries to determine the value of their hard-won patents.” This makes me wonder if the fact-checkers took a break when this article was presented for publication. The story of the lone “David” inventor battling in court against the evil “Goliath” corporation that steals a patented idea not only does not occur “often,” relative to the number of patents issued each year, it almost never occurs–a Continue Reading →With its waterjet machines, Omax takes customers places they never knew they could go and vice versa

In the absence of effective military forces or law enforcement, Ukrainians are taking the defense of the nation in their own hands through loosely organized militias.
One of them popped up in a YouTube video on May 2.
Although the group was unidentified, the clip was posted by a pro-Ukrainian group of former military and law enforcement officers, calling themselves the Donbass Volunteer Battalion. The video shows men armed with Kalashnikov rifles and clad in black ninja outfits dismantling a Kremlin-backed roadblock near Krasnoarmiysk in western Donetsk Oblast.
The national warriors also claim that 15 pro-Russian rebels were handed over to the police and that three Kalashnikovs were recovered.
The groups leader, Semyon Semenchenko, wrote on his Facebook page that the group is taking up arms and structuring like the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, the World War II era partisan group that fought both Nazi Germany and Soviet NKVD units in a futile attempt to gain national independence for Ukraine.

It's good to be cautious about news from them parts.
2A bump!
there’s a lesson to be learned here
Future headline?
This almost sounds familiar:
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
It would either be a good start or a last stand.
Either way—see you there!
What Good Can a Handgun Do Against An Army?
Militias will worry the Russians more than any regular Ukrainian army unit. They know the land, the people, they won’t fight by any rules, and they won’t be accountable to anyone. This is the best and worst thing that could happen.
Given the media here, it would likely read, "Right-wing hate groups form militias to throw nation into chaos."
But, yes. Your point is a possible future scenario.
Yes, "genuine, civilized patriots " just like their Galicia Waffen SS grandfathers who murdered hundreds of thousands of Jews, Poles and Russians.
The handiwork of genuine civilized Ukrainian patriots in Odessa, May 2nd.
Strangled cleaning lady whose screams for help are recorded:
Ukrainian Nazi version of "civilized":
A boy and girl murdered by "genuine Ukrainian patriots":
Perhaps up to 300 civilians were murdered in Odessa May 2nd by Ukrainian Nazi Right Sector and their NATO instructors. Murderers you call genuine patriots.
That's kind of "civilized" U.S. and EU support in Ukraine as we speak.
Those who lost their lives fighting against Nazism are spinning in their graves !
Agitprop lives on FR
One thing I'm certain of, the US need to stay away from there if we can.
As well as Nazi revisionism and denial !
WW2 ended a while back. The topic is now defense of a sovereign nation against an invader.
Killing has a tendency to feed on itself.
My heart goes out to the Ukrainian people. I hope the good guys win, whoever they are.
Too late. U.S. is leading the show over there. Graystone, acronym agencies, they are already on the ground.
The objective: mass murder Russian civilians in Ukraine to poke the Bear to intervene.
So far the Bear is reluctant...but might bite where not expected.
U.S.-sponsored AQ in Syria is fleeing Homs...
Where they will go?
That's a false accusation. I said I hoped they would be both civilized and patriots.
I don't know who the hell those folks are.
Mass murder Russians? You mean foreign invaders? Or maybe these are Russian forces murdering Ukrainians because they can use chaos to pretend that a secessionist vote passed there too?
. Remember Victoria Nuland's "F' the EU" battle cry?
The Invaders are Neocons who toppled Ukraininian government, installed Neo Nazi thugs in hope to foment the war in Europe.
You are insane. Russia is gobbling up countries rebuilding the USSR. Babbling about neocons installing nazis to power and pretending that a faction that won less than 10% of the vote is running around murdering at random is crazy.
Kievan Rus is the heart of Russia.
Western Ukraine is Polish land, and it was until 1939.
Calling Ukrainian citizens of other ethnic extraction "invaders" is shameful. It borders on Nazism.
Check the history books. It ain't pretty.
Nice to know which side you will be on when the reconquista comes to the southwest US
I did not say the other ethnicities were invaders, but judging how YOU are the one who considers them to be Russian and not Ukrainian isn’t that what you are doing?
Svoboda and Right Sector run Ministry of Interior and two other departments. They ARE Nazis, as their Odessa handiwork shows.
You need this to wash the foul words...
Over 80% of people in Ukraine self identify as being ethnic Ukrainian.
And there is so much more wrong with your posts.
LoL
Russia needs that chaos. If the Ukrainians bring any semblance of normality back, watch for Russia to push it back into chaos
How do we know they weren’t killed by Russia?
USSR was built by Wall-street sponsored Communist thugs. Tens of millions of Russians were murdered. Rusian land was cut into "republics" and Russian people found themselves divided. When USSR got dissolved some 70 years later, millions of Russians found themselves overnight in hostile foreign lands. Even if they were loyal citizens, their human rights were denied.
from this vantage point, the hatred of Russians had nothing to do with the hatred of Communism. It is religious hatred, aimed at annihilating Russians as an ethic group.
The fact that "democratic" EU and U.S. supports the worst scum is an evidence to this claim.
Wall-street created communist Russia? Wow.
How about Occam razor?
Right sector was in Odessa, May 2nd.
Right Sector thugs are Caught on "tape".
Odessa is far away from Russian border.
American and Eu MSM keep mum about this genocidal crime.
What is more likely, Right sector murdering off up to 300 Ukrainian citizens who opposed Nazi junta or "Russia"?
The genocidal crime was hushed up by Kiev junta.
If there were grounds to accuse "Russia", how likely is that Kiev Nazi junta and NAT0-controlled media would keep silent?
Russian FM is on record claiming that the perps of this crime will not escape. How likely is that he would raise this issue if "Russia" was the perp?
The Russians and the Germans each killed millions of Ukrainians. Even if these armed separatists were added to the toll of Russians wrongfully killed by Ukrainians, they are a rounding error of a rounding error, as a % of the millions of Ukrainians deliberately killed by Russians.
If you do not have command of the facts about the events in 1917 that are historical record, you are not qualified to discuss current events that are still fluid.
Ignorance is an ailment that could be cured by learning.
There is no excuse for ignorance in the age of Google.
What you wrote here is really sick. You advocate genocide against an identifiable ethic group "as such".
The Nazis killed 3 million ethnic Ukrainians during WWII as part Generalplan Ost.
Pretty sick stuff.
Yet you seem to ignore all that history.
The deaths of a few dozen people in a building fire at the end of a running street battle in which Ukrainians are killed by gunfire from some of the people in the building = genocide? The deliberate mass starvation of millions of Ukrainians by Russians during the Holodomor was a genocide. The mass killings of millions of civilians (Poles and Ukrainians and 1/2 of the world's Jews) by Germans was a genocide. The casualties of a running street battle are not a genocide.
Yet you seem to ignore all that history.<<<<<
I don't. Communists who invaded Russia in 1917 murdered tens of millions of Russians 1917-1940. Among the Politburo members there were almost no Russians. Stalin was Georgian.
Lazer Kaganovich, the man who masterminded Holodomor you mentioned was not an ethnic Russian. He murdered 6 million, just like Himmler.
Germans murdered 3 million in Ukraine. But there were Ukraininans who helped them murder fellow Ukrainians, ethnic Jews, Russians and Poles.
Galician Waffen SS is hailed by many in Western Ukraine for their crimes. Imagine hailing other Waffen SS in Germany or other Western European country, for now at least.
I recall the quip when Germans complained that Austrians want to depict Hitler as German and Bach as an Austrian.
Ditto here. Russians are accused for the crimes committed by the other ethnicities.
So, who is ignoring the history?
So, how exactly "Russians" deliberately starvated millions of Ukraininans (of whom many were actually ethnicRussians)?
You say: "The casualties of a running street battle are not a genocide.".
Well, US-NATO "justice" says otherwise. The casualties of Muslim fighters in Srebrenica were declared "Genocide" by U.S. sponsored ICTY kangaroo court.
If several thousand KIA combattants are genocide, several hundred unarmed civilians are genocide as well.
You can not have it both ways.
You actually think that Stalin acted alone? Of course he didn't.
So, who is ignoring the history?
You are.
You deserve Duranty Award for factual reporting.
No you deserve the Duranty Award for your denial that Russians were involved in the Holodomor.
Hitler was Austrian. Napoleon was Corsican. Did Kaganovich and Stalin give their orders in Hebrew and Georgian, respectively, in the name of Israel and Georgia? Who carried out their orders? Spare us the nonsense about Russian innocence. Ordinary Americans were horrified by the Waco massacre. Ordinary Russians exulted at the deaths of millions of Ukrainian "class enemies". Heck, like you, they still call them Nazis. Today's Russian attitudes are basically no different from that of Nazi Germany - the whole attitude is the Russian equivalent of Deutschland über alles, with Russia in the role of main victim, and bloody revenge and territorial conquest as the salve for mythical historical wrongs suffered by Russia, the largest empire in existence.
As to the pregnant woman killed...Kiev Gov.denied it even happened....But she was working over holiday cleaning offices, watering flowers etc.....She was strangled with an electric wire found on the floor next to her body, and flower pot toppled near her body.

HP recently showed off a concept eBook Reader at the ‘Making Connections’ event in Shanghai. Even though the company claims it uses ‘cutting edge’ technology the only feature that really sets it apart from others already on the market is a nifty page turning feature. Sliding your finger across a touch sensitive pad on the bottom results in the text being turned and distorted as it if were on an actual page.
But other than that I think HP has a lot of work on its hands if it intends to compete against Sony and Iliad who are already selling their own readers. First off HP’s device won’t be hitting the market for at least a couple of years giving their rivals plenty of time to upgrade their own products. Secondly while the HP reader will tie into their Snapfish photo sharing website the device won’t have Wifi meaning albums need to be downloaded to flash cards in order to be viewed. And thirdly in a truly baffling move HP has decided to shun the PDF format and instead develop its own file format for use on the device. (You know that decision was made in a boardroom full of suits.)
So while their concept is quite clever I won’t be putting HP’s eReader high on my wishlist when it eventually comes out.

The partnership seeks to offer drug developers access to a range of sensitive and robust analytical platforms for early clinical development across Asia, Europe, and North America.
"This partnership emphasizes the crucial role of contemporary analytical platforms in driving down the cost of drug development. Whether in Phase 0 or enriched Phase I, we can confidently provide critical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information before Phase II," said Dr Michael Butler, CEO of Xceleron, in a press statement.
Over the years, Phase 0 and enriched Phase 1 studies have been used successfully in to investigate a range of developmental endpoints such as the presence of drug at tissues or cells of interest, absolute bioavailability, and human metabolism. These studies when conducted early in drug development allow confident decision-making that offers a cost-effective alternative when compared to later stages of clinical development.
More than 100 analytical methods for Phase 0 and enriched Phase I investigations have been developed between Xceleron and JCL Bioassay. Both companies recently built laboratories that are equipped and staffed specifically for the purpose of conducting ultra-low level analyses under good laboratory practice (GLP) and good clinical practice (GCP) conditions. This partnership will provide access to clinical design expertise as well as appropriate analytical platforms for the purpose of early clinical investigation.Reviews how heat is transferred in the atmosphere.

Micro- and nanoscale mechanical structures have long been used to sculpt and channel optical signals, from waveguides to resonators, but lately the direction of influence has reversed. Now optical signals are being used to manipulate these mechanical structures. Recently, researchers at both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge) and Cornell University (Ithaca, N.Y.) demonstrated new methods of using optical signals to control mechanical structures, at least one group of material scientists proposing to close the feedback loop. The trend began many years ago with the invention of "optical tweezers" to manipulate living cells without damaging them. Now MIT engineers, professor Matthew Lang and doctoral candidate David Appleyard, have demonstrated next-generation technology: an optical tractor-beam that can manipulate both living cells and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) structures as large as 20 microns. "We've begun applying optics to building structures on chips," said Lang. Separately, Cornell University professors Michal Lipson and David Erickson, along with their graduate students Bradley Schmidt and Allen Yang, report harnessing the evanescent field surrounding solid-core optical fibers to attract and propel micro- and nano-scale particles through microfluidic devices. Lipson, a pioneering researcher who manages a team of EEs conducting silicon photonics research, collaborated with mechanical engineer Erickson to characterize the velocities that can be achieved for various particle sizes, reporting that speeds of 28 microns per second were achieved for three-micron-diameter polystyrene spheres using about 54 milliwatts of optical power down the fiber. Back at MIT, in a separate lab, EE professor Erich Ippen teamed with physics professor Marin Soljacic and their graduate students Milos Popovic and Peter Rakich, to unify the influence of optics-on-mechanical with mechanical-on-optics by closing the feedback loop between the two. The researchers have crafted a control theory detailing how feedback from mechanically coupled optical cavities can be used to dynamically tune their resonance. "We hope to eventually demonstrate working MEMS devices that can perform all-optical functions not possible today, from switching to adaptive dispersion and filter synthesis for applications like optical clock recovery," said Popovic. The team is now crafting MEMS membranes and cantilevers that can perform signal processing operations presently requiring expensive translation to electrical signals and back to optical, such as resonators that can track communications signals across their entire free spectral range of about 4.5 THz.Previous Episode | Next Episode

November 4, 2002-- Home Textiles Today,
Fashion bedding house Custom Comfort has added a solid-color sheet program that coordinates back to several of its new print introductions.
Made domestically of linen and cotton, the 230-count sateen sheets, with an attached hem, are offered in two spring colors of aqua and seafoam. A queen sheet set will retail for $89.
"Being a fashion resource, we wanted to offer solids but fashionize them by the fabric and type of color," said Trevor Rabkin, co-ceo.
"It's a soothing collection," said Jonathan Alkin, co-ceo.
The solids pair up with several print patterns, each of which offers a different bedding style. For a romantic, lacy look, Chantilly is available in aqua and seafoam, as is the more graphic Dashes, with short lines crossing the sheets. The brightly colored Cabana Stripe pattern is available in aqua and melon colorways.
Coordinating solid-color duvets, shams and dusters in a linen/cotton blend will also be available. A queen duvet will retail for $99.
"If it's successful for the spring, we'll go forward and do it in fall colors as well, such as mustard, gold and aubergine," said Alkin.

PQRS is the first CMS-crafted national program to link the reporting of quality data to physician payment. The Affordable Care Act authorized incentive payments for eligible professionals (EPs) who successfully participate in the program through 2014.
The incentive payment for the 2013 reporting year is 0.5 percent of the total allowed charges for Medicare Part B professional services covered under the physician fee schedule and furnished during the reporting period.
For reporting year 2014, EPs may earn an incentive payment of 0.5 percent of their total estimated allowed charges for Medicare Part B physician fee schedule-covered professional services furnished during the respective reporting periods. If EPs are unsuccessful PQRS participants in 2013, they will be subject to a penalty in 2015. Table 1 summarizes the payments during these years.
Table 1. PQRS Payment Incentives and Penalties
What are some of the differences between the requirements in the 2012 PQRS and the 2013 PQRS?
CMS released the Medicare physician fee schedule final rule for calendar year (CY) 2013 on November 1, 2012. In the final rule, CMS finalized several changes to the PQRS for 2013. Major program changes are highlighted in Table 2.
Table 2. 2013 PQRS Changes
It is important to note that the 2013 PQRS includes 259 quality measures (individual measures) and 22 measures that are part of a 2013 measures group. Whereas 2012 PQRS quality measures may be continued in the 2013 PQRS, measure specifications may have been updated for the new program year. Surgeons who are currently reporting in 2012 PQRS should review the 2013 PQRS Measure Specifications Manual for Claims and Registry Reporting of Individual Measures for updates and changes. Surgeons can also visit the American College of Surgeons (ACS) PQRS website for more information on the program.
How do I use the measure specifications manual?
The 2013 PQRS Measure Specifications Manual for Claims and Registry Reporting of Individual Measures should be used to identify measures applicable for professional services that a practice routinely provides. The manual can be accessed at the CMS website. Next, select those measures that make sense based upon prevalence and volume in the practice, as well as your individual or practice performance analysis and improvement priorities.
How do I report PQRS measures?
There are a number of ways that EPs can report in PQRS 2013 in order to receive an incentive payment and/or avoid the 2015 payment penalty. A matrix that lists all six options for reporting under PQRS 2013 is available. Moreover, the 2013 physician fee schedule also finalized two methods by which EPs can simply avoid the 2015 PQRS penalty without receiving an incentive payment for PQRS 2013. The two methods are outlined in Table 3.
Table 3. 2013 reporting options to avoid 2015 PQRS penalty but not receive 2013 incentive
These two options are currently only available for 2013 and are intended for practices that may be overwhelmed with attempting to comply with other reporting programs. Successful PQRS compliance will still be required after 2013, and it is possible that CMS may finalize other reporting methods in future rulemaking.
The ACS has developed useful PQRS resources for surgeons, including the 2013 PQRS flow sheets for claims-based reporting. The flow sheets are categorized by procedure codes relating to various surgical procedures for the perioperative measures set. The perioperative measures set includes measures #20, #21, #22, and #23. This flow sheet provides the corresponding current procedural terminology II code that should be used on the Claims 1500 form as shown in the figure below. The flow sheets should be used as a reference only and should not be submitted to CMS. The flow sheets are available for review. Additional background information regarding the PQRS program can be found on the CMS and ACS websites. If you have questions regarding PQRS, contact Sana Gokak in the ACS Division of Advocacy and Health Policy at sgokak@facs.org.Welcome to our website

Beginners Guides: Upgrading Win98 to Windows XP

PC Stats has posted a new beginners guide about upgrading Win98 to Windows XP
Today's computers really don't get the best out of Windows 98. Games and software have started the transition to being 2000/XP compatible only, and it's only a matter of time before the operating system loses its viability completely. If you have a newer computer with Windows 98 installed, it's high time you considered updating your operating system to Windows XP..

While all this hubbub has done little to illuminate the events leading up to and directly following the 9/11 attacks, it has reinforced the fact that this administration appoints American blacks to positions of genuine authority and power.
People are responding to that fact, while empathizing with Dr. Rice. This came clear during a recent appearance on Radio One's "Live at Five," with Latoya Foster. Callers were effusive in their admiration for Dr. Rice. "I'm not a Republican, but Condi Rice made me proud," said one caller. "This black lady defended this country," said another.
These callers had a visceral response to seeing Dr. Rice discussing complex foreign policy matters on TV. In her, they saw an alternative to the standard model of black achievement. They saw someone who discusses politics in terms of issues, rather than just race or racial discrimination. They saw a black leader who does not define herself purely as an extension of the civil rights movement.
More and more, this is what the younger generation of black Americans want from their leaders. They want people who can discuss politics Harold Ford Jr., Georgia congresswoman Denise Majette, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and Newark's former City Councilman Corey Booker. These are black leaders who talk race, yes, but they also talk about school vouchers, using government funds to support religious charities and - perhaps most importantly - they supplant the victim theology with a powerful message of individual striving and economic empowerment.
On the national level, we see this shift in the appointments of Gen. Colin Powell as secretary of state and Condoleezza Rice as national security adviser. Every time Dr. Rice answers a question from the 9-11 commission, she suggest 9-11 commission to assail the Bush administration, the more the public understands that the Republican Party offers opportunities for blacks that extend beyond all the old covenants, and the more they end up helping the Republican Party usher in a new chapter in the black political narrative.RANSON - University Healthcare Jefferson Medical Center officials recently announced that the special care unit (SCU) is now offering an acute dialysis service.
Jefferson Medical Center is using the NxStage CRRT, a continuous renal replacement therapy. In March, Kristy Penick Brown, Jean Bridwell, and Ron Clocker, all SCU registered nurses, traveled to NxStage headquarters in Boston for training as super users.
"Upon their return, they trained all of our SCU nurses and resource nurses," said Tina Mawing, SCU nurse manager. "We believe CRRT is an excellent adjunct therapy to current medical treatment of the acute renal failure patients."
Submitted photoKristy Penick Brown, RN, is shown training Ted Grose, RN, on how to use the NxStage CRRT equipment at Jefferson Medical Center.
On May 6, Jefferson Medical Center treated its first renal patient using NxStage CRRT. "In addition to the benefits this new service offers our patients, it also provides our staff an opportunity for educational growth," Mawing added.

With the two wins today, Baylor improves to 5-1 on the year and remains undefeated at home with a record of 5-0.
“I thought the second match was our best match of the year,” said head coach Matt Knoll. “Just in terms of our energy, our focus level, and our execution were way better than they have been. I am really optimistic about what is coming up next for this team.”
Knoll was able to switch up his lineup including doubles teams in the second match, but the Bears posted the third and fourth shutouts of the season.
Match No. 1 vs. UT Pan-American
In the first match, the Bears claimed the doubles point with wins on court 3 and court 1 by scores of 8-3 and 8-1.
The Bears kept the momentum rolling as singles action got underway. Baylor’s Patrick Pradella made quick work of UTPA’s Chetan Panditi winning by a score of 6-0, 6-1 in the No. 2 spot.
Diego Galeano was soon to follow with a win on court 5 by a score of 6-3, 6-0. Roberto Maytin then posted a 6-2, 6-2 win on court 4. Tony Lupieri clinched the Baylor win with a victory at the No. 1 spot with a 6-0, 6-2 win over Thomas Panoulas, before Robert Verzaal picked up a 6-4, 6-1 victory in the No. 6 spot.
No. 56 Marko Krickovic was the last Bear to finish on court 3 with a win over Ricardo Hopker by a score of 6-2, 6-3.
The Bears win over UTPA moves the overall series record to 13-10 and the second straight 7-0 victory for the Bears vs. the Broncs.
With the loss, UTPA falls to 1-5 on the season.
Match No. 2 vs. UT Arlington
Baylor earned its second 7-0 victory of the day with a win over UT Arlington. The Bears claimed the doubles point by winning 8-1, 8-0 on courts 3 and 2. The win pushed the team’s doubles record to 6-0 for the season.
In the singles action, Diego Galeano tallied a 6-0, 6-0. Patrick Pradella was the next Baylor win on court 3 by a score of 6-1, 6-1.
Roberto Maytin clinched the match for the Bears with a 6-2, 6-0 victory over UTA’s Marek Pesicka, before Julian Lenz claimed a 6-2, 6-2 victory in the No. 1 spot. Mate Zsiga was able to claim the sixth match point on court 4 with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Sebastia Erimicioiu. Tony Lupieri finished the match with a victory on court 1 with a score of 6-2, 6-2.
The win improved the Bears to 12-3 against the Mavericks all-time. UTA is now 1-2 on the season with the loss.
The Bears next match will be on the road against North Florida on Feb. 21 before taking on No. 11 Florida in Gainesville, Fla. The Bears will return home on March 2 to host their second double header of the season, which will feature Laredo Community College and Abilene Christian.
“We don’t have a signature win yet, but we have a good opportunity when we go down to Gainesville next weekend,” Knoll said. “We are way more prepared then we were the last time we played a team of that caliber, so we are excited and we will go down there and see what happens.”Photo by Grant Scott-Goforth.
Lisa Rossbacher hiked all around campus on her first day on the job, July 14, as Humboldt State University's new president, meeting the people who keep the place humming — the sign makers, the plumbers, the vehicle mechanics, the facility managers, the test coordinator, the grant writers, the ID card makers, the librarians, the printers, the keepers of the maps and plans, the garbage men, the disability coordinator, the sustainability boss, the shipping and receiving crew, the veterans helping other veterans get an education.
And nearly everyone she met, she wanted their story: What do you do? How long have you been doing it? What were you doing before? What did you study?
Often she probed further: Do you handle all of the university's mail here? What have you printed on this 3-D printer? What do you find is the single most important need of veterans? What do you have in terms of chemicals that are being discarded? What about old IT? How are you tackling that big water leak?
She was serious, her voice low and calm, but also quick to quip. While signing a form granting her use of a campus key, she joked, "OK, this says you can withhold my grades if I lose it." When Facilities Services Manager Ed Goodeyon told her he's worked at HSU for 34 years, she teased, "Before that you were in eighth grade."
In the sign shop on campus, Rossbacher watched two HSU employees getting the official seal ready to place permanently on the time capsule that commemorates the university's centennial. They handled the coppery disc, with a big "H" in its center ringed by the words "Humboldt State University Founded 1913," gently. Then she and her tour guides moved briskly on to yet more formal introductions and mini interviews.
The day was humid. The campus hills steep. Rossbacher, dressed in a dark pants-and-blazer combo with a green shirt, showed no sign of flagging. But at an open back door of a maintenance warehouse leading to the outside, she did pause a moment to gaze upon an unruly green space. It lacked the cultivated perfection of the formal landscaping that graces the university's main thoroughfares. Dandelions and daisies spread wildly around picnic tables, a green bench and a tattered orange chair set randomly in the patchy grass. An EarthTub composter squatted nearby. Empty plastic pots tipped about, and others holding plants lined a shady edge.
"Does this ever get used?" Rossbacher asked. "It looks kind of nice."
"The guys sit out here," said Traci Ferdolage, associate vice president of facilities management, adding, "It's just an informal area."
A reporter asked if she'd mind posing in the scruffy oasis for a photo, and Rossbacher strode to one of the tables, sat, plucked a daisy and stuck it between her teeth and grinned. Then she whipped the flower out of her mouth and held it in her lap with her red leather notebook and phone case, composing herself for a more formal shot.
Humboldt, meet your new president.
Lisa Rossbacher is HSU's seventh president, replacing Rollin Richmond, who retired this spring after 12 years at the helm — a relative short-timer, considering the lengthy terms of most of his predecessors, including fifth president Alistair McCrone, who served 28 years. Rossbacher's also the 100-year-old institution's first woman president.
The 61-year-old Virginia native is not, however, new to being a president. She spent the past 16 years as the head of Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta, Georgia. She was also that university's first female president, and was the first female geologist in the country to become a university president.
But being the first woman anything is not, Rossbacher says, what has motivated her. When she started her career in geology almost 40 years ago, around 10 percent of geologists with Ph.D.s were women (today, it's a little over 40 percent). When she was chosen to try out for the astronaut training program in 1984, a few women had been in space, including American Sally Ride, but it was a mostly male arena. Today, only five of the 23 California State University system presidents are women.
"It's just that a lot of other people attracted to some of the same things I am happen to be men," she says.
Rossbacher spent much of her childhood on the Navy base in Dahlgren, Virginia, where her dad, a civilian mathematician, helped develop ballistic warheads. He also worked on escape devices for helicopters, which had to be different than those used in airplanes which eject the pilot straight up.
The base also had one of the earliest space surveillance systems, which could track satellites — rare wonders, at that time. Sputnik, the first Earth-orbiting satellite, had launched just a few years before, in 1957. They knew when a satellite would be passing overhead, and sometimes everyone went outside to watch it, Rossbacher says.
Rossbacher liked botany and being outdoors. She was a Girl Scout, and from fifth grade on she went to conservation education camp — first as a camper, then as an instructor and, by the time she started college, as director of instruction. She also read a lot of books — mostly fiction. Her mother was an English major, but both of her parents loved to read.
"They both had very eclectic interests," she says. "In college, they both took German, and they spoke it around the house. They thought my sisters and I wouldn't know what they were talking about."
When Rossbacher herself took German in college, she already had a strong vocabulary.
At Dickinson College, a small liberal arts school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, she was planning to major in English. Then she'd write the great American novel.
"I just figured I'd get my science class out of the way and do the writing and literature stuff," she says.
She got stuck with geology — and then hooked by it.
"I loved the concept of time and wrapping your mind around four and a half billion years' worth of stuff happening," she says. "And I also liked the fact that, when I was in a geology class, I could walk out and look around me and see something about the world that I hadn't understood an hour before."
She got her B.S. (summa cum laude) in geology, then went to State University of New York at Binghamton to work on a master's degree with a female geomorphologist she admired. She also taught geology courses back at Dickinson College. Then she went to Princeton for a second master's and a Ph.D., working with a professor who'd co-authored the introductory geology book that had first made her swoon for the subject. She gravitated toward Mars for her dissertation, focusing on the role of water and water ice in shaping it. She was one of many students from around the country whom NASA hired to pore through the data still coming back from the first soft-landing spacecraft to land on Mars.
"In the geology department at Princeton, there's this huge globe in the lobby, and students would put push pins in it to show where their field area was," Rossbacher says. "So people had pins in the Adirondacks, they had pins in the Great Barrier Reef, they had pins all over the world. And some joker just hung a string from the ceiling with an arrow that pointed into outer space. The other graduate students used to kid me a lot and say, 'Rossbacher, when are you going to do some actual field work?'"
So when NASA put out a call for applicants to its astronaut candidate program, Rossbacher applied, "just to shut people up," she says. She figured she wouldn't get in, what with her eyeglasses and tendency to get queasy in cars. She passed the eye exams, however, and was invited for a week of exhausting interviews and psychological and physical tests at Johnson Space Center. Some of the tests doubled as research experiments, including one to help NASA design off-the-rack space suits to replace the expensive, individually tailored ones in use. Rossbacher remembers feeling dizzyingly sick at times. In one test for claustrophobia, however — couched slyly, she says, as an experiment to test a rescue sphere to be used in the event of a space station disaster — she almost fell asleep inside the beachball-sized capsule.
She did well in everything. But she didn't fly, and much of the program is about flight and flying. She was told to take flying lessons, get her pilot's license "and express more interested in aviation, and then reapply."
But someone told her that NASA never selected college professors into the astronaut program. "When mission control says, 'Do this,' they want to hear 'Roger that,'" she says. "They do not want to hear, 'Well, have you thought about it this way?'"
And another person told her even if she got in, she probably wouldn't be able to do her own research in space.
Aside from diversions — a science reporting fellowship at National Public Radio, a job editing reports for a geothermal exploration company and a stint with the United States Geological Survey — Rossbacher's career has persisted in academia. She's been a professor and administrator at Dickinson College, Whittier College (in California) and California State Polytechnic University in Pomona. She did research at the University of Uppsala in Sweden. She belongs to dozens of organizations, committees and boards and has authored and co-authored scores of professional publications and several geology books (including one that won an "outstanding trade book for children" award). She writes a higher education leadership blog, and since 1988 has written a regular geology column in Earth magazine. (One of her recent "Geologic Column" pieces, "Beer's secret ingredient: geology," should resonate with rock hounds, beer connoisseurs and locavores alike.)
Rossbacher became president of Southern Polytechnic in 1998, and was there until her move this summer to Humboldt.
She apparently left a good impression in Georgia, where she was named president emerita when she left. A news release this June from Southern Polytechnic said that she led the university "to unprecedented heights" during her tenure: Enrollment increased 78 percent to more than 6,500 students; on-campus housing tripled; 10 new academic and support facilities were built; five new bachelor's programs and several graduate programs were added plus a school of engineering; incoming freshmen had among the highest SAT scores in Georgia; and Southern Polytechnic had the most African-American students earning engineering-related bachelor's degrees of any school in the country. The university system also credits her with expanding opportunities for underrepresented groups, including Hispanics and women, enabling distance learning, and building strong ties with the business community.
"President Rossbacher's enormous heart for the students set her apart from other university presidents," said former regent Willis Potts in the news release. "She cared deeply, it showed, and she made a difference in thousands of lives as a result. Humboldt State is getting a jewel!"
Southern Polytechnic was actually in great upheaval when Rossbacher left, dealing with the news that it was likely going to be absorbed into the much bigger Kennesaw State University. Another in a string of consolidations the University System of Georgia has undertaken in recent years, the move came as part of an overarching scheme to streamline administrative duties, boost student opportunities and save money. Rossbacher was slated to lose her position in the deal. But, she says, long before she'd learned of the proposed consolidation, she'd been looking for a president's post elsewhere. She says she and her husband, Dallas D. Rhodes — also a geologist, and former department chair of geology and geography at Georgia Southern University — wanted to move back West. The pair had spent about 20 years in California, and Rhode's research focuses on the San Andreas Fault. They hoped for something with mountains or an ocean. And maybe rivers.
They got all three in Humboldt.
Some press photos show Rossbacher in a red power suit, with short blond hair sleekly coiffed. The photo that accompanied Southern Polytechnic's announcement of her president emerita status this June showed a slightly more laid-back figure: stylish pant suit with green accents, a woven green bracelet, and medium-length, naturally wavy hair with a streak of green paint in it (green is one of Southern Polytechnic's colors). In both photos, she wears a golden bear charm on a chain — a gift Rhodes gave her more than 35 years ago, not long after they met, and which she's only taken off three times.
She was similarly less formal (but minus the paint streak) on another recent walkabout/photo shoot on Humboldt's campus. First, she wanted her picture taken at the art department, in a colorfully dark hallway that, years ago, was swallowed up and transformed by a sculpted representation of Jonah and the Whale. Rossbacher is a landscape watercolorist. She likes the mixing of water and geology, the pigments derived from ground-up minerals. And she likes to use the water from the place she's painting — if her husband's in a river fly fishing, you might find her on the bank, painting with the river water.
In Georgia, she took watercolor classes alongside university students. The professor would "out" her right away and often use her work to critique and point out errors.
"I was really trying to model that it was OK to make mistakes," she said. "And I loved the opportunity to interact with the students. There are students I was in class with, who've since graduated, that I still keep in touch with."
In the art hallway at HSU, she stood by a sharp-toothed window that could be the whale's mouth and glanced around at the ornate ceiling. "I need you to tell me if I'm standing in front of something that's got a horn coming out of it," she joked.
Back out in the bright day, traversing campus, her group surprised a pair of student ambassadors leading a tour just as one of them, Stephanie Loganayagam, was asking if any of the new students in tow were geology majors.
Silence.
Then Loganayagam noticed Rossbacher and said, "Hi, President!"
"No geology majors?" Rossbacher asked, looking at the group. "I'm a geologist." She looked back at the ambassadors and said, "This is great. This is part of the standard tour?"
Yes, they said, and the other ambassador, Dayshia Lesueur, laughed, reached out to touch Rossbacher's arm and said, "Lisa, when are you going to come on our tour? When are you coming? I'm supposed to be your tour guide."
"As soon as I can get it on the schedule," Rossbacher said.
To Loganayagam she said, "If I hadn't interrupted you, what were you about to say?"
"I was going to tell them that Humboldt County is amazing because we are geologically rich, with so many land formations, so many rivers and beaches," Loganayagam, an English major, said.
Walking again, Rossbacher shared one of her favorite themes: Being a geologist is good preparation for leadership. As a geologist, you know that "you will never have all the information that you want when you have to come to a conclusion," she said.
"It might be on another planet," she said. "It could be buried five miles beneath the surface of the earth. It could have been eroded a hundred million years ago. It may be there and you haven't got the technology yet, or you don't have enough money to afford the technology to get to what you need. But if you wait until you have all the information that you want, you will never make a decision. And geologists understand that."
She said she has many goals as president of Humboldt State, but that she also plans to build on the efforts of her predecessors.
"High on the list is continuing to support the existing strengths that the university has both in the sciences and environment and natural resources, as well as the arts," she said.
Another aim is to improve diversity, much as she did in Georgia — although the needs of Humboldt are quite different from those of Southern Polytechnic, which is ethnically and racially very diverse.
"The issue there was that the percentage of women students was only about 22 percent," she said.
There, Rossbacher said, the university needed not only to entice more women into the technological sciences, such as engineering, math and computer science, but to figure out how to keep them. She founded a women-in leadership program, and promoted the hiring of more female faculty and staff to provide more female mentors and role models.
At Humboldt, where there's a good balance between men and women, it is racial and ethnic diversity that could still use a boost to build on the gains made by Richmond's administration.
There are more tasks ahead.
University presidents, everywhere, face budget challenges — "and that's not just about not having enough money," Rossbacher said. "It's figuring out how to manage the resources that the institution already has in ways that are sustainable."
This could include making operations more efficient and generating more revenue through partnerships with the private sector, she said.
Humboldt students, meanwhile, have been emailing her to share their concerns ever since her presidency was announced. They want a bigger voice in conversations on campus. They're worried about the rising price of higher education as costs shift from the state to them and their parents. They're also concerned, as are faculty Rossbacher's talked to, about the decline in tenure-track faculty over the past five or so years, while the number of students has increased. This can make it harder for students to connect with faculty, access advising and do research. In a bigger community, there'd be a larger pool of adjunct faculty to draw upon, Rossbacher said. In small Humboldt, the solution probably lies in the budget. For example, she said, when there's money to add faculty positions, make them tenure-track ones.
"But it doesn't happen in a single year," she said. "It's part of a longer, strategic plan."
The process for developing a new strategic plan — which happens every five or so years — has just begun.
"If strategic planning works the way it's supposed to, it will identify the major priorities for the institution," Rossbacher said. "And that will then help us with developing a whole set of implementation plans that focus on the academic programs, co-curricular programs, athletics, facilities, budget, housing ... and then that helps us understand where we need to invest our resources."
Back in her office, Rossbacher picked up a green Slinky from her desk and began to demonstrate the waves in an earthquake. With a straight nudge, the Slinky's rings rippled forward in compressional, in-line waves. With a twist, the Slinky started to wiggle with transverse waves, looking like a sidewinder. Compressional waves move faster and are the first ones you feel in an earthquake, Rossbacher said. The slower transverse waves come next. Eventually they mingle, but one might be able to tell how far away a quake is by noting the time lag between the two wave types, which increases with distance.
On a broad windowsill sat two soft globes: Earth and Mars. On her book shelves, a selection of mostly leadership and geology works, including the old field manual Rossbacher used on a geology trip in 1985 to Humboldt. Several slide rules sat on another shelf.
"This was my father's," she said, picking up one. "And this was my uncle's, who was an engineer." She lifted a third. "And this is what I used in college. I used to carry one in the glove compartment of my car and use it to calculate mileage. This was before cars had computers that would tell you what your miles per gallon were. People used to look at me like, 'Are you crazy?'"
But she's not stuck in the past. Geologic time, after all, stretches back to the beginning of time but also moseys and shakes right on up to the present. As soon as Rossbacher arrived in Humboldt, she got set up with Twitter and Instagram accounts. In one tweet, she says she found the Moon Trees — redwoods whose seeds orbited the moon in 1971 before being planted on campus.
"I'm not entirely in the rhythm of doing it yet," she said of the new social media. "But I find the two formats interesting in very different ways. The Twitter is really quick — so I've found myself really thinking about what the message should be."
Tango, Rossbacher's and Rhodes' Doberman, also has a Twitter account. On April 6, on a preview visit with her people, Tango tweeted (with Rossbacher's help), "The mouth of the Mad River looks like Dog Heaven to me!" An Aug. 10 tweet reveals that Tango has discovered how COLD the North Coast water is. But on Aug. 13, she tweeted, "I think I'm going to love being a California girl."

A B.C. woman who was awarded millions of dollars to help care for her brain-damaged son will have to go back to court to try to get the money because the judge in the lawsuit plagiarized most of his decision, a higher court has ruled.
Monica Cojocaru was awarded more than $5 million in April 2009 after successfully suing B.C. Women's Hospital and its medical staff for negligence during the birth of her son.
The child, Eric Cojocaru, was left with permanent brain damage after a complicated vaginal delivery in 2001.
B.C. Supreme Court Justice Joel Groves used more than 100 pages to lay out his ruling, including scathing criticism of three doctors involved in the birth, who Groves said had not properly informed the mother of the possible risks to the child.
However, two out of three judges on a B.C. Court of Appeal panel ruled Thursday that Groves copied, almost word for word, most of his decision.
The panel found more than 300 of the 368 paragraphs were almost identical to submissions made by the Cojocaru family's lawyer.
In its ruling, the Court of Appeal said Groves's reasons for judgment cannot be considered his own, don't meet the standard of public accountability and do not allow for meaningful review.
"A reasonable and informed observer could not be persuaded that the trial judge examined all of the evidence before him and made appropriate findings," the panel wrote.
The appeal court ordered a new trial.hullo! happy and blessed birthday!

Lipscomb University’s Center for Entrepreneurship will celebrate Global Entrepreneurship Week, Nov. 19-21, with a Battle of the Bands and business market on Bison Square.
Battle of the Bands
The Center presents the Battle of the Bands on Wednesday, Nov. 20, at 6 p.m. in Collins Alumni Auditorium. The event will feature several Lipscomb-based bands along with free food and Starbucks coffee for the first 100 students who attend.
Creating your own mark in music is not so different from creating your own mark in business. The Battle of the Bands is designed to encourage students to pursue their own venture in business as much as the musicians in the bands are pursuing their own ventures in entertainment.
A grand prize of $500 will be awarded for first place, $300 for second place and $150 for third place.
If you are interested in participating in the Entrepreneurship Week Battle of the Bands, contact Kristin Matthews at kdmatthews@lipscomb.edu.It’s almost that time of year when everyone starts thinking about their New Year’s resolutions and setting goals for the coming year. Before thinking about goals for 2014 though, I wanted to write about one of my goals that I set for myself at the start of 2013.
At the beginning of the year, I decided that I wanted to get back into running. I say get back into running because I had run track in high school and cross country in middle school. However, I stopped running after my sophomore year of high school, and hadn’t really done any form of running since. So, I set a goal for myself that I would get back into running in 2013. Conveniently, during the time I was setting this goal, I was helping out at Shelby.tv, where the founders, Reece and Dan, were stressing the importance of setting SMART goals, not only for the company, but for everyone on the team. SMART = Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely. Clearly, my goal was not very SMART. It wasn’t very measurable or specific. How far was I going to run? Was I going to run a certain number of times a week? In other words, how could I set myself up to successfully achieve my goal? Thinking about this a little more, I ultimately decided on a very specific goal. What started out as “start running again in 2013″ turned into “run a marathon before the end of 2013.” Unlike the original goal, the new goal was very specific, definitely measurable, and definitely timely. Now, as I said, I ran track in high school. More specifically, I did sprints. So, the farthest I had ever run at once was probably no more than five or six miles. So, setting a goal for myself of running 26.2 miles at one time may seem like it didn’t qualify as attainable or very realistic. However, I felt strongly about setting a goal that wouldn’t be too easy. I wanted to challenge myself and really get back into running. I knew that training for 26.2 would help me do so, so I decided to go for it.
The first thing I did was head to the Niketown in New York City and invest in a pair of running shoes and a watch which would help me track my running. Next, I did what I knew would keep me motivated with my running: I registered for a race. I set my sights on the Skunk Cabbage Classic Half Marathon in Ithaca during the month of April. It seemed like a great first step, and I had about three months to get ready. Then, I started running. I did the majority of my training in Ithaca, running all over Cornell’s campus. Training during the winter months in Ithaca was definitely not easy, but I was able to stay motivated, and ventured out into the snow and cold week after week to make sure I’d meet my goal.
In the beginning of April, I accepted an internship offer to spend the summer at Nike working on the Nike+ Running team. I would get the chance to work on the very products which I had been using to work towards achieving my goal. Excited by the opportunity, I became even more inspired to run. I successfully completed the Skunk Cabbage half in mid-April. 13.1 miles was now the furthest I’d ever run. I was so caught up on reaching this first milestone, that I stopped running. End of semester excitement, and schoolwork contributed to this stoppage, but it was no excuse. I didn’t run at all in May, and I definitely wasn’t on track to meet my goal anymore. Not to mention, I still hadn’t chosen a marathon to register for. I kept telling myself I was just too busy, and that I’d return to training once I started my internship. Being too busy is not a good excuse, and I’ve come to realize that it should never keep me from doing things I love, like running. I was right, however, that I would return to running once I got to Oregon for the summer.
Training did not go exactly as expected, as I got injured in the beginning of October, but I was determined to do my best to stay on course. I kept on path to meet my goal, and this past Sunday, I ran and finished the Philadelphia Marathon. It was a really great experience, and completely worth every second of effort I’ve put into running over the past 11 months. It’s really amazing how many complete strangers cheered me on, and helped keep me going throughout the race. Some of the highlights for me were high-fiving the Mayor of Philadelphia at the starting line, and then crossing the finish line 26.2 miles later.
Not only was I able to achieve my SMART goal of running a marathon in 2013, but in the process, I also achieved my goal of “getting back into running.” So, what’s next? I definitely plan on running more marathons in the future. I not only want to improve my time, but explore other cities around the world by running 26.2 miles through their streets. I also have my sights set on my first triathlon sometime in the near future, although I have a long road of training ahead of me for that. Something makes me think it’ll be worth it though.
Below are some pictures I took while running on campus.
Nice! One of my friends showed this to me, really enjoyed reading and could also relate to it. I have a similar story – did cross country and swimming in high school. Started running when I got to grad school at Cornell a couple of years ago. Tried keeping it fairly consistent, but really decided to train seriously this year. Did Skunk Cabbage in April and the Catharine Valley Half in August but don’t think I will do a full Marathon this year. Thanks again for sharing!
Running is the sense of my life for about 5 years. I completely agree with you about smart goals. It’s the most important thing…Revision as of 14:05, 23 August 2013
Mathys Kauffmann of Kriegstetten, Solothurn, Switzerland, was one of the Anabaptist preachers held in chains in the newly built penitentiary and orphanage in Bern, who were considered "the most important preachers and ringleaders" (see Bern). From 3 March 1659 to 10 September 1660, Kauffmann was there. Efforts of the council and the clergy to convert him were in vain. On 20 January 1660 the appointed persons "betook themselves to the Anabaptist business" in the penitentiary to give the Anabaptists an examination. On 16 points the prisoners had to give an account, covering doctrine, communion, baptism, and attitude to government. All remained true to their convictions. Kauffmann had been seized at Koppingen in the canton of Bern, at his daughter's home. Now he besought the council to release him because he wanted to go to Solothurn. According to a decision of the council of 15 June 1660, the prisoners were to be banished. On 27 August they were again cross-examined, but they still "persisted in their opinion, no matter what one tried with them." Kauffmann was then taken to the border via Brügg with the others on 10 September 1660 and banished.

That's up from 14.5 million shares, or 3.4%, as of March 31. Greenlight, in its May 29 investor letter, said it expects Seagate's earnings to reach $10 to $15 a share in 2012. The firm also argued that Seagate's share price remained at a very low multiple of both near-term and long-term earnings, even after the shares had climbed to $26.96 a share during the first quarter. In late trades Monday, Seagate shares rose nearly 2% to $23.05. The stock is up 48% over the last 12 months.

Where do you guys think Houston Alexander fits into the mix? I personally feel its way to early to tell a this point but he did get a lot of people talking by knocking out Jardine. Just looking back on his past fights, I don't see anything impressive that indicates that he will be anything more than a "flash in the pan" in the UFC. Yeah, he did beat Jardine but at least Jardine has the fan base and the name he gained from the Ultimate Fighter. Unless Houston backs this up with another impressive win, I don't see him hanging around for too long in the UFC.

In vitro meat, also referred to as cultured meat, is a meat product grown from extracted cells in a factory. It's a test concept introduced by researchers to combat many ethical issues found in today's industrial livestock operations. The meat's production would also contribute to reduced environmental impacts, global hunger solutions, human health promotion and obesity reduction.\
Within the next 35 years, a process only in its beginning stages could become the norm, replacing most traditional livestock meat we find on grocery store shelves today.
Initially, it sounds like something from a futuristic science fiction novel or a dystopian society. Meat grown in a factory is straight from "The Jetsons" or "Star Trek." It's out of the question and couldn't even be possible, right? Wrong, completely wrong.
Cultured meat is happening right now. In fact, it has already happened. The first in vitro hamburger was served in 2013 in London. The two year project was highly complicated and not economically sustainable, with the final price totaling a hefty $325,000. But what did the lucky few selected to taste the burger have to say? Their biggest complaints were that the burger didn't taste the same as one that comes from grazing livestock, and it was a bit dry.
Despite the burger falling short on the taste and consistency fields, hopefuls still see the potential and are trying to obtain more funding for their research. If more support and funding is provided, the concept can become large scale, allowing the price to drop and more types of "meat" to be created.
I use the term "create," but of course I must mention that many, if not most, creationists would be completely against not only the research, but the concept itself. Many believe that growing meat goes against what is natural. Creating meat in a test tube, adding our own flavoring, vitamins and additives would be overstepping our boundaries or even "playing God." There are even people who have gone as far as saying that it would be equivalent to serving up zombies on a plate.
It's buffoonery to go as far as calling the meat "zombie production", but how can the accusation be challenged when there are companies like BiteLabs arising? The company's basis is to produce salami made of tissue samples from celebrities. Gut reaction says that this is disturbing, and, more alarmingly, cannibalistic. But is it, really?
Challenging the traditional definition of cannibalism, it is decidedly not. The production and consumption of the salami would take place between two (or more, no judgement here) consensual adults. It would also fail to violate any U.S. laws against murder or body desecration. Maybe it's skin crawling and socially unacceptable, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it cannibalism. All Sweeney Todd jokes aside, if forced to use the word cannibalism, I'd say it is a form of "humane cannibalism," if anything.
This argument presents a problem in itself, though. Since in vitro meat production is such a challenging and fairly newly researched topic there are many gray areas and questions posed that are difficult to answer because of how our society views the ideas of life, naturalism, cannibalism and humane treatment of animals. For in vitro meat to be a success, these terms must be redefined or at least understood in relation to factory grown meat.
Educational briefings and infographics would have to be readily available for the public, or they would simply not understand what it is they would be eating and would be against the meat replacement. If people aren't able to understand and accept that factory grown meat follows the same development process that meat from traditional livestock does, they will not back the introduction of the meat into the market.
Researchers behind the factory meat growing process also present the argument that in vitro meat would technically qualify as a vegan food. Part of this idea is because it would be cruelty free and a non GMO product.
The vegan-friendly argument is backed by PETA, who introduced a $1 million contest in 2008. The rules of the contest laid out that the company who was able to produce the first marketable in vitro chicken meat would receive the prize.
Unfortunately, no one was successful before the deadline arrived, and the prize money went towards combating animal cruelty in today's meat production process. PETA still considered the contest to be a raging success, though, based on the leaps and bounds made in the research and understanding of in vitro meat.
As someone who practices vegetarianism, I can see both sides of the argument. Yes, there would be cruelty-free meat available, which is a benefit that conquers a few issues vegetarians and vegans have with industrial livestock productions. It wouldn't offer a solution, though, to diehards who are not simply skipping out on meat products because they promote animal cruelty.
Some, such as Pennsylvania State University environmental resource management sophomore and environmental sustainability enthusiast Emily Newman, will not be supporting the endeavor, cruelty free or not.
When asked if she would ever find herself eating cultured meat, Newman, who has been a vegetarian for nearly two years and even practiced veganism for a brief period said, "No, definitely not. Food comes from the ground. The earth is giving it to us. We can utilize it. That's it, no need for anything to be grown in a lab."
Most vegetarians and vegans would hold the same standard. To suggest that cultured meat would be vegan friendly is to redefine the core values which people who practice a plant based diet hold themselves to.
I, however, am a big fan of the idea, not because I would find myself chowing down on some factory grown burgers or shoveling test tube bacon in my mouth, but because people who see meat as a necessity for every meal, the people who are hurting our environment and relishing in their poor health habits, will finally be able to contain their socially and environmentally poisonous behavior.
Personally, I'm still holding out for the real wave of the future- the Spy Kids' food Rehydrator, or the Star Trek Food Replicator. Until the glorious day comes when they're introduced, in vitro meat will have to do, and I'm looking forward to it's mass introduction, societal acceptance and growth within the next few decades.

We have reaffirmed our Neutral recommendation on
Hologic
(
HOLX
) with a target price of $21.00.
The company's third quarter 2012 adjusted earnings of 35 cents
per share were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny,
though revenues of $470.2 million were short of the consensus
estimate. The reported quarter was challenging for Hologic with
economic uncertainties in Europe, slower sales cycles and
increasing pricing pressure. Apart from margin erosion on European
sales, revenues were impacted by more than $4 million because of
these headwinds.
Breast Health is the biggest segment of the company which
contributed 45% of revenues during the reported quarter. Within
this segment, sales of Dimensions continued to gain traction and
represented 71% of digital mammography revenues and 60% of units.
Although product revenues in the third quarter had slowed with
shift in orders from 2D systems to the 3D tomosynthesis systems,
the number of 3D systems in the domestic backlog increased 76%
sequentially. Besides, tomosynthesis upgrades represented
approximately 25% of total tomosynthesis unit sales in the third
quarter.
Based on installations made till the third quarter, the company
has achieved 45% of its goal to place 500-700 3D systems (and
targeting 60% at the end of fiscal 2012) in the US within the first
two years of approval. Moreover, we are encouraged to note that the
company has already achieved the 60% target after taking into
account units in backlog (that will be shipped in the fourth
quarter). We believe that a favorable reimbursement decision for
tomosynthesis, likely next year, should further drive growth.
Moreover, clinical results from some key studies are expected to be
published by the end of 2012.
Meanwhile, Hologic's Diagnostics business is expected to
strengthen with the acquisition of Gen-Probe. This franchise
recorded 10% growth with three-fourth coming from core diagnostics
businesses, primarily ThinPrep pap test and the balance coming from
molecular diagnostics products. We are also encouraged to note that
the launch of the Cervista HTA system has been well received in the
US market, with 30 units in the domestic market already installed,
resulting in positive customer feedback.
We are encouraged by Hologic's focus on the international market
that contributed 27% of its revenues during the reported quarter,
up from 25% in the prior quarter. Revenues from this region
increased 21% or 25% after considering unfavorable currency.
Despite the persistent economic uncertainties in Europe, Hologic
has been building its international infrastructure and fortifying
management resources, particularly in the emerging markets of
China, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.
Recently, Hologic receivedan unfavorable ruling in a patent
infringement suit with
Smith & Nephew
(

sipping guzzling down my fourth cup of coffee.It’s just one of those mornings.
This morning, I am continuing with my weekly series called ‘Training Talk Tuesdays’. For those of you who are new readers, each Tuesday, the running coach in me comes out and I write about training for a race of various distances. Hope you join in the fun each week and be sure to email me with any specific questions you may have that you want me to cover in this series. Contact me.
(Disclaimer: Although, I am a RRCA Certified Running Coach, the information, I post may not be right for you. Please speak with a medical professional before making any changes to your current routine).
When I first started running, I had a track coach guiding me and directing me as to how much and how hard to run.
I also had a team to train with and we all wanted to RACE. I was very interested in racing from the start. It seemed like an easy way to keep focused on goals and use them to measure how I can grow over the years.
After I graduated, I took a few years off from racing and instead got involved in other activities, group fitness classes, surfing and lots of outdoor activities.
But when I reentered into the race scene, I was operating under one theory: the more I run, the better I will be. I understood that I needed rest days, but I really always thought that more mileage was better. So that’s what I did, I ran high mileage weeks (what was considered to be high for me 60- 65 mile weeks).
It didn’t hurt that at the time I was living in California where the weather was perfect for year round outdoor runs. Between balancing work, graduate school and running a non profit organization, running seemed like the most efficient exercise. I could get dressed, run out my front door, and be done with my workout. No driving to the gym. No fighting with the surf report and dragging my surfboard down to the beach. No waiting for a group fitness class to begin.
I really loved to run, too, so I thought doing any other exercise was kind of silly and pointless.
And then… I started to feel overtrained. No serious injuries but just felt the effects of over training: tired, irritable, restless sleep and changes to my appetite. You can read more about overtraining syndrome here.
I started to question EVERYTHING about my nutrition and training. Why was I getting so tired and my running buddies were not? I was eating enough calories from quality foods (under fueling is a big cause of injury). I wondered if my body just wasn’t designed for running. I was wearing proper shoes (got fitted at a specialty running store) And I didn’t think I was overtraining.
The trouble was that when I asked myself, “Am I overtraining?” I was looking at overall weekly mileage. I was running 60 to 70 miles or so a week while prepping for a marathon and didn’t think that seemed too high. In fact, it seemed low compared to my friends’ training plans.
The problem wasn’t my total mileage – it was running on back-to-back days for weeks. I would run Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday; do long runs on Saturday; and cross train or rest on Sunday.
Once I realized back-to-back runs every week, were the culprit, I stopped doing them… and guess what? Most of my nagging side effects disappeared. The moment I slipped up and started to run back-to-back again for a few weeks, my body and mind began to tell me.
A benefit to not doing back-to-back runs was that I was forced to incorporate other forms of exercise into my routine. And that’s when I really began to fall in love with yoga, fitness classes and long family walks.
Many people can run back-to-back weeks without problems. Some people can also run 100-mile ultra marathons. Heh. I cannot, and that’s okay! I just needed to figure out what worked for MY body, not someone else’s. Maybe one day I will be able to run that 50k I have my eye on, but not now in my current season of life. I’m trying to juggle too much and my body feels the effects.
The other day, someone asked me to list my top running rules. My personal rules are:
1) Always have fun!
2) Never be ashamed or afraid to walk. You are still a runner.
3) Try to avoid running back-to-back days for weeks.
4) Enjoy cross training – you need it! It provides a mental and physical break from running.
I hope these four rules allow me to run for many, many years.
What are your personal running ‘rules’? Can you run back-to-back days?
Your PERSONAL goals are spot on and great reminders to keep at the forefront of our training! Thanks for sharing!
Thank YOU for stopping by : )
I don’t run, I figure skate, but overtraining can be a big issue for skating, too. It’s hard because skating is so detail-oriented and you have to train the same moves over and over to improve. I always take a rest day each week, that’s a day with no exercise at all. And I don’t jump every day that I skate, some days I just do footwork.
I can imagine how it can be an issue for skating and dancing as well. So glad you are taking time to rest Mary! Thanks for stopping by : )
I try to avoid running back to back days. I have never run that many miles in one week (my max is probably around 30!) but I always feel off if I run 2 days in a row. I’ll take a long walk, yoga, or do some strength training to stay active on “off” days.This is one of the fastest selling products throughout the United Kingdom for everyday household use.

DUNEDIN, Fla. – No matter what you’ve heard about how unpleasant colonoscopies are, Susan Brady hopes her story will convince you they’re a whole lot better than the possible alternatives.
“Many people are afraid or embarrassed to get a colonoscopy,” said Brady, 52, a product manager with a software company. “They buy into the hype about how terrible the prep is, how you have to drink this liquid that doesn’t taste great and how you have to stay near a toilet.
“But colonoscopies save lives and they are nothing – nothing – compared to cancer, the treatments and their potential side effects.”
Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the survival rate is improving, and experts credit screening, especially colonoscopy, which catches cancers early and even allows polyps to be found and removed before they become malignant.
A 20-year study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that colonoscopies cut the rate of deaths from colorectal cancers by 53 percent.
Two years ago, Brady experienced periodic rectal bleeding over two months. At first, she thought it might be hemorrhoids. But with a family history of colon cancer – an aunt and cousin both died of the disease – she decided to visit the doctor, who scheduled a colonoscopy.
During the procedure, a thin, flexible lighted tube is inserted into the rectum and colon to check for polyps while the patient is sedated.
In Brady’s case, a Stage IIA rectal cancer was found. It had penetrated the muscle layer of the rectum but hadn’t yet pierced the rectum wall.
“I was in shock,” she said. “I worked out, ate right, felt good and had a colonoscopy just three years earlier.”
She believes her cancer was fast-growing, and that’s why it wasn’t seen on that first screening.
The National Cancer Institute () predicts there will be more than 143,000 new cases of colorectal cancer in the United States this year and more than 51,000 deaths from the disease.
“It’s so preventable,” Brady said. “People need to educate themselves about the disease and its symptoms.”
Brady’s diagnosis was followed by a series of barium enemas and endoscopic ultrasounds of the rectum, as well as radiation and chemotherapy administered over six weeks.
The chemo made her tired, she said, but the radiation was “literally a pain in the butt.” Five days a week, she’d lie on the table, stomach down, bladder full (to move organs apart), as doctors used radiation targeted to destroy cancer cells.
As bad as it sounds, she said it was tolerable until about the fourth week, when she started experiencing incredible pain. Bowel movements felt like “shards of glass,” she said.
“You get to the point where you don’t want to eat anything because you don’t want it coming out,” she said.
She lost about 15 pounds during the radiation treatment.
After that came surgery to remove the remnants of the cancer. Next up was an ileostomy, a procedure that creates a surgical opening of the small intestine so waste can be collected in an external pouch, bypassing the colon and giving the rectal area time to recover from the surgery.
Brady lived with the pouch for six months. She sports a 3-inch scar from the procedure.
While dealing with the bag on her stomach, she also received a round of preventive chemotherapy with the drug Oxaliplatin. It targets stray cancer cells that may have spread to other parts of the body, but can have severe side effects.
In September, on a trip to Boston for a funeral, Brady woke up and couldn’t feel her hands or her lower legs and feet. She was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, a side effect of the drug.
She had balance problems. Trouble walking. Shoes were too painful to wear.
She’s trying to speed up her recovery with a regimen of yoga, massage, warm-water workouts and occasional hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatments, in which she receives concentrated levels of oxygen inside a sealed chamber.
The oxygen “provides a good environment for cells to regenerate,” she said. “I always feel better afterwards.”
The neuropathy is slowly subsiding; doctors say her prognosis is very good.
Brady said the love and support of her family, especially Michael, her husband of 22 years, helped her along the difficult journey.
“Nothing about the cancer is glamorous,” she said. “Nothing about the treatment is easy. But it beats the heck out of dying.”

Great!Who is Dante’s traveling companion and what is significant about this person serving as Dante’s guide in Dante's Inferno?
1 Answer | Add Yours
Virgil is Dante’s traveling companion in Dante’s Inferno. Virgil is a poet from Ancient Rome who appears in ghost form, but he comes to Dante and guides him through the Inferno. Virgil is significant because Dante is alluding to and calling on poets of the past, hearkening to the Ancient Roman roots of his civilization.
Dante loses his way on the path to God and ends up in a frightening underworld. He encounters Virgil, a man who “seemed from long-continued silence hoarse” (Canto 1). Dante first asks Virgil if he is a man or not, and Virgil replies that he was. He goes on to describe his life.
I born, though it was late,
And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,
During the time of false and lying gods.
A poet was I… (Canto 1)
Apparently, the path is treacherous. Virgil explains this.
Many the animals with whom she weds,
And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound
Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain. (Canto 1)
Virgil knows the way, and tells Dante that he can show him where to go. It is significant that Virgil seems to have shed his own culture in favor of a Christian one. Dante is re-writing history. While Virgil may have turned to God and can help Dante, he can only do so to a point. Virgil’s influence is long gone. Dante belongs to a more advanced, more sophisticated, more righteous culture than Virgil.

Brass can be cleaned using solvents, aqueous chemicals or emulsions. The metal must be cleaned to remove oily soils that would otherwise act as an interference coating, hampering paint adhesion. After cleaning, pretreatments to remove corrosion products can be applied.
One such brass pretreatment is bright dipping. This is done by immersing the brass in an acidic solution. Bright dip solutions are available from electroplating chemical suppliers. Suppliers of bright dips can be found at on the Suppliers page and are listed on pages 342-343 in the 2000 Products Finishing Directory.

Posted by: Michael M. O'Hear
Category: Criminal Law & Process, Public, Wisconsin Criminal Law & Process
1 Comment »
Wisconsin has already had two sentencing commissions, now both defunct. Is it time to think about a third? Sentencing commissions have proven their worth over the long haul in a number of other states, including Minnesota, North Carolina, and Virginia. A successful sentencing commission promulgates guidelines that channel judicial sentencing discretion and reduce sentencing disparities, collects and analyzes sentencing data in order to support evidence-based decision making, and provides information and recommendations to the legislature than can help to blunt some of the political system’s tendencies to excessive harshness. Although it is certainly not cost-free, a good commission may ultimately save the state far more than is required to fund its operations.
With these considerations in mind, the latest edition of the Marquette University Law School Poll asked respondents their views of commissions and of judicial sentencing discretion. (For my earlier posts on the Poll, see here and here.) The results indicate that there is substantial support for a commission, but that Wisconsinites also appreciate what their locally elected judges bring to the table as sentencers.
In response to the key question on sentencing commissions (27g), 61% of respondents agreed that “[i]t would be better to have an expert sentencing commission set state sentencing policies, rather than elected politicians.” With only 23% disagreeing, views ran almost 3 to 1 in favor of a commission.
But the question was not without its ambiguities. What does it mean to “set state sentencing policies”? Would that include promulgating binding sentencing guidelines? Advisory guidelines? Also, how many of the “agree” respondents, if any, thought, “I’d really rather not have any statewide sentencing policies at all, but if someone is going to create statewide policies, I’d prefer to have an expert commission over the elected politicians.” Relatedly, if the Poll indicates greater trust in a commission than in “elected politicians,” where do judges fit in? They are elected, but we don’t normally think of them as politicians in the same sense that legislators are.
Additional questions focused on judges more specifically. For instance, respondents were asked whether they agreed that “judges in Wisconsin treat criminals too leniently.” Opinion was closely divided, but, with the “disagrees” beating the “agrees” 42% to 36%, there does not seem to be a strong, widespread view that Wisconsin judges are too soft.
On the flipside, are Wisconsin judges seen as too tough? Probably not — only 27% felt that “[m]any of the people who are locked up in prison do not deserve to be there.” (27d)
One perceived strength of sentencing judges is suggested by 27f: 52% of respondents agreed, and only 30% disagreed, that “sentencing judges do a good job of taking into account the needs and perspectives of crime victims.”
Another potential strength of sentencing judges is their ability to take into account local circumstances when fashioning a sentence. Such localization is, of course, in tension with the competing goal of statewide uniformity in sentencing. Wisconsinites seem closely divided on this question of localization versus uniformity, but 27h suggests that localization may have a bit more support: when asked whether “[i]t is important for Wisconsin to have uniform, statewide sentencing policies, even if that means that judges have less freedom to take into account local needs and values in determining sentences,” only 41% agreed, while 48% disagreed.
In sum, on sentencing matters, it seems that Wisconsinites have more confidence in an expert commission than in elected politicians. On the other hand, there does not seem to be widespread concern about the performance of the state’s sentencing judges, and there is some real appreciation for the ability of judges to tailor sentences based on victim needs and local circumstances. A new Wisconsin sentencing commission might play a valuable role as a source of information and analysis for policymakers and sentencing judges — possibly, but not necessarily, embodied in the form of advisory sentencing guidelines — but mandatory guidelines might be seen by many as undercutting some important benefits of judicial sentencing discretion.

I am sure we could use a third. But first we should analyze why the first two were dissolved. Better yet, a rational discussion of racial disparity, the proportion of our citizens who are in prison, and what exactly constitutes a “crime” are all matters that should be discussed but are not. We have developed a dual track system of criminal justice in this country.
The rich and powerful are largely immune from prosecution, no matter what they do. At the other end, draconian sentences are handed down to the poor and unconnected for trivial crimes. Many politicians have no interest in hard, objective data because that does not suit their purposes. Until we get past that, and we most likely never will, our criminal justice system will continue to be a profit center that mocks the concept of “Equal Justice Under Law.”The 99 Lounge

“For me, just the fact that we’re even in the mix, that we threw offers out there to these elite guys, is exciting,” Staal said. ”For us to be involved and make a pitch, it was big. We aren’t far off. We’ve got some very good pieces in place, and if we can add, like they’re saying, another elite forward, it will definitely put us in the mix among the top teams in the Eastern Conference. It’s exciting. I hope they’ll continue to push — and not just grab anybody, but the right person for our group.”
Sounds to me as if Staal is hoping that his Hurricanes will continue to place a few inquiries to a couple of general managers looking to move a talented winger for the right price.

Beijing (AsiaNews
/ Agencies) - Chinese security forces
have killed a Tibetan and arrested six others as they tried to disperse a demonstration of 1000 people against the resumption of mining in the county of Markham.
According to the news released by Radio
Free Asia, the police fired tear gas and live
ammunition into the crowd that
had gathered and was marching towards the site of the mine.
In
the past there had been large demonstrations, but the police had always managed to disperse them without too much violence. The man killed was called Nyima, the names of only five of the six arrested are known: Dawa, Atsong, Phuntsog Nyima, Jamyang Wangmo and Kelsang Yudron.
Chinese mining has often led to clashes with the Tibetan population who denounce
the companies for failing to respect the sacredness of area
and the ecological impact of mining.
The Tibetan subsoil is rich in copper, chromium, iron,
gold, silver, potassium, and natural gas. Last year, the Chinese government increased in
mining investment in the region.
Meanwhile, one of the two young men who
set themselves on fire Aug. 13 in Ngaba is reported to have died. He is 21 year old layman Tashi, a former student at the Kirti monastery
(Sichuan).
On 14 August, the restaurants and shops of Tibetan Nagba closed
their doors in a sign of mourning. Following the two self-immolation, the leaders of the Kirti monastery were called by the government authorities
for questioning.The five star Hotel Ambassador–Zlatá Husa is located in the centre of Prague in the middle of Wenceslas Square. The hotel is near historical monuments, cultural and commercial centres, luxury shopping centres, restaurants, clubs and cafes.

His wife, Nerida Cortese, said each year they either travelled to Australia to visit her family or across New Zealand to visit Mr Cortese's family, which she said was dotted all over the place.
"This summer is the first one we can enjoy in the house we have made our own over the last 18 months," she said. "Don't get me wrong, we all adore our family, it's just an exciting first."
The couple said their ideal summer needed sun, sand, seafood and plenty of shopping.
"My favourite things to do during summer are visit local beaches as a family or with friends, spending all afternoon at a barbecue and enjoying the warmish evenings in the sun," said Mrs Cortese.
Their decision to stay home meant they could take part in the local Christmas lights competition and take trips to the local pool to watch their sons swim while they chatted with friends, before spending afternoons in the sun.
"Our yard is a great sun-catcher, where Shane and I enjoy the odd Pimms of a late afternoon."
They said last summer was spent travelling, by train, to Wellington to spend Christmas with Mr Cortese's family. After this they rented a bach in Papamoa.

Phil Trexler / Ohio Beacon Journal | October 14 2006
An anti-war demonstration in Akron that drew 200 people last year also drew the attention of military officials investigating the protesters for ``potential terrorist activity.''
The release of documents, reported Friday by The New York Times, revealed the federal government had maintained records on the ``Stop the War Now'' rally held in Akron on March 19, 2005, as well as dozens of other demonstrations held across the country.
The Akron event was sponsored by the Northeast Ohio American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group that bills itself as nonviolent and peaceful.
``It's chilling, intimidating and ridiculous knowing that the government is looking at events like ours, a public event advertised as being legal and nonviolent, and deems it a potential terrorist event,'' said Greg Coleridge, director of the group's economic justice program.
``We were doing nothing more than expressing our Bill of Rights rights to organize and speak freely, and for that the government considers it threatening. What a waste of resources -- human and financial.''
The Defense Department's release of documents showed that accounts of 1,500 ``suspicious incidents'' had been maintained in a government database longer than allowed, including after it was determined that no threat to military buildings or personnel existed, the Times reported.
A defense spokesman told the newspaper that the practice of ``questionable data collection'' had led to changes to ensure that only information on viable threats of terrorism was being collected.
Coleridge said the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio became involved in seeking the release of the government documents on the Akron rally and another anti-war meeting held in Cleveland in November 2004.
The Akron rally included a march past a downtown military recruiting office and a stop at the federal courthouse. Coleridge said the rally was marked by the presence of people he suspects were government officials sitting in unmarked cars taking pictures of the protesters.
Akron police say they were present at the rally, but not at the behest of federal officials. Videotapes were taken for security purposes, said assistant law director Mike Defibaugh.
``What Akron police did was solely and simply based on municipal policing and nothing in conjunction with the federal government,'' Defibaugh said.
Gary Daniels, an ACLU of Ohio spokesman, said the monitoring, surveillance and labeling of peaceful groups is troubling.
Daniels said the ACLU is still waiting to learn through the release of more government records who was responsible for the surveillance and reports on the rally and meeting.
``It's a concern because when you go out in public and express your views and dissent against the government and this surveillance is done, what you have is people being chilled by Big Brother,'' Daniels said. ``It also gives the impression that the government will do what it can to keep it from occurring. This is not something you want in a free and civil society.''

BookmarksiCycle information provided by her iPhone device, is now available in Spanish.
“There are more than 35 million people in the U.S. and 400 million people worldwide for whom Spanish is the primary language,” said Leslie Heyer, President of Cycle Technologies. “It makes sense for this valuable family planning tool to be accessible to Spanish speakers. We plan to make iCycleBeads available in additional languages and through other smart phone devices in the near future so that eventually this birth control option can be used by anyone with a smart phone, anywhere.”
The Spanish language version of iCycleBeads will be presented at the Symposium for mHealth Strategy in Latin America in Lima, Peru March 25-26.
iCycleBeads is based on the Standard Days Method®, a family planning method that:
- Was developed through extensive analysis of reproductive physiology data, tested in large-scale clinical trials, and proven more than 95% effective at preventing pregnancy.
- Is the fastest growing natural family planning option available having been used by +2.5 million women worldwide in more than 50 countries using the visual tool CycleBeads®.
- Was developed by the Institute for Reproductive Health at Georgetown University.
To use iCycleBeads a woman enters into the “app” the starting date of her most recent period. At the touch of a button, the app shows her where she is in her cycle and whether she is on a day when pregnancy is likely or not.The information is provided on a virtual representation of CycleBeads or a calendar. The user will also receive customizable alerts for the first and last days of her “fertile window” (the days when she is able to get pregnant), when she can expect to get her next period, and to remind her to enter her cycle data.

“I grew up with Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short, and I love them. Three Amigos is a goofy fun film, with everything you would expect from these comedians. Three Amigos is a fun little slapstick comedy film, I for one enjoyed it when I was young and still do now. For me Steve Martin in the 80's was his best times, I remember watching a lot of his stuff when I was a kid, and laughing my ass off.

Up On The Roof
Matthew Sweeney Children's Poems
Up On The Roof...
Up on the Roof
Up on the roof of a church
was a small, blond boy
and a black and white kitten.
Down below, the priest
was praying aloud,
pleading with God,
asking him to keep
this small boy from falling,
down from his church.
He couldn’t phone the mother
as he didn’t know her,
and cats all looked the same.
When the verger appeared
with a telescopic ladder
the priest closed his eyes
and, gripping his rosary,
he prayed in the dark until
the verger began to climb.
The boy was on his feet now
calling the kitten
who refused to move.
‘Sit down,’ begged the priest,
in an almost whisper
so as not to alarm the boy
who paid no attention,
walking over the slates
as if on the pavement
or as if he had wings -
with the sun in his hair
he looked like an angel.
When the verger’s bald head
rose above the drainpipe
the boy had the kitten
and was walking back,
along the ridge,
with a beatific smile.

Wrong. Hover the graphs. They use latest builds of safari and chrome (or nitro and V8 if you want).
We all know that FF is currently a bit slow. The question is, will FF4 be back among the others ? It seems that it might be the case. And the worst is that in the end, it does not matter : as a user, what's most important is not page rendering speed, it's UI responsiveness, and no benchmark currently measures this. E.g : IE7&IE8 take several seconds to open a tab when under load, FF3.5 was about as bad, though a bit faster (don't remember about 3.6), and on all other browsers the process is instant. ".UCL News

Nigel Waugh, Director of Human ResourcesMaking the District More of a Democracy
FairVote's Adam Fogel shows how Washington, DC can move toward the goal of universal voter registration before it receives a vote in Congress.
As the National Rifle Association and its congressional allies hold the D.C. Voting Rights Act hostage, there is an important opportunity to reflect on what democracy means for the District of Columbia. Beyond debating issues of home rule or statehood, the D.C. Council should consider reforms that would increase voter turnout, improve civic education and expand opportunities for political participation.
This year, council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) convened a hearing to look at ways to modernize D.C. elections and expand access to the polls. The District falls below the national voter turnout average, and a quarter to a third of D.C. residents are not even registered to vote. The reforms that the council is considering -- Election Day registration, no-excuse absentee voting and early voting -- are good first steps, but the council should think much bigger if the goal is to make the District a beacon of democracy.
For example, consider the goal of universal voter registration. Our voter registration system is a relic of the past. Since the turn of the 19th century, politicians have advocated for voter registration laws to limit the number of eligible voters; the goal was to manipulate the composition of the electorate. Living with this system, which was designed to keep people from participating, has given Americans a sort of complex. Conventional wisdom says that we don't vote because of apathy or because we aren't paying attention, but the reality is that the system itself erects barriers to participation that many people cannot maneuver around -- leading to dismal American voter registration and participation compared with other democracies.
To increase participation and engage all citizens, we must change the way we think about voting in this country and in the District. Most other democracies in the world place the burden of preparing for elections on the government -- not the individual voter. Instead of expecting people not to show up on Election Day, as we do in the United States, most democracies anticipate participation by developing full and accurate voter rolls. In short, we need a paradigm shift from the current self-initiated, opt-in system to one where citizens start out on the voter rolls and opt out if they choose.
To begin modernizing the District's voter registration system, the D.C. Council should set a uniform voter registration age of 16, as Florida and Hawaii have done. This common-sense policy would allow schools to conduct systematic voter registration drives, increase registration at the Department of Motor Vehicles through "motor voter" programs and give these newly registered voters time to learn about candidates and issues. Currently, young people often leave high school without knowing the mechanics of participation because they were too young to register.
Another proposal is for the D.C. Board of Elections to prepare the voter rolls by automatically registering all citizens to vote through existing databases. Using tax forms, public assistance agency records and the driver's license database would increase the accuracy of the voter rolls and decrease the need for outside groups to register voters before each election. This policy would not only increase the District's registration rate, but it would also alleviate some of the burden on local election officials close to Election Day.
As we wait (and wait) for Congress to act and finally give the District its well-deserved right to vote in Congress, the city can take action now to make sure it is prepared to take advantage of that vote. The D.C. Council can enact polices that would increase voter registration and participation, showing the rest of the country that Washington doesn't just talk about the vote -- but actually does it.
The writer is Right to Vote Director at FairVote.Duluth, MN (NNCNOW.com) --- Voters could have the last word on raising Minnesota's minimum wage. A bill calling for a referendum on the issue is under consideration by the senate rules committee right now.
The amendment was introduced yesterday and if passed by the House and Senate, voters would determine if the state's minimum wage should increase automatically with inflation.
The referendum calls for raising the minimum wage from 6.15 to 9.50 an hour over the next three years... then grow with inflation for years to come.

Standard Article by Brent Bartsch
Issue: Property Rights
The group calling themselves North Dakota Hunters for Fair Chase has been advocating an initiated measure banning commercialized game farming for several years now. Recently, the group was able to collect enough signatures to put it on this November’s ballot as Initiated Statutory Measure No. 2. Now, whether one favors patronizing deer and elk ranchers is their own personal choice (at least it is for right now) and beside the point. The point is that this measure is an assault on private property rights and thus on freedom. Perhaps the best illustration of this is an email sent out by the Chair of the Sponsoring Committee for the measure, Mr. Roger Kaseman, on October 2nd. While attempting to debate the opponents of his group’s measure, the reasoning used is contemptuous of the basic foundations of the freedoms enjoyed by Americans. To give him the full benefit of his own words, his email is quoted at length:
“The High Fence Canned Hunt Operators claim an absolute right to do with their property what they want. They argue that Measure 2 will violate their property rights. That sounds good, but is fallacious and misleading. A right must have a Constitutional origin.”
This is squarely at odds with the American tradition of natural and inalienable rights. Government is created to protect the rights of men (and women) – not to grant them their rights. This is also why so-called positive rights, which are dreamed up by politicians and bestow benefits on one group at the expense of another group, are anathema to traditional or so-called negative rights. In order for government to grant someone a positive right or benefit, they must necessarily violate other persons’ traditional (negative) rights.
The fact that state constitutions sometimes list (negative) rights is thus redundant, but done in order to provide emphasis. This can be thought of in much the same way as the First and Second Amendments to the U.S. Constitution were thought to be redundant, because the federal government was not granted the power to infringe on speech or on the right to bear arms in the original document.
“The United States Constitution does not establish the property right the Canned Hunt operators claim. The authors of the Constitution did not write property rights into the document because Southern delegates claimed human beings as property. Northern delegates would not agree to the right to buy, sell or own human beings. North and South agreed to leave property rights to the individual states.”
While no one should claim that the U.S. Constitution grants property rights – remember, the American tradition is such that our rights do not come from government – this is a tortured interpretation of constitutional history. The dispute cited above actually had more to do with how slaves would be counted for the purposes of representation in the House of Representatives (because of the repercussions that would have on the distribution of political power in the new federal government) and less to do about slavery itself – unfortunately. Nevertheless, it is true that the broad police powers were left to the individual states, thus leaving the states with the ability to take away property rights via legislation if they so chose. But, like we wish the Southern States had not denied slaves their natural property right of self-ownership, freedom would be greatly enhanced if states used this power sparingly, such as by refraining from banning commercial game farms.
“Article 1, Section 1 of North Dakota state constitution, states that an individual has the right to, ‘…. acquire, possess, and protect property….’”
Again, the state constitution is just reiterating that individuals have the right to property. Governments can protect rights and they can take away rights through laws, but they can not create them. If the North Dakota constitution was silent on the issue, the right to property would still exist.
“The right to acquire and possess comes with the duty to protect. Society, not the individual property owner, decides how best to protect property. An individual can’t buy a piece of property and bury toxic waste simply by asserting a property right. Society decides where we bury toxic waste, not individual land owners based of (sic) a phony property right.”
This shows nothing but confusion. The right to property does not require that an individual protect her property, no more than the 2nd Amendment requires an individual to own a gun. That is the whole point of property rights – it is up to the owner to decide what shall be done. Moreover, in the example cited, “society” (i.e., government) is not deciding how to protect property (as if all property is collectively owned by the government), but is instead defending the property rights of others. While the vast majority of people would not bury toxic waste in their backyard (it tends to ruin home values), the exercise of the police power of a state in order to prevent violation of others’ property rights is vastly different than what Kaseman’s group wants to do. As opposed to defending the property rights of others, Measure 2 would violate the property rights of others. In other words, Measure 2 is the toxic waste.
“Property rights are subordinate to the due process of law. The people, through their elected representatives or by initiated measure, decide what that law will be.
In 2000, Montana voters passed a voter initiated measure that outlawed Canned Hunt operations. Montana High Fence operators filed suit claiming the measure violated their rights. They lost in District Court, the Montana Supreme Court, the United States District Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and in the United States Supreme Court. Lawyers for the Canned Hunt operators could not cite a single court case that supported the argument that the Montana Measure violated any right.”
Yes, the states can take away property rights. This is widely acknowledged. But Kaseman’s group needs to admit that their measure means to take away property rights, instead of pretending otherwise by saying such things as, “They [opponents] argue that Measure 2 will violate their property rights. That sounds good, but is fallacious and misleading.”
[Emphasis in the original.][Emphasis in the original.]
“Article 11, Section 27 of the North Dakota Constitution declares that: ‘Hunting, trapping, and fishing and the taking of game and fish are a valued part of our heritage and will be forever preserved for the people and managed by law and regulation for the public good.’
Penning selectively bred, hand raised, hand fed deer and elk inside an escape proof fence and selling a guaranteed shot at the animal threatens our hunting heritage in direct violation of Section 27.”
Apparently, it doesn’t violate Article 11, Section 27. That is why this group finds it necessary to pass a new law. It is also terribly unclear how commercial game farms – essentially, the domestication of animals – threatens hunting. There are a lot of things in our modern world that threaten hunting to some degree, but this is analogous to saying that chicken farmers threaten grouse and pheasant hunting. If anything, commercial game farms expand the opportunity for city dwellers and others, such as those who have handicaps, to get some experience, albeit much less than on a wild hunt, with the reality of how their dinner gets served.
In conclusion, with twisted logic, a confused understanding of history, particularly in regards to the American tradition of natural liberty, and contradictory statements, Kaseman pretty much runs the gauntlet of ridiculousness with this one. Instead of trying to bamboozle the public with this nonsense, he should stick to talking about his group’s main point – killing animals is cruel – and leave it at that. However, while this would please the Humane Society of the United States, it seems unlikely that this message would do as well with the North Dakota electorate at large.

It’s become exaggerated over the years, this story about how [Tinkers] was rejected by every publisher in the universe. The reality is that I met with a copious but common amount of rejection. I received some rejection letters that said nobody wants to read quiet, metaphysical novels. One of them actually said nobody wants to read a novel written from more than one point of view. I wrote a metaphysical, contemplative, more-than-one-point-of-view novel.
Had the Pulitzer not happened, its worldly career would have still exceeded my wildest expectations. The day it came out, it was briefly noted in The New Yorker. I think pretty much every American newspaper reviewed it more or less favorably. Then, in the middle of April [2010], we won the Pulitzer. That was like the world turning inside out, like those cartoons where your eyes jump out of your head and your brain comes flying out.
I started Enon in March 2009, a few months after Tinkers came out. I got this articulated silhouette of an exaggerated hill studded with headstones. At the top of the hill was a guy sort of creeping along. I just knew that was Charlie Crosby [grandson of the protagonist of Tinkers] and at the bottom of that hill his daughter is buried.
What I’ve realized is that I could not be less interested in autobiography. I could not be less interested in myself, but I could not be more interested in the fact that I am a self. So the Enon cemetery is the cemetery in Wenham, where I grew up. I just try to write things that are beautiful, which is not to say things that are pretty. Basically, what I want to do with my reader is break your heart and blow your mind. As a writer, I want to reproduce the things I most love when I read.

Matches Santa Barbara sectional perfectly Poor quality control on this ottoman
This is not Overstock.com's fault. However, I received the product and it has a multitude of defects. First, the underside of the ottoman has a zip pocket in the liner containing the legs and hardware. Wonderful, except the liner was ripped open, exposing the underneath of the ottoman. Inside the ottoman was a packet of silica pellets, which was split open, and were rolling around inside the ottoman. Next, I noticed the legs would not attach squarely, due to off center mounting holes and cage nuts. Next, there are literally dozens of strings hanging off the ottoman, that would have to be clipped. Once I got past that, there was a rip in the corner of the fabric, near the bottom of the ottoman. To top it off, there is some manufacturing debris (tape, wood, or paper), underneath the fabric. This would not be a deal breaker, other than its dead center on the top side of the ottoman. Every time you sit on it or move your foot, sounds like you are crumpling paper. Honestly, I cannot believe this thing passed any sort of quality control during manufacture. I would say the size and color is perfect. I called Overstock.com to request a return/replacement, and will give it one more chance. Perhaps the one received was just a lemon. I am not happy with the inconvenience of returning, and was not offered any compensation when I called to complain, just an offer to return/replace.
Perfect
I don't know what I was thinking when I decided to order a sectional online. I don't know what I would have done if I had hated it. With that said, I could not have been more pleased. I was looking for a linen style sectional with the nailheads for my sunroom and found none in my area. This sofa came and it is absolutely perfect and the price is outstanding! I have found that when the seating is too soft then my back will hurt if I sit for long periods. The deep seat cushions are sturdy and supportive, but not too hard and the sofa is well made. I rated the style as Good, just because having a type A personality I would have wished that the back pillows were attached, however since they are not the covers are removable should you want to dryclean them, as are the seating covers. I am now considering buying the matching ottoman.
Made Well, Sturdy and Comfy Ottoman!
We bought the sectional, needed the matching ottoman piece, everything is great about the Santa Barbara Abbyson set, it is made extremely well, compared to other products that are 2-3 times as much, and believe me we've done the research, it can be used as a tray, magazines, foot rest, the works, it's great and looks great! Thank you, Overstock. also came brilliantly packaged and within a week from order date.
too much bounce
I ordered this and the sectional. This came in 1st. If this is an indication of the sectional that's on it's way I am not going be happy. This ottoman is really lightweight. When you sit on it your body bounces a few seconds. I HATE that. It does wrinkle when used. I know it's for feet but I have grandkids who will love to jump on this too bouncy thing. It should have had some fabric protection but didn't. I put scotch guard on it. I am sorry I ordered this and cringe every time I think of the sectional to match that's on it's way. You get what you pay for. I read others reviews about the sectional and bought into the hype. I wish I could talk to someone who's had the thing over a year to see what's going on with it at this point.

“Weeds are survivors,” said Lee Van Wychen, director of science policy for the Weed Science Society of America.  impact of rising carbon dioxide levels on weeds can be striking. In a study conducted by Lewis Ziska of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service, weeds grown under urban conditions of warmer temperatures and more carbon dioxide — conditions anticipated for the rest of the world in 50 years — grew to four times the height of those in a country plot 40 miles outside the city, where carbon dioxide and temperature reflected background conditions.
So what if there are a few more weeds? Well, Ziska last said.
.”Comment
MILTON, Ga. – Several people were observed via hidden camera taking a $2,500 wood splitter from an abandoned property July 13.
A neighbor told police he saw a gate broken down on an abandoned property on Mountain Road. Feeling this was suspicious, the neighbor installed a hunting trail camera on a nearby tree. A few days later, July 12, the camera picked up two people – a man in camouflage gear and a woman in jeans and a T-shirt – enter the property then leave. The next day, the camo man returned with another man carrying an air compressor at 3:55 a.m. Ten minutes later, the men were seen carting a wheel-mounted wood splitter out of the property. The splitter had flat tires, necessitating the air compressor.
MH-7-30Robert L. Woodson, Sr., is founder and president of the
National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise (NCNE)
. Often referred to as the godfather of the movement to empower neighborhood-based organizations, Bob Woodson's social activism dates back to the 1960's, when as a young civil rights activist, he developed and coordinated national and local community development programs. During the 70's he directed the National Urban League's Administration of Justice division and then served as a Resident Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
For more than 30 years Woodson has been a source of guidance and support for grassroots organizations around the world. He was instrumental in paving the way for resident management and ownership of public housing, and brought together task forces of grassroots groups to advise the 104th Congress, the Pennsylvania Legislature, and the Wisconsin Assembly. He is consulted by cabinet officials, numerous governors, members of Congress, academicians, business leaders, and the news media.
He has worked with youth intervention and violence prevention programs since the 1960's and has written several books on the subject. A major initiative of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise is the Violence Free Zone project, the roots of which were in a program in Philadelphia, PA known as the House of Umoja, which stopped gang violence throughout Philadelphia in the early 1980's. Using strategies learned there, Woodson and NCNE helped craft a peace agreement among warring factions in Washington, D.C.'s Benning Terrace public housing development that had led to more than 50 youth deaths in recent years. A program of jobs, training, education and other support led to a complete revitalization of the neighborhood and turnaround in the lives of youths most people had written off as hopeless. The principles of this program have been adapted to NCNE's Violence Free Zone projects in the East Capitol section of Washington, DC, Dallas, Los Angeles, Hartford, and Indianapolis.
Among the many awards Woodson has received is the prestigious John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Fellowship, often referred to as the "genius" award. He is the author of hundreds of articles and several books, including The Triumphs of Joseph: How Community Healers are Reviving Our Streets and Neighborhoods, published by The Free Press in January, 1998.When Will Local Real Estate Market Rebound?

MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: I'm Maureen Cavanaugh, you're listening to These Days on KPBS. Springtime is when the typical real estate market begins to pick up from the winter doldrums. But as we know, the last few years have been anything but typical for the housing market in San Diego. So many analysts are looking ahead to this spring real estate season as a mixed bag full of hopeful signs and cautionary tales. If you're looking to buy or to sell or just looking, we're about to discuss where the San Diego market is in terms of pricing, lending, and potential. I'd like to introduce my guests, doctor Michael Lee is director of SDSU's Corky McMillan Center for Real Estate, and Michael welcome to These Days.
LEE: Thank you, Maureen.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Matt Battiata is CEO and broker in charge of the Battiata real estate group. Good morning, Matt.
BATTIATA: Good morning.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: And Gary London is a real estate economist with the London group realty advisors. Good morning, Gary. Thanks for coming.
LONDON: You're very welcome.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Now, we are inviting our listeners to join this conversation. Are you going through a short sale or a loan modification? Are you planning to buy or maybe sell your property this spring? Give us a call with your questions and comments. The number is 1-888-895-5727. Mike, how would you describe the activity that we've seen in the residential market since the beginning of the year?
LEE: I think it's very muted where transaction volumes are historically low, don't really see a lot of activity in the market. And so I think things have yet to pick up.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: And would you agree with that, Matt?
BATTIATA: I would agree. What we've lost for the time being is our trade up buyer, which is a big part of the market. So many people -- I mean, I think it's -- the numbers might be as high as 50 percent of the homes in San Diego with mortgages are upside down. So what it means is most -- you have a lot of people who don't have any equity, and therefore they can't sell that one property and maybe move up to a bigger home or a better area or better neighborhood. And so there's a lot of people that for the time be, until the values come back up, are just out of the market.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: What -- I mentioned though in the beginning, hopeful signs of Gary, what are the hopeful signs you might be seeing in the market since the beginning of the year that may continue into the spring?
LONDON: Well, you mentioned winter. It's been a five-year winter.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Yeah.
LONDON: And the market has reached its bottom. I think that statistically, we're seeing that some months we see some ups, some months we see some down, but some are crawling along the bottom, and the market is sort of preparing for its long slog back. We're not seeing that play out much yet in much increase in transactional volumes [CHECK] move back, which is a function of essentially what Matt said, valuation declines and the fact that people that -- discretionary buyers are not coming back into the market yet, and discretionary sellers are not selling yet. Never the less, because the economy is in a rebound, it's a slow rebound, but because things are getting better, that inevitably will catalyze a recovery in the housing market. So I sort of look at 2011 as the second transitional year. We're gonna see a modest up side by the end of this year, but nothing that's really statistically significant.
CAVANAUGH: I want to start taking calls but I do want to get your feeling, the group's feeling, if you will, about housing prices. Because we hear so much conflicting information about housing prices. You know, it's down like one tiny tenth of a percent or up a tiny tenth of a percent. Michael Lee, what does that mean? Housing prices. Are they going up?
LEE: I think it's difficult to generalize from indices that you see Kay Schiller or Core Logic because they're averages. Okay? And there's a lot of variation across the county. Different submarkets are very, very different from each other. And the mix changes in terms of what's selling at any particular month. So I don't put a lot of credence on looking at these national or these metropolitan wide figures. That said, I'm a little more pessimistic than Gary for the short run because I think we haven't yet figured out all of our lending problems of we still have a lot of foreclosures to process through, and eventually that supply's gonna come on the market in a gradual sense. Because I think the banks don't want to deluge the market with a lot of real estate owned. And you still have problems with lending and borrowers being able to qualify. Even though prices are down so much in San Diego, it's still a relatively expensive city compared to income. It's much better than it used to be, but it's hard to qualify given the new regime that lenders are putting in front of us.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: For instance, Matt Battiata, are the people who are trying to sell their homes, are they getting closer to what they wanted in terms of price?
BATTIATA: I don't think anybody's getting what they wanted. That's the big issue. A lot of people -- you know, the reality is right now, for the most part, the only people that are selling are the people that have to sell. And that's why a big part of the market is distress cell sales, people that are upside down who are doing short sales, or homes that the banks are selling that they've foreclosed on. The average home seller, they might think they want to sell, once they find out what their home is realistically worth in the market, if they don't have to sell, they just decide I'm gonna stay put and wait. Because it doesn't make sense for me to sell at that price. And as Michael said, are that's really -- the biggest issue, the biggest cloud that's hanging over our market is the fact that you've got a huge number of people that are upside down. And if for any reason they need to sell, because there's a lot of people that owe at peek levels in this market. And the market has to get all the way down to the bottom, and I think we're pretty close. We're maybe 20 percent away from the bottom, let's say. It's gotta get all the way to the bottom, and then get all the way back up to those peek prices. And until it does, all those people that owe at those peek levels, if for any ran they need to sell, whether it's a job transfer or they lose their job or they get divorced or any of the reasons people typically sell, they're all unfortunately going to be a short sale as opposed to an equity cell. And that puts a lot of down pressure on prices.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: And Gary, is that really the bottom line? If somebody says I wanna sell or I want something, and they contact a real estate agent and they find out the house is worth, I mean -- it's such a shock how low that number is, and then they just decide, well, I guess we'll stay here.
LONDON: I think Matt is spot on. I think that's exactly the problem right now. Listen, statistics locally have suggested that from the top in 2005 to the bottom last year that housing prices in San Diego dropped 40 percent. I don't believe that for a minute. I think that if you're trying to transact right now, that is the case. But as Matt has suggested, virtually all of the transactions that have transpired over the last few years have been distressed transactions, either really distress as in trust deed sales or functionally distressed, I lost my job, I better sell my house. And until we get past the sort of have to sellers and into the want to seller stage, which is going to happen some time, you know, past this year, we're not going to see really how far housing prices have dropped or how far that they have to recover. But from peek to peek, we're probably looking at a ten-year -- you know, ten years from now at this point.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Right. That is Gary London. My guests are Dr. Michael Lee and Mat Battiata, and we're taking your calls at 1-888-895-5727. Steve is on the line, he's calling from the five freeway. Good morning, Steve, welcome to These Days.
NEW SPEAKER: Thank you for taking my call. I have a comment based on what I observed in the last Southern California housing bust in the early 90s. There was actually -- somebody put together a series of LA Times articles extending from about the end of the early 90s recession in 1991 until the housing market actually reached bottom which was around 1996, and year after year, these articles document that people said this is the year the market is gonna hit the bottom. I think bottoms are hard to identify until they actually materialize. Of and you can see them in the rear-view mirror but you can't see them up front.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Uh-huh.
NEW SPEAKER: And given it took five years for the market to bottom out between the end of the last recession and when the market finally reached bottom, and that this current recession just ended in 2009 and the housing boom was much, much larger this time, I find it very optimistic to assume that we hit a price bottom already just a couple of years after the end of the recession.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Steve, let me get a response to that. Who'd like to -- yeah, Gary.
LONDON: Yeah, I actually I think the caller is mostly right. The market peeked in 89, it didn't recover until 96. Where he's wrong is that the bottom was in the middle of that period, 92, 93. This feels to me like 93 again. It's going to be a few years before we start seeing some reasonable price appreciation. We're gonna start seeing it gradually beginning about now. And I'm not prescient. I don't know if it's now or three months from now or a year from now, but we're sort of -- in that we're sort of approach, at, or I think coming off of that bottom now, it's gonna take a few years before we get to normalcy, then we get to the point where we begin the ride back up again, and that ride back up again is a long ride up.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Isn't this recession just a little bit different because the real estate market -- the crash in the market wasn't the response to the recession, it was kind of the cause of the recession? Is that different.
BATTIATA: It is different. But the effects are the same.
LONDON: Yes.
BATTIATA: And the other thing is this drop has been extended by the government intervention into the mark, which is well intentioned of it is different but at the same time, it still was a boom, it's a bust, and the best way to look at it is that real estate markets are like a cruise ship out on the ocean, they get momentum, regardless of which direction they're going in. So when the market was changing ahead in 2004, you can turn -- we turned off the engines and the propellers in this cruise ship in 2004, but the median price kept going up until 2006, because the market had momentum. Now we're steaming full speed in the opposite direction. Maybe -- I think we're getting to the point where we're starting to throttle down the engines and turn off the propellers, but even if we do that now, the reality is this market will have a year or two of momentum going in a downward direction. Of so they don't turn on a dime.
LEE: I'd like to come back to the lending side of that.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Sure.
LEE: Because in the past, the housing has tended to lead us out of a recession because it's an intrasenstive type of investment.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: What kind of investment?
LEE: Intrasensitive. So when we have low interest rates that the federal reserve is trying to help get us out of a recession, housing will pick up quicker because it becomes more affordable. The problem is, you've got two off setting winds here. You've got the off setting wind that negative equity that Matt referred to before that people just can't qualify or aren't going to sell. And secondly that we offset some of the affordability advantage and low interest rates with the tighter -- much, much tighter under writing guidelines that we see, and new vis-a-vis the last time.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Let's take another call, again we're talking your calls at 1-888-895-5727. Jason is on the line from Point Loma. Good morning, Jason, and welcome to These Days.
NEW SPEAKER: Hello, how are you?
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Just fine, thank you.
NEW SPEAKER: Basically I'm a home buyer just calling in to ask a question about short sales. My wife and I have been submitted offers on multiple short sales, we're finding that some banks are a little more logical. Basically, you know, from the agent's point of view, are there certain banks that they're steering their clients towards in terms of short sales or are there any banks that they're -- if they can, they're steering them away from. I've been heard rumors that Wachovia is very easy to deal with. And then on the other hand I've heard rumors that some basics, I don't know if I should name them, are a lot more difficult to deal with. Are there strategic moves that agents do to get them into short sales involving certain institutions.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Thank you Jason. Matt?
BATTIATA: I can take that. Jason, i would say that you and your wife should be looking for a home that you like, and that's a good deal that you can get at a good price. All the banks are different to deal with. It also depends on who the investor is. Many times a certain bank might be the servicer, but then there's a different investor behind that servicer. So you really can't -- and some banks are most difficult to deal with than other the. But at the end of the day, if you're willing to be patient, most short sales do go through these days. You just have to be patient. The caveat is that you might wait six months, and then the bank might come back with a ridiculous price. They might say we want 300 when really the property is worth 265. But you can get around that as well. So you just really need to be patient. Short sales are very frustrating for everybody solved, whether it's the listing agent, the buy are's agent, [CHECK].
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: A recent news report that came out earlier this month noted that 70 percent of people who were -- who did recently close their short sales said that it was a difficult or extremely difficult experience.
LEE: Excruciating.
LONDON: That's a very euphemistic way of putting it.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: So Gary?
LONDON: Everything's difficult when you're dealing with lenders right now. This was a credit crisis, the lenders made a to know of mistakes, the pendulum has swung as Mike has suggested to the other extreme where interest rates are extremely low, where it's difficult to find -- to get a loan even if you think you're traditionally quite qualified. But having said that, this is the window of opportunity for buyers. Interest rates are low, if you have some money that you can put down perhaps at a higher level as down payment on a home, pricing is cheap, it's never been this good in San Diego before. From the perspective of a buyer. And it's a window. And the visual is, windows open and shut. And this window will shut. And it really doesn't make any difference whether Matt Mike or Gary are right, almost at the bottom and on our way up. We're almost in that floating period where homes are real cheap, interest rates are low, and if you can figure out a way to qualify for a short sale or a regular sale, now's the time to strike.
BATTIATA: Uh-huh.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: I'm curious about just a quick about how is the profession doing? How are agents doing? I would imagine that a lot of people really got out of the business in the last couple of years.
BATTIATA: Definitely.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Are brokers, are agents taking smaller commissions? What are you guying doing to stay afloat?
BATTIATA: Sure, well, yeah, I think a lot of agents and brokers have gotten out of the business. Both real estate brokers and mortgage brokers. And really here in San Diego if an agent has not adapted to the market, meaning transitioned into -- just transitioned into the market in whatever way they could, then they have gone broke and gone out of the business, and it's a really unfortunate reality but it's the case.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Anything else gentlemen?
LONDON: Well, I'm not on the ground like Matt is, but statistically of course as we got a huge reduction in the amount of people at every level, you know, every part of the real estate and finance business that are out of business. Of the whole industry is compressed. Where you really see it is in the builder business, because we only delivered somewhere in the range of 3200 homes or got 3200 permits last year in San Diego County, which is a number that's not gonna get much larger this year. So the whole industry has gotten smaller and what's interesting about it is that once the market and the economy do recover, we'll inevitably see a [CHECK] it's supply and demand, we're not gonna be quickly supplying new homes again with the depression that has occurred in this sector.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Diane is on the line from San Diego, we're taking your calls at 1-888-895-5727. Good morning, Diane, welcome to These Days.
NEW SPEAKER: Hello. I'm actually calling to ask a question about the home loan modification program.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Uh-huh.
NEW SPEAKER: And I have a friend that I was assisting with this process, and he was doing his home loan modification through B of A, and he's in the construction industry, everyone knows the construction industry has just crashed in San Diego, so he filled out his application showing his income has just plummeted since the last year. [CHECK] I know how to make a case. We read it real carefully, did a great job, submitted it of A, and it said we're sorry, but it doesn't demonstrate that you've had a reduction in your income. And I'm just wondering, first of all, I thought it was a federal program, so I was a little surprised that it was going through B of A, and there's an appeal process, but it's just a ridiculous response that maybe this isn't a real thing. Maybe there isn't any [CHECK] for people who have suffer indeed this economy.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Let me go to Michael Lee on that because you've been talking about lenders. What about -- this seems to have done it perfectly correctly, there has been a dramatic drop in income, and this is the response they get.
LEE: Well, I think this is not unusual. The program while a federal program is administered by servicers and basics and the lenders that are in collecting payments. And they have significant discretion, and they look at it from the standpoint of what is highest value that I can get from different alternative approaches? So I look at it as -- if I make this loan modification and the borrower then essentially gets back on track and pays off the loan, what is the value to me of that E(REPEAT LAST PHRASE) if I don't think that's gonna happen, I go ahead to a foreclosure, sell the house, what kind of value I'm gonna get that way. So that aspect is there, but you can see from the numbers in early its of the amount of people who have applied versus the amount of people who actually get through the process it's been very low.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Very low percentage. Yeah.
LEE: Part of that is the bank, but I think part of it also reflects the issues for the borrower. If you're deeply under water, then loan modifications, which only work to reduce your front end payments really aren't gonna help. Of and the banks won't process that. Also if the -- you have a lot of situations where even though they can get your front end ratio, which is your housing to income ratio, down to 31 percent, often the back end ratios with all your other kind of debt is still over 60 percent. And so there are a lot of factors that go into the decision making.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: And we're up against a break but you wanted to mention something. Of the.
BATTIATA: Just to respond to the caller. Let me just bottom line it. In general, lenders have no interest in modifying anyone's loans. They are going through the motions because they have been pressured by the federal government to do it. It is a government program, but it is -- it's a voluntary program for the banks to participate in. And in general, 95 percent of the people that, apply for loan modifications are rejected. And even the loan mods that are granted are such a Band-Aid, in other words it's not dropping someone's payment from $3,000 a month down to 1800, it's going from 300 down to 2700, and normally, the $300 that they save every month is just tacked onto the back end of their loan. And the disingenuous thing that the banks are doing, [CHECK] is if the banks are not gonna modify people's loans, they should not lead borrowers down the primrose path of telling them that they're going to and telling them to take the next year to 18 months to submit all this paperwork knowing full well that they're not gonna do anything meaningful. They should just simply state, you know what? We don't do loan mods. Because people waste a huge amount of time and get themselves in worse situations. Because the banks also say, well, if you're current, we're not gonna modify your loans of so people stop making payments, they destroy their credit, they get into a situation where they're in [CHECK].
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: We have to take a break. Of when we return, we will continue taking your real estate questions and phone calls and continue our spring real estate outlook here on These Days. You're listening to These Days on KPBS.
I'm Maureen Cavanaugh, You're listening to These Days on KPBS, and we're quieting an update on the San Diego real estate market. My guests are Gary London, a [CHECK] CEO and broker in charge of the Battiata real estate group. And Dr. Michael Richard earnest is director of SDSU's Corky McMillan Center for Real Estate. And we are taking your calls at 1-888-895-5727. Let's start out with a call from Ed, calling from east lake. Good morning, Ed, and welcome to These Days.
NEW SPEAKER: Good morning, thank you. Well, my question is, in 2007, I did I bankruptcy. I had a primary residence, and I have had two rental incomes. Unfortunately I was caught up in the market. And I had to claim bankruptcy. Now I'm in the market three years later to purchase the home. The income is there, the down payment is in a savings account, but now the obstacle I'm coming across is now the banks are telling me, yes, you have to wait at least 2 or 3 years after a bankruptcy before you can qualify for an FHA loan. But now after the bankruptcy, it took about a year for one of my homes to actually get foreclosed on. Of so now the payments are telling me that I have to wait three years after the foreclosure. So I'm kind of confused. Of I really don't know which direction to go now.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Any advice for ed.
BATTIATA: Well, my advice would be, if you haven't already, check with a credit union. Sometimes credit unions because they're lending their own money have different guidelines of he's gonna run up the against that there are federal -- if he wants to get a fed -- government insured loan, Fannie Mae, Freddy Mac, [CHECK] so he's not gonna be able to get around that. I mean, he could, it's unlikely, so my suggestion would be to try a non-government insured loan which would be, like, three a credit union.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: You know, before we leave our discussion about lending, I want to get your -- your impressions about this idea of shutting down Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac, a proposal by president Obama and house Republicans to slowly dissolve these two lending giants. And let me go to you, Gary. Of what is your take on that?
LONDON: Well, you know, we talk about a lot of changes. This discussion we've talked about the problem of government intervention that we haven't been able to clear the market quick enough. We've talked about the pendulum swung the other direction with lenders. But -- and there's even a proposal in the Obama administration to reduce mortgage deductibility on some level. All of these issues pale in comparison to what would happen if the secondary [CHECK] the backbone of our sort of home finance delivery system in this country for several generations now, since the mid-20th century. Now, the good news is that whatever happens to those agencies is not gonna happen immediately. We're talking about probably a ten-year period of change. There will be change. And presumably, someone will fill in the gap of buying up the notes that get originated from the homes that Matt sells. But that problem, that issue has to be addressed. Because the backbone of our home purchasing system is in the ability of lenders to sell their notes to the secondary market, thereby infusing liquidity or cash back into them, so they can lend more money. And if that goes away or doesn't exist as it doesn't exist in many other countries, it portends a dramatic change in the amount of people that can be home buyers going forward.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Because, Michael, half of all the mortgages in the United States are held by Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac. So it would seem that these are rather important institutions of what's the rationale for getting rid of them?
LEE: Well, you pointed out the first rationale which is it's very dangerous to have two institutions that hold half of a $10 trillion market either in the form of guarantees or loans they hold in their portfolio. They pose a systemic risk, they are clearly too big to fail. So the option to scale them back to a point where they're no longer systemically important I think is very important for the future stability of the system. If it's done slowly and gradually over time, I'm very confident that the private market will come back and securitize these loans because I agree with Gary that you cannot finance all of our mortgages through bank portfolios. That said, I think as they are scaled back both private label securitization, a new European style financing instrument called covered bonds issue as well as more banks holding bonds in portfolio will fill the gap. And through that [CHECK] the government will still have a back stop in case the market seizes up.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Let's take calls. Of Al is calling from La Jolla. Of good morning, Al, welcome to These Days.
NEW SPEAKER: Good morning. I had a question for the guests. If the inflation sets in and the dollar value declines, how would that affect the market?
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Would anyone like to take that? If we go into an inflationary period.
LEE: That gets back to Gary's sweet spot. We're in a sweet spot now, and it's not gonna last forever because I think interest rates are likely to rise. Of the fed is gonna quit the QE2 by the summer, that has been keeping long-term rates down, at the same time we're gonna see a bit more inflationary pressure build up. So I think interest rates are bound to rise.
CAVANAUGH: I want to take a moment to talk about the commercial real estate market too, Gary, and I know that's pretty much your area. How are commercial properties doing and what do you expect to see in the short term?
LONDON: Well, the transactions in quality commercial have been very strong at most prices. The problem is that [CHECK] is not high quality. Of it's older, and when we say commercial, we're talking about office and retail. And we have too much of it. So we're going to see really a much longer period of valuation decline in the commercial sector, a much higher period of vacancy in the office sector, lots of transition in the retail sector 'cause it was way over built, so we're gonna see a lot of old shopping centers that are gonna sort of be reconceptualized into mixed use and housing projects and that sort of thing. I think a shopping center that [CHECK] may not have a reason to exist anymore. Terror a lot of troubles in the commercial sector right now. Of there's competition in the retail sector from the Internet, which is only becoming more pronounced, which has an impact on bricks and mortar. I think that that sector, the buy word in that sector is look at the existing inventory and think about new uses, rehab, renewal, reuse.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Is that the linkage between the commercial and residential property outlook, that kind of innovative use of old retail properties? Or are there other links as well to the health of commercial real estate and residential real estate?
LONDON: Well, let me give you the short answer then I won't dominate the conversation here.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Sure.
LONDON: The answer's yes. Essentially, the kind of housing that we're going to only be able to deliver in San Diego County is going to be higher density, urban housing, probably in many instances on former commercial sites. So yeah. I think there is a linkage there.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: And I don't want to leave the conversation either without talking about people who are renters, people who are not gonna be buying property. What's the outlook for them? Are we gonna see a lot of properties available? Are rents gonna be going up? Are they stabilize something what kind of feelings do you have about that?
LEE: Well, I think that we're transitioning from excessive emphasis on home ownership to a more stage tenure mix, which means a lot more people will stay renters, and as households enter home buying age, they're really gonna stay being renters of so demand for rental, multifamily in particular, is gonna be strong, and rents are gonna rise. Am you're already starting to see that.
BATTIATA: Which invariably leads to people wanting to buy.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Yeah, exactly.
BATTIATA: Because rents get high, and I think what Gary mentioned earlier is this is a window of opportunity over the next few years, whether we're at the bottom now, or the bottom's in 2013, because you've got low interest rates, and in various -- especially -- even the upper end, for first time buyers issue it's definitely an opportunity. But if you look in the upper end, homes that are a million plus, the majority of those homes are now selling below replacement value. In other words, you could not go, even if you got the land for a song, you couldn't build these homes for what they're currently selling for. So I said back in 2005, I thought the market would drop about 35 percent. I didn't think it would drop as much as it's dropped. But I always said, once we get to the bottom, it will be the buying opportunity of a lifetime here in San Diego. And I think that it is, and it will be.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Let's take a call. Mark is calling from San Diego. Good morning, mark, and welcome to These Days. Of.
NEW SPEAKER: How are you doing?
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Great.
NEW SPEAKER: I just wanted to know, is the condo market toxic? Is it radioactive, [CHECK] we had a short sale, and that's another matter all together. It was a huge relief to get rid of the condo. Of but I have a bitter taste in my mouth about condos, and condo conversions and just that market in itself.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Yeah, mark, let's get a reaction to that. Of there are a lot of people in condos of what's the situation there?
LONDON: Well, was that a paid caller? Matt always has one ringer in every conversation we have here. Listen, there's two points to be made here. The condo conversion market is a once every 25-year if nom. When there's an expression of an extreme shortage [CHECK] that party's over. But the condo market itself is going to become more and more the predominant product that will be transacted in San Diego. Of and more and more people will be buying condominiums. Of and I think even in the condo sector, whether you look downtown or any -- or wherever a condo's exist or delivered, that market is probably reaching, you know, its bottom stability, you know, its bottom point stability now. And I think the point is is that that's the product, we're not gonna give up on it, and that's how people are gonna find their first house, and perhaps even their second or third in their future in San Diego.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: I can almost hear people saying when? When? When is it gonna come back?
BATTIATA: Just to answer mark's question, some condos are toxic because of -- if you're gonna buy a condo, condos are great of that's some incredible condos downtown. It's a great option for a lot of people. Some people who are downsizing, etc. But the issue is, you gotta look at the H, on A, look if it's funded, look if that's lawsuits. You gotta be really careful because some condos are toxic because of the number of foreclosures, a low level of owner occupancy, [CHECK] can be a great opportunity also.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: I gotta ask sort of a closing question, I'm gonna direct it first to Michael Lee because we don't have an awful lot of time. But as the market picks up, and it sounds as if there's great caution in this group, it sounds as if everybody sort of agrees that that's the slow direction that we're going in. Of has the real estate crash affected the market in any permanent way do you think, Michael?
LEE: I think it has because people realize very vividly now that prices can go down and that maybe housing is not the great investment that we thought about it as in the part of. So I think going forward, people are really gonna be a lot more conservative in their buying habits and not stretch themselves as much thinking that, well, are house prices are just going to always go up and I'm just gonna cash in.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Buy the most house that you can, right?
LEE: It's gonna change buyers' attitudes.
MAUREEN CAVANAUGH: Right, right I think we have to leave it there, gentlemen. I want to thank you all so much. Gary and Matt and Michael. Thank you very much.
LEE: Thanks Maureen.

Bulgaria's Prosecuting Authority has started analyzing documents to find out whether Ivan Danov, the Minister of Investment Planning, has abused the French welfare system.
In an interview for Bulgaria's NOVA TV, Atanas Chobanov, a journalist, made the announcement after saying he had been interrogated last week over the issue.
Chobanov, whose website Bivol.bg reported in 2013 its alleged discovery about Danov, said the Minister had signed in France documents arguing he was unemployed, currently residing in France and looking for a job.
Data provided by Bivol has however shown that Danov lived in Bulgaria in that moment (2004-2005) and worked on a few projects while also teaching at Sofia's University of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy (UACEG).
He thus managed to obtain benefits worth EUR 15 000 from France over the course of eight or nine months, according to the reports.
Short after the alleged discovery was made in the summer of 2013, Danov admitted there was a speck of truth to these claims, as he did receive money but did not know they were social benefits.
The Minister could not be prosecuted in France due to a five-year legal prescription, unlike in Bulgaria, where it is 10 years.
Bivol is considered controversial by some in Bulgaria who doubt the authenticity of its sources. It has nevertheless managed to occasionally have a share in shaping opinions.

National Museums LiverpoolU.S. courts warn of email juror scamJuly 30, 2014 3:11 PM
The federal courthouse today received its first call from a concerned citizen who received an email as part of a nationwide scam operation targeting prospective jurors in the federal courts.
The email, purportedly from the "National EJuror Program" and sent this morning, directs the recipient to respond to a summons for grand and petit jury service and fill out a form with personal information, including date of birth, Social Security number and even mother's maiden name.
Courthouse officials said the email is not from real court officials and is an attempt to gain personal data as part of a likely identity theft operation.
At least seven other U.S. courts around the country received similar calls today from citizens in their jurisdictions who received the emails. It's not clear from where the sender is obtaining the names, although the caller to the court here was not in the juror database for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
The federal court system has recently warned about a similar scam in which citizens have been targeted by phone calls and threatened with prosecution for failing to comply with jury service. Those calls have also requested personal data.

And then there's the free accompanying mobile app, which lets the machine pull shuffle songs from two docked devices—and lets you pick what percentage of songs pop up from each.

Top US officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry and Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, will have anticipated fairly routine discussions with counterparts Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Defence Minister David Johnston, but given Iraq’s further unravelling a focus on remedies to an evolving crisis will be unavoidable.
There are no easy choices.
Australian and US officials had planned to put meat on the bones of an agreement for the rotation of Marines through Darwin to bolster security co-operation in the Asian regions.
However, the Iraq situation is now an overwhelming preoccupation of the US and its allies, including Australia as one of the founder members of the Coalition of the Willing whose 2003 invasion contributed to that country’s de-stabilisation.
Australia has offered to render humanitarian assistance to minorities in northern Iraq terrorised by Jihadist invaders who have declared a borderless “State of Islam’’ in the region.
But the US, which has begun air strikes to relieve pressure on the Kurdish stronghold of Erbil, may well seek additional help from its close allies beyond airlifts of food and medicine.
This is an evolving situation that risks developing a life of its own.
US President Barack Obama insists the US wishes to avoid getting sucked into another Middle East conflict, but this may prove easier said than done if Iraq continues to disintegrate.
In a statement before leaving Australia for the Netherlands and Britain, Prime Minister Tony Abbott appeared to raise the stakes in remarks about a deteriorating security environment in Iraq.
“The world is no longer confronting an evil terrorist group but a highly potent army,’’ Mr Abbott said. “It has shown itself capable of holding territory, imposing its own abhorrent form of government and forging alliances with other extremist organisations.
“It must be defeated.’’
Defeating the Islamic State, now that it has put down transnational roots across the Syrian and Iraqi frontiers, would involve military commitments way beyond anything that may reasonably considered in present circumstances.
Any Australian government would be wary about re-deploying ground forces in another Middle East conflict, but the US will be considering various options both to bolster a fragile administration in Baghdad, and a nascent Kurdish state in the north.
These options are sure to be touched on in the AUSMIN discussions.
Latest developments on the ground may well hasten Iraq’s fragmentation into a Shia state in the south, a Sunni stronghold in the centre and north-west, and a new Kurdish state in the north-east.
Eleven years after US-led forces put former dictator Saddam Hussein to flight, Iraq is fracturing from within, and there seems not much that can be done to stop the process.
Adding to the mess are signs from Baghdad the US-backed government of Prime Minister
Tensions between al-Maliki and president
America and its allies have long been dissatisfied with the al-Maliki regime, but have not been in a position to oust him. The prime minister is a Shia and is blamed for not forming an inclusive government in an effort to unify the country.
It may be way too late for that.
The Australian Financial ReviewA child's maturity relative to that.
For example, in schools where the cutoff date is Sept. 1, children born on Aug. 31 make the cutoff and are the youngest in their class; children born on Sept. 2 will wait an additional year to enter school and be among the oldest in their class.
Children born just a few days apart should have the same underlying risk of having ADHD, according to the researchers, so this significant difference in diagnosis rates is strong evidence that medically inappropriate diagnoses are being given.
"We believe that younger children may be mistakenly diagnosed as having ADHD, when in fact they are simply less mature," study researcher Melinda Morrill said in a statement.
The characteristic behaviors associated with ADHD are inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, according to the National Institutes of Health. Rising rates of ADHD and large differences in diagnosis rates have led to fears that the condition is not accurately diagnosed.
Accurate diagnosing is crucial, the researchers say, because stimulant medications are often prescribed as a treatment for ADHD. The stimulants have side effects, including insomnia, stomachache, headache, dizziness and decreased appetite, and they have been shown to increase heart rates and blood pressure. Little is known about their long-term effects.
The new findings are consistent with those of another forthcoming study that suggests children born just before the kindergarten cutoff date are 50-percent more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than those born just after, Morrill and her colleagues write in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Health Economics.
The findings indicate that there are children who are diagnosed, or who are not diagnosed, because of something other than underlying biological or medical reasons, according to Morrill.
"We are not downplaying the existence or significance of ADHD in children," Morrill said. "What our research shows is that similar students have significantly different diagnosis rates depending on when their birthday falls in relation to the school year."
In the study, the researchers examined data from two national health surveys and a national private health insurance claims database to evaluate rates of ADHD diagnosis and treatment in children. The data sources covered different time periods ranging from 1996 to 2006.
The findings will be published in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Health Economics.

Question: Are texting and social media sites harming our children’s literacy skills?
I love my students, and I love teaching. However, my job has become significantly more challenging than it was when I began my career 28 years ago. Texting and social networking sites have hurt students’ literacy skills.
Students returned to school recently. Other than texting and using social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, the majority of students have done little to no reading or writing since June when the last school year ended.
On Oct. 11-13, students will take the Michigan Educational Assessment Program test that will be used to evaluate their teachers and school district.
Students will read numerous selections, answer objective questions, and write an essay.
They will be asked to choose key ideas to support a position on a question, to use examples and details to support their position, and to show mastery of language and writing conventions. Those are skills we should expect of students and of literate adults.
However, when students text or use social networking sites, they aren’t practicing the language and writing conventions expected of literate adults and tested on the MEAP. Instead, they are developing habits that will not contribute to academic or career success.
Texting and social networking sites don’t require careful reading or editing. Those are skills expected of literate individuals.
They also don’t require writing in complete sentences. Twitter, for example, only allows 140 characters. Consequently, many students write in fragments and run-ons.
This also has an effect on word choice. Typically, students use slang and abbreviations. Consequently, many students start using slang in formal writing because it’s part of their everyday writing and speech.
There also is a negative effect on punctuation, especially when texting. It ignores language and writing conventions. Many students have no idea when to use capital letters. They don’t capitalize ‘I.’ They don’t capitalize proper names. You’re/your, there/their/they’re, and its/it’s become interchangeable. Punctuation is haphazard.
Also, texting and social networking sites don’t require practicing handwriting; therefore, many students can’t write legibly. Every year, I am amazed by how few of my eighth-graders are able to read or write cursive. They struggle with their own signature.
Today, students might be brighter than students 28 years ago — and they should be. We know more about teaching and learning today, and information is more readily accessible.
Aldous Huxley, a famous English writer, once wrote, “Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards.”
Texting and social networking might have advanced “small talk” communication, but they don’t encourage deeper, more meaningful communication — the type of literacy necessary for academic success or a professional career.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By the time Monday came again, Jay had mixed feelings about the necessity of going to school. He hadn't talked to Sarah or Odette at all since the party, fearing their probing questions as to exactly why Charles hated him even more now than before, and he wasn't ready yet to take his place at the usual lunch table. Before he had decided to curl back up in bed and forget the world, his mother was in his room, pulling the blankets off him and telling him to come downstairs for breakfast. He knew there was no getting out of it – she knew every trick in the book, and wasn't about to let him skip school for no good reason. His mind was made up for him. He was going.
He ignored everyone at school as much as he could until lunch. As the bell rang, it sounded more to him like a death knell, and the cafeteria where his inquisitive friends sat would be the end of him. Walking in and sitting down, he braced himself for some of Odette's enthusiastic questions, but Sarah cut her off.
"Erik told me what you said, so don't start to play dumb. How badly did you screw things up for yourself?"
He blinked at her, dumbfounded. Sarah's blunt and tactless accusations weren't even close to what he was prepared for, and he was taken completely by surprise. "Wait, what?"
"You heard me," she said, ready to motivate him the only way she knew how, "I know you screwed things up, but just how badly? Can you fix this, or did you burn the bridge and turn the river under it to boiling magma?"
"I-I don't know," Jay stammered, feeling backed into a corner, "And wait – What makes you think I want to fix things with Charles, anyway? He's a complete douche, and I'm done with him."
"No you're not. Look over at where he's sitting right now," Sarah said, and Jay followed her instructions. He glanced over at the table where Charles and Metis were sitting, and turned back quickly, lest Charles catch him looking. However, a quick glare from Sarah had him looking at them again, and Jay noticed the two friends looking more awkward than Jay had ever seen them before. He let his eyes linger on Charles' expression, caught somewhere between careful sarcasm and poorly hidden self-pity. Jay wanted to smack himself as he dwelled on how cute Charles' little pout was, and how strangely sweet his knitted eyebrows seemed.
"You know, if you weren't staring so much, I'd agree that it's probably over between you two," Sarah began, snapping Jay out of his reverie. "But you still like him. You need to man up, Jay, and take some responsibility for your mistakes. You're not even close to done with him and you know it; you're just running away like a coward so you don't get hurt."
The look on Jay's face let Sarah know that she had pressed all the right buttons. He needed this tough love to get him into gear, because otherwise she knew he would only mope around feeling sorry for himself. He'd never take the initiative himself to get up and tell a guy he was interested, so Sarah had to do it for him. Sure, she worried about her friends, and all Jay's protests coupled with the nasty rumors she had heard about Charles would usually have been enough to put her off the possibility of any relationship they might have, but she knew that a boy like Charles was just what Jay needed. He would provide the spark to move Jay long after she couldn't.
Without another word about it, Jay accepted what he needed to do. As always, Sarah was right – he was running away from Charles the way he ran away from everything when things got too tough. This time, though, things would be different. He'd talk to Charles on his own terms and explain just how he'd been feeling for the past few months. Their relationship couldn't be any worse at this point, so Jay figured he had nothing to lose.
He called Metis as soon as he got home from school, and apologized for the way he had acted the other day. Deciding to take the plunge, Jay set up a surprise meeting with Charles for later that day – he hated the pressure of waiting, and wanted to get it over with as quickly as he could. Pulling off this bandage would hurt, Jay was sure of it, but it might turn out well in the end. He kept his hopes up and prepared for what might be their final confrontation, hoping he'd make it out alive.
***
Jay drove past Metis' house five times that evening, waiting for the signal that Charles was there and that Jay should make his move. Five times, his car slowed to a crawl as he scanned the house for the fake candle that would be glowing in the picture window; four times he sighed deeply, not realizing that he had been holding his breath; three times he counted the seconds as he waited around the block before he made his next pass, knowing that if Charles saw his car, it would all be over. Twice, Jay prayed to anything that would listen, including Flying Spaghetti Monsters, Athena, and the Pope, but once, only once, Jay gasped and hit the gas pedal a little too hard, peeling away from Metis' house after seeing that tiny electric flame illuminating Charles' coat, thrown carelessly onto the couch.
He parked around the block so that no noise would betray his arrival. Charles was supposed to be surprised by his visit and if he wasn't, if an errant gravel crunch or slamming door caught his ear, Jay lost his most potent weapon. Having quit smoking months ago, he knew there was no excuse but nerves as to why he was breathing so heavily or why his hard was pounding so hard in his chest, and he tried to take his mind off it by going over the plan once more in his head: Jay would apologize to Charles, take some abuse, explain why he had done what he did, take some more abuse, beg for forgiveness, take some abuse, curl up in a corner and cry, take some abuse, hang himself in Metis' closet…
Standing on the front lawn of some stranger's property, Jay wondered what he was doing. He shouldn't be here – hadn't he made up his mind about Charles, after all? Wasn't he just giving in to the same pushy friends he had sworn not to follow so blindly? He almost had himself half-convinced that he should turn around and go when Sarah's words echoed in his head.
Wasn't he just running away?
Shambling forward, a zombie to his pride, Jay walked up to Metis' front door and rang the bell. According to plan, Jay was ushered in silently and pointed towards the den, where Charles sat, waiting. Jay stepped as lightly as he could, making it halfway down the hall before he stopped. The dragon he had to slay waited before him, mere feet from where he stood; Jay knew deep in his heart that it was a battle he wouldn't escape unscathed.Interdisciplinary research is a topic of increased interest within the academic and scientific communities. Many researchers and organizations express positive regard for interdisciplinary approaches (Menand 2010) and view interdisciplinary research as a necessary approach to addressing increasingly complex problems (Klein 1990; Lattuca 2001). Numerous efforts have been made to promote interdisciplinary scholarship, but we know little about the nature of interdisciplinary research and those who practice it.
The term "interdisciplinary" has become a familiar one for most researchers, but there is actually no consensus on a precise definition of the term. There are multiple definitions of interdisciplinary research, and much ambiguity surrounds these definitions (Jacobs and Frickel 2009). This ambiguity and diversity of ideas makes it difficult to measure and identify interdisciplinary research, which presents a challenge to researchers wishing to study this movement that appears to be transforming the way scientific research is done. Indeed, there is no widely accepted indicator of interdisciplinary research (Wagner, Roessner, and Bobb 2009).
The National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates offers us a valuable opportunity to address some of the unanswered questions about interdisciplinary research. This survey, which is an annual census of individuals earning research doctorates in the United States, contains the first attempt to identify doctoral students who conduct interdisciplinary research. Building on the analyses of Falkenheim (2010), we examined this indicator of interdisciplinary dissertation research in order to better understand the prevalence of and trends in interdisciplinary activities among doctoral graduates.Ligue 1 side chase Stamford Bridge forward.
Check in to Burnley vs Chelsea
AS Monaco are set to fight Atletico Madrid in pursuit of Chelsea forward Fernando Torres according to the Metro.
Read more Chelsea transfer rumours.
The 30 year old has come nowhere near justifying the £50m the Blues paid Liverpool for his services back in January 2011 and now the west London side are finally ready to call time on the Spanish international’s faltering spell at Stamford Bridge though will demand £20m for the forward.
Former club Atletico Madrid are only willing to offer £13m though Ligue 1 big spenders AS Monaco are ready to meet Chelsea’s valuation and it’s a move that Torres may be tempted by, not least as the principality side are likely to be able to offer a huge, tax-free, salary.
Torres’s three and a half year stint at Chelsea has been littered with goal droughts and the arrival of Diego Costa is sure to limit the experienced striker’s chances in 2014/15 and a fresh challenge could be best for all concerned.
AS Monaco secured a healthy second place finish in their first season back in the French top tier, securing Champions League football, and a move to Stade Louis II seems a sensible way to help boost Jose Mourinho’s transfer fund pot.
Torres has netted 45 goals in 172 appearances for Chelsea, with just 20 of those coming in Premier League action.
SEE ALSO: Top 10 smoking footballersWith all due respect to Cleve Jones and David Mixner, who I've known and covered for many years, I think we seriously need to question the wisdom of convening a march on Washington this October.
Yes, LGBT people are angry and disappointed that President Barack Obama hasn't lived up to his promises and our expectations - something David knows about intimately, having been failed by his one-time friend Bill Clinton. Cleve, too, knows deeply about government scorn and neglect, having created the profound remembrance of those we lost as a result - the AIDS Memorial Quilt.
And I understand the call for a march. I am among Obama's critics - I am stunned that he has so flagrantly forgotten, despite being a constitutional scholar, that equality is the first core founding principle of this country, and as leaders in the civil rights movement so aptly pointed out - "justice delayed is justice that a march on DC in 4 months is waaay too soon, I wouldn't cite Kors' position as a plus.
Does any blood run in his veins? Seriously...
Obama is just asking for a march and if we are gonna pool resources to make an impression it should be done well. Like maybe 2012 when he is in full re-election mode. Maybe economies will have improved or at least mellowed out. We will have time to get perspective after a wild marriage ride in the first half of 2009. The current wave of equality will not last much longer. We need to protect Maine and hopefully re-capture CA. We also need to give Obama time...not much time...that's not my main emphasis...but we do need to know that our message is clear (to people outside our circle) before we do this.
If I am going to beg, borrow, and steal to get to DC and raise hell, I don't want my time and money and energy wasted. Four months isn't enough. This is too important. Do it...but not in 2009.
Patrick - Last year, Robin Tyler called for a march on Washington in Nov. 2012 with the idea of telling the Democratic Party we want our rights and will withhold our votes until we get them This might strike fear in them since the Dems are hoping to improve their numbers in Congress.
Meanwhile - that may also be the year there is a ballot initiative to repeal Prop 8 here in California - if it doesn't go on the 2010 ballot.
From what I understand of the effort to mount a march this October - it won't be an "angry" march - more supplicant than demanding - so there's that, too.
I am unconvinced of the potential for positive political results from a DC march, but I do think they are important cultural events.
I attended one of the marches in the 1980s. I don't recall what year - must have been after 1984 when I graduated from high school. That march had a huge impact on me as a young 20ish gay guy from Buffalo NY. I never imagined what it would be like to be surrounded by so many of my peers. That weekend was overwhelming and enthralling...even more so than my arrest last week outside of City Hall in San Francisco.
Things have changed a great deal in the past 20 years, but maybe a march of the magnitude of the one I attended in the 80s would help further coalesece young LGBTS in middle America that are disenfranchised from their coastal brothers and sisters. After I attended the march I no longer felt isolated in Buffalo.
If a new march is called for - and I think it is an excellent way to tug the historical heart strings of our African American President - then I hope it can be arranged to have impact for us more than any impact we might make on scheming, shallow, and opportunistic politicians.
We need to take time and plan well and make it possible for as many people to attend as desire to be there.
I heard about this yesterday, and if they have it I do want to go, I booked a room in Downtown D.C for that weekend. But I'll tell you the rates for DT hotels there are absurdly high. It would be better for each person planning on going to instead donate like $500 to the cause, instead of spending thousands to fly and then stay in a DC hotel 3 or 4 nights.
The era of marches on Washington is long since over. They are meaningful only to the participants. That counts for a lot, certainly, and can provide a huge boost. But it's not worth the many costs.
Karen, I agree with you 100 percent. In my opinion, we will not get more leverage with the administration by a March on Washington. Obama and his people are already aware that we are displeased with their performance. The religious conservatives aren't impressed by the size and number of our marches -- they believe that God is on their side.
Meanwhile, the resources that we'd spend on a D.C. March are desperately needed elsewhere.
Yes, thanks Patricia.
And as you well know - our LGBT kids and people with HIV/AIDS are going to be the invisible ones who suffer the most in this economy.
There is an on-going effort by the religious right to undermine all LGBT attempts to address school bullying and even use of the words "gay and lesbian" - let alone "transgender" in classrooms - and they have NO CLUE what to do with "bisexual."
So we've made progress - but as the recent Gallup Poll shows - there is always room for a backlash.
And - as the shooting of the abortion doctor yesterday indicates - we all need to be very vigilant about the lone wolfs out there determined to do "God's will" and eliminate us.
Why is it that when someone within the LGBT community tries to do something worthwhile, positive and noteworthy to try and change our current situation, others within the community always have to try to tear it down. If you don't wish to participate in the march, then don't. However, for those of us who think this is a great idea, then let us do what we think we need to do. We need to try and do things that are going to help everyone in the community, not just people in CA and ME. We need to let our elected officials know publicly that we are not happy with them and this is one way to do it. Go Cleve and David!
Douglas, no one is trying to tear down anything; we just happen to oppose a March on Washington for a variety of reasons.
This matters very much because these things reflect on all of us and it will affect all of us. Those of us who think it's a bad idea have a duty to say so.
All the others took up anything I could have possibly said about this wonderful piece.
Except: You're my ONE lesbian crush! I swoon every time I see a new post from you
Ah, shucks.
Thanks much. I'm blushing - my dogs don't notice.
After the giant fiasco of the millenium march- please no more marches in DC- that are planned by a small group of people. We went down this road before and it was disaster.
For a history lesson:
Great article from the Nation
And then the crimes...
Why can't we go to the National March, our local regional marches and donate money to LGBT people at risk as well? We don't have to turn the National March into a party or vacation that costs a bunch of money, we could find ways to network spare couches and make sandwiches and share transportation.
We don't need to reinvent the wheel on Civil Rights methodology, it might help if LGBT leaders read about the Civil Rights Movement and utilized their tactics and strategies and add those to the ways we use the internet and other modern communication technologies.
Karen, I agree 100%. Everything else notwithstanding, we could never get organized and/or save up money for a march that soon and I agree that there is no point in doing so when Congress is not in session. We can lobby our Federal Legislators in our home states--people just have to get off their duffs and do it.
I am the first person to say that repeal of DOMA and DADT and getting ENDA and the Hate-crimes act passed should be our FIRST priorities. But, that said, if those of us who cannot afford to march in Washington AND engage our state-wide battles put our time, money and effort into a march on Washington, we will lose too much ground on the state level (and to the person who said that we can do it if we don't turn it into a big party and over-spend--uh,no, actually, some of us have families to support and financially really can't do both). So to my mind, those of us in states where we have battles coming up and those of us who live nearby those states and can lend a hand, should do so--even if that means not marching on Washington. Lobbying our federal reps while they are in our home states and working on our state issues while we are in the state capitols is do-able for most people and much more cost effective.
I am well aware that this is not just about marriage, but pulling resources out of the state level battles on marriage would be like leaving the battlefield and heading off to open another front while our enemy is reloading; we stand to lose BOTH the battle and the war if we do that. Personally, I would be satisfied for the time being if we could affirm DP expansion here in Washington STATE, while working on federal issues; I understand federal issues all too well, but I am constantly reminded that every time we cross the state line into Idaho, we suddenly have no protection from discrimination; if my wife were to end up in a hospital(God forbid) they could find out that she is trans from her medical records and LEGALLY they would not be obligated to recognize her as a woman--and nothing we are fighting for on the national level would protect her from that type of discrimination.
Speaking of which,as a lesbian married to a transwoman, it is almost painful to me to have to point this out, but lobbying for inclusive ENDA and Hatecrimes legislation is going to take one-on-one meetings with our congresscritters by the wider LGBTQ and Allied communities--and in the mean time, while we are focusing on the federal level"big picture" and state marriage battles, many transfolk are in dire need of our help with state-level anti-discrimination laws (ENDA does not address housing or public accommodation), states that still won't change their birth certificates to reflect their confirmed gender, inclusive state-level anti-bullying measures, the Real ID Act (which is going to cause a hell o' mess for pre-op and non-op transfolk)...the list goes on and on, but you all get the idea. Transfolk benifit form all of the federal rights and protections we all seek, but those protections fall short--and most of us are so focused on the pitched battle over marriage that hardly anyone is talking or blogging about New Hampshire (where the senate unanimously rejected a bill that would have extended anti-discrimination laws to transgendered), NY (where the assembly is a toss-up), MA and more places that I can't even remember now.
Honestly, between the Zapata trial, our huge strides for equal marriage,Prop8, Decline petition for R-71 (here in Washington), I am in Information Overload Mode and its easy to forget the issues that get less media attention.
The reason that failed was that the LGBT community fought about who would be in control of it, just like we fight over everything else. Why can't we all just learn to get along and work together?
Susan - thanks for the comment.
Someone else from Washington STATE noted that my original headline said we need foot soldiers in CA and Maine, not in Washington - and said that foot soldiers and funds are needed in Washington state to fight an expected repeal effort there - so I changed my headline to designate Washington DC.
You might consider writing a blog about how help is needed in Washington state....
Just a thought....
Can a gay man have a crush on you, too?
Intelligence, integrity, profound common sense, and a lack of shrillness get me hot and bothered.
Karen, I've followed, and admired, your extremely respectable journalism for years. You're a gem.
My thoughts on the concept of a new March on Washington are informed by having attended the 1993 March on Washington, which was, for those organizing and attending, a HUGE, big deal, a major effort, a major haul, majorly EXPENSIVE, and at times a major inconvenience (e.g., let's wait 5 hours in the sun for state x to march)....and that accomplished, politically, legislatively, or even culturally.... um....nothing.
This is called waste. And we can't afford to waste.
I respect and honor Cleve Jones and David Mixner, but I fear (1) they are stuck in old-school thinking (that was already old-school in 1993, which was for most people pre-internet); (2) they are clouded by nostalgia; and (3) well, their theories may be adulterated by a small touch of egomania.
Take it from someone close to Jones's and Mixner's generation: We have to use 2009+ tactics. We have to be smart, strategic, surgically targetted, nimble, flexible, facile, and effective. A big, huge, clumsy March on Washington would be, in my opinion, a collosal mistake, as it would be a collosal waste of resources, with about as much political/social impact as all previous Marches on Washington combined; to work out the math, that's ~0 (1979) + ~0 (1987) + ~0 (1993) + ~0 (2000) = ~0. (If you want, you can add the political/social impact of the Stonewall 25 march in NYC in 1994: Another ~0.)
I'm not trying to cynical. I'm trying to be reality-based. And smart. We have GOT to be smart.
And speaking of smart: Folks, listen to Karen.
Wow. Thank you for those VERY kind words. I'm not only blushing again, there are a few tingles.
But seriously - I really appreciate the comments. My work in and for the LGBT press is my contribution to "the movement" - done with the best journalistic standards, practices and fortitude I can muster. A story about me in the LA Weekly was entitled "Hard News as a Civil Right" - which I thought was kind of cool.
But I would say the same for my colleagues: we work hard for little pay and usually only hear from people when we've made mistakes. So when we get compliments, it's really heartening to know that we've been of some public service.
Thank you Very much.
All that said - I would suggest that the marches did have meaning for numerous individuals - myself included. I am still moved recalling the bravery of the lesbians and gays in the military who walked on stage in full uniform during the 1993 march - expecting Bill Clinton to lift the ban - but indicating to the whole world that LGBT people are just as patriotic as any other Americans. And of course - there was my friend Michael Callen singing "Love Don;t Need a Reason" - just months before he died.
But this year - I would suggest there are too many battles to fight in too many states and not enough money. I can't wait to have a march on Washington to CELEBRATE our equality.
Thanks again.
I was on the statewide planning for the first MOW in 1983 and attended in '87. By 1993 I felt the focus should be on the local level. Remember what happened right after the Prop 8 loss in CA - a wave of marches all over the country and across other major world cities. We should be taking advantage of our internet connections and the momementum that is building in the states. Coordinated marches on State Capitals would serve a better purpose than another MOW, IMO. Yes, there still is isolation, but most (if not all) the states have some statewide coalition and those who do not or are still growing could benefit from help by Nat'l orgs - NGLTF, HRC, and Stonewall Dems. Focus on the Congressmembers and the Senators in the districts where their votes are! That will get more attention from the political folks.
Karen, thank you so much for this thoughtful piece—better to ask the questions now before this gets too far. What I especially like about this is your sticking to factual issues, rather than looking at emotive things like many of us (including me) do.
I was especially struck by your points about the economic downturn. But I also wonder if there isn't a strategic risk: It seems to me that in the middle of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, such a march could seem self-indulgent to the majority of Americans—the very people we need to win over. When people are losing their jobs, their homes, their healthcare—or are afraid they're about to—a bunch of angry gay people travelling to DC over issues that the majority frankly doesn't care much about, especially in these hard times, won't make them any more inclined to support us.
But, it looks like there can't be a march that weekend, anyway—or, at least, no rally on the Mall: The Mall is booked that weekend by three other groups so it's not possible to get a permit to use the Mall.
Isn't that a kick in the pants, as they used to say - re the NY Blade's report that the Mall is booked.
And I think you're right about how such a march might look to others - self-indulgent while so many are losing their jobs - as if some of the folks who have the time to march might have the time because they lost or were fired from their jobs!
Thanks for the comment.
Take care -
Karen O.
If you think it is a bad idea, come up with a way to make the idea better, like everyone supporting it, getting behind it and raising the money for it to happen. The LGBT community does a lot of good talking, but we don't seem to get much done. Let's do it!
I can't "get behind" something that I think is a bad idea—that's the whole point. I completely agree with you that we need to get things get done, but what specifically would another March "get done"? I guarantee that it will definitely make people feel great (I did, too, after the one I went to), but that feeling fades pretty quickly. Then what? Time, energy and money are spent with nothing "done".
If you can give me something—anything—concrete that would "get done" by a march on Washington, then maybe I could get behind it. But to me this looks exactly like all the other marches that have already happened, all of which failed to get anything done. In these hard economic times, I think it's a luxury we can't afford.
Now, if you want to talk about simultaneous action in 50 state capitals, that could be something entirely different.
While your concerns have validity, I wonder if you attended Meet in the Middle in Fresno, CA, this past weekend? As a resident of Fresno, this event gave our community hope, something that can never be taken away. Yes, a lot of resources and money were spent on the event, however, what will come out of it will be priceless.
I see the march on Washington as the next step in what momentum has surged after Prop 8 in California. There are more people involved now than ever before and it is events like this that give our movement a backbone.
As a few others stated, as a Californian left out of the Prop 8 campaign, we will push through this movement without the support of EQCA and it is not surprising that Geoff Kors does not back the march. EQCA has proven time and again that their only contribution is as a fundraising mechanism.
SallyQ -
I did NOT attend MITM or the Leadership Summit - I boycotted the event over the massive confusion of press access to the summit.
From what I can gather from people with whom I've spoken about the event -some thought it was disorganized - but most thought the rally was inspirational and that the summit was worthwhile. Among the latter in that group is longtime activist (going back to the Briggs Initiative) Diane Abbitt who was on one of the panels.
If you note, I did not address MITM or the summit but rather five reasons why a call for a march on Washington at this time should be re-considered. And, as it turns out, the Mall is booked that weekend anyway.
To be completely honest, as Simon Cowell might say, I am not sure I understand this on-going complete obsession with Equality California and Geoff Kors. The irony is that EQCA is the LGBT lobbying group pushing state Sen. Mark Leno's Harvey Milk Day bill - and tearing down the organization and its executive director is a gift to the opponents of that bill.
You have every right to criticize Kors and EQCA - but please offer constructive criticism so it can be useful to the movement going forward.
Thank you for your comment.
Apparently Ms. Ocamb does not understand politics nor the call for the march.
The fact that she is “stunned” by Obama’s hasty retreat from the support he promised, before we helped to elect him, shows she has little understanding of the way politics works in this country. How long will we have to wait until we have another President with the balls to do for victims of "Don't ask, Don't tell" what Harry S. Truman did for African-Americans in the military in 1948. An executive order is all that is necessary, not an act of Congress!
What is it that you seek Ms. Ocamb, marriage, or equality?! Your arguments all seem to be directed at justifying the right to marry; perhaps you should read the purpose of this march and stick to that topic. This march is for full equality for LGBT community members in ALL aspects of their lives. How dare you reduce this effort for equal rights recognition as “a three-day feel-good trip to Washington that few can afford to make” when, in reality, this is a trip that all members of our community can ill afford not to make. We “owe” this fight to future generations of American women and men.
To address Ms. Ocamb’s questions about the wisdom for a march now:
1. No, it would not be better to wait, we need to do this as soon as possible. Don’t you realize that the media in this country is responsible for public and therefore executive, legislative, and possibly even judicial opinion. When our elected officials see the masses of supporters descend upon Washington on every television station, hear about us on every radio station, and read about us in every newspaper, it will not matter if it is Columbus Day, Independence Day, or Christmas Day, they will have no choice but to hear our united voice. For “equal rights” we need only reach an audience of nine men and women, the Supreme Court.
If we wait for all of the factions of the “community” to weigh in, the march will never happen.
2. The four month-deadline and economic downturn affects our foes as much as ourselves, and may actually be in our favor. Many of those who oppose us will be fresh from family holidays, and summertime commitments, which could significantly reduce their resolve to counter-demonstrate. Hotels and flights will be cheaper for us at that time. And, as for who will pay for the set-up… well, we can all be assured it will not be you, not the naysayer’s. It will fall to us, the faithful, those who never say give up, the doers, the community members who want the next generation to have a more “equal” life than we have had to endure.
3. As for Maine and the possible repeal of their marriage equality act, and then New Jersey, and then, and then…. I guess you just do not understand constitutional law or the point of this march at all Ms. Ocamb. We need to bypass the years of delays by the several states and go directly to the Supreme Court, and go as often as is necessary to win our battle. Or shall we again suffer the indignities of the ERA, the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution was first proposed in the United States Congress in December 1923? It was promoted by Alice Paul and the National Women's Party. Even now, it remains unratified 86 years later. I don’t know about you Ms. Ocamb, but I am not willing to wait another 86 years.
4. Your prejudices in favor of California are showing Ms. Ocamb… more Proposition 8 rhetoric. I say abandon the issue of marriage equality in the states completely! Until the federal government recognizes marriage equality, we will all still have “less” than our heterosexual counterparts. Marriage equality should extend to all matters of taxation, inheritance, medical and funeral decisions, and immigration and naturalization. None of these can be conferred by the states (even if all 50 vote to redefine marriage) these can only be conferred by our federal government.
5. Yes, we are all suffering the effects of this economic downturn, and that is no joke. Anyone with knowledge of the workings of fund allocation would be aware that the easiest cutbacks are from those who are the most needy, the poor, the ill, and the true minorities who have little electoral value to politicians. Ms. Ocamb, if your concerns really are with the cuts in state health insurance, state welfare programs and AIDS agencies, why then are you not asking all Californians to forego the expense of a new Proposition 8 style ballot measure until times are better. The considerable amounts of money saved, by both parties to this debate, could then be given to those needy agencies, in a show of generosity, by fundraisers on both sides of the California marriage issue.
You close by acknowledging your support: “At least one person agrees with me… Geoff Kors, executive director of Equality California.” I am so happy that you have one supporter Ms. Ocamb, I am also happy that it is not me.
I will close with my five reasons to march in Washington, D.C. in October:
1. God does not teach us to hate,
2. God does not teach us to discriminate,
3. God does not teach us bigotry,
4. God does not limit equality,
5. God does not take away our rights… Man does! And says he does it in the name of God!

Wow - thanks for the long response to this June 1 post.
Cleve - who I've know for quite some time - made some of these same points to me in a 45 minute conversation about what he really meant by calling for a march - especially that, at the time we spoke - it wasn't a "march" as we've historically considered it. Rather, he said, it was more like a beginning organizing tool.
Of course, since the horrendous motion by Obama's Dept. of Justice to dismiss a federal DOMA challenge, the march has taken on a whole new meaning. David Mixner even teased me to see if I'd changed my mind.
To be sure, if a march happens, I'll be there to cover it. I am, after all the news editor of the Southern California LGBT publication Frontiers in LA and many of the march organizers are from LA and/or California.
And being the news editor for an LA LGBT publicationt, Dr. Bullock, may explain my "prejudice" toward all things Californian and Prop 8 - which, BTW, is a HUGE story. The federal lawsuit filed by famed attorneys Ted Olson and David Bois to to find Prop 8 invalid under the US Constitution speaks to DOMA, for instance.
As to not understanding politics. Well, I'll leave that assessment up to you, as is your right. I would just note that I've been calling
out Barack Obama for some time now.
Check my posts here -
or perhaps this one from May 4 -
Or THIS one from Dec. 18, 2008 - when the country and many LGBTs were still totally smitten by the President-elect. This one is called "Obama's Vision - He Doesn't See Us." -
As to the economy - last week Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed cutting $80.1 million in funding to HIV/AIDS programs - including ADAP. If the cuts are approved, that also jeopardizes
our Ryan White Care Act funding. There are also deep proposed cuts to SSI, housing, and a number of other government services people living with HIV (and other poor and vulnerable populations) need.
And yes - there is a hearty debate here over whether the community here can raise the necessary $20 million-plus for a ballot initiative in 2010 given the new AIDS funding crisis. I have been reporting about all of this - though not always in blogs since my primary duty is to my magazine.
My point in these blogs is to raise questions to help further a dialogue - which both Cleve Jones and David Mixner have acknowledged and appreciated. It apparently stirred you - which is a good thing.
Thank you for engaging.
Thank you Karen for acknowledging my response to your article of June 1, and my right to disagree with your platform. I hope that you did not find my criticisms too biting, as that was not my intent. I think as time goes by, we will find that we will agree on many more issues than those that cause us disagreement.
I was in San Diego when the California Supreme Court took away our rights; I marched with my community there from Balboa Park to City Hall; I heard the roar of our united voices; and I was proud. I was in Fresno for the Meet in the Middle Walk and Rally, where I was both inspired by the words I heard and disappointed by many others. California was my childhood and adult home for 40 years, and California gave me the resolve to fight this fight to it's rightful conclusion. I am currently living in Southern Oregon, but am in the process of making the transition to San Diego this month, where I know all the budget cuts will affect me directly.
As a man who has been living with HIV/Aids and all of its life altering effects for the past 28 years, I truly sympathize with your efforts with regards to the economy of California; and on behalf of the various program cuts that seem so imminent. I do not mean to trivialize any of those issues you raised, but feel that the issue of LGBT equal rights is a separate issue that needs to be treated as such.
We have the power, as a significantly large minority population (12% to 15% = 36,720,000 to 45,900,000), to appreciably affect the outcome of any national election. We just need to find cohesiveness, perhaps a national rally will be the catalyst that begins the process of our unification. If we can muster the support of only one in a hundred of us (about 400,0000) and each bring a friend or family member, we can approach that magic number, one million for equality.
I truly believe in what the new marriage initiative is seeking to accomplish, but deeply feel that this is a national issue, and needs to be addressed as such. A marriage at the state level will still not let me live happily ever after with someone if he is not a citizen of the U.S.. I want that right! I want all of the rights I have been so long denied. I have waited for 60 years, I don't want to wait any longer.
I hope to see you when I am in Washington, D.C. in October.
With sincere respect and appreciation for the work you do for our community,
Holt
When are we going to get serious about equal rights? I read all of the comments as to why we should not converge on Washington, all of the reasons not to go.
When are we going to have the guts as a minotity group to say we have had enough of this segregation, this discrimination, this hate, and this bigotry? When do we get to begin to live 'our' lives, the lives we were born to live?
Ask yourself if you really want to be equal.
If you can truly say yes to that question, then you will have only one response when asked if you will march, if you will fight the fight, if you will go to Washington. You will say YES, over and over again, YES, for as long as it takes.
You will go to D.C. this year, and next year, and every year after that until we gain our rights. You will do all that is necessary to get you to Washington. You will scrimp and save; dig deeply into your pockets; beg, borrow, (but please don't steal); and you will enlist the aid of others in this fight. You will decide that a new outfit, a vacation on the beach, even a new car, is not as important to you as this struggle. You will go to Washington, walk with your brethren, raise your voices in unity, lie in the streets in protest, and boycott all businesses and churches everywhere that discriminate against us. You will make our united voice so loud that it will surely be heard in the halls of Congress, the Judiciary, and the Whie House; the cry will deafen our detractors, and we will accomplish the change we seek.
You have a choice, you can choose the level of your involvement, you can decide to stay at home and watch, or you can show the world that you are dedicated to our battle for equality. Join me for equality, join me in October, join me and truly begin to LIVE your lives!

If you're a fickle fair weather photographer you're missing out on loads of great photo opportunities. Face the elements and find out how to get the best of out all weathers.
A scene can be totally transformed by a touch of mist or fog. Catch it first thing in the morning, when the earliest rays of sunshine appear, and you could be in for an award-winning photo. Avoid just thick blankets of fog without any interesting details at all.
Bright overhead sunlight can drain the colour out of an image and give harsh shadows in portrait pictures. As always, early morning and late afternoon light are much more flattering. If you're getting less than impressive results leave the bright sunshine in favour of a shady spot for you subject instead.
There's plenty of inspiration for frost filled images on cold winter mornings; the key is to get out there early enough to catch them! Try taking a wide angle landscape shot of a frosty scene, then go to the other extreme with a really tight close up. Look for examples of frost strengthening the outline of whatever it's clinging to. Capture both the heavy frost and later as it starts to melt for different effects.
Most of us love the sunshine but photographically speaking cloudy weather is often easier to work with, as clouds help to diffuse the light. It's also worth watching for sun starting to break through cloud and provide wonderful shafts of light for stunning landscape shots.
Windy weather is one of the most troublesome conditions to work with. It can provide really dramatic images but it's a good idea to find a sheltered position to take your photos from if you can. If you're using a tripod make sure it's a heavy one that is unlikely to get blown over. Many tripods enable you to attach your camera bag as extra ballast against the elements, which can be really useful. You’ll be glad you made the extra effort when it comes to creating personalised gifts for family and friends.
Snowy landscapes make beautiful pictures. When you're surrounded by snow though you'll find it reflects loads of light, making getting the right exposure a little tricky. Cameras tend to overcompensate giving rather grey images. Solve this by setting a slightly longer exposure time than your auto exposure recommends.
Yes you want to keep your camera dry, but that doesn't mean putting it away the moment you sense a downpour. Work undercover and you can capture plenty of great shots. Ideally you want a combination of sun and rain for high contrast images, rather than dull rainy days. It's also great if you can point your camera towards the sun to highlight the raindrops. After the rain has gone take close ups of water droplets and look for interesting reflections in puddles.
For the gallery please send a maximum of four high-resolution images, complete with short captions and the photographer's name. Please ensure there are no copyright issues with using your images. Then keep your eyes peeled for them appearing!
Images of extreme weather conditions look great displayed together. How about framing a set of prints of the same scene in different conditions? Make your own weather collage. Or create a personalised calendar showing the typical weather shots for each’.UIC Highspeed 2012 will be held in Philadelphia, July 10 to 13, 2012.

I currently have 96 blogs on my blog reader. There are days when I gobble everything up, but for the last week, I've been skipping over loads of them. I totally deleted Cote de Texas because it loads too slowly. I feel like half the blogs I read just repost pictures from other blogs. I mean, how many times are we going to see the hallway with the white framed mirrors reposted?
I'm thinking of deleting all blogs that only repost inspiration pictures. I can find those anywhere.
I'm sharing this here because the present company does NOT fall into the category described.
but it takes forever to load!
right? Perhaps is the resolution. I do love her blog. I catch up with her on the team blog she does.
I'm so tired of reading about it and seeing pleas for votes.
Thank goodness for Mrs. Lime, Freckles, Copy Cat, and the others who post new, fun things for us to read. I'm really tired of seeing every page of House Beautiful posted on blogs.
prize, I'd probably be asking for votes too. So I don't hold it against them. I just want to see some new stuff.
But that said - its a lot of pressure to come up with content all the time so I cut all bloggers a lot of slack. It seems a lot easier than it looks and I don't put in nearly the amount of effort that those big name bloggers like Nicole, TYH, etc. do.
...or graphic.
I'm sorry, all. I didn't mean to start a big thing. I just got overwhelmed by my reader and realized that a good amount of the posts coming through were duplicates of posts on other blogs. I did some weeding and got my reader down to 96 blogs, which is still too many to keep straight in my head!
I notice that some of the Apartment Therapy team lifts from other bloggers without giving credit. The most recent example was when a blogger wrote about an antique store called On a Whim that is very popular in Northern Virginia. In the comments, there was discussion of that store and another one on the same road. A few days later, AT's DC blogger wrote about the stores. I just posted a link to the blog in the comments on the AT post and figured I'd leave it at that.
They are notorious for that and a lot of members have called them out on it. It's not all of the writers. I've seen a few that always credit their sources and then there are a few who just cut and paste most of their posts without due credit (mostly from NY & Chicago blogs)! This issue is becoming more and more prevalent! It should be addressed. There was a huge news article about this a while back, should have saved it, about bloggers suing other bloggers because of all this lifting crap! No need to apologize!
I certainly feel better after my little b**** fest. I got the music thing off my chest, learned I wasn't alone in my concerted efforts to vote for MiL, and now here I am, feeling all better.
That's part of what this board's for, right?
I feel like I should thank you for saying what I've been feeling. I'm curing my blog fatigue w/ lots of wine. What else is new, right. =]
It's just an annoyance factor for me. I get it, you want to win. But, you've just turned your blog into the give us the money, biatches, blog for the past couple of months.
I agree! It IS a lot of pressure to create new and fresh content every single day and kudos to those who can do it without "stealing" content from others. And, yes, I know these things are not "proprietary," but for the love of God, if you copy decor projects or content specifically from other blogs then give them freaking credit! The decor blog world is small and, I believe, most bloggers would only feel flattery that you inspired them.
And, in my particular case, it was pretty obvious to see what was going on because of our software-Woopra! A certain blogger was clicking on our posts in the design forum and then re-creating/recycling the post(s) the very next day on their blog! If you're going to use DecorPad as a source for a majority of your blog content then be honest about it. Why not give our members credit? What's the harm? Their response: It's not proprietary! Nice! Burn those bridges!
To clarify: Sharing decor ideas is fantastic! My issue is with giving credit, especially when a blogger is taking mass amounts of content from one Site and publishing it on another.
It's one thing to dole out design advice; it's a whole other ball game when one claims to be a DIY 'expert' on home reno's and such. Esp. when they hired out for all the big reno projects. I'm all for the entrepreunerial spirit and making a living off a blog........but when one sounds sanctimonious about doling out advice, that just irks me. Would it kill them to say "When we saw such and such, it inspired us to ____________." People wouldn't think any less of them.
The "preaching" thing kills me! Especially when it's lifted from another blog too. Ugh!
You mean other bloggers we're taking projects and ideas from here and then posting them as "Looky here at how creative and wonderful I am?"
They have stopped doing it to us, but I can't speak for others.
anything but there have been times where I've questioned shall we say "borrowing of material" from my blog. It could be coincidence but I know they do read mine and I hate to think the worst of someone but............it's been bothering me. And I would have probably ignored it if it hadn't been for a few of my readers (who aren't DP'ers) who emailed me to notify me of the "coincidence".
Again, I'm not all THAT and a bag of chips and it's a coincidental and crazy blogworld out there. I (as I'm sure others who have speculated) would have been flattered/honored had they credited the source.
I must be getting paranoid in my old age.
And, I'm not one of those people who emailed you. They posted the exact same project just a couple days after you! Dejavu, I just read this same exact post on freckles chic blog! I just don't get why these people don't give credit when we all frequent the same blogs! Meh!
was "it's not proprietary"!!!! Creeps.
They said: "These things are not proprietary!" LOL! Legally, I get the whole concept that a lot of these ideas are not proprietary, but at least be honest and say almost all of of our blog content came directly from DecorPad this month! They missed the point, entirely!
'clients' for this deception. Bad enough to take credit for something not yours and even worse to charge for it.
Damned close, anyway.
I could care less how they make their money! I'm just glad they've stopped with DP!
I know that there is a lot of "posting the same posts" thing going around. When something "fresh" comes out, it catches like wildfire, but I had no clue that people were lifting ideas from other sites and selling the idea boards. Wow, excuse me but, that is ballsy! And distasteful!
posting the same posts thing is normal when you get all the same magazines or shop at the same stores and especially when something fresh comes out, it does spread like wildfire. But, when it's something so obscure and random, and when it's always posted 1-3 days after your post, and when it's done day after day for weeks, coincidence just goes out of the window! Especially, when you have proof that they have looked at your posts!
Their idea boards have nothing to do with lifting, that's all them.
There are so many decor blogs out there these days they all sort of run together. My faves are the ones that balance design, life , and humor. I don;t mind the baby ones but if it's all baby all the time, I just can'tr relate, you know? I think Teresa does a fab job balancing the content on her blog even though she's a new mom. And I feel that DP'er's blogs are SOOO unique! Love reading them.
ITA hallelujah that the BHG challenge is OVER. I can't stand their blog who shall not be named so I voted for Nicole @ Making It Lovely every day.
I do a "spring cleaning" every few months and delete blogs that just don't appeal to me anymore, LOL.
And awww, thx jeannine for reading mine.......random question but do you comment on mine? There's a commenter by the name "jbhat" w/ no blog link who always leaves the sweetest compliments. Just wondering! =]
but sometimes post as just "Jeannine" or as "Upstart". I'm trying to get away from that second name, though, because there is another person with the same name out there.
I blog as part of my job in a totally unrelated field, so I don't use my real blogger account when I read decor blogs. Right now is the "quiet season" for my blog, so this is when I tend to get tempted about starting a decorating blog. However, from September-May, my blog is a handful (traffic on the peak day this year was about 21,000 unique hits with 404 comments coming in from high maintenance constituents) and I have to remind myself that while I can handle a personal blog right now (under 10 comments per day, very little traffic), I would never do as good a job as the blogs I read and that would frustrate me.
Anyway, as for the BHG challenge, I feel the same way many of you do and hope Nicole comes out on top.
at what you said about the BHG contest. I don't usually vote for things like that but in this case I stickied a note to my computer so I'd remember to vote every day for Nicole. I was thinking I was the only one who felt that way.
about them NOT winning, that I actually set a reminder in my Outlook calendar to vote everyday. Ha!
I'm glad today is the last day too! No more begging for votes EVERY.SINGLE.FREAKING.DAY. from that blog! Ugh!
I've been getting pretty selective about the blogs I read lately as well. I don't have much free time anymore. I prefer original content over inspirational photos. I adore all of the blogs from DecorPaders - very original, cute and humorous. I love seeing little home projects or just a "day in the life" post. It's like a mini vacation to peer into the life of someone else for a minute.
my friends and I genuinely care about what's going on in your lives.
: )
I love DP, and my most recent favorite is Kate at Centsational Girl, she's great. Mrs. L's blog as I love her style and seeing what she's up to in her house. My pet peeve is music on blogs. Drives me nuts. And weirdly, someone I used to enjoy is recently irritating the hell out of me. LOL. I tend to avoid baby blogs because I've been there done that, four times and it's no longer an interest but I can imagine what I'd been like when I had my first.
I've deleted blogs that are too slow to load as well! Some of them freeze my computer so I've had to delete them too. Don't really mind the blogs that post photos because I am obsessed with decor porn though
I agree! We have some of the best bloggers posting at Decorpad!"Those undergrads who had a tougher time ignoring unrelated stuff were also seven times more likely to be rated as "eminent creative achievers" based on their previous accomplishments..Such lapses in attention turn out to be a crucial creative skill."He does go on to note that these studies conducted were with college students, and results may be different with younger subjects. Furthermore he acknowledges how important it is for school-related success to execute mental control over attention.
So where does this leave us? I see two correlates:
- In school, it is important for our kids to hone attention to what is being said by the teacher and to attend to the tasks directed by him or her.
- Finding time to daydream, to depart the text, to brainstorm, to pursue creative venues is equally important.
- Read aloud and brainstorm alternative endings and titles to the chapters or to the books.
- When reading, brainstorm sequels.
- Make cakes and cards for parties instead of buying them. Create and design the cake, invitation, and decorations.
- Build forts in the snow, in the house (with chairs, sheets, blankets, boxes...).
- Design and Create - don't buy costumes for Halloween or other costume parties.
- Brainstorm unusual Sunday activities, or unusual family meals (experiment!).
- Take advantage of local historical sights, museums, nature trails, and events.
- Read all sorts of books, articles and of course, graphic novels, comic books!
As I am in comic book/graphic novel mode (see my "Note" to the right), let's talk about how comic books and graphic novels can help:
Attention and Graphic Novels: When reading graphic novels, the reader MUST ATTEND to verbal and visual stimuli:
- to the words,
- to the font shape;
- to font sizes,
- to the illustrations,
- to the color of the fonts and illustrations,
- to the foreground and background of the illustrations
- and even to the way the panels (dialogue and picture 'boxes') are laid out on the page.
How to use graphic novels to build attention:
- If you read graphic novels together (which I recommend):
- Talk about the art - how it makes you feel, what you noticed immediately, what took time to see and understand.
- Discuss design components and the page layout. Discuss changes in layout and why the illustrator may have made those changes.
- Ruminate about how word size and fonts all contribute to the story.
- Look for and discuss details.
- You may want to create your own graphic novels for favorite book and stories. Doing this forces you to focus on the essential dialogue and story elements. It provides opportunities to brainstorm about design and layout as well.
A note of graphic novel selections:
- Please see my blog post of October, 13, 2010 for lists of graphic novel genres, kid friendly graphic novels and publishers, and a brief history of modern comics.
- Also please note that especially for younger kids - adults should be involved in selecting graphic novels. There are some wonderful ones, but they have various levels of violence and sexual innuendo. There are many with little or none: (Laika, Zeus, Athena, Robot Dreams, American Born Chinese all published by First Second Books), The Bone Series and Ghostopolis (Scholastic) have some minor violence but is appropriate for younger readers, These are just a few suggestions.
- WHEN IN DOUBT SEEK A LIBRARIAN'S ADVICE - most good librarians not only know their graphic novels, they are strong advocates.The Madera City Council has voted to encourage Maderans to attend the next session of the Citizen Academy, which is set to begin March 11. It would meet eight successive Monday evenings.
City Administrator David Tooley, in his report to the council on the academy, urged council members to use their contacts in the community “to help identify the next generation of potential community leaders for participation in a session.”
The academy starts out as a boot camp for citizenship. It teaches people how city government works, which is something many, if not most Maderans don’t know much about.
For example, people are vaguely aware of the City Council, but have little idea of what it does. They often confuse it with the Madera County Board of Supervisors, which meets across the street.
The Citizen Academy clears the air as far as who does what, and addresses questions such as:
- Who is on the City Council.
- How to run for the City Council.
- Ways to contact the City Council member who represents me.
- Ways to bring subjects before the City Council.
- Ways to participate in city government by being a volunteer.
- How to find out about the rules and regulations citizens must follow when building a house or adding to a house, starting a business or posting signs.
- How to favor or oppose a change in zoning proposed for one’s neighborhood.
- What to expect from law enforcement and how to contribute to neighborhood safety.
Those who have participated in Citizen Academies report positive outcomes for themselves and fellow students. They report making friends and becoming more aware of the city around them.
Most of us have taken civics classes, so we know a little about government works. What you learn in the Citizen Academy is that the government that works best is the government closest to the people.
If you are interested, apply at the City Clerk’s office at City Hall.Abstract
Renaissance Learning got acquired by private equity firm Hellman & Friedman on Monday for $1.1 billion in cash. The deal was announced today.
The acquisition comes less than a month after Google Capital invested $40 million in Renaissance Learning, valuing the company at $1 billion. Google Capital plans to stay on board as investor.
Key Takeaway
Renaissance Learning was founded by Judi and Terry Paul in 1984 who have also remained the majority shareholders in the company for the longest time. British private equity firm Permira acquired Renaissance Learning for $440 million in 2011, taking the company off the public markets, fourteen years after its IPO in 1997.
Though the investment by Google Capital and the acquisition seem to be orchestrated, Renaissance Learning’s CEO John J. Lynch Jr. told NYT Dealb%k that it was serendipitous. The company had been in talks with Hellman & Friedman before Google’s investment but was not sure when it would start working with them according to Fortune.
According to Lynch Renaissance Learning is currently working on a GPS for students, identifying where they are on their learning path and what they are ready to learn. The business has high margins according to Lynch and saw a revenue growth of 20% last year. Currently, about 20 million students are using the platform at a cost of $5 per student per year.
As Liz Gannes points out on re/code, this acquisition is not ideal for Google Capital as the return on their investment would be minimal. Therefore, it seems as if Google Capital will ramp up its minority stake in Renaissance Learning alongside Hellman & Friedman.
Lynch estimates that Hellman & Friedman will hold on to their investment for four to seven years after which a new IPO or another acquisition might happen.
The new money will be invested in international expansion and research and development of the analytics products.

I enjoy the benefits it clearly brings and the quality it adds to my life but I find it hard to keep it straight in company. I feel I would have to justify my eating habits. But that's it: from now on I do what feels good for myself. Here are my goals:
- stick to the primal eating plan except for two meals a week or 1h before/after a strenous exercise.
- incorporate at least 2 strength sessions a week.
- increase leg strength by 10kg at 20 reps.

Igor Goldkind said he was picking out dairy in the North Parade grocery store when another customer became impatient and the abuse started.
It included, at one point, the man saying: “I will buy you the cheese but I will take half – like you took half of Palestine.”
The 50-year-old has reported the clash to the police and said: “I have never experienced that in my life before.
“I was in the queue at the grocer and we were talking about cheese and I was trying to select a portion of cheese.”
He said the man behind him in the queue asked about Mr Goldkind’s origins and Mr Goldkind told him he was Jewish-American.
Mr Goldkind, who is not a practising Jew, said: “That’s when it started. It just went on and on. Everyone was so shocked.”
Thames Valley Police is now investigating the incident.
Mr Goldkind, who also lives in North Parade, said: “I do not think this gentleman should be permitted to utter that kind of racial abuse in public.
“He felt an entitlement to put me in my place as a Jewish person and I think that is despicable.
“He apparently just wanders around Oxford spitting his bile at anyone who will listen to him.
“There is a tendency to turn your back on this. But I am not English. I am American and we make a fuss.”
Simon Fineman, of Farndon Road, was also shopping when he witnessed the outburst.
The 54-year-old, who is also Jewish, said: “He was just trying to provoke a reaction by saying outrageous things and he managed it. I thought what he said was horrible but I wasn’t going to rise to it. It was genuinely unpleasant but there was no violence.”
It comes as reports of racially or religiously aggravated crime increased two per cent in Oxford last financial year from 54 to 55.
Police also recorded 100 racist incidents between April 1 last year and March 31 this year – up on the 95 in the period before. Racist incidents that were not classed as a crime by police rose 37 per cent to 85 from 62.
Jonathan Bard, vice president of the Oxford Jewish Congregation, said incidents like this were extremely rare.
He said: “This reflects on the person who did the abuse rather than Oxford.”
No arrest had last night been made but a Thames Valley Police spokesman confirmed the incident was being investigated.
No-one from the shop was available for comment.NYC a superb place to see Pittsburghers on stageDecember 7, 2013 9:04 PM
On its five-day, four-night November trip to Broadway, the Post-Gazette ShowPlane included just three shows ("Matilda," "Kinky Boots" and "Motown") in order to leave two open theater slots for the 45 travelers to make individual choices. And they did, enjoying a wide range of options from "The Glass Menagerie" to "The Book of Mormon," "Pippin" to Billy Crystal, "Tosca" to the Rockettes.
Three-fourths of the way through, we gathered for a post-show drink at Sardi's to discuss what we'd seen. It was right after "Kinky Boots," and not surprisingly, when asked which of the three group shows they most enjoyed, "Kinky Boots" garnered 19 votes, compared to 10 for "Matilda" and five for "Motown." (Some couldn't decide and some had already headed off to bed.)
The highlight of that Sardi's session was the appearance of Billy Porter, Tony-winning star of "Kinky Boots." The Pittsburgh native (Homewood, CAPA, CMU) promised to stop by for a few minutes but relaxed in the warmth of our interest and admiration and stayed for much of an hour, talking with candor and humor about the show and the challenges of show biz.
If the vote on a favorite show had come after his visit instead of before, it might have been unanimous.
But Mr. Porter wasn't the only Pittsburgher we saw in a starring role. CMU grad Chris Hoch is playing the horrific Miss Trunchbull in "Matilda." Some of us saw Tina Benko (CMU) in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," along with Pittsburgh native Jacob Ming-Trent (Pittsburgh Musical Theatre). Some saw Zachary Quinto and Cherry Jones (both CMU) in "The Glass Menagerie." The list could go on.
Speaking of Pittsburghers, the Broadway segments on the Thanksgiving parade telecasts featured several: Billy Porter, of course; Chris Hoch's Miss Trunchbull in "Matilda"; CMU's svelte, Tony-winning Patina Miller as the Leading Player in "Pippin" and Michael Campayno (still a senior at CMU) as Rolf in "The Sound of Music."
PG theater trips are announced in the paper. But to request individual notice, contact Candi at Gulliver's Travels, 412-441-3131.to page content

In the past 5 majors, the 5 different winners were all 30 years old or younger! (Actually, McDowell was 30, the rest are all in their 20s!) Rory is the youngest at 22 years old, and he is going to stay on top because of the experience he has gained playing in the past few majors (most notably at Augusta when he lost his Sunday lead), the mechanics he uses in his swing and the mental strength he has exhibited during this week's US Open.
Rory came out fighting Sunday, not protecting his lead but increasing it. How was this different from the collapse at the Masters in April? It was all his perspective.
"What I did today, I tried to set myself a little target, little goals, just because it kept me from focusing on the leader board and focusing on how far ahead I was or anything like that," McIlroy explained. "... That really kept me in the present."
Mental Strength in golf is simply staying present. As Rory described, setting the little goals that keep you focused on the shot at hand is the best way to keep you moving in the right direction in your round. Here's how you can do it, too:
Before every swing, describe to yourself everything you can about the shot you are about to attempt. Find out:
- How far is the target, is it level, elevated or lower
- How is the lie of the ball, fairway, rough, sand
- Is there wind, will the ball fly to the target or roll
- What shape of shot will you need, draw or fade?
- Then decide how these factors will affect your shot as a low, medium or high risk play. Fully commit to your choice.
- Finally, describe to yourself how you will execute the shot you've chosen. Keep these swing thoughts simple.
- Use this process when the heat is on and your mind will not drift into negative self thoughts that can ruin a round.
The Mechanics in Rory's swing are perfection. Statistically, he lead all players in Greens In Regulation for the US Open with 86% (62 of 72!). That is 20% higher than last year's Open at Pebble beach. Phil Mickelson's caddy, Jim "Bones" MacKay said after seeing McIlroy's game up close for the first two rounds of the US Open, he had never seen a better two rounds of golf played, EVER. Here are a few keys to emulate in your swing:
- Start with a clean, well balanced address position. Getting perfectly centered in your golf stance means having evenly distributed weight from left to right and heels to toes. In this "ready" position, you will feel little or no muscle activation as you hold the club. (Drill: Stand in your golf posture and get centered. You will feel relaxed and ready to turn. Drift slightly toward your toes and you will notice your leg muscles will slightly contract, locking up the farther forward you drift towards your toes. Drift back to center and notice how the muscles in your stance relax again, returning you to a perfect "ready" position.)
- Turn First! Rotation is the first move to every swing you will make in golf! Too many players "shift" to the right to begin their take away and this is wrong. Once you have achieved the "Ready" position at address, Rotate your upper body over a stable lower and you will start a perfect sequence. [1]
- Learn to control the club face like Rory. On the take away, the club face will match the forward tilt in your spine angle. Watch this video and stop it at the 0:02 mark. [2]This is a perfectly square club face to the swing path Rory is swinging, ensuring a straight ball flight.
- Get to your left side at impact! Shifting to the target as your arms drop in front of you is a powerful move that will increase distance, something Rory did better than anyone this week. Watch this video from 0:04 to 0:07 [3]
Remember this US Open and the perfection we witnessed. I think it will be the first of many trophies raised by Rory McIlroy.

[4]Opportunity New Jersey obligated Verizon to complete full broadband deployment for its network by 2010. Despite evidence that Greenwich and Stow Creek townships are not being provided these services, Verizon asserted in its answer to the BPU Show Cause Order, dated April 12, that the company has met and gone beyond its ONJ commitments and, therefore, BPU should refrain from pursuing the Show Cause Order.
“Verizon met its commitment, investing more than $13 billion — billions more than was contemplated by ONJ — equipping 100% of its central offices with broadband capability and building out infrastructure that Board Staff acknowledges enables Verizon to offer broadband service to customers in more than 99% of the census blocks in New Jersey,” wrote attorneys on behalf of Verizon New Jersey in the company’s answer to the BPU Show Cause Order.
“...That a tiny fraction of individual households in the State are not realistically reachable for broadband service does not mean that Verizon failed to fully deploy in the State,” the answer document goes on to state.
BPU reportedly described the PAR-1 Order as allowing Verizon “freedom from traditional rate base regulation in exchange for certain rate protections...” and commitment to ONJ infrastructure improvements. The PAR-1 Order was replaced by a “PAR-2” effective 2002.
The Board of Public Utilities issued a Show Cause Order dated March 12 — based in part upon information and belief that residents of Greenwich and Stow Creek are not being providing broadband capabilities consistent with ONJ — directing Verizon to show cause why BPU should not find that Verizon failed to comply with the PAR Order in providing full broadband capability by 2010.
Verizon’s answer claims that the Show Cause Order regarding “two New Jersey towns where Verizon provides broadband to schools and libraries and surrounding areas, but does not reach every resident with broadband” “...overlooks Verizon’s commitment over the past 20 years to satisfy the ONJ objectives with massive and, in many cases, uneconomic investment to deploy broadband to make New Jersey the leading state in broadband connectivity.”
The answer document states that original estimates for network development projects that became encompassed by ONJ were $3.87 billion between 1992 and 1999, with an additional anticipated investment of approximately $1.5 billion during these years based on ONJ specifically.
Through actual investments of more than $13.3 billion on network development since plan approval, Verizon claims to have “provided the State with even more than it bargained for when the Board approved the plan nearly twenty years ago,” including meeting its Opportunity New Jersey objectives: full availability of an Advanced Intelligent Network in 1997, full availability of Narrowband Digital Services in 1997, statewide availability of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Switched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS) under the category of Wideband Digital Services, full compliance with Access New Jersey for schools and libraries by 2001 and, finally, equipping 100 percent of central offices with DSL with broadband available to customers in more than 99 percent of census blocks by 2010 under the category of Broadband Digital Services.
The National Broadband Plan, Verizon’s answer document states, also “noted the availability of broadband through other providers and specifically highlighted that satellite was well-suited to fill in coverage gaps for high cost/low density areas.”
“‘Because service providers in these areas [with low population density] cannot earn enough revenue to cover the costs of deploying and operating broadband networks, including expected returns on capital, there is no business case to offer broadband services in these areas,’” Verizon’s answer document states, citing FCC’s National Broadband Plan.
Verizon claims that “certain unique circumstances” associated with Stow Creek and Greenwich, such as the roughly 18,000-feet distance from the nearest central office in Bridgeton, create logistical difficulties reaching every household there with broadband.
The company explains that, based on census data, Stow Creek has a population density of 76 people per square mile based on a population of 1,429 individuals living in 560 housing units, while Greenwich is home to 847 people in 361 housing units, with a population density of 43 persons per square mile.
“These unique circumstances have combined to make broadband deployment cost-prohibitive in certain areas of these towns. It is simply too expensive to reach every household, and any such investment is uneconomic, given the low population density,” Verizon’s Show Cause Order answer document states.
“The Board did not contemplate any such mandate as a remedy for lack of performance under Opportunity New Jersey in 1993. Rather, it envisioned ‘remedies’ that would take away the benefits of alternative regulation — benefits that have been irrelevant for some time in the changed communications market,” the document states.
According to the company’s Show Cause Order response, the PAR-1 Order provided that if Verizon were not to perform its ONJ obligations “‘...the Board shall consider remedies such as [1] altering the depreciation allowances for [Verizon], [2] restructuring [Verizon’s] ability to implement indexed price increases, or [3] in the extreme scenario, voiding the [alternative regulation] plan and instituting a traditional base rate proceeding.’”
However, Verizon’s answer document explains that “with the passage of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, the emergence and popularity of the Internet, and the growth in wireless services, the communications marketplace has been transformed since 1993.
“...This market transformation dictates that Verizon is no longer the dominant telecommunications provider in New Jersey that it was when it operated as New Jersey Bell, let alone the monopoly utility for which the Board approved the PAR-1 plan and ONJ,” the document goes on to state, adding that “Verizon’s revenue has declined twice as rapidly as its costs” and “Verizon is now at the point where it has operated for the past several years in New Jersey with significant negative net income for both its intrastate and total company (interstate and intrastate) operations.”
Therefore, the company asserts, BPU “would not reasonably consider implementing any of these ‘remedies’ today, as Verizon now operates in a completely different environment” that would “produce a shortfall in meeting a revenue requirement for Verizon” and thus “produce substantial price increases to produce revenues sufficient to meet the cost of serving customers.”
The document concludes that the answer provided by Verizon to the Board of Public Utilities should resolve the concerns raised in the Show Cause Order, and therefore BPU should refrain from pursuing the Order. However, if BPU should conclude otherwise and opt to move forward with the proceeding, Verizon requests the company be granted a “full and complete evidentiary hearing” before taking any action considered adverse to Verizon.
BPU has directed Verizon New Jersey to provide any and all information “necessary to evaluate the design and condition of Verizon’s infrastructure, and the operating, maintenance and performance levels of service provided in New Jersey” as part of this order, and specifically ordered submission of “details of all construction, maintenance and repair data, including the dates and costs associated with each as well as current plans for any network upgrade including specific timelines for the completion of such upgrades” concerning Greenwich and Stow Creek townships.
“Since last fall, Verizon has taken steps to invest in maintenance measures to improve our wireline network infrastructure in places like Greenwich Township to increase the reliability of telephone service,” reported Verizon spokesman Lee Gierczynski. “These efforts are paying off, and we’ve seen a decline in customer complaints in Greenwich. Since October 2011, the number of complaints there has consistently trended downward and is half of what it was seven months ago.”
Commissioner Nicholas Asselta will serve as presiding officer at the May 9 hearing, which will solicit “input from affected customers” and “determine the scope of of the service issues and whether the PAR-2 service requirements are being met and continue to serve the public interest,” according to the BPU service quality order.
Pittsgrove Township resident James Colby said he has learned not to expect to have quality landline phone service whenever it rains, like many residents in Greenwich and Stow Creek, due to the age of hardwire infrastructure on his side of town. He also questioned why he has been stuck with “very slow broadband” Internet service while other township residents living 2.2 miles away from him allegedly enjoy FiOS availability.
Colby said a BPU representative responded to his complaints and suggested he attend the May 9 public hearing in Stow Creek to voice his concerns and hear what Verizon has to say in response to the residents in attendance.
“Regarding Pittsgrove, providing high-quality customer service is a necessity — not an option — in today’s fiercely competitive communications market where customers reward the best service providers with their business and have many options to move to other providers,” Gierczynski said. “We will gladly listen to any customers, no matter where they are, so we can better understand their needs and meet their service expectations.”
Addressing cellphone service complaints in the Greenwich and Stow Creek area, Gierczynski clarified that “issues about wireless coverage in the area need to be addressed by the wireless industry as whole, not just one player in the very competitive wireless industry.” He noted that “bringing together a coalition of wireless providers and local officials” — as Sen. Jeff Van Drew, who organized a Feb. 14 meeting on telecommunications problems in western Cumberland County, has suggested — would be a good start.
Van Drew said in March that action would be taken to put together a “cellphone summit” after the Show Cause Order was fully addressed.

Coverage: United States
Abstract:
It is through the images of the family in popular culture and literature that American Jews give form to the stresses, strains, and anxieties produced by their assimilation into American culture. This ''counter-memory'' is in sharp contrast to the official picture of a love affair between American Jews and American society. The cultural representations of the Ghetto Girl and the Jewish American Princess are examined in detail for what they tell us about American Jews' feelings about living in middle-class American society.St Mary’s signing choir in Dublin: ‘For deaf people, their voice is their hands and their bodies’

Adriatic Dental Practice is hosting its first annual "Dentistry from the Heart" complementary dental care event at its San Marcos location, 960 W. San Marcos Boulevard, CA, on November 2, 2013, from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. Dr. Valentina Obradovic, DDS, and her staff are offering a day of free dentistry, on a first-come, first-served basis, to those 18 and older who cannot get dental care elsewhere. Individuals seeking services are encouraged to arrive early; registration begins at 7:30 a.m. The first 75 patients are guaranteed to be seen. Patients should dress appropriately for the weather and bring chairs, water, or snacks in case they are waiting outside.
Oral health and oral hygiene are extremely important to the overall health of the individual. By offering complementary fillings, extractions, and cleanings, Dr. Obradovic wishes to assist those in need of these services as part of an international program of volunteerism.
"Dentistry from the Heart" is a worldwide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing charity dental care to those in need. A vision of Dr. Vincent Monticciolo in Florida over 13 years ago, "Dentistry from the Heart" offers assistance to those who, because of their circumstances, have not been able to afford basic dental care due to lack of dental insurance, loss of employment, or low income. Every year, thousands of individual dentists, hygienists, and volunteers across the world donate their time and resources to host their own charity events.
This organization is spreading smiles in the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and Puerto Rico. Dentists in these countries are making free dental care available to those without the means to secure care for themselves. Dr. Monticciolo’s idea that the dental profession could best reach out and show the world its giving spirit by using its skills and talents to help those less fortunate is realized through these events.

Chuck Hammers says after you open the second pizza place it gets easier each time.
Pizza My Heart owner Chuck Hammers never meant to build a mini-empire with 23 locations in the Bay Area. With a first Southern California location opening in Santa Barbara last year, the chain has become synonymous with pizza by the slice for many hungry technology workers and students. Hammer's chain has posted recession-proof growth throughout; he says that over the past 20 revenue has growth quarter-over-quarter without fail.
Yet the whole thing wouldn’t have happened if it OPEC didn’t end the oil embargo in the early 80s, forcing him to abandon his plans to be an oil-industry geophysicist.
So you didn’t go to pizza college. How does a geophysicist end up owning a restaurant chain?
Home of the Day
I’ve always loved physics. So when I was at Berkeley, I talked to my brother, who told me “You know, you should really get into geophysics. There’s an oil embargo on, prices are high, there’s lots of jobs, you’ll make a fortune.” So I took his advice and studied that, and I loved it. But then in my senior year the embargo ended, there were no jobs, they were laying off PhDs, and it was like, wow, what did I get myself into? What do I do?
So I went into the career counselor, money was running out, I had no prospects, I needed a plan. And I took that 300 question aptitude test, and it comes back: Physics is at the bottom, geology is at the bottom. Uh oh. But what was at the top? It was all the management stuff.
So at that point you’re thinking, oh man, I really screwed myself on this?
A little bit, yeah. But in my last semester I took some econ classes, and just smoked them. I was like, wow, I really like this. This is really fun. Too bad I’m graduating.
What happened then?
So I got out, and my brother in law who’s in the clothing and shoes business, he calls me and says, “Hey, if you’re not doing anything, we’re computerizing our store and I know you worked on computers at Cal. Can you just help us over the summer?” So I went in to help him with that, and I end up working in the store. I really, really fell in love with it, and what I loved was all the customer facing stuff. I end up working for him for 3 years. And it was great, because he was a really great marketer and taught me a lot. He started this shoe store called Athletic Shoe Factory and then built it to 65 stores before selling it. And I came out of that thinking, I really have to build something. I want to build a chain.
So why pizza?
The thing about me is, I’m an amazing creature of habit. So at Berkeley, a pizza by the slice place opens up my freshman year. That was Blondie’s. I ate there for lunch every single day.
My brother-in-law and I had actually talked about doing a clothing store together. But I realized that while I liked running the store, I wasn’t really passionate about the product. What I realized I was really passionate about was this pizza by the slice place. And at the time, nobody in the area was doing pizza by the slice, so it made perfect sense.
I put everything into it I had. I borrowed money from everyone, borrowed from my dad. I spent everything I had — my last bit of money was the food bill to open the doors. I crossed my fingers and hoped I had the money to pay my employees in two weeks. Thankfully, it just started rolling.
Eventually I got enough together that I could go to a bank and get the money to open the second store in Palo Alto. And once I was in Palo Alto, it was like boom. It took off like a rocket.
They say a company changes once it hits a certain number of employees. Was it like that having two stores?
The second one is absolutely the hardest. By far. It’s just like having kids. The first kid is easy: You’ve got the kid, he goes everywhere with you, you manage it. But once you have the second one you’re splitting your attention and instantly you’re playing defense.
Same thing with stores. If you have one store, you’re there all day and absolutely nothing goes wrong, because you’re there. If something happens, you put the fire out. As soon as you get two, you’re in the wrong store every time.
People say, how do you do it, you’re at 24 stores, how do you keep track of that? But it was the second one that was the bear. Adding another store now is not a lot. As we get bigger it gets easier.

(Edited by: Baumann, Van Susteren)Rosalynn Carter, née Eleanor Rosalynn Smith (born August 18, 1927, Plains, Georgia, U.S.), American first lady (1977–81), the wife of Jimmy Carter, 39th president of the United States, and mental health advocate. She was one of the most politically astute and active of all American first ladies.
Rosalynn was the oldest of four children (two girls and two boys) born to Wilburn Edgar Smith, a mechanic and farmer, and his wife, Allie Murray Smith. Her father’s death in 1940 at age 44, when Rosalynn was 13 years old, forced her to assume additional responsibilities and, as she would later say, ended her childhood.
In Plains, Georgia, where Rosalynn grew up and attended public schools, she met Jimmy Carter, the older brother of her best friend. While he was still a naval cadet and she was attending a local junior college, they became engaged. They married on July 7, 1946, at the Plains Methodist Church and began married life in Norfolk, Virginia, the first of several residences connected with his naval career. While raising three sons (born in 1947, 1950, and 1952), Rosalynn pursued her education, mostly through home study programs in literature and the arts. Their fourth child, Amy, was born in 1967.
In 1953, following the death of her father-in-law, Rosalynn reluctantly agreed to return to Plains, though she feared a loss of independence and fewer opportunities for travel. While Jimmy ran the family peanut business, she assisted him in bookkeeping, thus beginning a partnership that buoyed her confidence and increased his appreciation for her abilities. “I knew more about the books and more about the business on paper than Jimmy did,” she later wrote.
Her responsibilities increased after Jimmy won election to the Georgia Senate in 1962. Not only did she oversee the family business while he attended legislative sessions, she also handled much of his political correspondence and began to develop considerable respect for constituents’ views. By the time Jimmy became governor in 1970, Rosalynn had gained the confidence to campaign on her own and began giving short, extemporaneous speeches, an activity that had terrified her earlier. Prompted by conversations with voters during the campaign, she took a strong interest in mental health issues. In the governor’s mansion she presided over an establishment larger and more complicated than any she had ever managed, an excellent preparation, she later said, for the White House.
After Jimmy announced his candidacy for president, Rosalynn played an unprecedented early role. Eighteen months before the 1976 election, she began campaigning on her own, driving with a friend through towns where no one knew her to discuss why her husband should be president. Later she traveled by chartered plane to 42 states.
As first lady, Rosalynn participated in political affairs to an extent unmatched by any of her predecessors. She and her husband both acknowledged her status as a full working partner by scheduling weekly business lunches together, though her office remained in the East Wing, the traditional province of the president’s wife. She attended cabinet meetings when the subject under discussion interested her and attracted attention for taking whatever seat was vacant, even if it happened to be the one normally occupied by Vice President Walter Mondale. In June 1977 she visited seven nations in the Caribbean and Latin America and met with their leaders to discuss substantive matters related to defense and trade. Although she had prepared for the talks by studying Spanish and meeting with top economic and foreign policy advisers, she encountered considerable criticism, as well as some praise, on her return. Despite reports that she performed well, some critics questioned whether she should have assumed such a prominent role, given her lack of appointment or election. Thereafter she undertook no more such trips, though she did travel to various parts of the world for ceremonial occasions and on humanitarian missions, such as her 1979 trip to a refugee camp in Cambodia.
Like her husband, Rosalynn was noted for her practicality and her egalitarian attitudes. Her chief of staff earned the same salary as the president’s chief of staff. The first lady showed relatively little interest in refurbishing the mansion, and she ordered no new china pattern to mark her stay. As a hostess she was criticized for her inexpensive menus and her refusal to serve hard liquor, a decision she defended by citing cost considerations. Her emphasis on economy was also reflected in her wardrobe: she showed little interest in “name” designers and wore the same gown to the 1977 inaugural ball that she had worn in Georgia when her husband became governor.
When Jimmy appointed members of the President’s Commission on Mental Health in early 1977, he could not legally name Rosalynn as chair because of nepotism rules. However, she served as honorary chair and took an active role in the commission’s work, which resulted in the submission of the Mental Health Systems Bill to Congress in May 1979. During debate on the bill, which passed in 1980, she testified before a Senate subcommittee, the first presidential wife to make such an appearance since Eleanor Roosevelt in 1945.
Rosalynn worked hard to reelect her husband in 1980 and bitterly resented his loss to Ronald Reagan. After leaving the White House at age 53, she directed her considerable energy to the same causes that had long interested her. She continued her efforts to improve mental health care and to promote other projects that, as she said, would result in “good for others.” Among these projects was Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that helped people to build their own homes. She also wrote several books, including First Lady from Plains (1984), which was widely praised as giving more insight into her husband’s administration than most of the books by his top advisers.
Jimmy Carter sometimes pointed out that his wife’s first name was Eleanor and that she had been as valuable a working partner to him as had Eleanor Roosevelt to her husband. Most Americans would agree, and Rosalynn’s popularity was consistently high compared with that of other first ladies.Hi fellow Vera fans.

What we put into our airguns — and what it puts into their barrels
Everybody knows we shoot lead. So-called “ballistic alloys” are a poor substitute for it, so let’s all pretend that we shoot lead.
Lead is a soft, malleable metal — so malleable that a pellet’s skirt blows out when hit by compressed air and presses into rifling. It’s also so soft that during the Middle Ages it was used for pencils, as it leaves dark lines on paper or parchment or human hair! Yes, people made lead combs to dye their beards and hair while combing them — they didn’t live that long back then, anyway. Remember that, though, and wash your hands thoroughly, especially when you’re covered with a lead and oil cocktail, because it’s readily absorbed.Boeing 777 Crash: 2 Dead, 182 Hurt, Cable News Breaks In
Cable news networks broke away from coverage of the George Zimmerman trial and Egypt upheaval to cover a Boeing 777 that crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday, killing at least two people and injuring dozens more.
Airport spokesman Doug Yakel said 182 people were taken to local hospitals. There were a total of 307 people on board the plane -- 291 passengers and 16 crew members. All who were on board have been accounted for, said San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White. She said the two people who died were found outside of the heavily damaged jetliner.
At least 49 of the injured people were in critical condition, with the remaining 133 having minor to moderate injuries, said officials. The two passengers who died were Chinese citizens, according to South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.
CNN, MSNBC and Fox News carried footage from Bay Area station KTVU showing the smoking wreckage of the plane and amateur video on YouTube that appeared to be shot from a terminal (see below). Images broadcast show emergency crews surrounding the plane after its landing. On broadcast television, ABC News broke into its Wimbledon coverage for a special report by David Muir.
STORY: SF Plane Crash: Social Media Is Key First Responder
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown says the plane was coming from South Korea and was supposed to land on Runway 28 Left at San Francisco International Airport. The FAA said Flight 214 crashed while landing at 11:36 a.m. "Our thoughts and prayers are with all the passengers, and flight crew on the flight. We hope to provide you with further info asap," read a statement by Asiana Airlines posted on Twitter.
The news spread quickly on social media before it reached cable networks. MSNBC and CNN showed an image of a tweet from David Eun, a Samsung executive -- formerly a content exec at Google and AOL -- who was on board the plane. "Fire and rescue people all over the place. They're evacuating the injured. Haven't felt this way since 9/11," Eun tweeted.
I just crash landed at SFO. Tail ripped off. Most everyone seems fine. I'm ok. Surreal... (at @flySFO) [pic] —— David Eun (@Eunner) July 6, 2013
Immediately after the news broke of the crash, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote a note on Facebook explaining that she had been scheduled to take the Asiana Airlines flight, but opted for a United flight instead. That flight "was scheduled to come in at the same time, but we were early and landed about 20 minutes before the crash," she wrote, adding: "Serious moment to give thanks."
STORY: SF Plane Crash Prompts Networks to Preempt Shows for Continued Coverage
On cable, Dana Bash and Richard Quest were on the line for CNN reporting on the crash. MSNBC's Lester Holt gave a special report. Fox News' Janice Dean reported on the weather conditions in San Francisco at the time of the crash. FNC also had aviation expert Capt. Chuck Nash on by phone to explain the potential logistics of the crash and Claudia Cowan on the ground in SF.
CNN also posted an image of smoke pouring from the airplane that was initially tweeted by the daughter of a passenger on the flight:
@cnnbrk @cnn more photos my dad has sent from 777 crash pic.twitter.com/F0ekLTKwPv— Bird (@EuniceBirdRah) July 6, 2013
On Saturday evening, several networks preempted regularly scheduled programming to continue the coverage. MSNBC pushed the season premiere of Lockup back one week, and had Craig Melvin anchoring. CNN had Presumed Guilty: Murder in West Memphis set for 10 p.m. ET, but continued coverage with Don Lemon. Fox News Channel preempted The Last Days of John Lennon for continued coverage anchored by Greta Van Susteren.
Below, the amateur footage of the crash that was aired on the networks:

Actually that is not true. What you are stating is out of ignorance of what the Pope. You are positing the assumption that A. You know what the Pope Thinks B. Since you know what the Pope Thinks ______________________________________ C. You know what the Pope Believes That is false logic and there is no evidence of proof in it. What you do not realize is that there is Evidence in Religion and it is Logical. > > IOW, science == science whether you believe it or not. I know for a Fact that Science Evolved out of Religion. You may assume that Logic came from Science but it came from Religion. The separation between Logic and Belief came merely at a Time when Sorcerors were losing their Heads for working with the Invisible Forces - Alchemy, Magnetism, Star Gazing... etc... Even Guass who invented the Sum of Squares and used it to predict the sighting of a Planet knew that he was a Heretict and would not publish his own Formulas. Prior to the Renaissance Period, Freely thinking about the Forces of Nature was no longer Dictated by the Church. However, the Church had always contained the Logic of the Ancient Civilizations and was afraid to release it else it would lose Political Power. The discovery of the Ancient Language systems of previous civilization demonstrates that the knowledge was always evolving. Atomic Theory began in 500 B.C. Now, the Scientists are the Ones who Hold the Knowledge as if it were Their Secret; they have created an Elitist Band of Priests who Act like they Are Mightier via their Words, use of Language, when in fact All Language is Logical. Language itself is Logic and there would no Sensible Communication if it was not. So, Logic is inherant to the Nature of Communication. Just as the Bees communicate their patterns of flight to the flower, so do we communicate. If Scientists are so Egotistical to Believe that Science somehow proves anything and that prior to Science as a Academic Discipline everyone else was living in a Day Dream, then it is those Scientists who are living in a Day Dream, or Self-delusion that Science is somehow separate from Human Thinking and Experiencing of the World. The idea that one can prove that Religion is not tested by experience is a false assumption. How can you know that there is no Truth or Reality in the Religous Experience if you have not Tested it? A Real Scientist would set a Laboratory Experiment that would test Precepts of Religion. The Ideal of Science is to isolate the phenomena from the nuemenon. However, there is no phenomena without nuemena. That is the meaning of the Tao. Yang is the Phenomena and Yin is the Nuemnena. According the Ancient Taoists, phenomena continually changes its properties. Thus Yang is constantly becoming Yin and Yin becomes Yang. The rules of the Yin/Yang are that there is no Stable Yin or Yang but an ever transformation process of movement. This actually is not all that different than the Scientific properties of Quatum Physics. And, hum... the Modern Quantum Physicists borrow their ideas from the knowledge that is more than 4,000 years old. Rene Descartes, one of the Fathers of Sciences, was a Jesuit Jew. And, he worked on combing Hebrew Religious Ideals with Ancient Greek Philosophies (the roots of Christianity). It is in his Belief that Science would Prove the Existence of God. Descartes, was explaining the the Role of the Scientist was to discover the operative forces of God's Creation. Thus, Science was originated to become closer or to commune with the Creator not to Replace the Creator. The Catholic Church lator sanctified Science when it realized that it could no longer suppress it. The mythical story of Lucifer is that of an Angel of God, who fell from being withing the Domain of the Creator to desiring to be the Creator. Einstein left many writings about his fear of discovering the Wormholes in the Cosmos. He realized that once Science had explored the Forces that underlie the Universe, we might in our Knowledge Destroy It. Who would have the wisdom of wielding the Power of the Atoms? If you could easily push a button on your Computer Keyboard in order to Blow Me up in your haste to give the Evidence that there is Atomic Energy, would you do it? Does your desire to Prove that you are Right and that I am Wrong override my Faith? I doubt it. Even if you were sitting at a Nuclear Facility, I have Faith that No One around you would allow you to Push that Button that would Kill everyone around me. I could be dead wrong. But until I am proven wrong, I have Faith that I am protected by a Cosmic Universe where Beings actually care at least about such things and there is some moral code of logic that tells us that Killing a person for an Opinion is somehow not quite nice. Why? I cannot prove that people care about anything or anyone. But they do. There are things we cannot prove and that is where Logic fails us. > > Religious beliefs are easier imparted and held through ignorance, not > education. Actually, Faith come via proof. Faith is the most difficult mind set to come to because it requires acceptance and release of the anxiety of knowing that one cannot know-it-all. > > The nonsense of trying to call science "just another religion" is bunko When one does not know what one is talking about, the last resort it Flame/Name calling.

The Asia Pacific Screen Awards (APSA) and FIAPF-International Federation of Film Producers Associations announced today that internationally renowned Japanese composer, actor and musician Ryuichi Sakamoto will be the 2012 recipient of the FIAPF award for Outstanding Achievement in Film in the Asia Pacific region.
An Oscar®, Grammy® and two time Golden Globe® winner for his film compositions, Ryuichi Sakamoto will personally accept the award at the sixth annual APSA ceremony on November 23 in Brisbane, Australia.
In what will be an undeniable highlight, APSA is honoured to confirm virtuoso pianist Ryuichi Sakamoto will perform two pieces during the ceremony. This Australian exclusive performance will mark the first time in six years that Ryuichi Sakamoto has performed in the country.
Within the world of film Sakamoto’s vast body of work is incredibly diverse, with his dozens of film scores covering fiction, documentary and animated feature films. Attesting to the unparalleled quality and universal appeal of his work, Sakamoto’s outstanding musical compositions have played a key role in films by filmmakers from both across the Asia Pacific region and far beyond, as well as films set around the world and in a multitude of languages including Arabic, Japanese, English, French and Spanish.
FIAPF President, Luis Alberto Scalella says, “As the international body of film producers’ associations, FIAPF is proud to celebrate the diverse and prolific body of work of artist Ryuichi Sakamoto. Over the past APSA editions, FIAPF Awards often celebrated personalities from the film community with an active role as producer. By giving this year’s FIAPF Award to Ryuichi Sakamoto, we wish to put emphasis on the great contribution of creative talents to films. As an actor, composer and a musician who does not limit himself to any one genre or style, Ryuichi Sakamoto has contributed immeasurably to film, and but also to art. As an artist who has never forgotten his roots, we are very pleased to honour Ryuichi Sakamoto with this prestigious award from his own region, Asia Pacific. As an artist who is ever evolving and constantly creating, we bestow this award to Mr Sakamoto to focus on and honour his outstanding achievement in film, while greatly anticipating what Ryuichi Sakamoto has next for the world.”
Listeners young and old from all cultures and creeds have found inspiration in Sakamoto’s music, from his pioneering early electronic music as a member of Yellow Magic Orchestra, to globally-inspired rock albums, classical compositions (including the opera Life, which featured contributions by over 100 performers), over thirty ﬁlm scores, more than forty solo albums, video game soundtracks and even mobile ringtones.
Equally expansive is his array of prestigious awards: an Academy Award® for Best Original Score for Bertolucci’s The Last Emperor (1987), two Golden Globes® for The Last Emperor and The Sheltering Sky (1990), a Grammy®, the Order of the Cavaleiro Admissão from the government of Brazil and, from the French government, Ofﬁcier of the Order of Arts and Letters.
Sakamoto’s most recent film scores were for APSA competition features Women Without Men (2009) from Iranian-American writer directors Shirin Neshat and Shoja Azari, and accomplished Japanese filmmaker Takashi Miike’s Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai (2011). One of his earliest film scores was for Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence (1983), in which he starred alongside Takeshi Kitano, David Bowie and Tom Conti and also won the 1984 BAFTA for Best Score. Since then, he has composed film scores for more than twenty films including The Handmaid’s Tale (1990) which screened in competition at the 1990 Berlinale, Pedro Almodovar’s High Heels (1991) which won the Best Film at the Cartagena International Film Festival (Colombia), Wuthering Heights (1992) starring Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes, Little Buddha (1993) which earned him yet another Grammy® nomination, Wild Side (1995), starring Joan Chen and Christopher Walken, Taboo (1999) which starred Takeshi Kitano and screened in competition at the Cannes Film Festival 2000, Brian De Palma’s Femme Fatale (2002) screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival 2002, documentary Derrida (2002) about the father of deconstructionist philosophy, Tony Takitani (2004) based on the short story by Haruki Murakami, and pioneering Japanese CG animation Appleseed (2004).
In addition to his dedicated film scores, Sakamoto’s compositions have been used in many films, notably Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu’s widely acclaimed international feature Babel (2006), and Caterpillar (2010), for which actress Shinobu Terajima won the APSA Jury Grand Prize in 2010.
Sakamoto has devoted much time in recent years to environmental and humanitarian projects, using the creativity of artists to change the world for the better. He has collaborated with leading electronic artists and undertaken a European tour with his piano, violin and cello trio in 2011/2012.
As the recipient of the FIAPF Award, Mr Sakamoto will be inducted into the Asia Pacific Screen Academy, joining fellow Japanese filmmakers who, since 2007, have collectively received nominations in every APSA award category, including APSA award winners Noritaka Kawaguchi, Masahiro Motoki, Isao Matsuoka, and Shinobu Terajima.
Ryuichi Sakamoto is the sixth person to be honoured by FIAPF through their partnership with the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. Previous recipients are George Miller (2007), Yash Chopra (2008), Isao Matsuoka (2009), Christine Hakim (2010) and Zhang Yimou (2011).
As a performer at the APSA ceremony, Sakamoto follows in the footsteps of special guest performers including Japan’s number one Japanese R&B star Ai, whose performance included music from the film Departures (Okuribito), Tenzin Choegyal, Katherine Philp, internationally renowned Erhu virtuoso Ma Xiaohui and William Barton, Australia’s leading didjeridu player and composer.
The International Federation of Film Producers’ Associations is the only organisation of film and television producers with a global reach. FIAPF’s mandate is to represent the common economic, legal and regulatory interests of film and audiovisual producers. FIAPF members cover 30 producers’ organisations from 27 countries and five continents.
A total of 34 films from 18 countries and areas across Asia Pacific have been nominated in the 2012 Asia Pacific Screen Awards. The International Jury, headed by Australia’s Jan Chapman, will assemble in Brisbane, Australia in mid November ahead of the APSA Ceremony on November 23.

Applies To: Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista
Software-only device drivers do not expose a device ID, and there is no standard method for installing these devices. Some manufacturers install the device by using the InstallShield installation program or a similar method. Note that software installed by other methods might not be completely removed when the device is removed in Device Manager, and therefore you might have to check the registry to verify that all entries are removed.
Use any of the following methods to determine whether an unknown device was created by software:
- Start your computer in Safe Mode. Although not 100-percent reliable, starting your computer in Safe Mode can be one of the easiest ways to determine whether the unknown device is created by software.
To start your computer in Safe Mode, press F8 after you restart your computer and before you see the Windows logo. On the Windows Advanced Option Menu, press the ARROW keys to select Safe Mode, and then press ENTER. If the unknown device is no longer listed in Device Manager, it is likely that the unknown device is not hardware.
- Check the Startup folders. If you suspect that a specific program is the cause of the unknown device, check the Startup folders on your computer to see which programs are configured to start when your computer starts.
Your personal Startup folder is in the following location on your hard disk:
%appdata%\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
The All Users Startup folder can be found at:
%allusersprofile%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
- Use the System Information tool. The System Information tool can be useful when you need to identify the cause of an unknown device.
To use the System Information tool to view a list of programs that start when your computer starts, follow the steps in the procedure Use MSInfo32 to view the list of startup programs.
To use the System Information tool to view a list of problem devices, follow the steps in the procedure Use the System Information tool to view a list of problem devices.
- View the Setupapi.log file. If the device has a meaningful name, use the information in the Setupapi.log file to identify the cause of an unknown device. By default, the Setupapi.log file is located in the %systemroot% folder.
Sometimes the list designation can be misleading. For example, a device might be listed as a serial device in Device Manager, when in reality it is not related to a serial port. This typically occurs when a partial Plug and Play ID is available, and Device Manager interprets it as a serial device. This can also be corrected by locating the startup program.
Removing an unknown device in Device Manager does not resolve the error if a software program is the cause of the unknown device. You must remove the program, and then restart your computer. If the unknown device is still listed in Device Manager after you restart your computer in Safe Mode, refer to your hardware manufacturer documentation for help in removing the device.
Click Start, and then in the Start Search box, type msinfo32, and press ENTER.
In the navigation pane, expand Software Environment, and then double-click Startup Programs.
A list of the programs that are configured to start when your computer starts is displayed.
Check the event log for errors that refer to any of these programs. Note that when a program creates an unknown device, the program can work unless it depends on that device to start.
Click Start, and then in the Start Search box, type msinfo32, and press ENTER.
In the navigation pane, expand Components, and then double-click Problem devices.
A list of the devices installed on your computer that might have a problem is displayed in the right pane, as follows:
- The Device column lists the common name for the device, or the name of the device driver associated with it.
- The PnP Device ID column lists device IDs, such as a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) ID, an error codes might be listed under Problem Devices, depending on the device type:

Development History
Comprised of former Blue Tongue Entertainment employees, Paul Baker wanted to use his experience as a lead programmer in a AAA studio to create something of his own. Chris Burns approached him and they started working together, with Drew Morrow joining the fold as the studio really took flight.
Paul and Chris share a mutual love for cars and motorcycles, and they wanted to explore that with Stunt Star: The Hollywood Years. What started out as a simple idea of a 2D car going over a jump has quickly turned into a full garage of vehicles, along with a full set of customisation options that mirror their passion.
The team believes in delivering raw gameplay rather than narrative-driven experiences. By offering a large amount of player customisation, each player can enjoy a unique gameplay experience. While the team is looking to branch out with something new for their next release, they feel that player customisation is something that will always be important to them.

A Way of Life
I was not prepared for what I seen in this film. I went into this with the impression that it was going to be some movie about struggling teenagers who turn out alright in the end. I thought that I would leave the cinema saying, 'well that was nothing special.' I was completely wrong. It was one of the best films I've seen all year. Directed by first timer Amma Asante, it is the harsh truth of the state of lower class citizens, one of the most important messages ever sent out of a film. You will leave more determined to be a better parent in the future.
The film draws you in straight away as it begins with a gang of teenagers physically assaulting a middle aged man in the middle of the street. The ferociousness of the beating their giving out made me sit up straight away and take notice. The film then travels back to the events leading up to this attack.
At the beginning we are introduced to Leigh-Anne (Stephanie James). Leigh-Anne is a frustrated, angry teenage mother living in a council flat with no electricity. Her mother killed herself when Leigh was just a child and she also, along with her brother, suffered constant abuse form her father. So with only her brother and his two friends to support her, and with very little income coming in, times are hard for Leigh. Her only reason for living is her daughter Rebecca, and she will do anything, literally, to protect her. Her Grandmother Annette (Brenda Blethyn) feels that she would be more suited to look after Rebecca, which leads to several run ins between the two. Annette isn't the only person she has trouble with, due to her jealousy and racist standpoint, Leigh is involved in constant confrontations with Turk Hassan Osman (Oliver Haden). Another reason for this hatred towards Osman is Leigh is jealous of the relationship he has with his daughter Julie (Sara Gregory).
In one scene we see an example of the lengths Rebecca will go to help her daughter- no matter how brutal. She acts as a pimp to gain £30 off a man who comes looking for sexual service. Rather than have sex with the man herself, she convinces a girl younger than herself, to seal the deal. "Just open your legs and let him do the rest'. It is one of the most startling and shocking scenes of the film.
Leigh's brother Gavin (Nathan Jones), and his two friends Robbie (Gary Sheppeard) and Stephen (Dean Wong), are always there for Leigh. But that usually involves crime and anti-social behaviour. The four of them as a group run riot and it's when they are together we see that despite being a committed mother, Leigh is far from an innocent little girl.
Leigh is regularly visited by a social worker (Marged Esli), and after seeing her chatting to hated neighbour Hassan, she is convinced that Osman is plotting to get her baby taken away from her. One of the most significant parts of the film is when baby Julie is burned by a candle at home. This leads to a string of events that leads to the tragedy that we caught a glimpse of at the start. The aftermath of this is even more tragic.
This is a film that will leave you thinking of the youth out there today and have you deciding whether or not you sympathies with Leigh Anne. I didn't.
All the cast in this film played their roles very well but for me Stephanie James, in the role of Leigh-Anne, stood out for me. Not because she was the lead character but due to the fact that for someone making her on-screen debut and performing so well, I feel that that takes a lot and I'm pretty sure this will not be the last we see of her.
Overall I feel that this is a must see film for all ages of 15 and up, I felt that it should have had an 18 certificate, if not for its stance as a very good movie, but for it's importance.CIEAM Latest

The results of these studies were presented today in a late-breaking clinical trials session at the Cardiovascular Research Foundation's 19th annual Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) scientific symposium by William Gray, M.D., FACC, of Columbia University Medical Center in New York.
Patients treated with carotid stents in Abbott's CAPTURE 2 (Carotid ACCULINK/ACCUNET Post Approval Trial to Uncover Rare Events) and EXACT(TM) (Emboshield and Xact Post Approval Carotid Stent Trial) post-marketing trials, which enrolled 4,111 patients, demonstrated 30 day patient outcome results that are comparable to the AHA outcome guidelines for patients less than 80 years old who undergo carotid surgery (carotid endarterectomy). These guidelines recommend stroke and death rates that are within 3% for patients without symptoms of stroke (asymptomatic) and 6% for patients with symptoms of stroke (symptomatic).
"With these two very large, well-conducted, real-world carotid artery stenting trials, not only has carotid stenting achieved a comparable outcome to guidelines established for patients who undergo carotid surgery, but it also did so in a population of patients who are at high risk for experiencing adverse events from surgery," said Dr. Gray. "This is significant because this is the first time physicians have achieved results in high surgical risk candidates that are comparable to the long-standing guidelines that were established for lower surgical risk candidates, demonstrating that stenting can provide a reliable non-surgical alternative for patients facing the difficult decision of how to manage their carotid artery disease."

Like us on Facebook
Back before Angelina Jolie was one half of a power couple with Brad Pitt, she was starring in the video game-based Lara Croft: Tomb Raider film franchise. I'm always down for a female lead to kick some arse, but to be honest, I never really got around to watching these movies.
Now rumors are swirling that Warner Bros. would like to relaunch the franchise — complete with casting a new female lead.
What do you think about the Lara Croft character? Were you into the movies with Angelina Jolie? Are you interested in a reboot of the female-driven action franchise? Or not so much?
They should definetly make another Tomb Raider film! I dont know why they havnt already, the films all did very well. Keep Angelina Jolie because she kicks ass and she pulls of the comedy side too, she IS Lara Croft,I even think they kinda model the game character after her these days... Kinda. Anyway the film fans cant imagine anybody else playing the role and I thought her accent was good! Besides Megan Fox comes across as really bland to me . But if they did make another film with another actress then I still would see it, but it just wouldnt be the same, I'd still be thinking about Angelina jolie's character. ANGELINA JOLIE FOR ONE MORE TOMB RAIDER FILM
I think if you have to have a new lead, ( AJ is fantastic by the way). Then you should cast a complete unknown to emerse in to the role, plus they should be a true Bit, Like myself and maybie go back to how she got into the whole tomb raider job as she grew up with out her father, her training and adventure would then be in sync with the Aj films. Keeping the flow and everyone loves the whole begining of things. Take batman begins, the new wolverine film, underworld etc.
I thought Angelina was perfect for that role and I can't imagine anyone else playing that part. I don't think they should make any more Lara Croft movies, period. There weren't THAT good...it's just one of the movies that I watch when it comes on TV.
I think they should change Anjelina Joile as Lara Croft and cast somebody new.If you never played the video games you won't notice the differences between the two character.As a gamer it was quite painful to see her play the role.Lara Croft is more feminine in the games and what Anjelina played is just a masculine version of the original form!!!!!!!!!!And most of all-her british accent was not near good enough.The perfect choice would be ( still) Rhona Mitra.
i have no desire what so ever to see another lara croft movie. she's not interesting at all to me, and i would rather sleep than see a sequel.
Never liked the movies
Never liked the movies
No, I don't want another Tomb Raider and I really don't want one without Angelina Jolie! No more Megan Fox, she is so over. She can't really even act, please...she's no Angelina.
I'm not an Angelina fan--far from it--but I hate movies that recast already established characters. That's the worst.
Nope, not without Angie.
Nope, not without Angie.
I'm not a big Tomb Raider fan as is, but I really couldn't see anyone but Angie playing Lara. I agree gab... Megan Fox is irritating.
I'm not a big Tomb Raider fan as is, but I really couldn't see anyone but Angie playing Lara.I agree gab... Megan Fox is irritating.
I really liked these movies but without Angie I don't really think I'd watch...besides Megan Fox is irritating.
I don't see the point of making more Lara Croft movies, with or without Angelina. The movies were awful. That being said, if people saw them was because Angelina was on them (even if her acting was terrible too), so it makes even less sense to continue without her.
I think they should keep Jolie (who is probably passing on it since she doesn't have the time or energy to do the role right now) or scrap it.. Even worse they are completely revamping the character.. no longer English.. no longer "Lady Croft".. they want to Americanize it which means trashier..more violent.. so Megan would be a physical match for the role... I hate when they try to completely change something that has already made a HUGE amount of money worldwide and is very distinct.. someone is just greedy... that is CRAP!
I never watched the Lara Croft films, I'm more interested in them putting out a new game instead(I would buy that :)).
Not really.
Not really.
I think it honestly depends on who the select to cast as Lara. If not Angie, I think Kate Bekinsale has had a solid run with the Underworld series, so I think she could be a feasible recasting of Lady Croft. Though she isn't a spitting image of Angelina, I think she could effectively play the part.
I think only Angelina should do lara Croft. And as for it coming to light again, then I say NO WAY. Leave that movie alone and come up with new movies/Television for us to watch. This is why I can't stand television now. It's nothing new or quality to watch.
I loved the movies & I love Angelina Jolie, so I can't really see anyone else playing the role..
I found the movies to be really fun, but I'm not sure about another actress playing the part. I'd have to see the trailer to really know if I'd see it.
NO, not without Angelina. I would refuse to see this if Angelina didn't play Lara Coft. Angelina made that effing franchise a hit (in terms of the films I mean) and she outta be the one playing the character until I hear her give her blessing to another actress.
They weren't very good movies, but they were pretty entertaining. It'd be weird to see someone besides Angelina as Lara Croft, though. She was so perfect for that role it's like she was genetically engineered to do it.Jessica Simpson wants the world to see how adorable her family has become. The celebrity offered a series of pictures posted on Saturday and all of the cut poses are of her 20-month-old daughter, Maxwell, and six-month-old son, Ace. According to the Huffington Post on Friday, Simpson’s daughter is starting to look a lot like her mom and fans are excited to see the family traits.
“Ace is the place that I become the annoying kissing mom. All I want to do is snuggle this lil emotional perfect soul! He is a dream!” wrote Jessica Simpson on Instagram. In one picture the famous mom is hugging her little boy and she seems to have a moment of complete gratitude.
Jessica Simpson hasn’t said too much about her kids before, but it appears that she is opening up. With a new Instagram account and posting on Twitter more frequently the star seems to have a desire to share the photos with the fans and give people a look at her kids.
While the family time is great to see, fans can also catch Jessica Simpson on television. A new wave of Weight Watcher commercials have hit the fans in hopes to help those folks looking to lose weight in 2014 find some motivation. Showing off her slimmer figure, Simpson might not have her kids in the shot, but she definitely looks good there too!Pedaling coast-to-coast for a purpose
Keith Harris is pedaling for a purpose.
At the tender age of 50, he's set out on an eight-week, 4,400-mile bike ride across the U.S. to raise $25,000 for The Rotary Foundation. He's also hoping to raise an additional $2,500 for Anna Jaques Hospital in Newburyport, Massachusetts, where a few years ago he was treated for a life-threatening heart condition.
"The trip is sort of my midlife crisis," he admits but it's not the first time he's pedaled across the country. He made the trek about 20 years ago, before he married his wife, Christina.
Harris has been a Rotary member for 18 years. He's served as president for the Rotary Club of Ipswich, Massachusetts, and as a district Rotary Foundation chair for seven years. He says Rotary has become "a way of life" for him and for Christina, who's also a member.
"Rotary is indeed a body of many parts," says Harris. "It allows us to reach out through the headlines and interact with the people we otherwise would only hear or read about."
He'll have plenty of interactions during the trip this summer. He says he's planning to occasionally stay with other Rotary members along the way, as well as tap into the hospitality of the WarmShowers.org community for cyclists. His trip began 9 June in Seattle where he dipped his rear wheel into the Pacific, and he hopes to finish in Newburyport on 9 August by dipping his front tire into the Atlantic.
"Hopefully I will meet new people and by doing something unusual, have new opportunities to encourage them to do what I believe they already want to do deep down," he says. "They just need to think about it a bit differently."
Harris is riding a Co-Motion Cascadia, the same bike he rode on his first cross-country outing. He's raised $22,850 toward his goals.

Summary:
Absolutely thrilling bike... buy one!!!
Faults:
Fork seals at 9500.
General Comments:
Very heavy, but you soon get used to it, the weight is low down so cornering is a real pleasure, there are lots of comments on the web about the front suspension being too soft.. for what?.. It's perfect and gives a truly luxurious ride.
It's a bit reluctant to tick over before it's properly warmed up-about 5 miles, but only in freezing temperatures - otherwise it fires up 1st time.. no choke.. and is happy after a minute or so.
It turns heads wherever it goes because the noise is absolutely gorgeous.. even other bikers on their glitzy £6000 bikes just stand and stare.. it's got a unique presence.. 20 years old and still very much a contender.
Easy to clean too, unlike newer bikes, just keep on top of the chrome because, even though it's excellent quality, it doesn't like the winter salt at all.
I love it... just love it!!!

ORANGE, CA -- 16 JUNE, 2004 -- This August, SWORD OF DRACULA writer Jason Henderson teams up with partner Greg Scott (Gotham Central, Strange Magic) to create SYLVIA FAUST, another of the pair's trademark lead females-this time a refugee magic user who falls for the young proprietor of the most unique bar/movie theater in the world. The new series is Henderson and Scott's second series for Image Comics, and their first in full color. Henderson is also involved in the development of the video game and movie versions of SWORD OF DRACULA.
Henderson will launch SYLVIA FAUST by hosting a screening of "Wizard People, Dear Readers," Brad Neely's "Harry Potter riff parody" at the world-famous Alamo Drafthouse in downtown Austin, Texas at 11:59 pm, Saturday night, July 24. The screening is part of a three-day engagement to benefit Cinematexas, the non-profit organization that promotes independent film through its annual Cinematexas International Film Festival.
"Sylvia Faust is a four-issue romantic comedy – a New York story with magic - about Sylvia and Tim Klass, two people from totally different worlds," Henderson explains. "Sylvia is an early-twenties princess from another dimension who's basically a refugee here because she doesn't want to marry the son of an evil Duke back home. She has a cockeyed vocabulary and emotions so strong her sadness makes frogs rain from the sky.
"Her romantic foil (and new boss) Tim runs the Apocalypse Drafthouse, a slightly run-down Greenwich Village movie theater famous for its beer, pizza and all-night marathons where fading celebrities drink and carouse with movie geeks."
"Sylvia Faust is all about the romance, the characters, and the comedy. Greg's art style for Sylvia Faust is very different from what people have seen in the past - it's much more open and clean, with none of the heavy blacks he uses for Dracula or Strange Magic.
"Also, Sylvia Faust is a co-creation of mine and Greg, so we're both into the story. There's no boss, except for the collaboration."
Coloring the book is Leslie Barkley, who also colors Soulcatcher for Henderson at Moonstone.
"All of the action in the story centers around the Apocalypse Drafthouse-a place inspired by the real-life Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas, where they do things like show Mexican horror films with live dubbing, and triple-features with guest stars," says Henderson. "Quentin Tarantino does a semi-regular festival at the Alamo where he shows two weeks of whatever he wants, and it's all so unpretentious and cool. Harry Knowles' 24-hour 'Butt-Numb-A-Thon' also happens at the Alamo. And so I watched the cast of characters who move through the Alamo, the stars and the once-stars, the broke students waiting tables and taking tickets, the harried and crazed manager, and realized, this is a place for a really wonderful romance. So that's what we made."
Henderson and Scott previously launched SWORD OF DRACULA at an event called Dracula Night at the Alamo.
In "Wizard People, Dear Readers," artist Brad Neely performs a running monologue over the entirety of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER's STONE, including voices and sound effects. The result, as chronicled by the New York Times, has been an underground hit.
The Alamo Drafthouse Cinema is Austin's only independently owned and operated movie theater. Their website and calendar can be found at.
Cinematexas is a non-profit arts organization that strives to provide a hospitable, diverse and ever-expanding space for landmark films. The Cinematexas International Film Festival website is at.
SYLVIA FAUST #1 is available for order in the June issue of Previews and will go on sale August.Member since: May 2009

Questions & Answers
The price not my first choice but the price is reasonable.
What are the approximate measurements of the diamonds?
There are five half-carat diamonds, but we do not have the dimensions of the diamonds, unfortunately.<<by_0<<
I was able to find a 1.1 acre piece of land bordered by a brook that already had a well and septic installed. The land was $36,000
We encountered some unexpected problems that were not mentioned in Jay Shafer’s book or at his seminar. For instance, we needed a pressure tank for the water from the well and since there was not room in the house a shed had to be built and insulated so the water would not freeze which cost an additional $1,000. Then we needed to hooking up the house to a septic system. The State of Vermont does not have any building requirements, but does require septic, even for graywater. Grading the land and attaching septic was an additional $4,000.
Overall, it was a good learning experience. Now that I am living in the house those past problems seem minor.
I love seeing “lived in” pictures of tiny houses. It’s much more, well, real than a lot of the pictures you see around the interwebs.
beautiful house! Love your land and location also. Enjoy!
Beautiful house in a great setting, I envy you! It’s a bit disconcerting to hear the cost was so high since I’m still costing out my hopeful project. Would you mind separating out the labour and material costs?
Labor cost was about $10,000.
Really nice to see one of these with well and septic.
So you are saying that it is legal in Vermont to buy land and live in an RV (which I believe is technically what a tiny house on wheels is classified as), as long as you have a septic system?
I too am interested in the no building requirements part. Does that mean what I think it does, that there is no minimum square foot requirements?
Some towns in Vermont have minimum size requirements for buildings but the State
only requires a septic system. Do as you want with the electric and other rgings but make sure you have a working septic.
Last time I checked Vermont only requires a full septic system if water is piped INSIDE your dwelling.
If you only have a spigot outside and use part of it inside (caught in a bucket) and part outside, you are going to use so little water that there is very little possibility of contaminating anything.
This assumes a properly built, or an approved, compost toilet system
An RV park for 1 RV.
Do the Vermont regs allow for more than one on a lot that size? Could you start a tiny house pocket community?
No reason not to as long as you increase the size of the septic as more people are added.
The project looks great, land, building, septic and water.
This is a great story. So refreshing to see someone do the entire package. Most people who do this live in a host’s backyard with a cord & hose.
Great job !!!!!!!!
Nice! I like the use of cedar lap siding in the shower.

Pingback: New Tiny House in Winhall, Vermont | Tiny House Living
Is that a cedar sided shower? What did you do to make sure that area is properly waterproofed? I would think that the siding would be to porous even if it was well caulked.
Cedar sding in the shower works well. The cedar is painted with Vermont Coatings sealant. A natural product that uses cheese byproducts.
Hi Bob,
We’re thinking about doing a cedar shower in our tiny house, too. Do you have some kind of waterproof barrier under the cedar? We would love to hear any other thoughts on your experience installing / maintaining it. I think yours is the only tiny house I’ve seen with such a thing.
Thanks,
Tiny
Great job! I’m also building a tiny house in Northern VT and would love to chat about the building requirements you researched. If you would be willing to talk, please get in touch! My email is ethan [AT] thetinyhouse.net
Ethan, The tiny house is based on the Epu model from Tumbleweed tiny houses. As the house is built on a slab and I wanted to preserve the possibility of moving the p-trap for greywater had to be on the outside of the building. So the trap is insulated inside a boxthat also includes
a heat lamp that can be turned on during sub freezing temperature.
Awesome work! I am always working on the planners in the county I live. If your house is ‘signed off’ by your planners, I’d love to tell that to mine! All we need are a few good examples like yours.
So, thanks!
The Winhall, Vermont zoning administrator did not have a problem with this tiny house. He said that he would not want to line in a house that small but thought it was a great idea.
Jamaica town has no zoning regs! The feds stick their noses in, especially since TS Irene devasted so much of Jamaica Village and other villages within Jamaica Town. Yes, the state says any residence must have septic. Camps do not yet, UNTIL you say it is your full time residence!! That is IF the ( army co. of engineers) Feds let you live in your own camp!
Does the $32,000 include the $5000 for the shed and septic tank?
He said those were additional costs, so I took that to mean in addition to the $32k. Perhaps I misunderstood.
I’m thinking a lot of it was the cost of hiring the carpenter. It’s expensive for a build.
The shed houses the water pressure tank. Cost of $1,000 total
What about the neighbors? Did you consult their input on moving a tiny house into the neighborhood?
What would the neighbors have to do with it ?
The land is zoned for a application and the owner met that and the requirements for septic.
We have a saying on owned land…
My Property, Heaven High and Hell Deep.
I had a tiny house celebration and house warming and all the neighbors attended. They have been supportive.
Awesome tiny home!!! And finally someone besides a builder trying to sell lets everyone know its NOT as cheap as you think to build a tiny home the right way!
Very nice- just curious as to why on a trailer?- in VT you could have saved quite a bit by simply building a cabin on piers, or blocks, even one as tiny as this. Do you plan on moving it, or is it here to stay? Either way, great job!
If I had to do it again I would probably not use a trailer. Separating from electric and propane is simple, separating from the septic will require cutting pipes. So being mobile is not as easy as I thought it would be.
Was curious myself!
Great, little build. Yes, having a contractor do most of the work adds up. I think it’s rare to find an owner who can do all of the work themselves.
Love it! Love the big ol’ can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli best of all! Oh…wait…the Simplify sign was even better.
Blessings….
I love it!! I’m curious about the thermal behaviour of these tiny wooden houses. Anyone could share their experience?
This tiny house is insulated with 5″ of blue board insulation. It retains heat well. So far the outside temperature has only been down to fifteen degrees. It remains to be seen how it handles colder temperatures.
I gotta admit that I don’t really see the point. Apparently you want it to be mobile, so why not get a prefab trailer or RV, retrofit it the way you like, and save $20,000? That is a pretty steep price-tag for such a tiny shack.
RV’s usually don’t hold up well as fulltime residences. Moisture problems, appliances designed for occasional use, leaky roof/windows, etc.
I live in the Pacific NorthWET, and RV’s take it hard here.
I’ll admit, there are exceptions, but they seem hard to find.
And as well: If you plan to take your home on the road or travel with it, RV’s are waaaaay easier to tow around than a tiny house.
And then there’s mobile as in moving around a lot and mobile as in being able to move your house every few years or so. Having a tiny house on wheels doesn’t necessarily mean you intend to be on the road regularly, it could just be that you like the flexibility of being able to take it with you at some point in the future.
The owner has what he wants and congrats.
Forget the the cute and stylish and hip and small house look and for the same price, 44k, you could have bought ten (10) 26-32 foot trailers from the government that are in Mississippi now. They are Katrina remnants and are in fair condition. Check the GSA auction site.
There is a big big difference in the small house movement between style and frugality. You cannot be in the frugal category and save your money and resources by buying these “Barbie trailers” prebuilt.
There is nothing wrong with this small trailer, but it is a trailer and a expensive one at that.
There needs to be Frugal Small House and Stylish Expenditure Small House. This is neither.

$32k is in the car loan or personal line of credit range. Spread out over 5 years, it’s roughly $600/month.
LOVE these pics and stories of people that have actually made the move to ‘tiny’ living. So inspired. This is definitely in my future!!
Many thanks for sharing.
Real tiny house living.
Looks great.
Thanks!
I never quite understand comments posted on tiny homes/small homes here in the manner of – ‘why not just buy a big tent/RV/trailer instead of spending what you did?’ as if the person posting didn’t think of that. What is constructive or helpful about such a comment?
Personally, I live in a very small place, not the prettiest, though it works for me for the last decade. But would I do some big time changes if it were within my financial power? Oh yes, I would. Would I work a job that would enable those changes, even though it would totally compromise my lifestyle? Nope.
Point being, let’s be less hasty to question judgement and even less inclined to print it, when we can instead choose to increase /expand /give our knowledge in more constructive ways.
oops, and, beautiful build, beautiful location! Thanks for the $ breakdown as to expected and unexpected costs.
MJ, I personally think comments such as those “Why not (something else) instead?” are valuable in that they encourage ANSWERS and more opinions, and, best, intelligent debate. Suggesting they not be ‘allowed’ or ‘printed’ because they might somehow cast tiny house living in a ‘questionable’ light is both premature and counter-productive. For every reason someone choose or likes a tiny house, there are those who will question something, and that does NOT empirically mean they are ‘anti-tiny house’, it merely means they might be in the research phase and want to head off similar questions THEY may receive, in the future, themselves, when THEY get around to moving into THEIR tiny house.
I want to read about the good AND ‘bad’. I want to read questions and answers, pro’s and cons, as I research and plan MY dreams, because the balance of information helps me to arrive at a more well-informed decision, someday down that road.
I personally did not take any of the particular post’s ‘questions’ as offensive or degrading to ‘the tiny house movement’. Posts like these PROVOKE discussion, and discussion is very important, after all is said and done. 😉
I assume, MJ, that your comment was directed at me. It was not a rhetorical question. I genuinely don’t understand, and I am genuinely curious as to what would make this choice superior.
I currently have a 7 acre river-front piece of land, and have been working on my shipping container house for the past few months. Now, I am a scavenger, I do all my own building, and my work gets done pay-check to pay-check, and I am still under $28 000, all in.
But I have been looking into going mobile, so that I can continue work and live cheaply and simply in the city, while finishing my home in the country.
And when I do the math, the approach taken above, does not add up. So please, enlighten me, rather than being being derisive.
Derisive? I didn’t see it. Projection?
Adam, the particular, closing lines from MJ’s post:
“let’s be less hasty to question judgement and even less inclined to print it, when we can instead choose to increase /expand /give our knowledge in more constructive ways” WAS somewhat derisive.
This statement CLEARLY suggests the comment NOT EVEN BE PRINTED. This is censorship, and it was NOT a post that came even close to warranting such a drastic move…
And using the words “more constructve ways” implies the original post was UNconstructive, which it clearly was NOT.
It (Deek’s post) posed a very real, sincere question, one that many of us HAVE to consider, when researching the weigh-ins of cost vs. budget in building OUR tiny (or small) homes.
It DOES beg the question, if the tiny is on wheels, but on a home-owner, property-owed lot, and at a cost of over $70,000, one doing simple math WILL, invariably, ask the question, “If a person wants to SIMPLIFY, DOWNSIZE, have their own tiny home on a plot of land someday, why would someone do so for the SAKE ALONE of owning a self-built tiny house, when living quarters could be acquired for the SAME PURPOSES but at a fraction of cost?
I am all for tinies, and appreciate quality construction, but if another mode of ‘tiny space’ exists that would adequately serve the same purpose (if not better, with a little more square feet AND built-in original appliances, interior finishing, etc.) AND at a fraction of the final costs, *I* want to consider it!
Just saying… 😉
I orginally was going to redo a camper and have it more my taste. Someone had given us a old camper that we planned to live in full time after a gut and redo. Then I saw the tiny house. Which ment I can built something that would last forever. You can keep the cost low if you build smart. My total cost was 7,000. The camper would have costed close to 10,000. To each its own.
I’m facing a similar decision – tiny wooden house or second hand 5th wheel trailer. The trailer is cheaper, probably could get housed fairly quickly for half the price of a tiny house, but the tiny house has the advantage of being completely purpose built to your exact design, having a higher ceiling (important in a tiny living space),more windows and it’s also possible that most of the trailers in my price range will have some serious defects and possible rot. Building your own tiny house allows you to control the materials and workmanship so you know exactly what you have. Condensation is worse in a trailer in the winter and some people have problems with the synthetic materials offgassing. The whole aesthetic of a tiny house is much more appealing to me than a flashy white trailer with big swoopy swirls all over them that most seem to be. That said, if a person is going to be moving around a lot and maybe trying to slip into camping spots in a safely boring, non-attention-getting way, maybe a regular RV is a better choice. It all depends on what a person is looking for their home to provide.
EXCELLENT POST, ALice H.!
The key point here is CHOICE. People will always make their decisions based on what THEY will choose over another, and based on personal and individual tastes, what options they can or cannot live with/without, and cost.
This site would be a simple vehicle for tiny house design and sales propaganda were we never allowed to read about ALTERNATIVES, both in materials and design, or in the ‘construction-of’ itself (as in, maybe the ‘alternative’ is not even a ‘real’ tiny house…).
That is well put Jipsi.
If it works for the individual…then it is good.
One needs to view these various build thru jaded eye. I lean towards the cheaper structures being built better, but cheaper also and being accomplished thru sweat equity as a investment in the build also. You cannot buy frugality is what is reinforced in the price of many builds.
You can buy downsizing and gain savings in years to come.
Hi Bob-
I live in VT too and have been in the wishing and researching stage for a few years. I am serious about building a tiny home but I’m not native here and my main concern is how a Tumbleweed house will handle the often extended sub-zero weather in winter. Perhaps you can re-visit this page and give us an update in February or March, or if you would be interested in e-mail I give Kent permission to pass mine along to you if you request it from him. (Not sure if that is allowed, but if so…)
Your house and land look awesome. I pretty much understand about the construction challenges and issues but would *really* be interested in how you located went about finding your building site.
Congratulations on your accomplishing the goal of so many who visit this blog.
Regards
The Dickinson P-9000 heater is terrific. It can heat the house from 60 degrees to 70 degrees in about 45 minutes. I do that before retiring for the night, turn it off, and the house just cools down to 65 degrees by the morning. As to financing, I saved and invested.
I heard abouhe land for sale by word of mouth, it had not been in any real estate listings. I work part time in the local post office and hear gossip and other pieces of news. I had been looking for land for two years without coming across anything that was suitable so I feel fortunate to having heard of this land.
I love this little house! It is very well done. I want to comment on the expense. The money shows in all the great detail and new materials, and if you add plumbing and electricity and propane runs to any house with one bedroom and one bath, it will cost about the same as adding it to a little house. However, if one decides to build oneself and uses mostly recycled materials, one can build a 7 X 10 tiny house with a 4′ deep front porch with built in benches for under $2700 because I did it. In all fairness, however, I chose not to add plumbing, but to use a water crock and fill it every day. I take basin baths and use a composting toilet. I also chose to use goal zero solar energy completely which I am purchasing this winter, so there is no wiring in the house, but the solar costs about $1200 more dollars and I use solar powered lanterns ($30 each)with LED lights for lighting. I have a propane 2 burner stovetop and small propane heater. So it can be done less expensively, but if I could go back, and if I had the money, I would certainly pay someone to at least dry in the whole little house for me (plumbing, wiring, and gas), then just finish the inside myself. So cudos to you, friend, for a great build well worth the money spent.
PS- I put my tiny house on the tiny market for one day. The next day my husband asked me to take it off. Apparently, he has grown quite fond of the little house and wants to keep it for us. Lol!
Beautiful. I need one out here in the rainforest of Hawai’i. Open to negotiating trades. E.g., build it, live in it for x amt. of time!
Hey Kent,
Another Vermonter here. Great job on the house – I think I saw an ad for that piece of land when it was up for sale. I would hope you keep in touch with this page and update as has been already requested. Rather than side communications off-site, I would hope folks would continue to toss ideas back and forth here for the benefit of everyone.
Native Vermonter here too (Rutland) had to move out of Vermont to find a decent career. Upon retirement it will be a tiny house and back to Vermont! A great combination indeed.
i’m in montpelier and have helped with one tiny house project and gotten tours of a few others. can my son (8yo) and i come visit sometime? you can send an email to me at: tatonka_28@yahoo.com.
so much to talk about… coolio!!!
kim
very cool and nice house. the interior being all wood looks great and seems like it is comfortable to be inside of. how many man hours did your carpenter put into the build?
tumbleweed tiny houses look like really great designs, even the ones that are meant to be built on foundations. nice aesthetics.
The house was built over a period three weeks with a carpenter, his helper and me. I did not slow them down too much and when something was needed I went to the local hardware store to purchase it.
A sign that says SIMPLIFY… all that firewood in abundance and you have a diesel heater?
Propane heater with propane costing $1.78 a gallon.
No room in this tiny house for a wood stove.
Small wood stoves are available. Try marinestove.com.
By “not enough room” I do not mean the size of the stove but the clearances required around the stove.
I would have to second the notion that this is a questionable use of a large amount of capital. You could have done something small on 5-10 acres on a dirt road in VT (plenty of property cheap in VT & NW New Hampshire – you just need to do your due diligence and research it. Find an area you like, meet some of the locals and find out who might be willing to part with some land. You’d be surprised how many people are inclined to sell, but won’t formally list with a Realtor). All together, with land, well, septic, solar you could build a small, craftsman-style, one room cottage for such a large sum of money, & be totally off-grid in a mini-paradise.
With all due respect, it is not so cheap to buy land in Vermont anymore. And building costs are much higher than they were even just a couple of years ago. To have an acre of land, and a handsome little house of your own, for under 80,000, PAID FOR, is not so bad.
You are so right on! As a VTer and land owner of two properties..one called and taxed as my residence on 2.3 acres and on called and taxed as my camp on 6.5 acres…if anyone plans coming to VT thinking cheap, do not make that huge error. There are lots of reg’s in place in VT now. Especially since Tropical Storm Irene devasted areas around what were tiny mnt streams etc. anyone can google and find the regs on septics, bldg regs in various communities. Some towns have no building regs, and yet you must have septic IF it is a fulltime residence! My camp has no running water except the river. Compost toilet, but cannot Live full time( by law) in my 12×20 cottage at campdue to the site, the Feds stuck those nose in. So just telling you there are lots of regs and nothing, nothing is cheap in VT! Check the stats! I live here, I love our VT and our people. Never will move away!
Hi – very nice job. I live across the river in Cow Hampsha and would love to see the home some day since I’ve been wanting to build one for a number of years now. I’ve seen very few in person though. I also recently installed a Dickinson Newport solid-fuel heater in a small camper… it puts out more heat than I thought it would. Although yours looks to be propane, they seem to make good products.

Hi Bob
I like your home.Alot.
I am new to the tiny house conversation.I am looking for a trailer… how far from the ground is the bed of the trailer?
Thank you much
Tim
Bed of the trailer about 2′ from the ground.
I really like the cedar siding in the shower. It fits my idea of what a shower should look like. How is it holding up so far?Group: Independence-Development Ltd

Starting at 12:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, June 4, Motorola will be offering the no-contract 32GB Moto X for $100 off of its normal price of $399. The sale will run for 2 days, ending the night of June 5.
Motorola has run quite a few Moto X promotions in the past, so it’s not entirely shocking to see another sale kicking off soon. And while the Moto X+1 is in the works, that device is rumored to be another few months off. So if you’re interested in the Moto X and somehow haven’t taken part in any of Motorola’s previous promos, tomorrow you’ll get another shot at snagging a discounted unit.
How many of you have a Moto X? If you do, did you get it during one of Motorola’s numerous sales?A closer look at 3 stocks

Cooking can be an enjoyable, meditative, even therapeutic endeavor, but there are plenty of times when you just need to get dinner on the table. I hear from a lot of readers new to the Primal Blueprint who are dealing with the kitchen learning curve: how to condense shopping trips, how to assemble good Primal meals throughout the busy week, how to free up time for other activities outside the kitchen. A group of readers recently took up the discussion in our forum., leaves you with a constant supply of cuts. Gathering up a large stock of veggies – with some freezer bags and prep –, dressings and other condiments..This article gives an overview of the drug addiction scene in New Hampshire. But behind the addiction problem is the trafficking business.
The focal point of New Hampshire's drug trafficking is Manchester in the southern part of the state. Drug dealers most often acquire their supplies from the Lowell, Massachusetts area just a few miles away. Cocaine, some of which is converted to crack cocaine, and heroin are the primary drugs that travel on this channel.
Nearly all the cocaine and heroin sold and used in this area are sourced out of New York City, one of the primary drug distribution points in the country. Other drugs are trafficked across the remote and largely unpatrolled Canadian border.
Much of the drug activity in the Manchester region is controlled by gangs, either national gangs that have been growing in strength, or copycat gangs that have arisen in the last few years. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has established a New Hampshire Safe Streets Gang Task Force to counteract the influence of gangs and drug traffickers in the area. In April, 2009, the Task Force reported the seizure of 45 kilograms of cocaine and nearly a quarter of a million dollars from seven suspected gang members in an attractive suburban home outside Manchester.
Much of the property crime in the state is thought to be drug- and gang-related. These crimes include thefts from corner stores, banks and gas stations and home invasion robberies. Unfortunately, prisons and jails serve as breeding grounds and recruitment pools for gang members. More local youth follow the examples of national gangs and establish their own gangs in outlying areas, further compounding the problems from gang activity.
Potent hydroponic marijuana and synthetics such as MDMA (ecstasy) and controlled prescription drugs such as oxycodone or benzodiazepines come across the Canada-U.S. border, not just for local use but also destined for other regions of the U.S. Weapons and cash pass across the border to the north.
As the southern border of the United States is patrolled by far more personnel than the northern border, the ratio of seized drugs to trafficked drugs is thought to be low in the north.
Marijuana is the most widely abused drug in the state and Canada's hydroponic marijuana is far more potent than Mexican commercial-grade marijuana. Analysis of commercial-grade Mexican marijuana shows levels of marijuana's active ingredient (THC) as high as 9 percent, up from 3 percent two decades ago. Hydroponic marijuana from Canada may have a potency as high as 25 percent THC. The higher the THC, the more likely it is that a user will become dependent or addicted.
Based on 2007 reports from the Drug Abuse Warning Network, three counties in the southern part of the state experienced 89 deaths and 21 suicides in which drug abuse was involved. These three counties are Rockingham County, Strafford County and Hillsborough County which includes Manchester. Nearly all the deaths involved multiple drugs with the exception of a few opiate and cocaine deaths. Alcohol was involved in about a third of all deaths.
By the time high school students graduate in New Hampshire, six out of ten of them have smoked marijuana. More than a third are current users of the drug. About a fifth have used cocaine.
Alcohol sends the most people into drug rehabilitation facilities, accounting for nearly half of all admissions in 2008. Opiates such as heroin, methadone, OxyContin, Vicodin, Percocet, methadone, Suboxone, morphine and codeine contribute another 25 percent of those seeking addiction treatment and cocaine adds approximately 10 percent of the addicts who enter rehab centers.
What is needed for New Hampshire citizens is substance abuse treatment centers that enable drug and alcohol addicts to leave drugs and alcohol behind them and in which they can learn to live productive, enjoyable lives again. And young people in New Hampshire need effective drug abuse prevention programs that teach them why they should avoid alcohol abuse or use of narcotics.
The Narconon drug and alcohol rehabilitation program, found around the world and across the United States, has a success rate of 70 percent. The Narconon drug prevention curriculum has been proven to change the thinking of school-aged children away from using drugs and alcohol. When treatment centers really help people recover from addiction and prevention programs actually keep young people from starting to use drugs, the future for all citizens of New Hampshire can become free from substance abuse and addiction.

The problem is they take people out of their comfort zones and that freaks folks out. Okay so you want to turtle up in your keep with standard troops, I want to crack that turtles shell and eat its meat. It's a pvp game with the option to not fight, so don't fight them.
So your pride keeps you from clicking "pay off", that is not the devs problem it's yours.
Fiinally for the devs, dragons have dragonslayers so wizards could have...wizardslayers. The whole mess resolved with a single unit.
Preferably a lone mounted warrior to run them down or a speed boost to a solo warrior type designed to kill wizards. High elemental resists with low s/b/p resist caps so it wouldn't be able to handle wizards but need to be escorted.
Then again this may be too silly, but so would nerfing the focus of the "Arcana" expansion. Arcana is referring to the arcane which in turn is magic which is used by...wizards. So you expanded and then beat the purpose of the expansion with the nerf bat?
I love this game so far, just work out the bugs then deal with the "That's not fair" crowd. Hell,one of the things that keep me playing is holding off Konstantin with opposing conventional armies. No magic at all and it was epic. I still wonder if it was "the" Konstantin or if it was him that he held back, but I digress.
In summation; leave wizards alone and/or make a wizard slayer. Great game, that is all.
You give that cav some sort of net that lets him snare and drag the wizard around and I feel like that would be amazing. Otherwise I would look into doing some other form of "anti" wizard unit.
A unit that could generate an anti-magic sphere would allow for players (on both sides) the opportunity to still participate in straight up medieval style fighting while working towards the obj of disabling the opponents spells/protection.
My other thought would be to add. . . A FOURTH WIZARD, and A FOURTH SPELL SCHOOOL. MUAAAHAHA. No seriously.
You add a fourth wizard and spell school (divine maybe? I heard the orcs and elves cast spells too. just as a thought for character skin) and this hero has AOE abilities mimicking the spells that current mages have access to. Instead of dropping a screen wide meteor/blizzard/lightning storm this hero stops any magic currently going on in the area or from occurring in the target area for an equal or SLIGHTLY shorter time than does the offensive spell. I would make them both equal though. This would also stop abilities like MASS HEAL, DOWNPOUR, ect.
Players who want to use magic to devastating effect should be allowed to do so, but should have to work for it. If a player wants to field an army which does not waste an army using magic it should still be their duty to defend against it, not just remove it from the game. Currently the defense for it are very limited though.
Magic should allow for some flashy, wrath of the deity sort of stuff happen; but only to the same effect as when I place 3 siege towers on a wall and rush it with goblins.
TL;DR In my opinion: Magic does not wreck you any worse currently than does a full army of spear men against your horsemen. The issue is that there is no means in which to field any other unit against the spear men currently.

Bethlehem, Pa., April 7, 2006—Moravian College Comenius Center and the Volunteer Center of the Lehigh Valley will co-host a Nonprofit Executive Director’s Roundtable On Wednesday, April 19th, at Moravian College, Main Street campus in Bethlehem, Pa. The theme of the discussion is “Lobbying: One of the Tools in the Advocacy Toolkit,” designed for the leaders of charitable organizations. The panel will feature Dr. Florence C. Kimball, dean of the Moravian College Comenius Center for Continuing, Professional and Graduate Studies, and Joseph M. Geiger, executive director for the Pennsylvania Association of Nonprofit Organizations (PANO). They will define what constitutes lobbying and outline the best practices for nonprofits in advocating for the needs of their organizations and clients
Prior to joining Moravian College, Kimball served for seven years on Capitol Hill working for the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL Her primary responsibilities were for the print and electronic vehicles that communicated FCNL’s lobbying initiatives to the Quaker constituencies, nationwide.
Geiger is the executive director for the Pennsylvania Association of Nonprofit Organizations (PANO) and has garnered more than thirty years experience in the fields of education, human resources and association management. PANO is the statewide membership organization serving and advancing the charitable nonprofit sector through leadership, advocacy, education and services. Geiger has delivered many programs on the role of charities in the public policy process. Presently, he facilitates the Charities Build Communities Coalition in Pennsylvania comprised of the 175 charities that forged the passage of Act 55 (defining “charities” eligible for exemption).
Dr. William Kleintop, associate dean for Business and Management Programs for the Moravian College Comenius Center, will moderate the program. “We have invited local executive directors of nonprofit organizations to attend these Roundtables” said Kleintop. “We believe Moravian College provides an outstanding central location for conducting roundtables as well as other educational opportunities for area nonprofit organizations.”
The program is being held in the Bahnson Center of the Moravian Theological Seminary on the Main Street campus from 8 to 10 a.m., beginning at 7:45 a.m. with a continental breakfast. Advanced registration for the program is $15.

This was the highest pick for the Devils since they grabbed defenseman Scott Niedermayer third overall in 1991. Larsson is capable of making the Devils' NHL roster this season, although that decision will be made during the preseason.

Rumors were swirling this week when Amber Heard was photographed seemingly trying to shield a diamond ring on her left hand. But now there’s no reason to cover up. People magazine has confirmed that the actress is engaged to Johnny Depp.
"Of course they couldn't be happier to be engaged and excited to share the rest of their lives together," a source tells PEOPLE, adding that she has already told “close friends” the happy news.
The couple met on the set of their movie “The Rum Diary” and officially started dating the following year after Depp,50, had confirmed his spit from his girlfriend Vanessa Paradis.
Depp and Paradis, a French actress and singer, had been together for 14 years and have two children, Lily-Rose, 14, and Jack, 11.
Heard is reportedly developing a close relationship with the kids.
“Amber has really taken well to the kids and really enjoys spending time with them,” revealed the source. “And she’s even taken Lily shopping on her own for some bonding time.”
Heard, 27, has previously stated that she’s bisexual and was in a four-year relationship with photographer Rasya van Ree.GREENSBORO, N.C. - In an effort to make it possible for everyone to attend the Wyndham Championship and experience a PGA TOUR event, the Piedmont Triad's PGA TOUR event will offer free admission before noon for the first three days of tournament week, it was announced today. The 73rd annual Wyndham Championship is set for Aug. 13-19, 2012.
For the first three days of tournament week, Monday's Kevin Harvick Foundation Pro-Am presented by Technology Concepts & Design, Tuesday's PGA TOUR practice rounds and Wednesday's New Breed Logistics Pro-Am, admission will be free of charge until Noon for the first 5,000 fans that arrive at Sedgefield Country Club each day. After Noon each day or after the first 5,000 people arrive, whichever comes first, $15 regular-priced tickets will be required for entry. And as always, children under the age of 15 are admitted free of charge with a paying adult. Regular ticket prices return for official tournament play Thursday through Sunday.
"We are happy to invite the Piedmont Triad to join us at the Wyndham Championship," tournament director Mark Brazil said. "A lot of Piedmont Triad people are still struggling to make ends meet so we are inviting everyone to come to the tournament as our guests so that people have the opportunity to experience this great Piedmont Triad tradition and see some of the world's best golfers. We appreciate the support our event enjoys throughout the region, and this is one way we can say 'thank you.'"
Rob Goodman/Wyndham ChampionshipAre Superheroes for real?
I've never met a Superhero before, but now I believe they exist.
I recently flew to South Dakota and Pennsylvania and met the tiniest, bravest, most inspiring Superheroes, including my new Superhero friend, 5-year-old Brooke Mulford.
Wearing her special pink cape, running with her arms raised in the air and screaming with joy, little Brooke forgets about all of the cancer procedures, medicine and treatments she's had to endure because when the cape is on, this little girl believes she's "Super Brooke."
Accessorized in her favorite color pink, Brooke is among 4,000 sick children and their siblings, who have custom homemade Superhero capes. The capes are gifts, sewn with inspiration and sent with blessings of love, from Wonder Capes.
Brooke's personalized pink Superhero cape gives her comfort, reassurance and power to fight stage four, high risk Neuroblastoma -- infant and childhood cancer of the nervous system.
All Superheroes need someone extraordinary, to outfit them...meet Amy Pankratz. By day, Amy is a stay at home mother of three, juggling the normal multiple schedules, obligations and responsibilities; including elementary and preschool school carpools, room mother activities, etc. By night, when her so-called "Love Bugs" are asleep, she sews through most of the night -- many times, pulling all nighters.
Amy and her husband Michael call their "hobby" and mission "Wonder Capes."
These capes are homemade, beautifully crafted "Superhero" comfort capes delivered to sick children around the world. As a mother of small children, Amy knows how important it is to love, encourage and support all of them. She understands that often parents focus on their sick child, taking away time and attention from their other children -- that's why she also accessorizes their siblings.
The capes are heartfelt inspirations. "I read their story. I think about them. I pray for them while I make it," said Amy.
I've been dreaming about traveling to meet Amy and her family for about a year. There were many challenges to my plans: first funding, then scheduling and more behind-the-scenes logistics etc. Recently, everything fell into place and then BAM! I was on my way to cover one of the most personal stories ever in my ten years of being a journalist.
How perfect that after nearly a year of trying to connect with Amy and Wonder Capes, that the stars aligned just in time -- September, which is National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month -- a way to focus attention on the important need to fund the fight against these cancers.
According to the National Cancer Institute, cancer is the leading cause of death by disease in children one to 14 years old. On average, one to two children develop the disease each year for every 10,000 children in the United States. In the 2007, approximately 10,400 children living in the U.S.,.
Also this month, the entertainment industry unites for Stand Up 2 Cancer, a celebrity-studded, simultaneous multi-network broadcast show -- just one of the many of the platforms for cancer awareness and funding.
As you will see in our GIG story, we too highlight the brightest STARS and Superheroes on the forefront of research, care and this determined fight.
In my lifetime, my hope is that you discover your Superhero powers to make a difference and that you're moved to use them to give back.
Since I created Go Inspire Go, my video-based, inspirational website that "Helps viewers discover their power and use it to help others," I've been jonesing to do a story about the fight against cancer.
Covering and sharing this story with you has been a dream of mine, and something I've been moved to do, since my father and aunt both passed away, months from each other, in 2001. Back then, I felt powerless.
After meeting Amy, other parents and Superheroes, I finally regained my power. Like Brooke and the other little Superheroes I recently befriended at CHOP, I too believe in miracles and the positive "power" of the cape!
For many of the sick kids who receive their cape, the Metropolis (and second home) where they fly is the hospital. Hopefully one day, they can fly freely outside and away from the villain they call cancer.
You may not be a sewing superstar like Amy, (I'm no Martha Stewart either); however, I do know that you have it in you to give back, no matter big or small. You can make a charitable donation -- a gift to honor or remember someone -- to cancer research organizations, or if you're on a tight budget, you can volunteer at your local hospital, sponsor, or organize a fundraising event.
Do you have commitment phobia, or hesitate supporting a nonprofit, or cause? No worries, be creative. Maybe there's a family member, friend, neighbor fighting cancer, who you can help with errands, household responsibilities, or better yet, lend your talents (painting, music, etc.) and spend time making your important Superhero smile.
Here's an example of paying it forward; In the video, you saw that Nick's mother, Angi Kappenman was inspired by Amy to give back. The Kappenman's donate backpacks to parents of a sick child at a local hospital -- in them are activities, such as coloring books, crayons, etc. along with a picture of Nick and a message to "Stay Strong Carry On," a mantra the family repeats as Nick continues his checkups...the intent is two-fold: to keep kids entertained and to help parents organize hospital paperwork.
It's obvious that I love talking and revere in storytelling. One of my contributions is using my skills to create videos and blogs that raise visibility and support for amazing superheroes -- many I want you to meet through GIG.
Please view and share our heartwarming video by copying and sending this video & blog link, sharing on facebook, or tweeting.
To all the Superhero families and children who continue to fight, the "C" villain: Stay strong. Carry on. Bless you.

Too many people are coming to the new museum—raising prices is intended to keep a few art lovers away! Really! That’s really the reason they’re raising prices!
And the proles are creating problems, doing things like standing too close to the sculptures and making people anxious, and there’s enough poor-versus-rich stuff going on here to make up the faintly ludicrous plot of a 1930s Marx Brothers movie. “We. [Inquirer]
