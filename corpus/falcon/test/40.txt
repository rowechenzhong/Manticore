Booker T. (April 5) — This '60s funk icon swings through Dallas' Granada Theater with a healthy helping of rhythm, blues and soul. Local bands Quaker City Night Hawks and Chris Watson Band.Pure essence! Spotless Fount of Light,
That fadeth never into dark!
O Thou, whose eyes more clear and bright
Than noonday sun are quick to mark
Our sins; lo, bare before Thy face
Lies all the desert of my heart,
My once fair soul in every part
Now stained with evil foul and base.
Since but the pure in heart are blest
With promised vision of their God,
Sore fear and anguish fill my breast,
Rememb'ring all the ways I trod;
Mourning I see my lost estate,
And yet in faith I dare to cry,
Oh let my evil nature die,
Another heart in me create!
Enough, Lord, that my foe too well
Hath lured me once away from Thee;
Henceforth I know his craft how fell,
And all his deep-laid snares I flee.
Lord, through the Spirit whom Thy Son
Hath bidden us in prayer to ask,
Arm us with might that every task,
Whate'er we do, in Thee be done.
Unworthy am I of Thy grace,
So deep are my transgressions, Lord,
And yet once more I seek Thy face;
My God, have mercy, nor reward
My sins and follies, dark and vain;
Reject, reject me not in wrath,
But let Thy sunshine now beam forth,
And quicken me with hope again.
The Holy Spirit Thou hast given,
The wondrous pledge of love divine,
Who fills our hearts with joys of heaven,
And bids us earthly joys resign;
Oh let His seal be on my heart,
Oh take Him nevermore away,
Until this fleshly house decay,
And Thou shlt bid me hence depart.
But ah! my coward spirit droops,
Sick with the fear that enters in
Whene'er a soul to bondage stoops,
And wears the shameful yoke of sin;
Oh quicken with the strength that flows
From out the Eternal Fount of Life,
My soul half-fainting in the strife,
And make an end of all my woes.
I cling unto Thy grace alone,
Thy steadfast oath my only rest;
To Thee, Heart-searcher, all is known
That lieth hidden in my breast;
Thy joy, O Spirit, on me pour,
Thy fervent will my sloth inspire,
So shall I have my heart's desire,
And serve and praise Thee evermore.With over 90 games exclusive to Slot Factory and more to come Slot Factory is one of the fastest growing slot applications on Facebook.

Big Bad Voodoo Daddy
Big Bad Voodoo Daddy
When: 8 p.m. Sunday, April 18
Where: Philharmonic Center for the Arts, 5833 Pelican Bay Blvd.
Admission: $50
Information: 597-1900 or
For better or worse, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Cab Calloway share a similar fate.
No matter how good the music they made over the years is, both are now remembered most for their roles in films that captured the American zeitgeist. For Calloway it was the role of mentor and stop gap for Jake and Elwood in "The Blues Brothers." For Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, it was as the band that got Mike to dance with his newly found girl in "Swingers."
Put that together with the love both shared for ribald ditties about getting loose — see Calloway's "Reefer Man" and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's "You and Me and the Bottle Makes Three" — and it makes sense that the last men standing from the '90s swing revival would have made an album of Calloway tunes.
The band is in Naples on Sunday as part of the tour supporting the album "How Big Can you Get?: The Music of Cab Calloway," which the band released nearly a year ago. The concert at the Philharmonic Center for the Arts starts at 8 p.m.
"His energy was amazing," says trumpet player Glen "The Kid" Marhevka of Calloway. "His charisma was a template for the approach of our live show."
Since forming in the late '80s, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy had often covered Calloway's signature song, "Minne the Moocher," and the song is referenced in their song "Mr. Pinstripe Suit."
"We'd always talked about doing more of his songs and then the time just seemed right to do Cab Calloway stuff," Marhevka says about the album's genesis. "He's overlooked in a lot of ways. People just think of him as the ‘Hi-De-Ho Man' or ‘Blues Brothers.' They don't list him as a jazz great."
Marhevka might have a point. Calloway's big band was always in the shadow of Duke Ellington's. They filled in for Ellington at the famous Cotton Club when his band was on tour. And while they eventually became a co-headliner at the Cotton Club and toured the country, they could never outpace Ellington's genius.
Marhevka said the band wanted to raise awareness about Calloway's music, which may seem strange since not that many people have too much awareness of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy right now. After being shot to the forefront of the swing revival thanks to "Swingers," the band's 1998 album "Americana Deluxe" went platinum. It seemed like the band was poised to do big things after playing in the 1999 Super Bowl halftime show.
But the swing revival sort of petered out with the turn of the decade, leaving bands like the Squirrel Nut Zippers and Cherry Poppin' Daddies without much of an audience.
"Nothing really changed for us," Marhevka says. "Selling all those records was nice, but it didn't make us rich. There are seven guys in the band. We still had to be out there touring and working. Same as we are doing now."
After touring a little longer on the Calloway record, the band is going back in the studio to continue the evolution of its swing sound.
"We've been doing it for years," Marhevka says. "We've kept doing what we want to do and that's what we'll keep doing."

Credit: Mark Wilson/Getty Images
Latest News
FAIRFAX (CBSDC) — Fairfax County Police are looking for a suspect who sexually assaulted a 24-year-old woman in Fairfax Wednesday night.
The victim told police she was grabbed behind and dragged into a wooded area and assaulted as she was walking in 9700 block of Commonwealth Boulevard around 10 p.m. The suspect threatened her with a knife or other edged weapon prior to the sexual assault.
The suspect fled the scene after becoming startled by a noise in the area. The victim was then able to get help and report the incident.
The suspect is described as a white male approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall. He was wearing a sweatshirt and partially concealed his face.
The area in which the incident occurred is relatively quiet, prompting concern from police.
“It’s concerning to use because this is not an area that is known for violent attacks like this,” said Fairfax County Police Spokesperson Bud Walker. “Because of the nature of the attack we really are urging people in that area to be on alert.”
Anyone with information is asked to contact Crime Solvers at 1-866-411-TIPS/8477 or. They can also call Fairfax County Police at 703-691-2131.I first met American Merrily Lustig-Tornatore at Stars’n’Bars on November 3, 2016. It was election night in the US and MonacoUSA was hosting a party in the days when it was normal to have a room full of mask-free people sitting on top of each other, drinking from the bar and cheering on a country that was once synonymous with democracy.
“I decided that the only way Europeans and the rest of the world could know who Americans were was to be exemplary and bright and funny so they would not get the wrong idea by seeing Trump,” says the long-time Monaco resident.
Born in New York, Merrily moved in 1964 to Killington, Vermont – via boarding school in Switzerland with a couple of months in Karachi and also in Paris – to be a ski bum. “I got my Vermont real estate licence in 1971 … I think!”
What a unique name. “When my parents were married, in the Forties, there was a cartoon in the Sunday paper with a little girl named Merrily who had long reddish-blond braids. My father liked her so much that I ended up being Merrily and having to live up to her reputation.”
Merrily comes from a line of accomplished women. In the Thirties, her mom started Airlines, the first in-flight aviation magazine, and was a speechwriter at NASA for the associate administrator for the Office of Manned Space Flight for the Apollo program.
In 1983, she had just received a “hard-earned” Emergency Medical Technicians accreditation in Vermont when she got a call from a family member in need. “My mother’s sister who ran Society Magazine for Société des Bains de Mer needed help so away I went to Monaco. It was really an offer I couldn’t refuse.”
Working alongside her aunt, creative genius June Quin, and her financial guru husband Mark, Merrily replaced her cousin Vally who had left for London. “You name it, I did it. Having been brought up in the publishing business, it seemed second nature. I think I learned to read by helping the family proofread.”
In 1986, she met Rémy, her first aid instructor at the Monaco Red Cross and “after a long engagement” they wed in 2009. “You can never be too sure you have made the right choice,” Merrily laughs. (Rémy retired two years ago as director of First Aid for the Monaco Red Cross.)
Merrily has been a member of MonacoUSA for over 20 years and also serves on its Board. She has laid the memorial wreath for association to commemorate when the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team led the liberation of Monaco from German occupation on September 3, 1944.
She was also vice-president of the American Aid Association of the French Riviera, founded in 1948 “to assist American citizens who find themselves hospitalised, jailed, resident in retirement homes or facing other temporary financial difficulties.” For years, Princess Grace worked personally both with the association and with the former American Consulate in Nice, assisting Americans living in the region. The association, which shut down in 2019, had strong ties with the Monaco Red Cross and its social work and youth outreach.
Following the Bastille attacks in Nice in 2016, Merrily spent ten days in Nice as a First Aid volunteer with the Monaco Red Cross. “We were helping the psychologically wounded and sat with people until a professional could see them. There was an American woman who came in with an aura of pain, and I just sat apart offering to translate if necessary. If I ran into Americans, I would help them liaise with the consulate in Marseilles if they so desired.”
Merrily’s current claim to fame is to have received the Covid vaccine yesterday in Monaco. “It is absolutely fantastic, considering the world population, to be one of the first people to have the honour to live in a place where I am so well treated.”
She was contacted by letter from the Ministry of State (see letter), signed both by minister of state Pierre Dartout and minister of health and social affairs Didier Gamerdinger, explaining who, when, how and why to get vaccinated. The letter invited her to make an appointment if she wanted to get the vaccine. Additionally, there was a full page of information addressing “Les Vaccins à ARNm” – how it differs from a traditional vaccination, benefits, possible side-effects and so forth. It states that Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna (EU-approved this week) are the vaccines that will be used in Monaco.
“The organisation of the campaign is fantastic. I phoned, it took ages to get through, and said YES. They called Monday and asked if I could come in Wednesday. I was so excited, I could hardly get the words out.”
Merrily says she becomes livid when people don’t wear masks. “Being really short and OLD, I occasionally walk into a grocery store and what not saying loudly, ‘SVP, mettez vos masques sur vos nez!’ It feels great. I’m too small to hit so they usually obey.”
Her vaccination appointment was for 9:20 am and she arrived 10 minutes in advance to check in and be interviewed by the doctor with the usual questions.
“I told Rémy after I got the Covid shot Wednesday morning that if I passed out during the day, don’t blame it on the vaccine. It could very well be because of the on-going election debacle in the US.”

Battle for Beit Shemesh.
(photo credit:FLASH 90)
All anonymous electioneering posters in Beit Shemesh must be removed because of multiple infractions of the laws pertaining to such campaign material, Central Election Committee chairman and Supreme Court Justice Salim Joubran ruled on Thursday.Yesh Atid MK Dov Lipman and his party brought the claims before the committee after haredi activists posted signs around the city showing an image of Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid.“This man is relying on your apathy. Gather together and defend your lives,” the poster read, urging the haredi community to vote for haredi candidate and incumbent Mayor Moshe Abutbul of Shas.The Beit Shemesh Municipality’s legal adviser did not heed the requests to take down the posters, leading to Yesh Atid’s appeal to the committee.Repeat municipal elections are scheduled for Beit Shemesh this coming Tuesday, following rulings by the Jerusalem District Court and the Supreme Court that widespread fraud in the October 2013 elections rendered the results invalid.Joubran ruled on Thursday that the posters with Lapid’s image, as well as all other anonymous political posters, must be taken down.Similar signs in favor of Abutbul have appeared in Beit Shemesh in recent weeks, often employing an inflammatory reference to the biblical Book of Esther and implying that haredi lives are at risk if non-haredi candidate Eli Cohen of the independent Beit Shemesh is Returning party wins the election.“This is not simply unknown voters breaking election law, but the mayor himself not following election law, and I strongly condemn him for this,” said Lipman.“Aside from the outright falsehood implied in connecting Finance Minister Yair Lapid to the Beit Shemesh elections, it continues to demonstrate haredi leaders stirring up hatred and implying to their voters that secular Israel wants to make them less religious. Our God is a God of truth, and our Torah is a Torah of truth – realities which they choose to ignore,” he added.Meanwhile, the Cohen campaign has reported that it is in close contact with representatives from the Sephardi haredi community in the city as part of efforts to increase Cohen’s share of the vote.A leading Shas rabbi in the city, Rabbi David Benizri, spoke out against Abutbul in the weeks following the last election, saying that the mayor had not fulfilled promises to Shas and Sephardi functionaries for posts in the municipal administration.Benizri went as far as to say that Shas would not enter Abutbul’s municipal coalition until he reallocated municipal portfolios.Officials in Cohen’s campaign told The Jerusalem Post that the Sephardi haredi community representatives with whom they were in touch saw Cohen as someone “who could represent their interests.”While the likelihood that the community will not vote for Abutbul is low, Cohen told the Post that it was “no secret that this community is disappointed with Abutbul and has been let down by him.”Both sides are scrambling to increase voter turnout within their supporter base.Abutbul told the Post earlier this week that his campaign had been going to door-todoor to drum up voter motivation and has been holding a series of workshops and events to boost the campaign.Voter turnout will likely be decisive in the election. There are some 50,000 eligible voters in Beit Shemesh, of which approximately 58 percent are non-haredi and 42% are haredi.In the October municipal election, total voter turnout was 67%, although the turnout in the haredi community was 72%, compared to 64% in the non-haredi sector.Without taking the matter of fraudulent votes into account, Abutbul took approximately 51.5% of the vote, compared to 48.5% for Cohen.Because of the lower non-haredi turnout, the Cohen campaign has been hard at work to motivate voters and has engaged in a campaign to identify those who did not vote last time so as to increase Cohen’s share of theHelp You To Find Royal Story Unclaimed Items, Easy To Access Particular Item Having Less Number Of Clicks

Source: Hardcover, Published September 26, 2013 by Viking Juvenile
Verdict: Very Good/Excellent
Book Description:.
Oh, this was a good one.
All the Truth That’s in Me took me by surprise, and I LOVE it when a YA title does that! I’ve been trying to find a way to describe Julie Berry’s novel, and here’s what I’ve got: cross Arthur Miller’s The Crucible with the YA skills of Laurie Halse Anderson and Ruta Sepetys. Without ever really pinpointing exact time, place, or even genre, Berry- through Judith’s incisive narration- takes us on a fascinating (and gorgeously written) trip.
In crisp, yet precise bursts, Judith recounts her past- her childhood, her disappearance- and her present, all the while talking to her one true love, her childhood friend Lucas. As we learn from the book description, after two years of missing from her village (and presumed dead), Judith suddenly returns. Due to her silence regarding her disappearance, her captor, and her scars, Judith is ostracized by most in her village- including by her widowed mother who forces silence, makes Judith work night and day, and only refers to her daughter as ‘You-‘. Judith has harrowing (and shocking) secrets hidden deep from her time away; some disturbing ones that start to creep to the surface when she makes a decision that changes the fate of her village and its inhabitants. When a tentative friendship begins between Judith and a young village woman, Judith is encouraged to speak again, to try and find her voice. And when a nefarious and ill-thought hunt threatens the lives of both Lucas and Judith, she knows that she cannot remain quiet any longer. She must tell everyone- including Lucas- the truth about her friends death, and what really happened while she was away. But who will trust or listen when Judith finally speaks? And will they want to hear what she has to say?

GABON AND EQUATORIAL GUINEA
MASS FOR THE WORKERS
HOMILY OF JOHN PAUL II
Lagos (Nigeria)
Tuesday, 16 February 1982
l. “I am with you always”.
These words of our risen Saviour Jesus Christ, taken from today’s Gospel reading, have a special meaning for us as we gather here this morning to praise his name and to celebrate his Eucharist. Christ is with us. Through faith and the waters of Baptism he has found a dwelling place in our hearts. He comes to us through his word and under the appearances of bread and wine. By God’s grace, we have become living temples of the Holy Spirit, citizens with the saints, and members of the household of God.
2. In the first reading of today’s liturgy, the prophet Zechariah tells us of a plea which rises up from the nations: “We want to go with you, since we have learnt that God is with you”. Is not this plea still heard today? Are there not many people, in every nation on earth, who, deep in their hearts, long to know the Lord and be close to him? We cannot be deaf to their petition. For it is to you and me, to every one of us, that it is directed. We have come to know the Lord and have been invited to dwell in his house. Now in our turn we must share our faith with others, so that they too may come to believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God, that he is Lord, and that he is with us always. Through us the Lord wills to extend his salvation: “I have made you a light for the nations, so that my salvation may reach the ends of the earth”.
3. I would now like to direct my words to those members of the Church in Nigeria who are industrialists and workers, employers and employees. You are playing a vital role in the life of your nation and people expect much of you. The Church too looks to you with great hope. She knows that you are able to give a powerful witness to the Gospel in the places where you work and among all those people associated with you in the service of humanity.
4. People who work enjoy a God-given dignity. God could have created everything on earth in its final form, but he decided differently. For God wants us to be associated with him in the improvement of the things he has made. By our work we share in God’s own creative activity. It was the same with Christ himself in his human nature. As I stated in my last encyclical: “The eloquence of the life of Christ is unequivocal: he belongs to the ‘working world’, he has appreciation and respect for human work. It can indeed he said that he looks with love upon human work and the different forms that it takes, seeing in each one of these forms a particular facet of man’s likeness with God, the Creator and Father”.
Work is also man’s way of helping his neighbour. One person’s work affects another person, and together workers help to build up the whole of society. Those who can say: when we work conscientiously, we make a real contribution towards a better world. Our work is an act of solidarity with our brothers and sisters.
5. All who work, whether they are single or married, well skilled or not, have important rights and responsibilities. For example, each one has the right to proper pay and to reasonable working hours, including time for holidays. And work should never hinder the exercise of one’s religious freedom. Work is for man, not man for work. So, work must not be allowed to dehumanise the person who does the work.
Between employers and employees there can sometimes arise cases of misunderstanding. These are to be resolved, not by violence, harsh words and antagonisms, but by mutual respect, willingness to listen and patient dialogue. Workers have the right to form unions and to ask for proper working conditions. But they also have the obligation to render loyal service, and employers have the right to receive the services for which they pay. Workers should not too readily have recourse to strikes, which generally cause much suffering to many; strikes remain extraordinary measures for the defence of human rights.
6. As employers and employees, as industrialists and workers, you can and must serve your country by vigorous efforts at economic development. Your country is richly gifted by God with agricultural and mineral resources. Use them to the best advantage of all, especially the poor, the orphans, the sick, the handicapped, the old, and those who are overtaken in the struggle for economic betterment. Do nothing to sabotage the economy of your own country. Nothing can replace diligent, efficient and honest hard work on your part.
7. Some people are unemployed because they rush to the big cities and do not want to cultivate the land. Help is needed therefore to modernise agricultural methods and to install such facilities as water, electricity and telephones in the rural areas, so that the young can be persuaded to stay on the land.
Some people are unemployed because they were not adequately trained, or because their expectations of the type of work they want are not fulfilled. Competent and dedicated economists, government planners and sociologists are needed to help solve these problems.
8. My words today are especially for you, industrialists and workers, employers and employees, all brothers and sisters in our Lord Jesus Christ. Each of you has a vital task to carry out in the mission of the Church, a task which you carry out in the toil and labour of your ordinary working lives. Side by side with your fellow workers, you share in the creative activity of God, you forge bonds of fraternity and friendship and, like the yeast of the Gospel, in quiet but effective ways you further the Kingdom of God.
Trough your work and through the holiness of life that comes from doing God’s will, you are able to make a big contribution to the Church’s mission of proclaiming the Good News to the whole world.
Where do you find the strength for this mission? What is the source of your inspiration? It is always Christ. Remember the words of the Gospel: “I am with you always”. Yes, Christ is with us, especially in the Eucharist. And this morning, in his Sacrifice, Christ offers us and all our work to his Father in heaven. In this way he gives an ever deeper value to all work. He gives a whole new meaning to our lives. In Jesus Christ our Saviour and our Lord, and in his Eucharist, we find the source of our strength and the cause of our joy.Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 Download PC Full Version Game more specific information:

Second time round for stolen bikes for me. Bastards, on their third attempt, finally ripped through the garage roof and went straight in with bolt croppers and took both my MTBs. They left my road bike and my wife's hybrid, so it was clearly a targeted theft.

Sports betting may be the act of placing a bet on the possible result and predicting sports outcomes. The quantity of individuals who bet on sports, ranging from casual sports enthusiasts to professional bettors, is increasing recently. Sports betting is legal generally in most countries and is widely known as “the other NFL”. In America alone, there are estimated to be over 22 million Americans who place sports bets, with nearly 1 / 2 of them placing bets on football. The frequency of sports wagers, however, varies by country, with the majority of bets being positioned on American football.
One way to increase your chances at winning sports betting is by choosing the best online bookmakers. There are several online bookmakers that operate in the united states and also have websites with detailed listings of their ongoing games. These sites contain all kinds of information ranging from news about teams and players, schedules and odds to statistics and betting advice. You can learn a lot from these sites, which is why many people prefer to place bets with them.
One of the most important areas of sports betting is choosing the right team or player. In order to make this wager, you need to know whether the favorite is well-liked by the crowd or the underdogs. The reason being the crowd tends to have a side in the betting process and place their bets for the favourite. The same applies to the underdogs; they attempt to exceed the favorites’ performance and try to take home the trophy. In a typical bet, the spread may be the difference between the actual value of a certain ticket and the one you bid for.
So as to increase your chances of winning on your sports betting wagers, you should employ reliable sports books. With regards to 온라인 바카라 choosing an online sports book, it is best to stick with those whose odds are within the casino’s favor. Although this doesn’t mean you should spend all your money at once, the better the odds, the more you’ve got a chance of getting a large amount of money back. Some individuals who have used this technique state that the return on the initial investment was greater than what they would ‘ve got if they had chosen the contrary. It also allows them to possess more selections on which sports books to utilize.
You also need to be alert to the volume of bets that you place. For example, if a player for a specific team is highly rated and you also place a bet for her or him, this might cost you more. The same goes for a new player on a team that is not popular; his popularity might play a part in the amount that you win or lose on your bets. For anyone who is confident about your bets, you have to stick to a smaller amount of bets. This will ensure that you don’t get stuck with large amounts of money on losing bets.
The second aspect of sports betting involves proposition bets. When placing a bet, it is common to choose several propositions that appeal to you. The two most typical choices are the underdog and the favorite. The underdog is the team or individual who is considered to be underdogs. This may mean a variety of things, such as a team that is extremely young or inexperienced, or one that has a bad defensive player.
Once you’ve narrowed down your alternatives to either the favorite or the underdog, you can then place your bets. Most punters prefer to place their bets into one of two pools: straight bets and spread bets. In straight bets, the primary purpose of the bet would be to try and make a profit. On the other hand, spread bets work in a different way. This kind of wager uses various mathematical formulas as a way to arrive at the odds for each game.
In order to place a straight bet, the punter must know the point spread for each game being played. When working with spread betting, it is important to remember that the bettor must know the total score for both teams. With this information, punters will then understand how much to bet using one team or another. The favorite and underdog in a sports bet are both subject to these standards, while the maximum amount a bettor can bet on each one is set by the bettor."About two years ago, I went to collect my husband from the ferry after work. My husband got into the car and as I was driving very slowly out of the car park we both noticed two people standing a few metres in front of our car. It looked as though they were strangers, older looking professionals, both walking to their separate cars in different areas of the car park. The man was reaching into his side bag and the lady was further ahead than the man, with her head turned to the right.
I know the exact positions they were in because they were completely frozen on the spot! My husband and I sat there watching the frozen strangers, not saying anything to each other and then all of a sudden it was like someone pressed play and the two strangers just continued on like nothing had happened. My husband and I promised to each other that we would never forget how weird the experience was. I can't remember exactly how long they stayed frozen like that but it was long enough to freak us both out!"

ECI EVENTS…..we make it happenI don’t want to unnecessarily pick on reporters, because they're overworked and underpaid and overworked. But the way this story was reported in the Star Tribune put the focus and blame on the victim:
The two pedestrians struck and killed Saturday night at an intersection in Ramsey were identified Sunday as a Texas couple in their 70s.Then the story starts to mention alcohol. Invariably, when you read an article about a bike or pedestrian accident, the article implies (overtly or implicitly) that the victims were culpable, intoxicated, or guilty of breaking a law.
John and Jean Nettelfield, 78 and 71, respectively, of San Antonio, were hit by a sport-utility vehicle and killed while trying to cross Hwy. 10 against a red light Saturday night, according to the State Patrol.
In this case, the paper offered a correction to an earlier report that had implied that the two elderly tourists were drunk. It turns out, they were just old and from Texas:.
Ideally, when tragedies like this happen, journalists ought to mention the role that road design plays in these accidents. Highway 10 in Ramsey is an incredibly busy freeway that’s almost impossible to cross. The place where the couple was run over has a hotel on one side and businesses on the other. Mentioning the lack of pedestrian medians or crosswalks, or the fact that people on foot are required to walk far out of their way to cross at a signalized intersection, or at least bringing up the rash of people being run over by cars would add a lot to a story like this. That’s the kind of context we need.
These cases don’t always have to be just about accident reports, either. The Star Tribune dropped the ball twice this month while reporting on the Park and Portland redesign issue. Otherwise sensible reporter, Steve Brandt, wrote two different articles on the redesign, both of which minimized the benefits of the plan for the neighborhood while over-emphasizing the inconvenience to drivers.
For example, Brandt’s piece on the public meeting on the Park and Portland avenue redesign didn’t fit with reports I heard about the meeting. The way he reports the story, it seems like a political battle between bicyclists and automobile drivers. The lede begins thus:
Opinions on restriping Portland and Park Avenues in Minneapolis to shrink the number of car lanes and give more space to bikes ran the gamut from praise to putdowns at a public meeting attended by more than 100 people Thursday night.
Attendees that I've talked to report a far more nuanced and positive discussion between cyclists, neighborhood residents, and others with concerns about safety.Attendees that I've talked to report a far more nuanced and positive discussion between cyclists, neighborhood residents, and others with concerns about safety.
"Who thought of this? Do they live in the city?" asked Monica Horning, a Bryant neighborhood resident opposed to the plan that would narrow the roadways from three traffic lanes to two and drop the speed limit from 35 to 30 miles per hour.
The more recent report on the details of road construction is only a slight improvement. The subtitle reads, “expect delays as the streets get shaved, repaved and restriped to improve cyclist safety.” That’s true, as far it goes, but it seemingly attempts to frame this story as a battle between motorists and cyclists, as if any improvements for cyclists come at the expense of car drivers.
This framing is misleading for at least two reasons.
First, the issue isn’t simply cyclist safety. A redesign of these streets will be safer for cyclists, pedestrians, and auto drivers. Park and Portland are badly designed for their neighborhoods. These are high-speed running through dense residential neighborhoods with a lot of children. Slowing the traffic down, reducing the number lanes, and calming traffic will improve things for everyone, particularly the most vulnerable (read: run-over-able) people. The new design will even make it safer for car drivers without really impacting the overall traffic volume of the street. It’s not a matter of bikes vs. cars. It’s a win-win-win situation, where everyone is better off.
Secondly, the current design is out-of-date and unnecessary. Brandt must not have been paying much attention at the meeting, because any traffic engineer would tell you that three lanes of one-way 40mph traffic on these streets is unwarranted. (“Unwarranted” is the traffic engineering term for “stupid.”) These streets were designed back in the 60s during the construction of Interstate 35-W, and in 2012 they’re obsolete.
Reading article after article where newspapers attempt to frame design debates into a “war on cars” is frustrating. It’s chum for the comment threads, driving traffic from the crucial “road rage” demographic. It’s also lazy journalism.
Whether its reporting on a bicycle accident in Dinkytown, a car running over an elderly couple in Anoka, or a re-designed street in South Minneapolis, our local press can do better. Reporting should not be a matter of blaming the driver or blaming the victim. Everything’s not a battle between nerdy bicyclists and angry drivers. Ideally, journalism looks at the bigger picture. We need to think about these problems in a way that allows us to see the alternatives, allows our imaginations to grapple with different priorities for our cities. Should we live in neighborhoods where you don’t have to be young and athletic to cross the street? Should bicyclists be able to listen to music and talk to a friend while they ride to class? Should children be able to walk to school?
As our metro boomers age, they’ll grow slower and easier to run over. These will grow in importance like a semi in the rear view mirror. We don’t want Minnesota to become the next Florida, where old people are run down at rates typically reserved for roadkill. (There was a recent incident there where a mother was charged with vehicular homicide for attempting to cross the street with her child from a bus stop to her apartment.) I’d like to see our journalists begin to mention street design as a factor in stories about traffic changes and pedestrian accidents. This really is the least we can do to honor the dead.
Update:
I guess it could always be worse. Witness this recent front page media frame from the DC Examiner:
2 comments:
Bill! Thank you for writing this. I've been waiting for someone to say this. The reporting of these issues is upsetting. The unnecessary deaths are even worse, and make me upset. Again, thanks for writing this. I'm going to Tweet it and post it on Facebook. Best -Nate
One more problem with the Park & Portland subhead: it implies that driving delays are due to the redesign for safety. In truth, the repaving had been scheduled for a long time, to replace old, failing asphalt. The redesign involves putting paint in different places on the new asphalt, which takes no more time than putting paint in the same places. If they hadn't done the redesign, you'd still see the same delays.
Being generous, maybe it was a poorly-considered attempt to cram both pieces of useful information ("expect delays" and "improve [cyclist] safety") into a small space. But whatever the intent, it still unnecessarily fuels the cars-vs-bikes fire.
(I rode on the repaved-but-not-yet-restriped Park Avenue the other day. Riding a bike on that busy street with no lane markings at all is fundamentally weird - I didn't even know which side to ride on! Hope the paint comes fast.)Metabolic Bodyweight Workout – Get a Fighter’s Physique!

Thread: A She-Wolf?
A She-Wolf name for a girl?
We always intended to honour both our maternal grandfathers when naming our children,
as they played such a great part in our upbringing.
So, when our first son was born he was named
William Arthur after my husband's grandfather.
Our potential second son would have been a
Benjamin Wolf after my grandfather.
Two girls later Eleanor Lillian and Penelope Eloise and we just found out that number 4 will be a girl as well, with no more children planned.
At first, I buried the idea of Wolf and just picked some 'pretty' names,
but now I wonder.
There are girl names that mean 'Wolf', like:
Orfilia (which supposedly is of German origin, but seems to be more popular with Latin-Americans)
Ylva (Scandinavian for she-wolf)
Ylwen (which I cannot seem to find anywhere online, but apparently means wolf-girl???? Can anyone verify that?)
Too far out there, or a great idea?

I say just use Wolf. If you want stick an e on the end of it to make it a bit more feminine: Wolfe
I posted a while back because I crushed on Wolf for a girl after using it in a BNG. I think where it would not work as a first name, using it as a middle name to honour a loved family member would be A-Okay - at least in my book anyway. Other less brash ideas: Adalwolfa: Feminine form of German Adalwolf, meaning "noble wolf." Adolpha: Feminine form of Latin Adolphus, meaning "noble wolf." Agwang : African Luo name meaning "wolf." Daciana : Romanian name derived from Roman Dacia, the name for the region that is today Moldova and Romania. According to Strabo, the Dacians were originally known as the daoi, from Phrygian daos, meaning "wolf." It is interesting to note, too, that daoi is the Gaelic word for a "wicked man." Guadalupe : From the name of a town in western Spain, from Arabic wādī al-lubb, meaning "river of the wolf." Lupa : Latin name meaning "she-wolf." Lupe : Short form of Spanish Guadalupe ("river of the wolf"), meaning "wolf." Lupita : Diminutive form of Spanish Lupe ("wolf"), meaning "little wolf." Otsana : Basque name meaning "she-wolf." Otsanda: Variant spelling of Basque Otsana, meaning "she-wolf." Ralphina : Feminine form of English Ralph, meaning "wise wolf." Ulrica : Feminine form of Middle English Ulric, meaning "wolf power." Compare with another form of Ulrica. Ulva: Swedish form of Icelandic Úlfa, meaning "wolf." Velvelva : Feminine form of Yiddish Velvel, meaning "wolf."
Hope that's helped a bit.Hakuna Matata * Ohana

I like Wolfe as an alternative option. I think most of the other options that mean wolf are "harder" sounding and not pretty anyway and by the time you move away from just Wolf it might be a waste. Lupita from the poster above is my exception to this. I love your other names and I hope you get to honour your grandfather.

When that happens, you’ll need to fill out a power of attorney form to give them the authority to access your records, tax information, and to act on your behalf.
While there are specialized forms that are just for taxes, there are also plenty of cases where you can use a general power of attorney form, or a state-specific tax power of attorney form to do the same thing.
These power of attorney forms are different from Federal IRS Form 2848, which is a specialized federal form for tax representatives. Form 2848 is usually the more powerful option, and a few states only use form 2848. This article is going to focus on the alternatives, but if you’re looking for form 2848, we’ve covered it as well. Or, if you want to read about power of attorney in general, click here.
There are lots of reasons you might want to use a state tax power of attorney. State power of attorney for taxes lets the person you designate access tax documents and may even allow them to file taxes on your behalf.
We’ll go more into what kinds of authority a POA will grant in a moment, though.
Tax POAs are relatively common, so don’t worry if you realize you need one. They can be helpful for anyone who knows that they will be very busy during tax season, especially if they might be out of the country on business or holiday.
It’s also useful if you have any upcoming medical procedures that might make it more difficult to fill out your tax forms. It’s important to consider if you have an upcoming surgery or are undergoing long-term treatments that can interfere with day-to-day life like cancer treatment.
It’s also common to use a state tax POA if you’re hiring someone else to take care of your taxes. Some tax professionals will ask for a POA or form 2848 before handling your tax information as an extra layer of protection for both of you.
You can also potentially use a tax power of attorney to bring in a tax professional to help if your taxes are audited, or if you have to negotiate terms of repayment on back taxes. Having a professional on your side can make the whole process much easier, and can help you find the relevant documents to get the best possible deal.
You may also want to consider a tax power of attorney if you’re dealing with multiple kinds of taxes, like taxes on your income and taxes on a recent inheritance. Anytime your taxes are more complicated than usual, it can be helpful to bring in a tax professional or qualified lawyer to help you fill out the forms and make sure you’re receiving the best possible return.
There are also several other forms that you may fill out in addition to your POA, but since generalized POA forms are more customizable than other options, you can add a lot of those powers and authorizations on the main form.
However, it’s important to make sure you check your state’s law about tax POA. Some states primarily use federal form 2848, while other states will have their own specialized kinds of tax POA or limitations on the kinds of power that can be granted with a tax POA.
One of the main advantages of using a POA form is that you can customize the kinds of authority you’re granting. You can also potentially use one POA for more than just tax purposes if you would like to make someone your agent or attorney-in-fact for other circumstances as well.
Like the specific form needed to be used, you’ll also need to check with your state’s laws to see if they require a tax-specific POA or if you can include other powers on the same form.
Depending on the state, you may be able to designate a wide range of tax powers, including but not limited to:
All of these powers are subject to local legislation though, so you may not be able to grant all of these powers if your state prohibits it.
With a general POA form, you can also customize what powers you are granting. For instance, your tax professional might not want some of the powers we’ve listed depending on what their professional policies are.
Or you can authorize someone to access your tax record and other tax information but not authorize them to sign or file your return on your behalf. That way they can help you prepare your taxes but can’t file them until you are available to look over the return and sign.
In some cases, you might need two different forms for your federal and state taxes, especially if your state is using a state-specific form instead of form 2848 or a generalized POA. Even if you can use the same forms for both sets of taxes you may have to customize the powers you are granting so that your agent can work on both sets of taxes.
That’s because your federal and state tax records are generally kept separate, and you’ll file them separately as well. Your state may also have a different set of regulations than federal tax regulations and will almost certainly have different tax breaks.
Having a tax professional on your side can help you determine what federal tax bracket you are under, as well as your state tax bracket unless you live in a state with a flat income tax.
No matter what your circumstances, having a tax POA authorized agent on your side can make tax season a lot less stressful.While based on the mission of the Red Hat Society -- a growing org founded in 1998 to celebrate women over 50 -- new musical revue "Hats!" is colored less in red than in bright and cheery pastels.

Åbo Akademi University, F1-20500, Turku/Åbo, FinlandHerpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is a major pathogen responsible for oral, genital and sight-threatening ocular infections which can be life threatening in immunocompetent adults and even more severe in individuals with compromised immune systems. Production of concatemeric DNA is an essential step for the generation of progeny virus as the packaging machinery must recognize longer-than-unit-length concatemers during encapsidation;however, the mechanism by which they are formed is very poorly understood.. We have previously shown that HSV encodes a two-subunit viral recombinase (UL12 and ICP8). Furthermore cellular DNA Damage Response (DDR) proteins have been shown by us and others to both positively and negatively influence the production of infectious progeny virus. The two subunit viral recombinase (UL12 and ICP8) interacts with several DDR proteins. It is now clear that DDR proteins function in at least four pathways, three that require some amount of homology (A-NHEJ, HR and SSA) and one that does not (C-NHEJ). We hypothesize that HSV navigates this complex environment to ensure the production of viral genomes that can be packaged into infectious virus. The central hypothesis is that HSV infection requires the activation of one or more of the homology dependent repair/recombination pathways and that viral proteins including the immediate early E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0 and the viral recombinase (UL12 and ICP8) act to influence pathway choice. Furthermore we suggest that the C-NHEJ pathway is inactivated by viral proteins in order to promote end resection and the homology dependent pathways leading to the formation of concatemers that can be processed into infectious virus.
In aim 1, we will determine which cellular pathways are activated and inactivated by HSV infection and the consequences of these actions.
In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that UL12 affects DDR signaling and directs pathway choice.
In aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that the structure of viral DNA depends on the repair pathway activated during infection and that in the absence of UL12, inappropriate pathway choice leads to the accumulation of structurally aberrant DNA. It is expected that this study will improve our understanding of the mechanism of viral DNA replication, provide information on the functions of cellular proteins important for genome stability and cancer biology and aid in the development of new antiviral therapies.
Herpes Simplex Virus Types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), are ubiquitous human pathogens responsible for oral, genital and sight-threatening ocular infections that can be life threatening even in immunocompetent adults. In individuals with compromised immune systems, HSV infections are often fatal. Our goal is to contribute to the understanding of mechanisms underlying replication of this virus and to provide information that will lead to novel and effective antiviral therapies.
Showing the most recent 10 out of 18 publicationsA new project aimed at increasing capacity and sustainability of cultural and creative industry initiatives in national economies has been recently launched by the African Caribbean Pacific (ACP) – European Union Programme.
The Project titled “Enhancing capacity for the sustainability of Cultural and Creative Industries in the Pacific”(Pacific CCI) is a 3-year project providing financial support, technical advice, mentoring and capacity building support to artists and cultural producers from the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Republic of Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.
The project is implemented by the Pacific Community (SPC) in partnership with the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) with financial contribution of the EU and support of the Secretariat of the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States.
As part of the first phase of the project, an open call for expressions of interest (EOI) was made on June 12 for creatives, artists, cultural producers, local businesses, national culture and art agencies and institutions from the ACP-Pacific region.
According to Dr Frances Vaka’uta, Team Leader Culture for Development from SPC’s Human Rights and Social Development (HRSD) Division, the Pacific CCI project seeks to increase the contribution and recognition of the culture and creative sector to economic revenue and commercial engagement in the region through a grant scheme.
“This project recognises that Pacific arts and culture are unique and can make a significant contribution to national economies while developing sustainably to safeguard cultural practices and traditions for future generations and supporting creative innovation” Frances Vaka’uta said.
“So far we have received more than 400 submissions following Phase 1 of the EOI process (which closed on 11 July) from 15 targeted countries including Timor Leste,” she noted.
Frances Vaka’uta also explained that the first set of grantees will be selected specifically based on the grant scheme priorities such as the creation of high-quality goods and services; improved access to national, regional and international markets; increased visual literacy education and improved access to sustainable financing and reduction in dependency on international financing arrangements.
She added that shortlisted applicants from the EOI process will be taken through information sharing sessions and a grant writing workshop before they submit their formal proposals for the grant scheme.
Associate Professor Verena Thomas, Team Leader of the collaborating team from Queensland University of Technology said that:
"This project is an opportunity to recognise the creative and cultural industries as key drivers for sustainable economies across the Pacific, to create stronger networks and to communicate the creative and cultural knowledge of the Pacific to the world. We are excited about working closely with artists, creative enterprises and institutions to explore our connections, share our experiences and learn from each other."

Joint Release
Division
Human Rights and Social Development (HRSD) DivisionDirector of IMMAF’s national federation in Spain, Antonio García Morales, recalls:
“If we look back several decades, it was at the end of the ‘90s when MMA arrived in Spain under the name of Vale Tudo and Valencia was one of the first Spanish provinces, if not the first, to begin its development.”
It was in 2012 when the Spanish Federation of Olympic Wrestling and DDAA (FELODA) under then president, Mr. Angel López Rojo and then technical director, President Mr. Francisco Javier Iglesias Serna, decided to incorporate MMA into its statutes. The sport was initially listed under ‘Combat Grappling’ since FILA (international wrestling) had it incorporated under this name at the time (under specific rules), and then later in 2015 as MMA (mixed martial arts) under IMMAF.
“In 2015, MMA achieved official sport recognition in Spain. Backed by the government under the CSD (Higher Sports Council), FELODA was granted authority over the national development of MMA and its structures as an Olympic federation.”
Today, Spain has the highest number of athletes (410) and coaches (47) of any nation to be using the state-of-the-art, IMMAF mobile App for training and grading in the IMMAF Technical Progression Scheme for MMA.
IMMAF Director of Development, Andrew Moshanov, reports:
“All provincial head coaches, across Andalucía, Baleares, Canarias, Cantabria, Asturias, Madrid, Castilla, Galicia, País Vasco and Catalonia are fully trained and certified by IMMAF and are ready to further roll-out the grading system in the regions.”
“We are delighted to be working together with a special department of the Spanish National Sports Council called the National Coaches School, directed by Mr. Javier Prieto and responsible for managing the program and requirements for training coaches. We are currently working towards the full alignment of national and international coaching programs.”
Alongside the technical progression scheme, which is accessible to all participants of MMA, the Spanish federation has also evolved a competitive pathway.
Antonio García Morales elaborates:
“MMA competitions in Spain are structured to provide selections for national championships, the winners of which go on to represent the country in IMMAF’s international tournaments. As members of the national team, the selected athletes’ expenses are paid by FELODA and they can formally register as high-performance athletes with all the benefits that this entails.”," Sharks general manager Doug Wilson told the Mercury News. "The evaluation will continue from there."
Lapierre, a ninth-year NHL veteran in his first season with the Blues, told reporters in St. Louis that he tried to phone Boyle to apologize, but there was no.".”
In closing, this year’s LowriderFest show was a success for both the event promoters, as well as the Lowrider community. We are definitely looking forward to checking out next year’s show; it’s always a good time in San Diego!.

According to the Washington Post, federal agents pressed the Clinton insider in December 2016 over how and why Hillary’s classified emails were forwarded to her husband’s personal computer; violating strict protocols surrounding the transmission of top-secret information.
The bureau officially concluded its investigation into Hillary’s email scandal in November; a full month before meeting with Abedin.
“The FBI interviewed top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin around the holidays last winter — more than a month and a half after the politically charged investigation into Clinton’s email practices had seemed to conclude for a second time,” writes the Post.
“The interview is important, though, because it shows that even after the bureau had intimated publicly that its probe into Clinton was over, the FBI knew it still had work to do with one of her close aides,” the article adds.
FBI MYSTERY DEEPENS: DOJ Officials Weighed Giving HUMA ABEDIN IMMUNITY After Hillary Probe
Federal.
Congressional leaders disclosed even more anti-Trump text messages this week exchanged between senior FBI agent Peter Strzok and DOJ lawyer Lisa Page; showing the duo weighed granting longtime Clinton insider Huma Abedin “immunity” should she speak with a Grand Jury regarding the former Secretary of State’s mishandling of classified material.
“Talked with DoJ about HA interview,” Strzok texted in Dec 2016 -a full month after the FBI decided not to indict Clinton for her use of a private email server.
 it up the chain,” he added.
According to the Daily Caller, the initials ‘HA’ were used in previous exchanges to refer to senior Clinton advisor Huma Abedin, while Gj likely refers to ‘grand jury.’
DOJ Searching Trove of Texts from Anti-Trump Agent
The Department of Justice is rummaging through “over 10,000 texts” between the FBI agent recently demoted from Robert Mueller’s investigation for his “anti-Trump bias” and his counterparts at the special counsel’s office.
DOJ officials tell Fox News they’re currently sifting through 10,000 text exchanges to determine the extent of Strzok’s bias, and whether his personal opinions of President Trump impacted his ability to impartially conduct his investigation.
Peter Strzok was secretly re-assigned to the FBI’s Human Resources Department earlier this year after Robert Mueller was informed of his Trump-hating text exchanges with other investigators.
The revelation of anti-Trump operatives inside the special counsel’s office prompted an immediate response from GOP leaders and officials; questioning Mueller’s ability to properly investigate allegations of Russian-Trump collusion throughout the 2016 presidential race.
They’re not the only ones.
The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board published a scathing op-ed piece on Thursday, citing the text exchanges and other mistakes as irreparably damaging the special counsel’s office and demanding Mueller’s immediate resignation from the investigation.Mitt Romney certainly has a lot of faith in America’s influence in the Middle East.
During Monday night’s debate, he seemed confident he could end Islamic militancy. It sounds so easy. The United States simply has to “put in place” a “robust strategy to help the world of Islam and other parts of the world reject this radical, violent extremism.”
Why hadn’t anyone thought of that before? I’ll tell you why — because it’s hopelessly naive, like so many of Romney’s foreign-affairs positions.
Take Pakistan, for example. The U.S. has been wrestling with Pakistani governments since 2001. But Pakistan is a hopelessly failed state, home to the Taliban, al-Qaeda and the Haqqani terror network -- as well as a rogue intelligence service and a wholly ineffectual government. What’s more, Pakistanis by and large loathe and resent the United States.
No problem, Romney said. Once again, he argued, the U.S. is simply “going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move toward a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.”
Why didn’t we think of that before? The truth is, since 2001 the U.S. has given Pakistan more than $20 billion in aid, which Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs describes as “U.S. taxpayers funding Pakistani corruption.”
But Romney offered a thought about that, too. “We should key our foreign aid” to “make sure we push back” and condition aid on results. Want to make that part of the world hate and resent us even more? That’s the formula -- constantly sticking our noses into their business and threatening to cut off aid if the countries don’t behave as we demand.
He was equally optimistic about Syria. The U.S. should arm the Syrian rebels, “but make sure” the arms “don’t get into the wrong hands.” Once again, that’s something a dozen states have already tried to do. The problem is, there no clear central authority among the rebels.
The rebellion is a melange of Syrian army defectors, angry Syrian citizens and foreign terrorists. It’s almost impossible for anyone donating weapons to know who is actually taking them. If a dozen foreign intelligence services have been unable to make this distinction over the last year, why does Romney think suddenly he could do better? That’s hopelessly naive once again.
Truth be told, President Obama’s strategy toward Syria is failing. For months now, the administration has been urging Arab states to limit the kinds of weapons they provide the Syrian rebels: just small arms — rifles, hand grenades and the like. The idea is to keep heavy weapons out of al-Qaeda’s hands. The principal arms suppliers, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are complying.
But in fact, because of that the conflict is locked in stalemate. That’s why it’s now reaching toward its 20th month. That’s why close to 30,000 Syrians are dead. And another result of American policy is that, while the stalemate drags on, more and more Islamic jihadists are flooding into the country.
A few months ago, Romney charged Obama with a “policy of paralysis” in Syria and vowed to give the rebels anti-aircraft launchers and other heavy weapons. But Tuesday night he simply called for the impossible: Sort out the rebels and give arms only to the “good” ones.
But of course that’s hardly the first time Romney has changed his position. Monday night he chastised the president, demanding to know: “Are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement” since Obama took office. He seems to have forgotten what he told those wealthy donors on this issue earlier this year: “You recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem” so “we sort of live with it, and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen.”
His debate homily about the American auto industry, while not a direct foreign-affairs issue, is all too typical.
“I’m a son of Detroit,” he said, so he certainly could not have argued against a bailout of the industry four years ago, as Obama charged.
Well, then how does he explain this statement from a 2008 New York Times op-ed: “If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye.”
Romney tried to explain it away a few months ago.
“I pushed the idea of a managed bankruptcy,” he said. “So I’ll take a lot of credit for the fact that this industry has come back.”

THRIVE: Timely Health Indicators using Remote Sensing & Innovation for the Vitality of the Environment
Blog post in the Modern Network
Earth observations have been used for decades to benefit society. The Veterans Administration (VA) is the country’s largest health care provider, caring for seven million veterans. The project is aimed at enhancing the VA decision support tools in the area of public health and air quality utilizing multiple NASA Satellite and Earth Science Model Products. This environmental information will be integrated with the VA’s Decision Support Systems.
The project is based on a close collaboration with the VA to provide a three-fold enhancement of the existing VA decision support, namely:
- Personalized Health Alerts for Patients in the existing MyHealtheVet tool.
- New Tool for Logistical Planning for Emergency Rooms and Clinics.
- Improved Diagnosis Tools for Physicians.
We learn from the past to inform the future by using machine learning to determine the mapping from historical VA hospital admissions (all ICD codes) and prescriptions over the last decade to the environmental data provided by a suite of NASA products. The key goal is the sustained routine use of the NASA products beyond the end of this project.
The proposition being developed and tested is that global daily high resolution air quality data delivered as a web service is of tremendous measurable value for multiple application verticals in a suite of decision support tools. The daily data products derived from a suite of NASA datasets using machine learning will allow provision of proactive health care by the country’s largest health care provider, the VA, and proactive policy making and environmental reporting for the municipality of San Leandro, CA.
We will utilize the UTD Innovative Virtual Platform for Research Collaboration and Application (a state of the art telepresence facility) to have regular videoconferences with our partners across the country.

Renewable Energy will Increase Security and Lower Geopolitical Risk
Plant Engineering Magazine October 2021
By Avery Ruxer Franklin
The transition to renewable energy will make the U.S. energy supply significantly more secure not only by decreasing the mining and materials required to build fossil fuel systems, but also by avoiding the political risks that threaten fossil fuel supply chains, according to new research from Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.
The report, “More transitions, less risk: How renewable energy reduces risks from mining, trade and political dependence,” is authored by Jim Krane, the Wallace S. Wilson Fellow for Energy Studies at the Baker Institute, and graduate fellow Robert Idel. They explain that, contrary to popular discourse on the subject, a transition from coal to wind would dramatically decrease the need for mined materials.
“Since transition technologies, with their smaller trade and profit attributes, are supplanting the far larger fossil fuel industry, the rise in ‘energy security’ alarmism may stem from a wish to maintain the more profitable status quo,” the authors wrote.
Renewables will certainly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but the authors argue analysts and policymakers have paid less attention to the transition’s other benefits. By moving away from the old energy system, the U.S. won’t necessarily have to dedicate so much of its expensive military resources to protecting oil-producing countries and shipments of fossil fuels. In contrast, renewable energy infrastructure requires only upfront mining and trade during construction.
Krane and Idel compare quantities of mined and traded materials required by renewable systems with those of fossil fuels. Their report also explores the risks an energy transition imposes upon the continuity of the U.S. energy supply.
They examine a hypothetical coal-to-wind shift in the Texas electricity market, finding that the mining required to build and install sufficient wind capacity to generate an average of 1 gigawatt per hour for 20 years is equal to the amount of coal mining required to generate the same amount of electricity for less than four years. This includes extracting ores and moving earth in the mining and refining process.
“Over two decades, five times more power would be produced by mining an equivalent amount for wind rather than coal,” the authors wrote. “Since transition materials requirements are so comparatively small, reduced international trade volumes mean a large measure of political risk falls away. Current practices for securing energy systems that require constant fuel deliveries thus offer little relevance for renewables.”
The mining and production of materials needed for wind power infrastructure requires significantly less work. Even if the world increased twelvefold the annual global production of all of the so-called “transition metals” such as lithium, cobalt, rare earths and copper — the materials that make building wind power infrastructure possible — those produced metals would compare to just 3% of 2020 world coal production. And renewable systems depend on trade only to acquire manufactured components and raw materials for making those components, according to Krane and Idel.
“Once the system is operating, no trade is required to sustain it,” they wrote. “Therefore, renewable energy production is not exposed to the political risks and other problems that plague fossil fuel production and shipments, such as interdiction, embargo, civil war, labor actions and other disruptions. Waning dependence on the global fossil fuel trade thus reduces threats to the continuity of energy supplies, a substantial benefit for importing countries.”
The authors added that “security requirements for ‘fuel intensive’ energy systems based on constant supply of combustible commodities are far more onerous, expensive and risk-prone than protection for ‘capital intensive’ renewable systems based on long-lived equipment that harvests energy from sunlight and currents of air and water.”
Under renewable systems, consumers also won’t have to depend on fuels shipped over supply lines that must remain uninterrupted at all costs, Krane and Idel argue.
“Fossil fuel supply chains may stretch for thousands of miles over land and sea, facing constant risks from technical systems failure, human intervention and natural phenomena. These supply chains are enormous,” they wrote. “Trade in oil, gas and coal — shipped around the world in massive quantities every hour of every day — represent between 5% and 10% of total international trade by value, while crude oil, gas and petroleum products amounted to 29% of all seaborne trade tonnage in 2017. Even a small failure can have extreme consequences.”
Energy security concerns will not completely disappear, and renewable power sources still have intermittent generation problems to overcome, but Krane and Idel argue that risks to the continuity of the U.S. energy supply will dissipate as renewables assume a greater share of the energy mix.Performance exclusions

This morning US FIRST announced the design of the competition during the 2011 season. FIRST is an organization that encourages students (K-12 & Highschool) to engage in engineering challenges, such as building robots to develop their analytical / engineering skills. A FIRST team is required to provide all their own support to launch a successful entry. This implies that they need to organize a team, do fundraising to sustain their effort, develop a team website, design a robot, deploy it for the competition, do public relations work to promote their project and preferably do community outreach.
The competitions are designed to have groups of 3 teams compete another group of 3 teams. As part of a game the robot is required to initially do autonomous operation and subsequently it can be tele-operated. The design of the game is each year announced by early January. The teams then have 6 (six!) weeks to design their robot, built it, program it and test it. They are then shipped off the regional competitions. It is a major challenge to design these robots in minimum time and make them robust enough for participation in a significant number of matches. The teams are judged on aspects such as team spirit, sustainability, web design, outreach, … and the bots are judged on engineering inspiration, design, quality, … so there are many aspects to consider in the operations of a team and in the design of a new robot.
This years competition is termed – LOGOmotion – The robots are required to collect “rings” in different colors and mount them on a wall – preferably in the shape of the FIRST logo. At the end of a match they teams are encouraged to launch a mini-robot that can climb a pole to light up a marker. The mini-robots are to be built from parts from the FIRST FTC game. Teams that mentor an FTC teams thus have a serious advantage, and as such there is a promotion of broader engagement in the community. It is going to be very interesting to see how the teams approach this years challenge.
As usual the Georgia FIRST launch was hosted at Georgia Tech and had massive participation with more than 500 people in participation and more than 30 new rookie teams. The Peachtree Regional will take place 17-19 March 2011 at the Gwinett Center. More details at the Georgia FIRST web siteAlleged Bank Robbery Ends With Car Crash Into Home
(Photo Credit/Ed Campbell)
GARDEN CITY (WWJ) – A wild scene in one Garden City neighborhood as a pickup truck being chased by police crashes into a house.
The driver of the truck allegedly robbed a bank near Merriman and Warren.
The man eventually lost control and hit a tree, then slammed into the front of a house on Harrison street reports WWJ’s Stephanie Davis.
“We intercepted him and a pursuit followed – up and down several streets … he attempted to make a turn and hit the house and the tree,” said Chief Robert Muery.
Ed Campbell saw the chase as he stopped at an intersection: “I looked back at my daughter and I just said, “this is why you stop at stop signs,” and then the officers were right behind him. When we looked (the other way) the police had the street blocked – that’s why he hooked that left and he hit that tree.”
Reports say that the suspect fired off shoots at officers, missed, then tried again, but his gun jammed.
The suspect said if his gun hadn’t jammed, it would have been ‘on’ according to police.
The driver was arrested and the stolen money was recovered.Kobe Bryant said he’s not surprised to hear reports Carmelo Anthony may want to make Los Angeles his permanent workplace this summer, playfully taking a shot at the frigid New York weather.
Bryant, speaking before the Knicks’ routine 110-103 matinee victory at the Garden, said he spoke to Anthony Friday to congratulate him on topping Bryant’s Garden scoring record by putting up 62 points.
Anthony added 35 to the mix in Sunday’s win over the injury-ravaged Lakers, with Bryant sitting on the bench with a left-knee injury and unable to go mano-a-mano versus Anthony.
But Bryant said he wouldn’t mind giving Anthony advice on his free agency eventually. The Lakers should have cap space to sign a player to a maximum contract.
“Everybody wants to play in Los Angeles,’’ Bryant said in a pregame press conference. “New York’s a beautiful place, don’t get me wrong but it’s colder than [expletive] out here. Palm trees and beaches obviously is more appealing. But all jokes aside, I think that players, when that time comes, they have to make the best decision for them and their families. I try not to think about it too much. If he wants to call me for advice later, I’d be more than happy to give it to him.’’
Anthony countered after the game when told of Bryant’s remarks about palm trees and the stark New York weather.
“I love the snow,’’ said Anthony, who shot 14 of 31. “I played in Syracuse where you get 25 inches.’’
Anthony said Saturday — the day after his 62 had topped Kobe’s 61-point Garden record — was a day for relaxing and watching the snow fall.
“Yesterday was sleep, I was resting,’’ Anthony said. “I was really tired [Saturday]. I chilled in the house. It snowed a little bit. I got a chance to look at the view and relaxed.’’
At halftime Sunday, Bryant and Anthony could be seen chatting it up. They are good friends and have been U.S. Olympic teammates twice. But Anthony would have to take $32 million less under the rules of the collective bargaining agreement to sign with the Lakers, who have fallen into an abyss at 16-29.
The two players may or may not have been talking about the weather.
“I can’t give you everything [we say],’’ Anthony said. “A lot of times it’s just quote unquote, shooting the [expletive], having fun, laughing and joking. It’s not always business we talk about. Just having fun, laughing, catching up.’’
Bryant said he got a lot of advance notice Anthony was stalking his Garden scoring record, set Feb. 2, 2009.
“I got a lot of messages from people saying he’s going after your record tonight,’’ said Bryant, who could return after the All-Star break. “It’s amazing. He went to work, got hot and didn’t cool off.’’
Bryant said it was a nice mark to have, but isn’t upset his buddy owns it now. However, he got in a little dig, saying: “If I was a competitor I’d say Melo has more opportunities to set a Garden record than I did. But I’m not a competitor so I won’t say that.
“Of course I called him that same night just to congratulate him and to say today you can cool off,’’ Bryant added. “[Sunday] he can afford to go 2 for 40.’’
That didn’t happen, of course. But despite Anthony’s 97 points in two games, he is suffering through a miserable 17-27 season.
Anthony already carries the stigma he only has advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs twice in his 10 seasons. However, Anthony has never missed the playoffs and the Knicks currently are two games out of the eighth seed.
Bryant appeared to send a signal Anthony isn’t going to want to stay in a place where he can’t win a title.
“It’s important for the organization to understand the level of competitiveness that you have, that you won’t tolerate having a team that’s not in contention for an NBA championship, which is what I did,’’ Bryant.”
Bryant understands Anthony’s predicament he doesn’t want to be known just as a great scorer but a champion.
“He’s a great player just like the rest of them,’’ Bryant said. .’’
Can Kobe convince Carmelo to go to the Lakers?
Let's hope so.just for the pure entertainment of it all. they should sign Russel Westbrook to complete the Trifecta of BallhogsFamily Travel: Drive-In Movies with Kids

The final penalty for a former Brazos County Court at Law judge has come, more than a year after he was first punished.
Randy Michel has been ordered to pay $400 for attorneys' fees and expenses related to the State Bar of Texas' investigation.
In December of 2005 Michel pleaded guilty to abuse of official capacity.
He was ordered to pay $4,000 and a fine of more than $13,000 to be shared with colleague and lawyer Patricia Bonilla Harrison.
Michel and Harrison were accused of speaking behind closed doors about a case involving a 2002 car accident, a case Michel was behind the bench for, and that Harrison was an attorney for.
Harrison pleaded guilty to improper influence also in 2005, for accusations of having illegal conversations with Michel.
She has also received a public reprimand from the state bar and has also been ordered to pay $400.
T. Gerald Treece with the South Texas College of Law in Houston said the fee may be light, because the state bar did not have to do a lot of work.
He also said the reprimand could have been worse.
"The least punishment you can get is, assuming you are guilty and you are to be punished, is a private reprimand," Treece said. "The next step up is a public reprimand, together with discretionary costs of attorneys' fees and so forth. Above that you could have a suspension or a probated suspension so it's sort of in the middle range of both."
Treece went on to say that even though the fee may seem light, Michel did not get off easy.
"This person had a triple whammy, so I don't think anyone can say he got off of anything," Treece said. "He got hammered from every front possible."
Both Michel and Harrison have within 60 days of the signing of the judgment (October 17, 2006) to pay.Now in a recent interview she was given the opportunity to speak for herself. "I am happy that the people in the LGBT community are now becoming legally respected and allowed to marry who they love," she said.
So it looks like the winners of American Idol OK with marriage equality is now two. Let's see if we can make it better. C'mon, Kelly Clarkson.

If You Really Want To Do Something...
How did the first week of 2013 treat you? We're a week in and I haven't started to focus on any of my goals. This is the first blog post I have started to write. I haven't run. I haven't read much. I haven't made the time to do the things I need to do to succeed this year. Many people (and the person I was for many years) would throw up their hands, become frustrated and give up because they couldn't get started doing what they needed to do. They would quit without even really trying. We can't give up that easily.
I could also make excusing about why I didn't do what I needed to do. Work has been crazy and I have been putting in ten to twelve hour days. Even on my days off, I get phone calls from work (the last time I didn't get a call or text from work was while I was out of the country). By the time I get home, I am usually fairly tired and want nothing more than to relax with my wife. Friends were in town for some of this week and we had guests staying at our house. There were other things I had to get done around the house.
All of that is true, but none of it really matters. There are tons of people who work more hours and still find time to start a business, write a novel, go to school, learn a language, write a successful blog, invent something or do any number of things that many of us don't. Many people have responsibilities, commitments and schedules that keep them amazingly busy, but they find ways to chase their own dreams and goals. There are people who are able to do way more with way less.
Don't accept the reasons you try to give yourself for why you aren't doing what you want to be doing. They are excuses and nothing more. If you want to accomplish a goal, you can find ways to do it. No one else is going to hold you accountable...you have to hold yourself accountable. Maybe you get up an hour earlier. Maybe you go to sleep an hour later. Maybe you just schedule time into your hectic calendar and stick to your appointments to run or read or write or learn. Do it on breaks at your other job. We can find a way to do the things we really want to do.
Are the goals you set important to you? Think honestly about them...at one point they were important enough to set as goals. If you are able to work on them, would you still want them as a goal? If so, then figure out how to succeed. Decide what needs to be done and then work on doing it. If you need more time to train or learn or practice, then make more time. You have control over your life, if you choose to take control. No more excuses. We can either make the time and put in the effort or we can give up. I know I don't want to give up. Do you?

An in-depth look at Thursday's 4-1 victory over Montreal
Thursday, 02.17.2011 / 10:55 PM MT / Cenovus Live In-Game Blog
By Ryan Dittrick - edmontonoilers.com
After ending his personal 14-game losing streak two nights ago against the Dallas Stars, Nikolai Khabibulin returned to the crease tonight looking for his second consecutive victory. The Oilers netminder stood tall, turning aside 36 of the 37 Montreal attempts he faced. Ales Hemsky scored twice, while Jordan Eberle and Ryan Jones added early third period tallies to provide the offensive catalyst in an entertaining 4-1 victory over the Canadiens.
With the triumph, Edmonton has now won two consecutive home games; a feat not achieved since the first two games of the season when the Oilers skated away on the winning side of 4-0 and 3-2 scores against the Calgary Flames and Florida Panthers respectively.

Greetings,.
Definitely worth hitting Trader Joe's for snacks during and after. It's located on East 14th Street near Union Square so you may want to coordinate the visit with your other activities. If you're into nuts, they have an excellent and rather extensive selection; last but not least, they are reasonably priced!
Enjoy your visit!!
for your batali fix, try LUPA for lunch. otherwise, i would suggest a relative splurge at GRAMERCY TAVERN. there is fine dining and the less expensive walk-in front section. very nice & no snooty there.
bourdain aint gonna lead ya wrong -- BARNEY GREENGRASS is totally worth it. go for breakfast.
for fun there is a new retro style automat on st. marks place aka e8th st (that's around the corner from the bookstore).
make sure to go to IL LABORATORIO DE GELATO on the weekend when traffic is closed & there is shopping along orchard st. have a glass of wine & a truffled egg & whatever else grabs you to eat at 'INOTECA.
enjoy your visit & report back!

Yup. Lexington and 51st Street. I don't know the area that well but I do know that Aquavit is around there. There's not much else of foodie-note around there. Midtown places often survive / do well just due to location...
> Baruch College of The City University of New York at 55 Lexington Avenue.
That's 24th Street and 3rd Avenue. You are very close to Curry Hill and a lot of the good places in and around Gramercy/Flatiron and Union Square, at different price points such as Tiffin Wallah, Chennai Garden, Roomali, Saravanaas, Shake Shack, Blue Smoke, A Voce. You'll find you get a lot more recommendations if you name the specific intersection, in general, BTW.
Re: Babbo. Did you try calling one of Mario Batali's other restaurants, like Lupa? Note that you can also dine at Babbo as a walk-in customer but that requires a bit more patience and planning, and it won't feel quite as special. But it is doable.
For your special night out...the cheapest tasting menus I know of are at Degustation and the red-hot and popular Momofuku Ko. Both are counter seating only (no tables) and rely upon an open kitchen where you can observe your food being prepared. Neither of those are French or Indian. However, the Ko reservation is next to impossible. Degustation is a definitely possibility, so call and reserve soon.
You might also want to consider some New American restaurants or those specializing in local ingredients, like Craft, Blue Hill, or Gramercy Tavern. My favorite is Gramercy Tavern It's pretty popular, so I'd call ASAP to make reservations. They have some of the best service in town. Do you have a maximum price point for your special night out?
Barney Greengrass is definitely worth a trip because it's very different from Katz's -- all that wonderful smoked salmon. It's old school NY. However, if time is a consider, you can easily get your smoked salmon fix at Russ & Daughters, which is very close to Katz's Deli. However, Russ & Daughters only does take out. You can easily choose a nice smoked salmon to go on a bagel with cream cheese and get it to go. At Katz's Deli, the thing to order is the pastrami. Go to both!
Il Lab is definitely worth a trip. Keep in mind that they close early, like around 6pm, so it's not a good after-dinner spot. Skip Magnolia, it's overrated, and the frosting is sugary-coma-inducingly-sweet. I always feel a bit sick after eating a Magnolia cupcake. If you want more interesting sweets and baked goods, though, try La Maison du Chocolat, Sugar Sweet Sunshine Bakery, Grandaisy, Kee's Chocolates, Birdbath, Abraco, Bouchon Bakery, Madeline Patisserie, or Batch, the Dessert Truck, the Wafels and Dinges truck....
TJ's and Dean and Deluca are fine if you're nearby, but the line to checkout at TJ's is always a mile long. Even the express line takes forever on a normal day! That's because there's only one TJ's in NYC. There's multiple Dean & Deluca's, but D&D is usually pretty expensive. It's a splurge snack for me there if I go. I get a few take-out items (usually from the meat or cheese or baked goods counters) and leave. For example, they carry cupcakes from Sage (who don't have a Manhattan retail presence) as well as iberico ham from Spain.
> amazing Mexican, Thai, Greek, or Chinese food either, particularly if any places are convenient to the hotel.
Manhattan is kind of weak on amazing Mexican and Thai, I can't think of any awesome Greek by your hotel, but you are rather close to the midtown location of Peking Duck House (can't speak to its quality as I've only been to the Chinatown one).

I haven't eaten at Serendipity but have seen some negative reviews. But in light of your girlfriend's wishes, I think Big Bad Lou would have a MUCH more pleasant trip giving in and going to Serendipity. It's just one meal/dessert.
About your Italian place, if you can't get into Lupa, you may want to give Otto a try. It's another Batali joint specializing in pizzas although their pizzas are their weak point. Their antipasti is really good (especially their vegetables). Their pasta isn't bad either. And the gelato is ridiculously delicious -- I think it's better than Il Lab. Bar Pitti is also not a bad place either if you want Italian.
Not Italian, but Batali also has a Spanish tapas place called Casa Mono. It's very hearty robust food. I love tapas-sized portions because you can try more things. And these tapas are pretty large compared to what you get at other tapas restaurants.>Number: 45202 >Category: pkg >Synopsis: pkgsrc-2011Q2 - lang/openjdk7 - Problem with JCE option >Confidential: no >Severity: non-critical >Priority: medium >Responsible: pkg-manager >State: open >Class: sw-bug >Submitter-Id: net >Arrival-Date: Tue Aug 02 00:20:01 /compile/GENERIC_MM i386 Architecture: i386 Machine: i386 >Description: When attempting to build lang/openjdk7 on pkgsrc-2011Q2 with option sun-jre-jce enabled, there is a message about downloading the Jurisdiction Policy Files, which is fine.

Hello from the other side, down in Tasmania, Australia winter has begun.
Yesterday I roughly cleared a 5x4m patch of knee high weeds, sprinkled a layer of goat manure and alpaca poo, wet newspaper around the edge for paths. I then decided to put thick old wool carpet to cover – the couch grass is relentless – thick Ropey roots matted in the top layer which I pulled some of… I then put 4 bed frames on top of the carpet and 3/4 filled them with bought green compost. Top layer home compost then have planted in garlic 2 beds, potatoes, and broad beans. I couldn’t wait you see, bc this is soooo exciting!!! Do you think this sounds ok? Will the manure under the carpet help to start to kill weeds and nourish the soil and attract worms?
So you are leaving the carpet in situ under the compost? As long as it is biodegradable I guess that will be ok but may take a long time to rot down so my only concern would be whether there is enough depth of compost on top of the carpet to allow adequate rooting. Should get rid of the couch grass effectively though. That’s my main enemy too! You could always do a trial and use carpet on half and cardboard on the other half. Good luck
Alastair
Thanks Alastair, a comparison trial is a good idea. Yes compost is deep enough but as you said carpet will take a long time to break down – it’s old woollen axminster, and therefore bed not in contact with earth organisms which isnt ideal but I’m doing this as well in another section of garden less weedy so I don’t feel so bad 🙂
My other concern is what has the carpet been treated with? Many, many moons ago I did some tests on tadpoles for the Environment Agency so see the effect on them of a then carpet insecticide dieldrin. It has since been found to be highly toxic to aquatic life and been banned as carcinogenic! Maybe anything in your old carpet has degraded by now but I would always hesitate to use them myself.
I’m also astonished that you can grow potatoes over winter as we have to start in the spring here. Maybe you have a milder climate or are growing them under cover.
Good luck with everything and have bountiful harvests.
Jan
Thankyou Jan. I’ve googled dieldren and its nasty stuff, doesnt breakdown easily so i’ll use polythene and cardboard for my other beds instead, is that what you’d do?, most carpet has been treated somehow..
Yes we can plant early potatoes here, from May-Dec..little frost, not much rain, averages 5-16C in the winter – crisp sunny days.

History of Sichuan Cuisine
Sichuan food served in China gets its name from a province of the same name in the southwest region. People native to China’s fourth-largest province tend to favor using spices and garlic as well as Sichuan peppers to give the dishes the mouth-numbing hotness they are famous for worldwide.
The reason the Chinese originally created the dish so hot was to have food available that kept them warm while keeping moisture and cold at bay. This makes sense considering the climate of Sichuan is damp, foggy, and muggy. While chili peppers are a mainstay of Sichuan food today, they did not exist in China until they received them as an import from the Americas in the 16th century. Some ingredients that original preparers of this dish used before chili peppers included betel nuts and ginger roots.
Most Common Ingredients in Sichuan Dishes
Those who wish to duplicate the taste in other parts of the world need to go shopping for some basic ingredients first. Chiles are the most common ingredient when making a modern Sichuan dish. They can be eaten fresh or cooked and then eaten dried, fermented, or pickled. The plumper and shinier chilies are called chao tian jiao while the milder and longer chilies are called er jin tiao. People east the second type most often in either the dried or pickled form. Other ingredients that make for flavorful Sichuan cuisine include:
- Doubanjiang: This is a salty and spicy chili paste made with soybeans and broad beans that have already gone through the fermentation process.
- Garlic: Along with chilies, garlic helps to give the dish its strong and spicy flavor.
- Pickled vegetables: Pickled and sour cucumbers often accompany Sichuan dishes. The art of pickling is popular in China and particularly when preparing this type of food.
- Red Sichuan peppercorns: The peppercorn is the ingredient primarily responsible for the numbing effect of Sichuan dishes. Although hot, peppercorns leave a lemony aftertaste in the mouth.
Examples of Sichuan Dishes to Prepare and Eat Outside of China
Westerns who are not accustomed to this style of cooking should first prepare vegetables that are both dry and fried. Green beans are a popular choice. Cooking them with minimal oil or even no oil will ensure a crunchy taste. The next step is to prepare seasoned water to poach the fish. The goal is to have soft-fleshed fish to pair nicely with the crunchy vegetables.
As for dishes to prepare, fuqi feipian is a cold appetizer with offal and braised beef covered by a fair amount of chili sauce. As a meatless alternative to fuqi feipian, chuanbei liangfen includes even more chili sauce along with clear cold noodles and jelly. Chung pao chicken, a classical favorite, includes chilis, peanuts, vegetables, and Sichuan peppercorns.
These are just three options adventurous eaters have to expand their palates and realize there is so much more to Sichuan food than the initial shock of the spiciness.SkinsCrunkin Posted November 14, 2005 Share Posted November 14, 2005 I'm not here to tell you Pierce is the best MLB in the game. That would be a bold lie, especially since the best MLB in the league IMO is Brian Urlacher. But how much did the loss of Antonio Pierce really hurt our defense? I'll be the first to say that the difference is tremendous. The difference I can see between Lemar Marshall and Pierce is astounding, and none of the differences are physical. Lemar may even be more physical than Pierce. The difference is how much he understands the defense. This guy knew Williams defense better that Williams himself if you ask me. I constantly remember him moving a DL last year to put them in the right position, or making hand signals checking into the perfect play. His understanding of the other team and the way our defense works was like having Greg Williams being able to stare down the offense right before the play. I watched the Giants game today and they showed how much film he watches before the game, it's absolutely astounding. They had Strahan saying how much Pierce watches film so that he can help put the DL in the right position. This would be huge for us because it seems like sometimes, we have people not lined up correctly and that is what we are lacking. I for one think that the loss of Pierce is the main thing hurting our D this year. Sure we have had some lackluster performances from some players. Especially, Walt Harris and Warrick Holdman, who I believe are killing this defense with their lackluster performances. But we are seriously missing Pierce and I just hope someone on the Defense steps up and tries to become what he was on the field for us last year. Maybe LaVar?? Nah, he likes being on the film to much, not watching it. HTTR!! Link to comment Share on other sites More sharing options...

Today will be a bit of a boring day – we’re working all day on the doors. I’ll strip, sand, fill and otherwise prep them, Fiona will do the painting.
I did what I could and left Fiona upstairs with primer and brush. While she was painting, I ground down the edges of the Hardieboard in the shower room (using a stone cutting disc in the angle grinder). The top three boards were slightly too long – I’d cut them all the same width and the wall they butted up to sloped in a little. It was a choking dusty job to cut the boards (even with a face mask). It was so bad that I just left the extractor running in the shower room to clear the air. It seemed to speed things up.
Peter cut me a piece of work top to sit on the top of the concealed cistern. yes, he was working on a Saturday. We have quite a lot of off-cuts (you can’t buy small pieces of worktop, so we had a lot left over). He has finished the hole for the sink – it’s a very neat job.
We finished quite late and, by then, the sun was going down. It was a warm, calm day, so we went down to the beach to watch the sunset. We had the beach to ourselves – it was gorgeous, we need to start living here very soon.

Rationale Behind the Combined Rankings
As you are aware, NHL Central Scouting produces a segregated set of rankings. That is, they are separated based on North American skaters and goalies as well as European skaters and goalies – four lists in total. I combined the four rankings from NHL Central Scouting by employing the following methods:
- Rounds One and Two: Took Bob MacKenzie’s January poll of scouts and inserted the player from the European or Goalie rankings where Bob’s poll suggested.
- Rounds Three and Onward: For the remaining rounds, I simply inserted 5 European skaters and 3-4 goalies per round based on the results of the 2013 draft.
The Surprises
NHL Central Scouting’s rankings always contain a few shockers. Here are some of the ones that stood out for me with reasons why Central Scouting could be right and, alternatively, why they could be off the mark.
OHL
1. Joshua Ho Sang – Down 6; 28 from 22.
- For: Undersized at 5’11, 175 lb. – Small players are generally the most vulnerable to sliding. Ho Sang started the season with the reputation as hard to coach and a puck hog. H did not overwhelm in the playoffs – 4 games, 3 points -10.
- Against: He worked hard with his coaches over the season on his team play. He won them (and me) over with his play after General Manager Warren Rychel traded his son, Kerby Rychel, to Guelph. Ho Sang willed the team into the playoffs with his team play and strong offensive efforts on the ice. Before the trade – 27 games and 30 points; after the trade 36 games and 55 points. This is a very high end guy whose skills and determination make his relatively small stature less of an issue.
- THW War Room Draft Projection: High to mid teens
2. Roland McKeown – Down 17; 36 from 19.
- For – Not overly large at 6’1, 197 lb.; inconsistent, could be more physical in his play. To have this guy at 36, you are saying to yourself that he does not have the qualities to be a power play quarterback for your team.
- Against – Good results: regular season – 62 games, 43 points, +38 (team leading); playoffs – 7 games, 4 points, +6 (team leading). In a year that there is a dearth of first round quality defensemen, I find it difficult to believe McKeown will somehow slip out of round one. With the big shot, his skating ability on the rush, his positioning on defense and his ability to play in all situations, there is just too much Duncan Keith likeness there to let him slip to the second.
- THW War Room Draft Projection: Twenties
3. Alex Nedeljkocic – Up 28; 82 from 110.
- For: It’s all about the size; Alex is only 6’0 and 190 lb. NHL teams are placing an increased emphasis on size for the goalie position. And if NHL teams are increasing their emphasis on size, NHL Central Scouting is doubling down on that emphasis.
- Against: The best results of any CHL draft-eligible starting goalie – 61 games, .925 save percentage on a so-so Plymouth Whalers team. A consistently good goalie whose mental toughness and physical skills make stand out from the pack.
- THW War Room Draft Projection: 2nd round
QMJHL
1. Nikolaj Ehlers – Up 12; 16 from 28.
- For: Undersized at 5’11, 162 lb.; like Ho Sang, small players are generally the most vulnerable to a draft day slide.
- Against: The hottest or close to hottest draft eligible player in hockey – 33 points in his last 13 regular season games; 20 in his first nine playoff games. He is just Mr. Excitement, the Electric Ehl, they call him. Drouin-like elusiveness, shiftiness, backhand; MacKinnon-like drive to the net, aggressiveness on the boards, hard shot from the rush.
- THW War Room Draft Projection: For me, way too much talent to not be in the top 10. Just for the record, while Drouin may be a better overall talent, Ehlers was the better player on the ice for at least half the games that they played together.
2. Mason MacDonald – Up 82; 42 from 124.
- For: The right size at 6’4, 178 lb. combined with great athleticism and reflexes; the foundation for a great goalie. Mason impressed everyone with his performance at the CHL Top Prospects game.
- Against: Has not produced the results expected of a second round goalie; playoff save percentage was .860; regular season .900. He was replaced by Julio Billia at the Ivan Hlinka tournament.
- THWWar Room Draft Projection: Unfortunately for me (unfortunately because we share the same last name and he plays the closest to my house of any CHL goalie – as the crow flies) he is more a third rounder as there are a few European goalies that I would take ahead of MacDonald.
3. Alexis Vanier – Down 43; 152 from 109.
- For: Slowed way down after mid-November; first 25 games – 24 points; last 36 games – 12 points. Foot speed while not terrible could use some improvement.
- Against: Size to die for at 6’5, 215 lb. Add the big shot on the power play, willingness to use the body and occasionally fight and you have the scouts drooling. Wondering about the decline in production as the year progressed, well, Alexis got injured (shoulder) during the Subway Super Series in November and seemingly never fully recovered. In fact, he had to shut his season down and miss the playoffs due to that injury.
- THW War Room Draft Projection: NHL scouts will do their homework and decide not to miss out on this behemoth – early to mid second round is the most likely outcome for this guy. However, in a year where there are so many small players, first round is still an outside possibility.
WHL
1. John Quenneville – Up 15; 29 from 44.
- For: 200 foot player. Decent size at 6’1, 182 lb. Hard to play against. Good playoffs – 9 games, 13 points, +4; decent regular season – 61 games, 58 points, +3.
- Against: In games, I have seen, Quenneville has never stood out in the way I would expect a first rounder should.
- THW War Room Draft Projection: A good player, yes, an NHL player, possibly; late second for me.
2. Reid Gardner – Up 14; 38 from 52.
- For: Hard worker, plays on the penalty kill, good shot.
- Against: Generically speaking, it would be unusual for an undersized forward producing .63 points per game to be picked by the early second round. Generally, the player would have to have at least one outstanding characteristic – fighting, skating, forechecking, shot etc. Exceptions, of course, could be made for players on powerhouse teams e.g. Halifax, London, Portland etc. where the player was limited to fourth line minutes because of the wealth of stars on the team. Prince Albert, unfortunately, is not yet one of those powerhouse teams. So, unless there is something I missed in my viewings of him, I am surprised with this guy’s ranking.What is even more puzzling about the ranking is that Gardner’s play deteriorated in the new year – 37 games, 34 points before January; 17 games and 10 points after.
- THW War Room Draft Projection: 3rd – 4th round.
- Editor’s Note (Chris): I’m somewhere in between with respect to Reid. He did impress me for the positive reasons noted above in a couple live viewings. He’s obviously no longer a sleeper pick as some scouts had pegged him earlier in the season.
3. Connor Bleackley – Down 5; 45 from 40.
- For: Has not shown enough offense to warrant more than a second round rating – 71 games, 68 points and +3. Does not have any outstanding skills, just good ones.
- Against: Most rankings have this guy in the 20-30 range. I feel he is a guy who most likely will end up in the NHL as a third line player who provides leadership, energy, a reasonable defense and some offense.
- War Room Draft Projection: While he could end up in the second round in a good draft year, the large number of small players at the end of the first round makes it unlikely that he would slip in this draft year. Call me surprised, OK, even, very surprised!
- THW Editor’s Note (Chris): Bleackley is a guy that has impressed me all year as well as scouts who I really value the opinion of. Where he tops out offensively at the next level is a bit of a mystery, but I have little doubt he succeeds at the NHL level.
Europe
1. Anton Karlsson – Down 51; 78 from 27.
- For: I know that I have always rated Anton higher than most but I honestly don’t know what NHL Central Scouting was thinking when they rated Anton as third round.
- Against: Size (6’1, 187), speed, grit and agitation. Point a game in the Ivan Hlinka tournament and the youngest member of Sweden’s WJC U20 team.
- THW War Room Draft Projection: In a year in which there a vast number of skilled smaller players, Anton is more the size and style that teams are looking for – early 2nd, maybe higher.
2. Ondrej Kase – Up 51; 35 from 86.
- For: Played against men in the top Czech professional league, playing 37 games with 7 points and a -4. Kase has high-end agility to make him elusive on the rush, excellent in traffic with a nice passing ability. Add vision and a wrister with a quick release and you have the beginnings of a pretty good hockey player.
- Against: Size – 6’0, 165 lb.; does not have the elite speed usually associated with successful smaller players. As with most junior players of his age, he did not receive a lot of playing time this year.
- THW War Room Draft Projection: For me, early 2nd is a bit of a stretch, I have him 3rd but he could hit late 2nd.
3. Sebastian Aho – Down 20; 68 from 48.
- For: Skilled rushing defenseman, excellent puck mover with a good defensive game. Good results: At U20, 27 games, 23 points, +11; in SHL (top Swedish professional league playing against men), 21 games, 5 points, -1.
- Against: Size – 5’9, 165 lb. A player this high in the draft at this size, you probably want the potential for more offense like Shayne Gostisbehere.
- THW War Room Draft Projection: I have currently have him as a 5th rounder but I expect he will go in the 4th.
The Likelihood of Success
In looking back at the 2003 to 2005 entry drafts, it is interesting to note the success rate for each of the rounds. By my criteria and calculations, here are the percentages:
- 01-15 – 82% (’03 – 93%; ’04 – 73%; ’05 – 80%)
- 16-30 – 76% (‘03 – 93%; ’04 – 67%; ’05 – 67%)
- 31-45 – 33% (’03 – 33%; ’04 – 7%; ’05 – 60%)
- 46-60 – 24% (‘03 – 33%; ‘04 – 33%; ‘05 – 7%)
- 61-90 – 24% (’03 – 33%; ’04 – 20%; ’05 – 20%)
- 91-120 – 19% (’03 – 10%; ’04 – 30%; ‘05 – 17%)
- 120-150 – 11% (‘03 – 10%; ‘04 – 13%; ’05 – 10%)
- 151-180 – 9% (’03 – 13%; ’04 – 13%; ’05 – 0%)
- 181-210 – 10% (‘03 – 17%; ‘04 – 3%; ‘05 – 10%)
- Over 210 – 12% (’03 – 13%; ’04 – 10%; ’05 – 15%)
- Overall – 23% (‘03 – 25%; ‘04 – 20%; ‘05- 23%)

Tuesday January 11, 2011
It's the news Michael Douglas' fans have been waiting to hear.
Five months after announcing he had throat cancer, the actor has said his tumour has gone and he thinks he's beaten the disease.
The 66-year-old made the remarks in his first interview since finishing chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment (pictured).
"The odds are, with the tumour gone and what I know about this particular type of cancer, that I've got it beat," he told interviewer Matt Lauer on NBC's Today show.
Doctors have warned him that the cancer could return, however, and that he needs to have monthly checks.

Before CLARK, Chief Judge, WISDOM, GEE, RUBIN, REAVLEY, POLITZ, RANDALL, TATE, JOHNSON, WILLIAMS, GARWOOD, JOLLY, HIGGINBOTHAM, DAVIS and HILL, Circuit Judges.
PATRICK E. HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:
We are asked to abandon physical damage to a proprietary interest as a prerequisite to recovery for economic loss in cases of unintentional maritime tort. We decline the invitation.1
* In the early evening of July 22, 1980, the M/V SEA DANIEL, an inbound bulk carrier, and the M/V TESTBANK, an outbound container ship, collided at approximately mile forty-one of the Mississippi River Gulf outlet. At impact, a white haze enveloped the ships until carried away by prevailing winds, and containers aboard TESTBANK were damaged and lost overboard. The white haze proved to be hydrobromic acid and the contents of the containers which went overboard proved to be approximately twelve tons of pentachlorophenol, PCP, assertedly the largest such spill in United States history. The United States Coast Guard closed the outlet to navigation until August 10, 1980 and all fishing, shrimping, and related activity was temporarily suspended in the outlet and four hundred square miles of surrounding marsh and waterways.
Forty-one lawsuits were filed and consolidated before the same judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana. These suits presented claims of shipping interests, marina and boat rental operators, wholesale and retail seafood enterprises not actually engaged in fishing, seafood restaurants, tackle and bait shops, and recreational fishermen. They proffered an assortment of liability theories, including maritime tort, private actions pursuant to various sections of the Rivers & Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 and rights of action under Louisiana law. Jurisdiction rested on the proposition that the collision and contamination were maritime torts and within the court's maritime jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1333.
Defendants moved for summary judgment as to all claims for economic loss unaccompanied by physical damage to property. The district court granted the requested summary judgment as to all such claims except those asserted by commercial oystermen, shrimpers, crabbers and fishermen who had been making a commercial use of the embargoed waters. The district court found these commercial fishing interests deserving of a special protection akin to that enjoyed by seamen. See State of Louisiana ex rel. Guste v. M/V Testbank, 524 F.Supp. 1170, 1173-74 (E.D.La.1981).2
On appeal a panel of this court affirmed, concluding that claims for economic loss unaccompanied by physical damage to a proprietary interest were not recoverable in maritime tort. 728 F.2d 748 (5th Cir.1984). The panel, as did the district court, pointed to the doctrine of Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Flint, 275 U.S. 303, 48 S.Ct. 134, 72 L.Ed. 290 (1927), and its development in this circuit. Judge Wisdom specially concurred, agreeing that the denial of these claims was required by precedent, but urging reexamination en banc. We then took the case en banc for that purpose. After extensive additional briefs and oral argument, we are unpersuaded that we ought to drop physical damage to a proprietary interest as a prerequisite to recovery for economic loss. To the contrary, our reexamination of the history and central purpose of this pragmatic restriction on the doctrine of foreseeability heightens our commitment to it. Ultimately we conclude that without this limitation foreseeability loses much of its ability to function as a rule of law.
II
Plaintiffs3 first argue that the "rule" of Robins Dry Dock is that "a tort to the property of one which results in the negligent interference with contractual relationships of another does not state a claim," and that so defined, Robins Dry Dock is here inapplicable. Next and relatedly, plaintiffs urge that physical damage is not a prerequisite to recovery of economic loss where the damages suffered were foreseeable. Third, plaintiffs argue that their claims are cognizable in maritime tort because the pollution from the collision constituted a public nuisance and violated the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899, as well as Louisiana law.
Defendants urge the opposite: that Robins Dry Dock controls these cases; that the physical damage limitation on foreseeability ought to be retained; and that plaintiffs stated no claim for "federal pollution," either as a nuisance or under the Rivers and Harbors Act. Finally, defendants reply that state law is not applicable to this maritime collision case and in any event provides plaintiffs no claim.
III
The meaning of Robins Dry Dock v. Flint, 275 U.S. 303, 48 S.Ct. 134, 72 L.Ed. 290 (1927) (Holmes, J.) is the flag all litigants here seek to capture. We turn first to that case and to its historical setting.
Robins broke no new ground but instead applied a principle, then settled both in the United States and England, which refused recovery for negligent interference with "contractual rights." Stated more broadly, the prevailing rule denied a plaintiff recovery for economic loss if that loss resulted from physical damage to property in which he had no proprietary interest. See, e.g., Byrd v. English, 117 Ga. 191, 43 S.E. 419 (1903); Cattle v. Stockton Waterworks Co., 10 Q.B. 453, 457 (C.A.1875). See also James, Limitations on Liability for Economic Loss Caused by Negligence: A Pragmatic Appraisal, 25 Vand.L.Rev. 43, 44-46 (1972) (discussing history of the rule); Carpenter,Interference with Contract Relations, 41 Harv.L.Rev. 728 (1928). Professor James explains this limitation on recovery of pure economic loss: "The explanation ... is a pragmatic one: the physical consequences of negligence usually have been limited, but the indirect economic repercussions of negligence may be far wider, indeed virtually open-ended." James, supra, at 45.
Decisions such as Stockton illustrate the application of this pragmatic limitation on the doctrine of foreseeability. The defendant negligently caused its pipes to leak, thereby increasing the plaintiff's cost in performing its contract to dig a tunnel. The British court, writing fifty-two years before Robins, denied the plaintiff's claim. The court explained that if recovery were not contained, then in cases such as Rylands v. Fletcher, 1 L.R.--Ex. 265 (1866), the defendant would be liable not only to the owner of the mine and its workers "but also to ... every workman and person employed in the mine, who in consequence of its stoppage made less wages than he would otherwise have done." Id. at 457. See also Societe Anonyme de Remorquage a Helice v. Bennets, [1911] 1 K.B. 243.

In Robins, the time charterer of a steamship sued for profits lost when the defendant dry dock negligently damaged the vessel's propeller. The propeller had to be replaced, thus extending by two weeks the time the vessel was laid up in dry dock, and it was for the loss of use of the vessel for that period that the charterer sued. The Supreme Court denied recovery to the charterer, noting:
.... (citation omitted). The law does not spread its protection so far.
275 U.S. at 309, 48 S.Ct. at 135. Justice Holmes did not stop with this delphic language, but with a citation to three cases added a further signal to his meaning:
A good statement, applicable here, will be found in Elliott Steam Tug Co., Ltd. v. The Shipping Controller, [1922] 1 K.B. 127, 139, 140; Byrd v. English, 117 Ga. 192, 43 S.E. 419; The Federal No. 2 (C.C.A. [1927] 21 F.2d 313.
Id.
The plaintiff in Elliott Steam Tug was a charterer of a tug boat who lost profits when the vessel was requisitioned by the admiralty under wartime legislative powers. In applying an indemnity statute that authorized recovery, the court noted that the charterer could not have recovered at common law: "[t]he charterer in collision cases does not recover profits, not because the loss of profits during repairs is not the direct consequence of the wrong, but because the common law rightly or wrongly does not recognize him as able to sue for such an injury to his mere contractual rights." Id. at 140. (emphasis supplied). In Byrd v. English, recovery of lost profits was denied when a utility's electrical conduits were negligently damaged by defendant, cutting off power to plaintiff's printing plant. In The Federal No. 2, the third case cited by Justice Holmes, the defendant tug negligently injured plaintiff's employee while he was working on a barge. The Second Circuit denied the employer recovery from the tug for sums paid to the employee in maintenance and cure. The court (Manton, Swan and Augustus Hand) explained:
It is too indirect to insist that this may be recovered, where there is neither the natural right nor legal relationship between the appellant and the tug, even though the alleged right of action be based upon negligence.
21 F.2d at 314.

The principle that there could be no recovery for economic loss absent physical injury to a proprietary interest was not only well established when Robins Dry Dock was decided, but was remarkably resilient as well. Its strength is demonstrated by the circumstance that Robins Dry Dock came ten years after Judge Cardozo's shattering of privity in MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916). See also Glanzer v. Shepard, 233 N.Y. 236, 135 N.E. 275 (1922). Indeed this limit on liability stood against a sea of change in the tort law. Retention of this conspicuous bright-line rule in the face of the reforms brought by the increased influence of the school of legal realism is strong testament both to the rule's utility and to the absence of a more "conceptually pure" substitute.4 The push to delete the restrictions on recovery for economic loss lost its support and by the early 1940's had failed. See W. Prosser, Law of Torts Sec. 129, at 938-940 (4th ed. 1971). In sum, it is an old sword that plaintiffs have here picked up.

Plaintiffs would confine Robins to losses suffered for inability to perform contracts between a plaintiff and others, categorizing the tort as a species of interference with contract. When seen in the historical context described above, however, it is apparent that Robins Dry Dock represents more than a limit on recovery for interference with contractual rights. Apart from what it represented and certainly apart from what it became, its literal holding was not so restricted. If a time charterer's relationship to its negligently injured vessel is too remote, other claimants without even the connection of a contract are even more remote.
It is true that in Robins the lower courts had sustained recovery on contract principles, but the Supreme Court pushed the steamship company's contract arguments aside and directly addressed its effort to recover in tort. The Robins court, however, pushed the steamship company's contract arguments aside and directly addressed its effort to recover in tort. The language and the cases the Robins Court pointed to as "good statement[s]" of the principle make plain that the charterer failed to recover its delay claims from the dry dock because the Court believed them to be too remote. Notably, although the dry dock company did not know of the charter party when it damaged the propeller, delay losses by users of the vessel were certainly foreseeable. Thus Robins was a pragmatic limitation imposed by the Court upon the tort doctrine of foreseeability.
In a sense, every claim of economic injury rests in some measure on an interference with contract or prospective advantage. It was only in this sense that profits were lost in Byrd v. English when the electrical power to plaintiffs printing plant was cut off. The printing company's contractual right to receive power was interfered with, and in turn, its ability to print for its customers was impinged. That the printing company had a contract with the power company did not make more remote the relationship between its loss of profits and the tortious acts. To the contrary, the contract reduced this remoteness by defining an orbit of predictable injury smaller than if there were no contract between the power company and the printer. When the loss is economic rather than physical, that the loss caused a breach of contract or denied an expectancy is of no moment. If a plaintiff connected to the damaged chattels by contract cannot recover, others more remotely situated are foreclosed a fortiori. Indisputably, the Robins Dry Dock principle is not as easily contained as plaintiff would have it. We turn to our application of the principle, its application in other circuits, and the tort law of our Gulf states before returning to the doctrine itself.

This circuit has consistently refused to allow recovery for economic loss absent physical damage to a proprietary interest. In Kaiser Aluminium & Chemical Corp. v. Marshland Dredging Co., Inc., 455 F.2d 957 (5th Cir.1972), the plaintiff lost gas supplies when the defendant negligently broke a gas pipeline. We held that because the interference with Kaiser's business was only negligently inflicted, recovery was precluded as a matter of law. In Dick Meyers Towing Service, Inc. v. United States, 577 F.2d 1023 (5th Cir.1978), we denied recovery to a tug boat operator for damages suffered when a lock on Alabama's Warrior River was closed as a result of defendant's negligence. We explained:
The law has traditionally been reluctant to recognize claims based solely on harm to the interest in contractual relations or business expectancy. The critical factor is the character of the interest harmed and not the number of parties involved.
Id. at 1025.
We denied recovery to the Louisville & Nashville Railroad for its loss suffered when the M/V BAYOU LACOMBE damaged a bridge that the railroad had a contract right to use. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. M/V BAYOU LACOMBE, 597 F.2d 469 (5th Cir.1979). We rejected the railroad's argument that its right to use the damaged bridge was a property right sufficient to support recovery, concluding that whatever its label, recovery was sought for loss of an economic expectancy. Id. at 474.
In Vicksburg Towing Co. v. Mississippi Marine Transport Co., 609 F.2d 176 (5th Cir.1980) (Politz, J.), we sustained recovery by an owner of a dock leased to another for damages to the dock caused by defendant's negligence. We asserted that the distinction between recovery by an owner when his property was damaged and recovery by others, as applied in Robins, Dick Meyers, and M/V BAYOU LACOMBE, was "meaningful, real and dispositive." Id. at 177.5

Nor has this circuit been the sole guardian of the Robins Dry Dock principle. Rederi A/B Soya v. Evergreen Marine Corp., 1972 A.M.C. 1555, (E.D.Va.1971), aff'd, 1972 A.M.C. 538 (4th Cir.1972), was a case factually similar to Robins. There the Fourth Circuit adopted the opinion of the district court that had denied on the basis of Robins a time charterer's claim for profits lost when his leased vessel was negligently damaged. An identical result was reached in Federal Commerce & Navigation Co. v. M/V MARATHONIAN, 528 F.2d 907 (2d Cir.1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 975, 96 S.Ct. 2176, 48 L.Ed.2d 799 (1976).
In Henderson v. Arundel Corp., 262 F.Supp. 152 (D.Md.1966), aff'd, 384 F.2d 998 (4th Cir.1967), the court applied Robins to deny claims by seamen for wages lost when the vessel on which they worked was negligently damaged in a collision. Courts in the First and Sixth Circuits have applied Robins in similar fashion. See, e.g., Hayes v. Luckenbach S.S. Co., 92 F.Supp. 684 (D.Mass.1950), and Casado v. Schooner Pilgrim, Inc., 171 F.Supp. 78 (D.Mass.1959) (seamen denied recovery of wages lost when vessel was negligently damaged); Complaint of Great Lakes Towing Co., 395 F.Supp. 810 (N.D.Ohio 1974) (dockworkers denied recovery of wages lost when dock was negligently damaged).6
The court in General Foods Corp. v. United States, 448 F.Supp. 111 (D.Md.1978), faced a situation similar to that presented to us in M/V BAYOU LACOMBE. A ship collided with a railroad bridge over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, forcing General Foods to ship by truck goods moving to and from one of its plants. Relying on Robins Dry Dock, the court denied General Foods recovery for these additional costs. The court discussed Robins, the decisions applying its rule, as well as decisions which assertedly undermined the doctrine and concluded:
Imposition of liability in the present case involves precisely the limitless type of liability which courts have consistently considered excessive for negligence. Neither the case law nor the sound policy considerations on which the decisions are bottomed support plaintiff's claims for its economic losses. Even assuming General Foods is a foreseeable plaintiff, "the law does not spread its protection so far."
Id. at 116.
Plaintiffs urge that the decisions in Petition of Kinsman Transit Co., 388 F.2d 821 (2d Cir.1968) (Kinsman II ), and Union Oil Co. v. Oppen, 501 F.2d 558 (9th Cir.1974), support their arguments that the Robins Dry Dock principle should be abandoned. We disagree. The policy considerations on which both those decisions are bottomed confirm our opinion that pragmatic limitations on the doctrine of foreseeability are both desirable and necessary.
In Kinsman "an unusual concatenation of events on the Buffalo River" resulted in a disaster which disrupted river traffic for several months.7 Because of the disruption, the plaintiffs incurred extra expenses in fulfilling their contracts to supply and transport wheat and corn. In a previous panel decision arising out of the same facts, the court had rejected the defendants' arguments that recovery by such plaintiffs should be disallowed because their injuries were not foreseeable. Judge Friendly stated that while "[f]oreseeability of danger [was] necessary to render conduct negligent," it was not required that the defendants envision the precise harm resulting from their conduct before liability could be imposed. Petition of Kinsman Transit Co., 338 F.2d 708, 724 (2d Cir.1964) (Kinsman I ).
In Kinsman II the defendants argued that the plaintiffs' claims should be denied because there was no cause of action for negligent interference with a contractual right. The court dismissed the claims, but did so on the basis that the damages were too remote.8 Thus, plaintiffs argue, Kinsman supports using foreseeability to determine whether their claims are cognizable in maritime tort. We think the opinion itself answers that contention. While rejecting any bright line rule, the court recognized that foreseeability was not a panacea and that limits on that concept should be maintained.
[I]t was a foreseeable consequence of the negligence ... that the river would be dammed.... It may be that the specific manner was not foreseeable in which the damages to Cargill and Cargo Carriers would be incurred but such strict foreseeability ... has not been required.
[Yet] ... "somewhere a point will be reached when courts will agree that the link has become too tenuous ..." (citation omitted). We believe that this point has been reached with the Cargill and Cargo Carrier claims....
In the final analysis, the circumlocution whether posed in terms of "foreseeability," "duty," "proximate cause," "remoteness," etc. seems unavoidable.... [W]e return to Judge Andrews' frequently quoted statement in Palsgraf ... "It is all a question of expediency ... of fair judgment, always keeping in mind the fact that we endeavor to make a rule in each case that will be practical and in keeping with the general understanding of mankind."
Kinsman II, 388 F.2d at 824-25.
As we explain in Part IV of this opinion, we disagree with a case-by-case approach because we think the value of a rule is significant in these maritime decisions. Kinsman II's general analysis of the problem, however, recognizing as it does the need for the imposition of limitations on recovery for the foreseeable consequences of an act of negligence, is compatible with our own.9
In Union Oil, vast quantities of raw crude were released when the defendant oil company negligently caused an oil spill. The oil was carried by wind, wave, and tidal currents over large stretches of the California coast disrupting, among other things, commercial fishing operations. While conceding that ordinarily there is no recovery for economic losses unaccompanied by physical damage, the court concluded that commercial fishermen were foreseeable plaintiffs whose interests the oil company had a duty to protect when conducting drilling operations. The opinion pointed out that the fishermen's losses were foreseeable and direct consequences of the spill, that fishermen have historically enjoyed a protected position under maritime law, and suggested that economic considerations also supported permitting recovery.
Yet Union Oil's holding was carefully limited to commercial fishermen, plaintiffs whose economic losses were characterized as "of a particular and special nature." Union Oil, 501 F.2d at 570. The Union Oil panel expressly declined to "open the door to claims that may be asserted by ... other[s] ... whose economic or personal affairs were discommoded by the oil spill" and noted that the general rule denying recovery for pure economic loss had "a legitimate sphere within which to operate." Id.10
In sum, the decisions of courts in other circuits convince us that Robins Dry Dock is both a widely used and necessary limitation on recovery for economic losses. The holdings in Kinsman and Union Oil are not to the contrary. The courts in both those cases made plain that restrictions on the concept of foreseeability ought to be imposed where recovery is sought for pure economic losses.

Jurisprudence developed in the Gulf states informs our maritime decisions. It supports the Robins rule. Courts applying the tort law of Texas, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana have consistently denied recovery for economic losses negligently inflicted where there was no physical damage to a proprietary interest.
In Rodriquez v. Carson, 519 S.W.2d 214 (Tex.Civ.App.--Amarillo 1975, writ ref'd n.r.e.), the plaintiff truck driver sued for wages he lost when his employer's truck was damaged by the defendant's negligence. The court denied recovery on the ground that there was no duty to the truck driver and explained its decision in terms similar to the Robins rule:
[W]e find no breach of a duty owed to appellant by appellee with respect to the injury, i.e., the absence of a truck for appellant to drive. If there were any obligation in this respect, it would arise by reason of some relationship or agreement between the appellant and his employer. The appellant did not suffer any bodily injuries, and in the absence of any showing that he had any vested interest in the truck he did not suffer any injury to personal property.
Id. at 216. Similarly, in Morse v. Piedmont Hotel, 110 Ga.App. 509, 139 S.E.2d 133 (1964), the court denied recovery to a plaintiff jewelry salesman who alleged that because the hotel had negligently lost his employer's merchandise--goods for which he was responsible--he lost his job and could no longer obtain insurance policies necessary for employment as a jewelry salesman. The court reasoned that such indirect economic losses were not recoverable where the plaintiff had no property interest in the lost jewels and thus refused to permit recovery for negligent interference with the salesman's business interests. In Ethyl Corp. v. Balter, 386 So.2d 1220 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 955, 101 S.Ct. 3099, 69 L.Ed.2d 965 (1981), the court stated that it was well-settled in Florida that there was no liability in negligence for interference with economic interests such as contractual or business relationships: "There is no such thing as a cause of action for interference which is only negligently or consequentially effected." Id. at 1224. The courts of Alabama and Mississippi also refuse recovery for wrongful interference with contractual or business interests where the offensive conduct is unintentional. See, e.g., Purcell Co., Inc. v. Spriggs Enterprises, Inc., 431 So.3d 515, 533 (Ala.1983); Cranford v. Shelton, 378 So.2d 652, 655 (Miss.1980).
The Supreme Court of Louisiana recently considered abandoning the Robins rule in PPG Industries, Inc. v. Bean Dredging, Inc., 447 So.2d 1058 (La.1984), where a customer of a pipeline owner sued a dredging contractor who negligently damaged the pipeline. The customer's claim was denied. The court explained Robins as based on a policy of avoiding multiplicity of actions and unforseeable extensions of liability. Id. at 1060-61. The court then used those policy considerations to conclude that under a risk-duty analysis the "moral, social and economic values involved" did not warrant extending a duty, and hence liability, to those who might suffer indirect economic losses from an act of negligence. The court did not purport to make a rule for every case, but did suggest that it was "highly unlikely" that indirect economic losses of third parties should ever be recoverable in negligence. Id. at 1061.
IV
Plaintiffs urge that the requirement of physical injury to a proprietary interest is arbitrary, unfair, and illogical, as it denies recovery for foreseeable injury caused by negligent acts. At its bottom the argument is that questions of remoteness ought to be left to the trier of fact. Ultimately the question becomes who ought to decide--judge or jury--and whether there will be a rule beyond the jacket of a given case. The plaintiffs contend that the "problem" need not be separately addressed, but instead should be handled by "traditional" principles of tort law. Putting the problem of which doctrine is the traditional one aside, their rhetorical questions are flawed in several respects.
Those who would delete the requirement of physical damage have no rule or principle to substitute. Their approach fails to recognize limits upon the adjudicating ability of courts. We do not mean just the ability to supply a judgment; prerequisite to this adjudicatory function are preexisting rules, whether the creature of courts or legislatures. Courts can decide cases without preexisting normative guidance but the result becomes less judicial and more the product of a managerial, legislative or negotiated function.11
Review of the foreseeable consequences of the collision of the SEA DANIEL and TESTBANK demonstrates the wave upon wave of successive economic consequences and the managerial role plaintiffs would have us assume. The vessel delayed in St. Louis may be unable to fulfill its obligation to haul from Memphis, to the injury of the shipper, to the injury of the buyers, to the injury of their customers. Plaintiffs concede, as do all who attack the requirement of physical damage, that a line would need to be drawn--somewhere on the other side, each plaintiff would say in turn, of its recovery. Plaintiffs advocate not only that the lines be drawn elsewhere but also that they be drawn on an ad hoc and discrete basis. The result would be that no determinable measure of the limit of foreseeability would precede the decision on liability. We are told that when the claim is too remote, or too tenuous, recovery will be denied. Presumably then, as among all plaintiffs suffering foreseeable economic loss, recovery will turn on a judge or jury's decision. There will be no rationale for the differing results save the "judgment" of the trier of fact. Concededly, it can "decide" all the claims presented, and with comparative if not absolute ease. The point is not that such a process cannot be administered but rather that its judgments would be much less the products of a determinable rule of law. In this important sense, the resulting decisions would be judicial products only in their draw upon judicial resources.
The bright line rule of damage to a proprietary interest, as most, has the virtue of predictability with the vice of creating results in cases at its edge that are said to be "unjust" or "unfair." Plaintiffs point to seemingly perverse results, where claims the rule allows and those it disallows are juxtaposed--such as vessels striking a dock, causing minor but recoverable damage, then lurching athwart a channel causing great but unrecoverable economic loss. The answer is that when lines are drawn sufficiently sharp in their definitional edges to be reasonable and predictable, such differing results are the inevitable result--indeed, decisions are the desired product. But there is more. The line drawing sought by plaintiffs is no less arbitrary because the line drawing appears only in the outcome--as one claimant is found too remote and another is allowed to recover. The true difference is that plaintiffs' approach would mask the results. The present rule would be more candid, and in addition, by making results more predictable, serves a normative function. It operates as a rule of law and allows a court to adjudicate rather than manage.12
V
That the rule is identifiable and will predict outcomes in advance of the ultimate decision about recovery enables it to play additional roles. Here we agree with plaintiffs that economic analysis, even at the rudimentary level of jurists, is helpful both in the identification of such roles and the essaying of how the roles play. Thus it is suggested that placing all the consequence of its error on the maritime industry will enhance its incentive for safety. While correct, as far as such analysis goes, such in terrorem benefits have an optimal level. Presumably, when the cost of an unsafe condition exceeds its utility there is an incentive to change. As the costs of an accident become increasing multiples of its utility, however, there is a point at which greater accident costs lose meaning, and the incentive curve flattens. When the accident costs are added in large but unknowable amounts the value of the exercise is diminished.
With a disaster inflicting large and reverberating injuries through the economy, as here, we believe the more important economic inquiry is that of relative cost of administration, and in maritime matters administration quickly involves insurance. Those economic losses not recoverable under the present rule for lack of physical damage to a proprietary interest are the subject of first party or loss insurance. The rule change would work a shift to the more costly liability system of third party insurance. For the same reasons that courts have imposed limits on the concept of foreseeability, liability insurance might not be readily obtainable for the types of losses asserted here. As Professor James has noted, "[s]erious practical problems face insurers in handling insurance against potentially wide, open-ended liability. From an insurer's point of view it is not practical to cover, without limit, a liability that may reach catastrophic proportions, or to fix a reasonable premium on a risk that does not lend itself to actuarial measurement." James, supra, at 53. By contrast, first party insurance is feasible for many of the economic losses claimed here. Each businessman who might be affected by a disruption of river traffic or by a halt in fishing activities can protect against that eventuality at a relatively low cost since his own potential losses are finite and readily discernible. Thus, to the extent that economic analysis informs our decision here, we think that it favors retention of the present rule.VI
Plaintiffs argue alternatively that their claims of economic losses are cognizable in maritime tort because the pollution from the collision constituted a public nuisance, and violated the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 and Louisiana law. We look to each in turn.
-1-
Plaintiffs seek to avoid the Robins rule by characterizing their claims as damages caused by a public nuisance.13 They suggest that when a defendant unreasonably interferes with public rights by obstructing navigation or negligently polluting a waterway he creates a public nuisance for which recovery is available to all who have sustained "particular damages." As defined at common law such damages are those which are substantially greater than the presumed-at-law damages suffered by the general public as a result of the nuisance. See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts Secs. 821B, 821C (1977); Prosser, Private Action For Public Nuisance, 52 Va.L.Rev. 997 (1966). Characterizing the problem as one of public nuisance, however, does not immediately solve the problems with plaintiffs' damage claims for pure economic losses. As Dean Prosser has explained, "courts have not always found it at all easy to determine what is sufficient 'particular damage' to support [a] private action [for a public nuisance], and some rather fine lines have been drawn in the decisions." W. Prosser, Law of Torts Sec. 88 (4th ed. 1971). In drawing such lines today we are unconvinced that we should abandon the physical damage limitation as a prerequisite to recovery for economic loss.
The problem in public nuisance theory of determining when private damages are sufficiently distinct from those suffered by the general public so as to justify recovery is as difficult, if not more so, as determining which foreseeable damages are too remote to justify recovery in negligence. In each case it is a matter of degree, and in each case lines must be drawn. With economic losses such as the ones claimed here the problem is to determine who among an entire community that has been commercially affected by an accident has sustained a pecuniary loss so great as to justify distinguishing his losses from similar losses suffered by others. Given the difficulty of this task, we see no jurisprudential advantage in permitting the use of nuisance theory to skirt the Robins rule.
Were we to allow plaintiffs recovery for their losses under a public nuisance theory we would permit recovery for injury to the type of interest that, as we have already explained, we have consistently declined to protect. Nuisance, as Dean Prosser has explained, is not a separate tort subject to rules of its own but instead is a type of damage. W. Prosser, Law of Torts Sec. 87 (4th ed. 1971). Our decisions under Robins have emphasized the nature of the interest harmed rather than the theory of recovery. As we noted in Dick Meyers Towing, "[r]ephrasing the claim as a public nuisance claim does not change its essential character." Dick Meyers, 577 F.2d at 1025 n. 4. Thus we conclude that plaintiffs may not recover for pure economic losses under a public nuisance theory in maritime tort.
-2-
Plaintiffs' arguments that the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act affords them an avenue of relief are foreclosed by Supreme Court decision. Plaintiffs suggest that both Section 10 of the Act, which prohibits the obstruction of navigable waters, and Section 13 of the Act, which prohibits the deposit of refuse into navigable waters, have been violated, and that such violations provide a basis for civil liability.14 In California v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 101 S.Ct. 1775, 68 L.Ed.2d 101 (1981), the Court held that the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act did not authorize private actions to be brought for violation of its provisions. Accordingly, plaintiffs' claims under the Rivers and Harbors Act may not be maintained.15
-3-
Plaintiffs also urge that their economic losses are recoverable as state law claims in negligence, nuisance or under the Louisiana Environmental Affairs Act of 1980. Because established principles of general maritime law govern the issue of recovery in this case, we reject these state law theories.
The claims all involve a collision on a navigable waterway of the United States and the resulting damages, and hence are within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the federal courts. See, e.g., Foremost Insurance Co. v. Richardson, 457 U.S. 668, 102 S.Ct. 2654, 73 L.Ed.2d 300 (1982). Under the Admiralty Extension Act our jurisdiction extends to the claims for shoreside damages as well as to those directly involving the waterway.16
It is well-settled that the invocation of federal admiralty jurisdiction results in the application of federal admiralty law rather than state law. See, e.g., Kossick v. United Fruit Co., 365 U.S. 731, 81 S.Ct. 886, 6 L.Ed.2d 56 (1961); Freeport Sulphur Co. v. S/S Hermosa, 526 F.2d 300, 302 n. 2 (5th Cir.1976). While our maritime decisions are informed by common law developments in the state courts, there is no requirement, as in diversity cases, that state law be adopted. Indeed the federal interest in protecting maritime commerce is often best served by the establishment of uniform rules of conduct. We believe that such is the case here. The Robins rule has proved to be a workable and useful tool in our maritime jurisprudence. To permit recovery here on state law grounds would undermine the principles we seek to preserve today. Accordingly, we decline to adopt plaintiffs' state law claims as theories of recovery.
VII
In conclusion, having reexamined the history and central purpose of the doctrine of Robins Dry Dock as developed in this circuit, we remain committed to its teaching. Denying recovery for pure economic losses is a pragmatic limitation on the doctrine of foreseeability, a limitation we find to be both workable and useful. Nor do we find persuasive plaintiffs' arguments that their economic losses are recoverable under a public nuisance theory, as damages for violation of federal statutes, or under state law.
Accordingly, the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to defendants on all claims for economic losses unaccompanied by physical damage to property is AFFIRMED.
GEE, Circuit Judge, with whom CLARK, Chief Judge, joins, concurring:
Both the majority opinion and the dissent do our Court proud, joining a few others on that relatively short list of truly distinguished and thoughtful legal writings of which it or any court can boast. Neither opinion, however, confronts explicitly what is for me the overarching issue in the appeal. That issue, a legal one only in the broadest sense and only implicitly presented, is perhaps best addressed in a brief collateral writing such as this will be.
The issue to which I refer is, who should deal with questions of such magnitude as the rule for which the dissent contends would, again and again, draw before the courts? An oil spill damages hundreds, perhaps thousands, of miles of coastal area. A cloud of noxious industrial gas leaks out, kills thousands, and injures thousands more. A commonly-used building material is discovered, years after the fact, to possess unforeseen lethal qualities affecting thousands who have worked with it. The long-term effects of inhaling coal dust are found to be disabling to a significant proportion of veteran miners. None of these illustrations is fanciful; each has arisen in recent times and presented itself for resolution to our body politic. Congress has dealt effectively with Black Lung; it has signally failed to deal with the ravages of asbestosis--a scourge, I suspect, far more general and widespread--and a swelling wave of individual asbestosis claims, to be resolved on a case by case basis, pushes slowly through our court system, threatening to inundate it and to consume in punitive damage awards to early claimants the relatively meager assets available to compensate the general class affected, many of whom have not yet suffered the onset of symptoms.1 It is my thesis that the dispute-resolution systems of courts are poorly equipped to manage disasters of such magnitude and that we should be wary of adopting rules of decision which, as would that contended for by the dissent, encourage the drawing of their broader aspects before us.
An exhaustive study of the deficiencies of applying a mechanism originally developed to decide who owns title to Blackacre, or whether it was Smith or Jones who ran the stop sign in his wagon, to the management of general disasters is beyond either the demands of this writing or the competence and available time of its writer.2 For today, a few observations and illustrations must serve.
I have already noted the probable consequences of attempting to compensate, on a case by case basis, the victims of asbestosis, a class temporally deployed across decades and comprising an open end extending no man knows how far into the future: the compensatory bucket may well be emptied by punitive damages and expenses of litigation long before remote members are even in a position to line up for a compensatory drink. Even considering compensatory damages alone for early claimants, compassionate juries--keenly aware that large percentages of any awards that they make will go for individuals' attorneys' fees and other expenses of their litigation--will likely insure that little of the limited pot will remain to succor late comers. Asbestosis and like disasters cry out for treatment by measures and procedures less limited than those available to such institutions as we.
For courts of their nature proceed deductively, reasoning from general principles to particular outcomes in individual disputes. This is so even where class actions are concerned, actions that can offer a partial, but only a partial, relief from the limitations of case by case adjudication, as the situation of the late-maturing asbestosis claims that I have instanced illustrates. Such a system as ours works tolerably well in the traditional case for which it was developed, where the stakes are limited to who owns the farm or to some other finite benefit. Its deficiencies become immediately and painfully apparent, however, when the consideration of factors inherently extraneous to the dispute becomes necessary or desirable to resolving it. Of these factors, perhaps the most often encountered is that of financial reality.
The limited resources available to compensate asbestosis victims are only a particular illustration of the intrusion of this factor. The more general problem arises whenever individual courts contemporaneously grant sweeping awards against the same entity, perhaps a governmental one, in unconnected causes. However just each particular award may be, the cumulative effect--produced by individual proceedings to which questions of fiscal limitations and necessary trade-offs are foreign and irrelevant--may be irrational. It follows that we should decline to adopt rules of decision which set ourselves such tasks, tasks that are of their nature beyond our competence to deal with justly. Because I believe that the well-intentioned rule advanced for adoption by the dissent is such a one, and that the rule of the majority roughly and approximately restrains us to matters within the competence of our procedures, I join in the majority opinion.
To the contrary of my brother Rubin's observations in separate dissent--with many of which I do not disagree--it is precisely the absence of "physical injury to a proprietary interest" that persuades me we should not embark on the course advocated by the main dissent. For it is just that indefinable which would engage us in the business of massive and general resource allocation, one which I have tried to suggest that we as courts are ill-equipped to conduct.
If the rule which Judge Wisdom espouses were one written in stone, I would be the first to enforce it by whatever means and procedures, inadequate or no, were available. That is not the question. The question is whether we should ourselves adopt such a rule and then proceed to apply it. My answer is that since I do not believe we are capable of administering such a procedure justly, we should not set ourselves the task. Nor am I so clear as my dissenting brethren seem to be about where the high ground lies in these premises. Extending theories of liability may not always be the more moral course, especially in such a case as this, where the extension, in the course of awarding damages to unnumbered claimants for injuries that are unavoidably speculative, may well visit destruction on enterprise after enterprise, with the consequent loss of employment and productive capacity which that entails.
JERRE S. WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, concurring specially:
My brother Higginbotham in his opinion for the Court correctly points out in footnote 10 that the issue of liability to the commercial fishermen who were financially injured because of this ship collision and resultant spillage is not before us and is an undecided issue in this Circuit.
I am not in serious disagreement with the Court's approach on this issue as set out in the footnote. I write for purposes of emphasis more than to differ. My concern is that I have considerable doubt that commercial fishermen can establish a proprietary interest in the right to fish in their fishing waters. Certainly the common legal synonym for "proprietary interest" is "ownership", as legal lexicons attest. Yet the bright line rule of the Court's opinion places emphasis upon a requisite proprietary interest.
It would be preferable, in my view, to have the rule include a clear recognition that the rights of commercial fishermen were more accurately defined by the Court in Union Oil Co. v. Oppen, 501 F.2d 558 (9th Cir.1974), one of the cases discussed by Judge Higginbotham. The Court agreed that ordinarily there is no recovery for economic losses unaccompanied by physical damage. It found, however, that commercial fishermen were foreseeable plaintiffs whose interests the oil company had a duty to protect when conducting its operations which resulted in the spillage. The rule that should prevail was effectively stated by Judge Sneed in that case in the quotation set out in Judge Higginbotham's opinion. I repeat it here for emphasis:. (Emphasis added.) 501 F.2d at 570.
The commercial fishermen properly recover because their livelihood comes from a "resource" of the water which was polluted. Yet, physical property owned by them was not damaged and it is doubtful that a proprietary interest could have been shown.
I recognize that the Court's opinion in footnote 10 accepted Union Oil as a possible alternative analysis as to the rights of the commercial fishermen. I write to give it greater emphasis than is to be found in the footnote reference and to stress it as the more realistic alternative than a proprietary interest analysis. I would prefer that the rule be stated with enough additional breadth to allow recovery for those who are damaged because they make their living out of a "resource" of the water.
I concur fully in the result in this case because I am in full agreement with the decision of the Court as to all the claimants who are before us. But I have the reservation expressed above as to the rule of law which is stated in the Court's opinion.
GARWOOD, Circuit Judge, concurring specially.
I join in the affirmance of the judgment below substantially for the reasons so well stated in Judge Higginbotham's cogent opinion, with which I am in general agreement. I particularly agree with its analysis of the insufficiency of the proximate cause, foreseeability and remoteness formulations to alone provide an adequate guide for distinguishing, on a normative, pre-event basis, between the classes of cases in which recovery will be allowed and those in which it will not. And I concur, for the reasons ably stated by Judge Higginbotham, in the view that physical harm to or invasion of a proprietary interest is generally an appropriate condition for recovery of negligently caused economic loss, and that the "particular damage" theory of public nuisance law, at least if broadly read, is not an adequate substitute, as it suffers in this respect from deficiencies analogous to those of the proximate cause, foreseeability and remoteness formulations. As the Court's opinion correctly states, to allow appellants "recovery for their losses under a public nuisance theory ... would permit recovery for injury to the type of interest that ... we have consistently declined to protect."* And I believe we wisely leave to one side the claims of the commercial fishermen, who are not before us. I write separately only to explicitly suggest what seems implicit in the Court's opinion, namely, that the physical harm or invasion requirement may not be inflexible or without exception, and that, in certain unusual instances, a relatively restrictive application of the public nuisance theory of damage or invasion different in kind, rather than degree, or something analogous thereto, may be an appropriate substitute. I am in full accord with the desirability of a general rule in accordance with the principles stated by Judge Higginbotham, and for the reasons he articulates. However, we need not in this case either foreclose, or define the precise contours of, possible rare exceptions.
WISDOM, Circuit Judge, with whom ALVIN B. RUBIN, POLITZ, TATE, and JOHNSON, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting.
Robins is the Tar Baby of tort law in this circuit. And the brier-patch is far away. This Court's application of Robins is out of step with contemporary tort doctrine, works substantial injustice on innocent victims, and is unsupported by the considerations that justified the Supreme Court's 1927 decision.
Robins was a tort case grounded on a contract. Whatever the justification for the original holding, this Court's requirement of physical injury as a condition to recovery is an unwarranted step backwards in torts jurisprudence. The resulting bar for claims of economic loss unaccompanied by any physical damage conflicts with conventional tort priniciples of foreseeability and proximate cause. I would analyze the plaintiffs' claims under these principles, using the "particular damage" requirement of public nuisance law as an additional means of limiting claims. Although this approach requires a case-by-case analysis, it comports with the fundamental idea of fairness that innocent plaintiffs should receive compensation and negligent defendants should bear the cost of their tortious acts. Such a result is worth the additional costs of adjudicating these claims, and this rule of liability appears to be more economically efficient. Finally, this result would relieve courts of the necessity of manufacturing exceptions totally inconsistent with the expanded Robins rule of requiring physical injury as a prerequisite to recovery.
I. ALTERNATE STATEMENT OF THE CASE
A. Factual Background
On July 22, 1980, at 8:44 p.m., the inbound bulk carrier M/V Sea Daniel collided with the outbound container ship M/V Testbank at Mile 41 of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet Channel. This channel is a 66-mile, man-made shortcut between New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. Immediately following the collision, a cloud of hydrobromic acid mist enveloped the ships from ruptured containers onboard the Testbank. The prevailing winds carried the acid cloud to Shell Beach, Louisiana, a little town downwind of the collision. The collision damaged several containers on the Testbank, which were then lost overboard. One of these containers held about twelve tons of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in fifty-pound bags.1 This was the largest PCP spill in United States history.
The same day, Civil Defense and local authorities evacuated all residents within a ten-mile radius of the collision. The Coast Guard closed the Outlet to vessel navigation.2 Health officials suspended all fishing, shrimping, and associated activities on the Outlet and within about 400 square miles of surrounding Louisiana waterways and marshes. They also embargoed seafood and shellfish caught in the area and widely broadcast notice of this embargo. The closure and suspensions lasted through mid-August.
The commercial fishing industry in the area sustained serious losses, primarily from the depressed market in that industry in southern Louisiana. Other businesses suffered losses. Numerous parties filed suit against the vessels and their owners, seeking compensation for their expenses and their lost profits caused by the collision, pollution, and bans to navigation and fishing. The claimants may be classified as follows:
(1) commercial fishermen, crabbers, oystermen, and shrimpers who routinely operated in and around the closed area;
(2) fishermen, crabbers, oystermen, and shrimpers who engaged in these practices only for recreation;
(3) operators of marinas and boat rentals, and marine suppliers;
(4) tackle and bait shops;
(5) wholesale and retail seafood enterprises not actually engaged in fishing, shrimping, crabbing, or oystering in the closed area;
(6) seafood restaurants;
(7) cargo terminal operators;
(8) an operator of railroad freight cars seeking demurrage;
(9) vessel operators seeking expenses (demurrage, crew costs, tug hire) and losses of revenues caused by the closure of the outlet.
In its decision and judgment entered in State of Louisiana ex rel. Guste v. M/V Testbank, E.D.La.1981, 524 F.Supp. 1170, aff'd, 728 F.2d 748 (per curiam), the district court dismissed the claims of shipping interests, marine and boat rental operators, wholesale and retail seafood enterprises not actually engaged in fishing, seafood restaurants, tackle and bait shops, and recreational fishermen. On February 22, 1982, a panel of this Court heard oral argument, and that panel affirmed the decision of the district court, holding that it was bound by Robins and by Akron Corp. v. M/T Cantigny, 5 Cir.1983, 706 F.2d 151 (per curiam). See State of Louisiana ex rel. Guste v. M/V Testbank, 5 Cir.1984, 728 F.2d 748 (per curiam). Now a majority of our Court en banc has affirmed that determination.
B. The Fifth Circuit's Extensions of Robins
This Court's most recent extension of Robins, and one that is squarely on point with the present case, is Akron Corp. v. M/T Cantigny, 5 Cir.1983, 706 F.2d 151 reh'g denied, 5 Cir.1983, 711 F.2d 1054. In Akron, a ship grounded in the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River, blocking large vessel traffic from entering or leaving the river for several days. Owners and charterers of vessels blocked by the closure of the pass sued for demurrage, additional fuel expenses, tug hire, pilot fees, and other delay expenses. This Court denied recovery:
"Robins stands for the proposition that a party may not recover for economic losses not associated with physical damages. Id. The rule's purpose is to prevent limitless liability for negligence and the filing of law suits of a highly speculative nature. This court noted in Bayou Lacombe [5 Cir.1979, 597 F.2d 469] that '[w]hatever the wisdom of the traditional rule of nonliability for negligent acts causing economic loss, Robins reflects the state of law in this circuit,' 597 F.2d at 472."
706 F.2d at 153 (emphasis added).
In Dick Meyers Towing Service, Inc. v. United States, 5 Cir.1978, 577 F.2d 1023, cert. denied, 1979, 440 U.S. 908, 99 S.Ct. 1215, 59 L.Ed.2d 455, this Court denied recovery for losses after navigation on the Black Warrior River in Alabama was completely halted for five months by a faulty lock near the Bankhead Dam. Meyers sued for recovery of the loss of towing business sustained as a result of the closing of the river. This Court affirmed the district court's denial of recovery, relying on Robins and Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Marshland Dredging Co., 5 Cir.1972, 455 F.2d 957:
"The law has traditionally been reluctant to recognize claims based solely on harm to the interest in contractual relations or business expectancy....."
Finally, in Louisville and Nashville Railroad Co. v. M/V Bayou Lacombe, 5 Cir.1979, 597 F.2d 469, L & N Railroad sought recovery for loss of use of a railroad bridge damaged by the Bayou Lacombe. Although L & N did not own the bridge, it sought to place itself in the same position as the owner of the bridge through its contractual agreement with the bridge's actual owner. The Court found that the agreement placed no ownership interest in the L & N. Therefore, under Robins, as construed by this Court, L & N had no right to recover. The damages allegedly sustained were losses of an economic expectancy and not proprietary losses. Id. at 474.4
The enduring appeal of Robins, despite its inapplicability to cases such as this one, seems to spring from the administrative convenience of a "conspicuous bright-line rule" and from "the virtue of predictability". Majority opinion at 1029. In a frequently cited extension of Robins, an Ohio Court of Appeals was remarkably candid in its justification for relying on Robins. Stevenson v. East Oil & Gas Co., Ohio Ct.App. 1946, 73 N.E.2d 200. In Stevenson a defendant negligently obstructed a factory building, necessitating a large-scale lay-off. The court felt that it would be impossible to draw a workable line of liability between workers out of their jobs and restaurant owners supplying the workers' lunches:
"While the reason usually given for the refusal to permit recovery in this class of cases is that the damages are 'indirect' or are 'too remote' it is our opinion that the principal reason that has motivated the courts in denying recovery in this class of cases is that to permit recovery of damages in such cases would open the door to a mass of litigation which might very well overwhelm the courts so that in the long run while injustice might result in special cases, the ends of justice are conserved by laying down and enforcing the general rule so well stated by Mr. Justice Holmes...."
Our notions of proximate cause and foreseeability are admittedly less adequate in truncating a chain of claims where the conduit through which the harm passes is contract. If a contract between A and B provides sufficient nexus for B to recover after A 's physical injury, then it is difficult to distinguish C 's contract with B, or D 's contract with C. In short, one contract seems as good as the next for establishing proximate cause and foreseeability once the first claim is allowed. Robins resolves this dilemma by disallowing all third party claims based solely upon a contractual relationship with the injured party.6
There are sound reasons for such a rule. Courts recognize that once they permit recovery for economic loss to parties linked in a serial chain of contracts, defining a stopping point becomes nearly impossible. In Robins, for example, the shipowner had settled his claim against the drydocker, apparently for the rents the shipowner would have received from the charterer had there not been an additional delay. Robins, 2 Cir.1926, 13 F.2d 3, 4. Had Justice Holmes imposed liability again in the Robins appeal for the charterer's lost profits, the tortfeasor would have been required to make good the still better bargain of the charterer. Similarly, if the charterer had a contract with parties on shore to clean the charterer's catch, the drydock would have been required to make good on this bargain as well. This iteration of compensation could conceivably run without limit. Liability would accrue "in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class". Ultramares Corp. v. Touche, N.Y. 1931, 255 N.Y. 170, 179, 174 N.E. 441, 444 (Cardozo, C.J.).7 In limiting recovery in a chain of contractual relations, the Supreme Court drew the line after the first claim for damages. Justice Holmes had thus fashioned a rule in claims arising from a chain of contracts that would avoid a multiplicity of actions and prevent a vast extension of liability.8 As one commentator observed:
"In a situation of this type, total recovery for all lost profits might amount to an enormous sum, and the Robins Court may have thought that liability of this magnitude would unduly discourage socially useful but risky undertakings. However, by arbitrarily cutting off liability after the most proximately-related party, the courts following Robins have indicated their doubt that the traditional limits of the duty concept, the doctrine of proximate cause, and the jury's discretion are adequate to prevent excessive recovery. For the sake of certainty, these courts have sacrificed the fairness of a case-by-case determination of the appropriateness of recovery."

II. THE INAPPLICABILITY OF Robins Dry Dock TO THIS CASE
Whatever the pragmatic justification for the original holding in Robins, the majority has extended the case beyond the warrant of clear necessity in requiring a physical injury for a recovery of economic loss in cases such as the one before the court. Robins prevented plaintiffs who were neither proximately nor foreseeably injured by a tortious act or product from recovering solely by claiming a contract with the injured party. The wisdom of this rule is apparent. This rule, however, has been expanded now to bar recovery by plaintiffs who would be allowed to recover if judged under conventional principles of foreseeability and proximate cause.9
A. The Precise Holding of Robins Applies Only to Claims for Negligent Interference with Contract.
Because the centerpiece of this litigation has been Robins,10 the holding of this oftcited case merits scrutiny. A ship's time charterer was required under contract to turn the vessel over to a dry dock for maintenance. The charterer owed no rent during the time the ship was under repair. The drydocker, who had contracted with the owner of the ship for the work, negligently damaged the ship's propeller. During the additional delay caused by repairs to the propeller, the charterer lost expected profits from the use of the ship. The charterer sued the shipyard for these economic losses. The Supreme Court denied relief, holding that the shipyard's damage to the propeller wronged only the owner of the ship. The Court further held that the charterer had lost merely the benefit of his contract for hire and had suffered no legally cognizable claim:
"[The plaintiff's] loss arose only through [its], 72 L.Ed. at 292 (citations omitted).
Robins held only that if a defendant's negligence injures party A, and the plaintiff suffers loss of expected income or profits because it had a contract with A, then the plaintiff has no cause of action based on the defendant's negligence.
B. Difficulties with Subsequent Extensions
It is a long step from Robins to a rule that requires physical damage as a prerequisite to recovery in maritime tort. The majority believes that the plaintiff's lack of any contractual connection with an injured party, taken with the Robins rule, forecloses liability: "If a plaintiff connected to the damaged chattels by contract cannot recover, others more remotely situated are foreclosed a fortiori." Majority opinion at 1024. This conclusion follows readily from the reasoning that if uninjured contracting parties are barred from recovery, and if contracting parties have a closer legal relationship than non-contracting parties, then a party who is not physically injured and who does not have a contractual relation to the damage is surely barred.
This argument would be sound in instances where the plaintiff suffered no loss but for a contract with the injured party. We would measure a plaintiff's connection to the tortfeasor by the only line connecting them, the contract, and disallow the claim under Robins. In the instant case, however, some of the plaintiffs suffered damages whether or not they had a contractual connection with a party physically injured by the tortfeasor. These plaintiffs do not need to rely on a contract to link them to the tort: The collision proximately caused their losses, and those losses were foreseeable. These plaintiffs are therefore freed from the Robins rule concerning the recovery of those who suffer economic loss because of an injury to a party with whom they have contracted.
Because Robins provides an overly restrictive bar on recovery, courts have over the years developed a number of exceptions.11 The traditional exceptions allow recovery for certain husband-wife claims,12 recovery for negligent interference with contract when the interference results from a tangible injury to the contractor's person or property,13 and recovery for persons employed on fishing boats to recover for lost income when the employment contract is disrupted by a third party's negligent injury to the ship or equipment.14
Many opinions go beyond these traditional exceptions, both in the Fifth Circuit and in other courts. Our own Court has allowed a plaintiff to recover the added costs of performing a contract caused by a defendant's negligence,15 and has employed this exception for maritime torts.16 This Court also allowed a plaintiff to recover added costs in J. Ray McDermott & Co. v. S.S. Egero, 5 Cir.1972, 453 F.2d 1202, when a prime contractor recovered liquidated damages to a subcontractor after a vessel negligently dropped anchor on or near the pipelines which the contractor was constructing across a river bottom.17 Canadian cases have also allowed recovery of additional expenses.18
Although the majority says that this Court has not "been the sole guardian of the Robins Dry Dock principle", the majority's support19 is reminiscent of the Potemkin Village set up for Catherine the Great to visit. In both the Second and the Fourth Circuits courts have recently limited the applicability of the Robins rule in maritime torts.
The Second Circuit's opening volley on Robins was Petition of Kinsman Transit Co., 2 Cir.1968, 388 F.2d 821 (Kinsman II ), which has effectively limited the applicability of Robins to a small number of maritime torts. See. The import of Kinsman II was to establish foreseeability as the test for liability instead of the requirement of physical injury.20 The court rejected the requirement of physical damages without even bothering to distinguish Robins, and instead relied on customary negligence principles. Id. at 823-34. Although the Court in Kinsman II found that the damages were too "tenuous and remote" to allow recovery, the opinion represents an important departure from Robins because the Court was willing to rely on a case-by-case application of proximate cause principles rather than the blanket bar of Robins.21 There is therefore no basis for the majority to say that Kinsman II's "general analysis ... is compatible with our own"., also belies a blanket approval of Robins in the Second Circuit. In Marathonian, both the district court and the court of appeals reluctantly dismissed the plaintiffs' claims, but made it clear that the holding was narrow and was compelled by Robins in "instances involving the factual contours of that case". In its opinion, the district court stated:
"[W]ere this Court now free to write upon a tabula rasa and not constrained by the weight of precedent, we would reject the negligent interference with contract doctrine in favor of a negligence-causation-foreseeability analysis, such as that adopted by Chief Judge Kaufman in Petition of Kinsman Transit Co., 388 F.2d 821, 823-34 (2 Cir.1968)....
* * *
"In the instant case, however, we feel bound by the Supreme Court's decision in Robins. We believe that the Robins decision must be adhered to by the lower federal courts, at least in instances involving the factual contours of that case, namely the negligent interference with a time charterer's contract rights by third parties, until such time as the Supreme Court directs otherwise."
392 F.Supp. at 913, 915.22
In the Fourth Circuit, District Judge Merhige refused to dismiss claims for economic losses suffered by commercial fishermen, local boat, and tackle and bait shop owners, but did dismiss claims by the plaintiffs who purchased and marketed seafood from commercial fishermen. Those losses, although foreseeable, were too indirect. Pruitt v. Allied Chemical Corp., E.D.Va.1981, 523 F.Supp. 975.
Finally, the ramparts have been breached in the Ninth Circuit. Although the majority says that Union Oil Co. v. Oppen, 9 Cir.1974, 501 F.2d 558, is "not contrary" to our Court's affirmation of the Robins rule, a close reading of Oppen indicates that this is incorrect. In Oppen, a mishap in 1969 at an offshore oil drilling platform introduced hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the ocean off the coast of Santa Barbara, California. Although a strict application of the extensions of Robins would have barred all recovery, the Ninth Circuit allowed fishermen to recover for the loss of their livelihood. After acknowledging the "widely recognized principle" that a plaintiff could not recover for the negligently induced loss of "a prospective pecuniary advantage", id. at 563, the Court noted the many exceptions to this rule, "in which defendants engaged in certain professions, businesses, or trades have been held liable for economic losses resulting from the negligent performance of tasks within the course of their callings", id. 566. The Court regarded the real question to be whether Union owed a duty to the fishermen. This in turn depended on whether Union could foresee a risk of harm to fishermen:
[W]e can not escape the conclusion that under California law the presence of a duty on the part of the defendants in this case would turn substantially on foreseeability. That being the crucial determinant, the question must be asked whether the defendants could reasonably have foreseen that negligently conducted drilling operations might diminish aqautic life and thus injure the business of commercial fishermen. We believe the answer is yes.
Id. at 569 (emphasis added).23
Recently, the Robins holding has been undermined in Louisiana. In PPG Industries, Inc. v. Bean Dredging, La.1984, 447 So.2d 1058, the Court held that the dredging contractor who damaged a natural gas line was not liable for the added expenses incurred by the only user of the line. But the Court did not rely on a bright-line physical damage requirement, and criticized earlier Louisiana cases for "taking a mechanical approach to [an] unreasoned conclusion". Id. at 1060. The Court said that although Robins is usually cited for the proposition that negligent interference with contract is not a tort, Robins is better justified as responding to the need to prevent multiple actions and unforeseeable liability. The Court went on to hold that the particular risk at issue in the case--the risk of shutting down the plaintiff's factory--was not encompassed by the defendant's duty of care. Justice Calogero dissented, arguing that the risk was within the duty, but he first "applaud[ed] the majority's ... abandoning the per se exclusion of [economic] damages which our courts have heretofore adopted on the heels of Robins." Id. at 1062.
One cannot deny that Robins's policy of limiting the set of plaintiffs who can recover for a person's negligence and damage to physical property provides a "bright line" for demarcating the boundary between recovery and nonrecovery. Physical harm suggests a proximate relation between the act and the interference. At bottom, however, the requirement of a tangible injury is artificial because it does not comport with accepted principles of tort law. Mrs. Palsgraf, although physically injured, could not recover. Many other plaintiffs, although physically uninjured, can recover.24
The inapplicability of Robins to plaintiffs who have been proximately and foreseeably injured by the collision illustrates the fundamental weakness of founding a rule of recovery in tort upon Robins. Conventional tort principles do not apply in Robins because the connection between the plaintiff and the tort was a contract, not a tortious act or a defective product. In cases where the parties have suffered losses only because they are parts of a chain of contracting parties, only one of whom was physically injured, Robins provides a bright-line rule to limit claims. Whatever the justification for this rule in its original context, however, we should not extend it to instances where the parties are not linked merely in a contractual chain. Instead, we should allow recovery in instances where each of the parties alleges a loss that occurred outside this contractual chain, where each injured party, isolated from another injured party, can assert an injury that is cognizable when judged by our usual rules of proximate cause and foreseeability.25 There is only one justification for the requirement of physical injury: If Robins establishes a policy of restricting the type of plaintiff who can recover for a defendant's negligence, physical property damage furnishes an easily discernible boundary between recovery and nonrecovery.
With deference to the majority, I suggest, notwithstanding their well reasoned opinion, that the utility derived from having a "bright line" boundary does not outweigh the disutility caused by the limitation on recovery imposed by the physicaldamage requirement. Robins and its progeny represent a wide departure from the usual tort doctrines of foreseeability and proximate cause. Those doctrines, as refined in the law of public nuisance, provide a rule of recovery that compensates innocent plaintiffs and holds the defendants liable for much of the harm proximately caused by their negligence.
III. AN ALTERNATE RULE OF RECOVERY
Rather than limiting recovery under an automatic application of a physical damage requirement, I would analyze the plaintiffs' claims under the conventional tort principles of negligence, foreseeability, and proximate causation.26 I would confine Robins to the "factual contours" of that case: A plaintiff's claim may be barred only if the claim is derived solely through contract with an injured party. The majority's primary criticism of this approach to a determination of liability is that it is potentially open ended. Yet, there are well-established tort principles to limit liability for a widely-suffered harm. Under the contemporary law of public nuisance, courts compensate "particularly" damaged plaintiffs for harms suffered from a wide-ranging tort, but deny recovery to more generally damaged parties. Those parties who are foreseeably and proximately injured by an oil spill or closure of a navigable river, for example, and who can also prove damages that are beyond the general economic dislocation that attends such disasters should recover whether or not they had contractual dealings with others who were also damaged by the tortious act. The limitation imposed by "particular" damages, together with refined notions of proximate cause and forseeability, provides a workable scheme of liability that is in step with the rest of tort law, compensates innocent plaintiffs, and imposes the costs of harm on those who caused it.27A. Public Nuisance Law and Particular Damages
To assert a cause of action under public nuisance law, a plaintiff must assert "particular damages".28 As Dean Prosser, Reporter for the Second Restatement of Torts, has written, although courts once required physical injury for a recovery under nuisance, this limitation was quickly abandoned:
"The origin of this notion is obscure, although there is an obvious derivation from the old distinction between the actions of trespass and case. It has been expressly repudiated often enough; and the whole tenor of the cases in which particular damage has been found makes it quite clear that it is not now the law, if indeed it ever was."
Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va.L.Rev. 997, 1007-08 (1966).
Instead, to state a cause of action under public nuisance, a plaintiff must prove "particular" damages from the alleged wrong. These damages must be different in kind and degree from those suffered by the general public. If other individuals suffer the same kind of damage, although in lesser degree, a private plaintiff might still recover. Id. at 1009. "It is only when the class becomes so large and general as to include all members of the public who come in contact with the nuisance, that the private action will fail." Id.
Generally, pecuniary loss to the plaintiff results in particular damage that sets him apart from the general public. When the plaintiff is prevented from performing a specific contract, or is put to additional expense in performing it, he can maintain his action because the contract is an individual matter that is not common to the public. Id. Also, those who have established businesses which make common use of the public right that the nuisance infringes have been allowed recovery. When a river is blocked, for example, a steamboat line operating on it and a company that rafts logs or collects tolls for passage have been permitted to maintain the action.29 There are also cases in which commercial fisheries making a localized use of public waters have been allowed to recover under nuisance law.30 And although plaintiffs who are delayed by a public nuisance cannot recover money for the delay itself (e.g., the profitable opportunities that the plaintiff had to forego), they can recover for actual additional expenses, such as extra fuel, additional crew expenses, and greater demurrage charges.31
The Supreme Court of Louisiana has recognized that a business may sustain the requisite "particular kind of business damages as a consequence of the obstruction of a navigable channel". Pharr v. Morgan's L. & T.R. & S.S. Co., La.1905, 115 La. 138, 38 So. 943. In that case, the defendant had negligently damaged a railroad bridge spanning the Atchafalaya River. The barges could pass under the repair framework, but the steamboat could not. The plaintiff was forced to employ an extra steamboat to transport the sugar cane from the sugar fields below the bridge to the refinery above the bridge. Id., 38 So. at 944. The Court held:
"The negligent breaking of the bridge was the primary, paramount cause, which lead to the obstruction of navigation as well as the work of reparation; and if, as argued, such work was the immediate cause of the injury, it was simply an intervening cause set in motion by the party originally in fault. It may be said that the remedy was worse than the disease.
"We therefore are of opinion that defendants are responsible in damages caused by the obstruction of navigation."
Id. at 945. The Louisiana Supreme Court awarded damages for the extra transportation costs incurred, but refused to award delay damages because of the uncertainty of the evidence; the plaintiff would have been entitled to such damages had he been able to prove them.
The closest federal case in point is probably Burgess v. M/V Tamano, D.Me.1973, 370 F.Supp. 247, aff'd, 1 Cir. 1977, 559 F.2d 1200. There, the court denied the plaintiff's motion to dismiss the claims of fishermen and clam diggers seeking damages as a result of an oil spill in a Maine bay. The court decided the motion for dismissal on the basis of public nuisance, holding that the commercial fishermen and clam diggers had suffered "particular damage different in kind, rather than degree, from that asserted by the general public". The court denied recovery to businessmen in Old Orchard Beach because their damage was "derivative from that of the public at large, is common to all businesses and residents of the Old Orchard Beach area". Id. at 251.
The line of demarcation provided by the Burgess court under an analysis of public nuisance and the line suggested in this dissent are similar. Those who incur a direct pecuniary loss (and thus fall within the field of "particular damages") will frequently also have been injured both proximately and foreseeably by the spill. Ships bottled up in the Mississippi River that had to pay additional crew expenses and docking and demurrage charges, for example, would recover these expenses. Similarly, fishermen would be entitled to compensation for the loss of their livelihood.B. Applications of the Alternate Rule of Recovery
Although the requirement of "particular" damages provides a useful means of limiting claims, it must be applied within the general framework of the long-standing requirements of proximate cause and foreseeability. It is, of course, axiomatic in tort law that those who have been proximately and foreseeably injured should recover. Although cause and effect can be carried to limitless and unknowable lengths, courts have chosen to deal with these concepts in a restrained manner that is practical and within the scope of ordinary human understanding. These arbitrary limits are delineated by "proximate" or "natural" causes. One must admit that the line between recovery and nonrecovery may appear as arbitrary under a rule of proximate cause as a line created by a requirement for physical damages. In a sense, any line that the courts draw to limit recovery is arbitrary. But this dissent attempts to draw lines which comport more closely with principles of intrinsic fairness than the line based on physical damage.
1. Requirements of Proximate Cause, Foreseeability, and "Particular" Damage
First, the damage must be proximately caused by the accident. Although this requirement will preclude some claims, it provides relief for many of the claims for economic losses at issue here because of the great interdependence of the elements in the maritime industry. Hardly any claim escapes its imprimatur, and its overinclusiveness in defining the class of proper plaintiffs in this case limits its traditional utility. We therefore concentrate instead on the principles of foreseeability and "particular" damage, which are more useful here in delimiting recovery.
Foreseeability provides a mechanism for limiting claims that are proximately related to the accident. The requirement of foreseeability precludes recovery for damages resulting from gains that are allegedly lost because the accident altered the course of events upon which the expected gain was predicated. For example, the law should not compensate a shipper for purely speculative profits. Such predictions of the future are limitless in variety and incalculable in scope. Foreseeability requires that we confine the scope of claims to those arising from activities in process at the time of the accident or to claims that can be proven with certainty.
Finally, a plaintiff must assert a "particular" damage that distinguishes him from the general population. This requirement of "particular" damage basic in the law of public nuisance developed as a response to widespread losses. It was formulated to compensate those plaintiffs most seriously aggrieved by a tort while preventing open-ended liability. The distinction is useful here. In a maritime accident, a business suffers "particular" damages to the extent that the accident prevents the business from engaging in primary maritime activities, such as fishing or use of the waterways, or supplying commodities or services vital to primary maritime activities, such as those of bait and tackle shops, drydocks, marinas, and seafood wholesalers or processors. All other losses that are not peculiar to maritime activities are part of the general economic dislocation caused by the accident and are therefore not "particular".
A plaintiff must meet all three criteria for recovery. This test should provide a reasonably satisfactory equilibrium among compensation to plaintiffs, foreclosure of open-ended liability, and imposition of incentives on defendants to obtain insurance and to exercise due care.
2. Parties Entitled To Recover Under the Test
Shrimpers, crabbers, oystermen, and other commercial fishermen who routinely operated in those parts of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and the surrounding areas that were temporarily closed by the Coast Guard should recover. It is foreseeable that a ship carrying PCP might be in a collision and that some of the PCP containers might be lost overboard.32 It is also foreseeable that a PCP spill would result in the closure of fishing areas. Commercial fishermen have suffered damages that are proximately caused by this closure. Finally, they have suffered "particular" damages because, unlike members of the general public, the tort has denied them their livelihood in the maritime industry.
Ships that were trapped or delayed by the closure of the Gulf Channel Outlet are also entitled to recovery. It is foreseeable that a PCP spill would result in closure of the river to navigation. Such closure proximately caused shippers to incur additional expenses. The damage is "particular" because the operators of these ships have incurred additional pecuniary outlays in the course of their maritime activities.33 Ships that can alter their routes to reduce or eliminate losses should be denied recovery pro tanto because of their duty to mitigate damages. See Hercules, 720 F.2d at 1201 (per curiam), aff'd, 11 Cir. 1984, 728 F.2d 1359 (en banc). If the rerouting of ships caused delays in an alternate route from crowding, ships that would have taken the alternate route in any event should not recover their delay expenses.
The land-based businesses that have claimed damages include drydocks, marinas, bait and tackle shops, seafood processors, seafood wholesalers, and restaurants. It is here that drawing the line becomes difficult, for these businesses have been affected by the PCP spill, but all would agree that a seafood restaurant in New Orleans should not recover for a loss of business from consumers' concern over contaminated products.
The general test of recovery for these claimants is whether their business of supplying a vital commodity or service to those engaged in the maritime industry has been interrupted by the collision, the closure, or the embargo. Marinas, for example, in the afflicted area should be allowed to recover. If all shipping and boating is suspended, then a marina or drydock in the area affected is unable to supply docking or repair services to users of the waterway.34 No mitigation of damages is possible. The same would be true for similarly situated boat charterers who supply marine "common carrier" services.35 Bait and tackle shops present a similar situation: The condemnation of a large fishing area damages or destroys the livelihood of those shops whose business is exclusively predicated upon supplying direct inputs (bait, fuel) to those whose commercial undertakings have been foreclosed by the quarantine and embargo.36 Finally, seafood processors and seafood wholesalers that provide services for the condemned area should recover.
There is a point beyond which we cannot allow recovery. Seafood restaurants, for example, are not providers of a vital service to the afflicted area. Their damage is not sufficiently distinguishable from general economic dislocation to allow for recovery. They are too removed from the tortious act. A plaintiff may also be barred because it is not sufficiently involved with the afflicted area as a supplier of vital inputs peculiar to maritime activities. The bar would arise, for example, if a bait and tackle shop were only partially connected with a foreclosed area. Basically, a claim for damages that is indistinguishable from a general grievance furnishes no basis for recovery.
3. The Measure of Recovery
Generally, lost profits should be awarded to eligible claimants. Their livelihood has been compromised, and only a recovery of the value of that livelihood, however imprecise the calculation may be, can approach compensation for the losses they have suffered.
Commercial fishermen, oystermen, shrimpers, and crabbers should recover the profits that they lost during the closure of the area. The measurement of their loss should be the difference between their actual earnings and the earnings they would have had if the PCP were never spilled (based on historical calculations), if there were no closure of the fishing grounds, and if there were no depression of the demand for seafood because of the embargo and the attendant adverse publicity. This measure of damages would also apply to land-based businesses, such as eligible drydocks, marinas, bait or tackle shops, seafood processors, and seafood wholesalers.
Trapped shippers should recover for additional expenses of crew, fuel, demurrage, tug hire, or any other foreseeable direct expenses that these ships would not have incurred but for the accident. Loss of profit arising from maritime casualty may be awarded as long as it is proved with reasonable certainty. Delta S.S. Lines, Inc. v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 5th Cir.1984, 747 F.2d 995, 1001. Generally this involves demonstrating that the shipper "has been engaged, or was capable of being engaged in a profitable commerce". Id. We would not, however, require that the shipper prove that specific cargos were not carried because of the accident. We would instead follow the "time-honored rule" that the "proper method of determining lost detention profits is to seek a fair average based on a number of voyages before and after". Id.
IV. ADVANTAGES OF THE ALTERNATE RULE OF RECOVERY
The advantages of this alternate rule of recovery are that it compensates damaged plaintiffs, imposes the cost of damages upon those who have caused the harm, is consistent with economic principles of modern tort law, and frees courts from the necessity of creating a piecemeal quilt of exceptions to avoid the harsh effects of the Robins rule.
A. Extrinsic Notions of Fairness and Case-by-Case Adjudication
If tort law fails to compensate plaintiffs or to impose the cost of damages on those who caused the harm, it should be under a warrant clear of necessity. When a rule of law, once extended, leads to inequitable results and creates principles of recovery that are at odds with the great weight of tort jurisprudence, then that rule of law merits scrutiny. A strict application of the extension denies recovery to many plaintiffs who should be awarded damages.37 Conventional tort principles of foreseeability, proximate causation, and "particular" damages would avoid such unfairness.
It is true that application of foreseeability and proximate causation would necessitate case-by-case adjudication. But I have a more optimistic assessment of courts' ability to undertake such adjudication than the majority.38 Certainly such an inquiry would be no different from our daily task of weighing such claims in other tort cases.
The majority opinion also states that the Robins rule, being free from the vagaries of factual findings in a case-by-case determination, serves an important normative function because it is more predictable and more "candid". Normative values would also be served, however, by eliminating a broad categorical rule that is insensitive to equitable and social policy concerns that would support allowing the plaintiffs' claims in many individual cases. In assessing "normative concerns", the courts' compass should be a sense of fairness and equity, both of which are better served by allowing plaintiffs to present their claims under usual tort standards. It is not clear, moreover, that a jury's finding of negligence in a case-by-case determination is "less the product of a determinable rule of law" when the finder of fact is guided in its determination by rules of law. The jury's finding of liability in this case would be no more "lawless" than a finding of proximate cause, foreseeability, and particular damages in a physical damage case.
B. The Economic Arguments
The economic arguments regarding allocation of loss that purportedly favor the Robins rule of nonliability are not as clear to me as they appear to be to the majority. It is true that denial of recovery may effectively spread the loss over the victims. It is not certain, however, that victims are generally better insurors against the risk of loss caused by tortious acts having widespread consequences. Although the victims do possess greater knowledge of their circumstances and their potential damages, we do not know whether insurance against these types of losses is readily available to the businesses that may be affected. We do know that insurance against this kind of loss is already available for shippers. Imposition of liability upon the shippers helps ensure that the potential tortfeasor faces incentives to take the proper care. The majority's point is well taken that the incentives to avoid accidents do not increase once potential losses pass a certain measure of enormity. But in truth we have no idea what this measure is: Absent hard data, I would rather err on the side of receiving little additional benefit from imposing additional quanta of liability than err by adhering to Robins' inequitable rule and bar victims' recovery on the mistaken belief that a "marginal incentive curve" was flat, or nearly so. If a loss must be borne, it is no worse if a "merely" negligent defendant bears the loss than an innocent plaintiff absorb the damages.
V. CONCLUSION
The Robins approach restricts liability more severely than the policies behind limitations on liability require and imposes the cost of the accident on the victim, who is usually not in a superior position to obtain insurance to cover this loss. I would apply a rule of recovery based on conventional tort principles of proximate cause and foreseeability and limit eligibility only by the requirement that a claimant prove "particular" damages.
ALVIN B. RUBIN, Circuit Judge, with whom WISDOM, POLITZ and TATE, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting.
While voting to deny damages to all of the plaintiffs who joined in this appeal on the basis of the Robins rule, several of our colleagues who joined to make up the majority have indicated some concern about applying the rule so as to deny damages to every claimant who has not suffered a physical injury to a proprietary interest. Thus, the majority opinion refrains from agreeing or disagreeing with the Ninth Circuit decision in Union Oil, permitting recovery, in the absence of physical injury to a proprietary interest, by "commercial fishermen, plaintiffs whose economic losses were characterized as 'of a particular and special nature,' " and would leave that question "for later." It may be assumed, therefore, that some who joined in the opinion may not be disposed to deny damages to fishermen. Judge Williams would go further and expressly recognize the right of commercial fishermen as "foreseeable plaintiffs whose interests the oil company had a duty to protect when conducting its operations which resulted in the spillage." Judge Garwood does not think that Robins requires proof of physical injury in every case. These views evidence that in fact a majority of the court is unwilling to impose an unqualified requirement of physical injury to a proprietary interest.
Judge Gee's view, in which Chief Judge Clark joins, is that, while we should not go beyond the physical-injury requirement, the question of scope of liability for damages should be resolved by legislative action. If, however, the limited-recovery rule is fair, it does not require Congressional consideration.
I agree with Judge Gee and Chief Judge Clark that the subject calls for legislative consideration and that the necessary application of principle accompanied by suitable line drawing can be better accomplished by statute. However, I would not await such action, for, in default of it, every time we reject a claim we act as decisively and finally as if we had allowed it--as definitively as if we were adhering to a statutory command not to allow damages when no such command has been given. The constitutional grant of jurisdiction to federal courts over cases and controversies not only empowers but requires us to review the constitutionality of legislation, as the Court held in Marbury v. Madison1 a century and a half ago. It equally empowers and requires us to decide other cases within our jurisdiction whether or not Congress has provided a rule of decision and even when we think Congress should have acted and has not done so.
Robins should not be extended beyond its actual holding and should not be applied in cases like this, for the result is a denial of recompense to innocent persons who have suffered a real injury as a result of someone else's fault. We should not flinch from redressing injury because Congress has been indifferent to the problem.
Stated more generally, the summary judgment denied the claims asserted by shipping interests suffering losses from delays or rerouting, marina and boat operators, wholesale and retail seafood enterprises not actually engaged in fishing, shrimping, crabbing or oystering in the area, seafood restaurants, tackle and bait shops, and recreational fishermen, oystermen, shrimpers and crabbers. The rights of commercial fishermen who survived summary judgment are not before us
The arguments of plaintiffs are not uniform, but their differences are largely in emphasis and focus
Professor Carpenter's article, supra at p. 5, came within months of Robins Dry Dock, and sounded the drumbeat for change with arguments similar to those now urged. What is relevant here is that the courts did not follow Professor Carpenter's call to abandon the physical injury requirement. As Professor James pointed out:
The failure of the movement to gain momentum takes on added significance when it is put into context. It coincided with a veritable ground swell in the law of negligence that pushed liability for physical injuries toward the full extent of what was foreseeable and shattered ancient barriers to recovery based on limitations associated with privity of contract and similar restrictive concepts.

The Eleventh Circuit has applied the Robins Dry Dock rule as developed in our own circuit. See Kingston Shipping Co. v. Roberts, 667 F.2d 34 (11th Cir.1982) (owners of vessels delayed when ship channel was blocked due to maritime collision could not recover economic losses). That court recently considered abandoning the Robins Dry Dock doctrine but did not do so. See Hercules Carriers, Inc. v. Florida, 720 F.2d 1201 (11th Cir.1983), aff'd by an equally divided court, 728 F.2d 1359 (11th Cir.1984) (en banc), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 105 S.Ct. 128, 83 L.Ed.2d 69
We note that both the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have permitted crewmembers of a fishing boat to recover for their share of the lost catch when the vessel was negligently damaged. See Carbone v. Ursich, 209 F.2d 178, 181-82 (9th Cir.1953); Miller Industries v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 733 F.2d 813, 818-20 (11th Cir.1984). Both courts recognized, however, that such recovery was an exception to the general rule
Kinsman II, 388 F.2d at 822. Judge Kaufman briefly summarized the facts of Kinsman as follows:
[A]s result of the negligence of the Kinsman Transit Company and the Continental Grain Company the S.S. MacGilvray Shiras broke loose from her moorings and careened stern first down the narrow, S-shaped river channel. She struck the S.S. Michael K. Tewksbury, which in turn broke loose from her moorings and drifted down-stream--followed by the Shiras--until she crashed into the Michigan Avenue Bridge. The bridge collapsed and its wreckage, together with the Tewksbury and the Shiras, formed a dam which caused extensive flooding and an ice jam reaching almost 3 miles upstream. As a result of this disaster, transportation on the river was disrupted [for] a period of about 2 months.

Judge Kaufman wrote:
We ... prefer to leave the rock-strewn path of "negligent interference with contract" for more familiar tort terrain. Cargill and Cargo Carriers argue broadly that they suffered damage as a result of defendants' negligence and we will deal with their claims in these terms instead of on the more esoteric "negligent interference" ground.
Having determined our course, we nevertheless conclude that recovery was properly denied on the facts of this case because the injuries to Cargill and Cargo Carriers were too "remote" or "indirect" a consequence of defendants' negligence.

A substantial argument can be made that commercial fishermen possess a proprietary interest in fish in waters they normally harvest sufficient to allow recovery for their loss. Whether the claims of commercial fishermen ought to be analyzed in this manner or simply carved from the rule today announced, in the fashion of Union Oil, or allowed at all, we leave for later. That is, today's decision does not foreclose free consideration by a court panel of the claims of commercial fishermen.
As Professor Henderson put it:
When asked, cajoled, and finally forced to try to solve unadjudicable problems, courts will inevitably respond in the only manner possible--they will begin exercising managerial authority and the discretion that goes with it. Attempts will be made to disguise the substitution, to preserve appearances, but the process which evolves should (and no doubt eventually will) be recognized for what it is--not adjudication, but an elaborate, expansive masquerade.

Fuller, The Forms and Limits of Adjudication, 92 Harv.L.Rev. 353, 396 (1978). This case illustrates how our technocratic tradition masks a deep difference in attitudes toward the roles of a judiciary. The difference between the majority and dissenting opinions is far more than a choice between competing maritime rules. The majority is driven by the principle of self ordering and modesty for the judicial role; the dissent accepts a role of management which can strain the limits of adjudication
Plaintiffs argue that the Supreme Court, in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 54 U.S. (13 How.) 518, 14 L.Ed. 249 (1852), recognized a federal cause of action for public nuisance caused by the obstruction of navigable waterways. As a threshold matter, we note that the Court has apparently foreclosed this line of reasoning in California v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 296 n. 7, 101 S.Ct. 1775, 1780 n. 7, 68 L.Ed.2d 101 (1981): [Iron Bridge Co. v. Hatch, 125 U.S. 1, 15-17, 8 S.Ct. 811, 818-819, 31 L.Ed. 629 (1888) ]. In short, although there may have been a common-law nuisance cause of action for obstructions of navigable waterways. Wheeling Bridge did not federalize that law. Respondents have cited no decision by this Court that did.
In any case, our treatment of the nuisance issue, infra, means that plaintiffs here cannot recover whether or not they have a substantive claim for nuisance under federal law.

While the Court in California v. Sierra Club addressed only the question whether a private cause of action should be implied under Section 10, we think the Court's decision requires a conclusion that private actions may not be brought under Section 13 either. Both sections were enacted to insure the Federal Government's ability to prevent the obstruction of navigable waterways. We find the Court's analysis of Section 10 under Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975) equally applicable to Section 13

Except for the vessel operators (and the recreational fishermen, who suffered no economic loss), the injury suffered by all appellants consists of interference, not with their own actions, but rather entirely with their prospective economic relations with others, either as suppliers or customers. As to the vessel operators, in my view their situation is aptly described in Kinsman II:
"To anyone familiar with N.Y. traffic there can be no doubt that a foreseeable result of an accident in the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel during rush hour is that thousands of people will be delayed. A driver who negligently caused such an accident would certainly be held accountable to those physically injured in the crash. But we doubt that damages would be recoverable against the negligent driver in favor of truckers or contract carriers who suffered provable losses because of the delay or to the wage earner who was forced to 'clock in' an hour late. And yet it was surely foreseeable that among the many who would be delayed would be truckers and wage earners." 388 F.2d 821 at 825 n. 8.
Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is toxic to both human and marine life in even moderate quantities. PCP contains dioxin, which has been tentatively linked to cancer in humans and other mammals. This PCP is not phencyclidine [ (phenylcyolohexyl) piperidine], or "angel dust", which is also designated by the initials PCP
The Coast Guard feared that vessel traffic would stir up any PCP that had settled on the bottom of the Channel
In Kaiser Aluminum, 5 Cir.1972, 455 F.2d 957, the Court denied a plaintiff's claim for damages after it had to close a portion of its facility when a barge negligently severed a gas supply pipeline owned by a third party. The Court denied recovery:
"We agree that recovery by Kaiser is precluded as a matter of law because there.

The Eleventh Circuit has followed this Court. In Kingston Shipping Co. v. Roberts, 11 Cir.1982, 667 F.2d 34 (per curiam), cert. denied, 1982, 458 U.S. 1108, 102 S.Ct. 3487, 73 L.Ed.2d 1369, that Court stated flatly: "Robins made clear that a party may not recover for economic losses not associated with physical damages." Id. at 35. The court denied any recovery for losses that shippers incurred after a vessel's wreckage blocked the port of Tampa
In Hercules Carriers v. Florida, 11 Cir.1983, 720 F.2d 1201 (per curiam), the Court, following Kingston, barred recovery by the vessels trapped in Tampa Bay. Judge Thomas Clark concurred specially, calling for en banc reconsideration of Kingston. Judge Clark stated that Robins is essentially a contract, not a tort case. According to Judge Clark, Robins merely held that when A is prevented by C 's negligence from fulfilling his contract with B, B can sue A for breach of contract, but not C for negligence. Where there is no A for B to sue in contract, Judge Clark argued that Robins should not bar suit against C. He urged the court to reject the physical/economic distinction for injuries in favor of the usual "foreseeability" and "remoteness" rules of tort law. The Eleventh Circuit reheard Hercules en banc, but affirmed by an evenly divided court (6-6). 11 Cir.1984, 728 F.2d 1359 (en banc). Because no opinions accompany the affirmance, we do not know if the six affirming judges voted to affirm because they found that the result was mandated by Robins, because they believed the physical damage rule was a good rule, or because they found the plaintiff's damages too remote under even traditional tort doctrine.
For a discussion of Stevenson and the denial of recovery because of a judicial desire to prevent potentially unlimited liability for negligence, see Comment, Foreseeability of Third-Party Economic Injuries--A Problem in Analysis, 20 U.Chi.L.Rev. 283, 286-87 (1953)
Courts also worry about the possibility of double counting damages if parties removed from the physically damaged plaintiff were allowed to recover. Justice Holmes summarized the law of damages as follows: "The general tendency of the law, in regards to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step." Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Lumber Co., 1918, 245 U.S. 531, 533, 38 S.Ct. 186, 62 L.Ed. 451. See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 1977, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707, holding that direct purchasers may recover treble damages from an antitrust wrongdoer, but indirect purchasers may not. Robins avoided double counting of damages by allowing only the injured party to recover.
The problem of limiting claims here is akin to limiting fire spreading from one house to another from a defendant's negligent spark. New York at first denied recovery for any burning structure, a rule consistent with Robins. Ryan v. New York Central R.R., N.Y. 1866, 35 N.Y. 210. New York then allowed recovery for the first structure burned. Webb v. Rome W. & A.R. Co., N.Y. 1872, 49 N.Y. 420. Other jurisdictions have rejected the Ryan rule altogether. See Prosser, Wade & Schwartz, Torts: Cases and Materials 332 (7th ed. 1982)
Judge Merhige recognized this difficulty in the litigation concerning the contamination of the Chesapeake Bay from the dumping of the toxic chemical Kepone: "[T]he set of potential plaintiffs seems almost infinite". Pruitt v. Allied Chemical Corp., E.D.Va.1982, 523 F.Supp. 975, 979. In ruling on a motion to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim, Judge Merhige allowed the claims of both the fisherman and the marina-operators (as "surrogates" for recreational fishermen), and disallowed the claims of boat salesmen
Justice Holmes attempted throughout his judicial career to restrict liability as much as possible. See G. Gilmore, The Death of Contract 14-17 (1974). This concern for limiting liability is out of step with contemporary tort doctrine
A plaintiff might be able to recover under public nuisance for blockage of the channel through which his ship was to sail. See note 31 and accompanying text. Yet under this Court's extensions of Robins, the plaintiff's claim would be dismissed
Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Flint, 1927, 275 U.S. 303, 48 S.Ct. 134, 72 L.Ed. 290
Commentators have long criticized the Robins rule, usually for the reason that negligent interference with contract is more appropriately treated under traditional principles of negligence. See Harper, Interference with Contractual Relations, 47 Nw.U.L.Rev. 873, 885-89 (1953); James, Limitations on Liability for Economic Loss Caused by Negligence: A Pragmatic Appraisal, 25 Vand.L.Rev. 43, 56-57 (1972); Note, Negligent Interference with Economic Expectancy: The Case for Recovery, 16 Stan.L.Rev. 664, 689-92 (1964); Note, Negligent Interference with Contract: Knowledge as a Standard for Recovery, 63 Va.L.Rev. 813, 818-23 (1977); Comment, Foreseeability of Third-Party Economic Injuries--A Problem in Analysis, 20 U.Chi.L.Rev. 283, 286 (1953)
The rule is also heavily criticized because it denies recovery when the "pragmatic objections" have little or no application:
"In other cases there will be just a single loss, although the plaintiff's identity and possibly the time of his injury are clouded by uncertainty. When that is the case, liability should not be denied on the basis of the pragmatic objection, and when all the elements usually required for an action grounded on negligence are present, it is submitted that liability should be imposed."
James, supra, at 57-58 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).
Another exception allowed a master to recover damages as a result of the loss of his servant's services through negligent injury. Mineral Industries, Inc. v. George, N.Y.Sup.Ct.1965, 44 Misc.2d 764, 255 N.Y.S.2d 114. Although the notion of master-servant has fallen into disrepute, Nemo Foundations, Inc. v. New River Co., W.Va., 1971, 155 W.Va. 149, 181 S.E.2d 687, courts have expanded the common law rule that a husband may recover damages for the loss of consortium resulting from torts committed against his wife. A wife can now recover damages for loss of consortium when her husband is injured. See W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts Sec. 125, at 888-90 (4th ed. 1981). Contracts were protected at common law against interference by torts such as fraud and slander. Note, Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations in the Nineteenth Century: The Transformation of Property, Contract, and Tort, 93 Harv.L.Rev. 1510, 1511-12 (1980)
See Newlin v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co., Mass.1944, 316 Mass. 234, 54 N.E.2d 929, allowing recovery for mushrooms ruined by cold after the temperature control was interrupted by a telephone company's severance of power lines
The exception was purportedly grounded on old admiralty cases that allowed recovery, cases which Robins had not explicitly overruled. See Carbone v. Ursich, 9 Cir.1953, 209 F.2d 178, 179-80
In In re Lyra Shipping Co., E.D.La.1973, 360 F.Supp. 1188, the defendant negligently blocked a canal, forcing the two plaintiffs to incur transportation costs not contemplated in their contracts. The court allowed recovery for wasted fuel and other costs, whether these were borne directly by the carrier or indirectly through the contract by the shipper:
"I believe that both the statutory 'nuisance' doctrine and ordinary maritime tort law provide viable bases for recovery in this case. Under either rationale, it is plausible to argue that plaintiffs ..., who incurred such additional expenses as extra fuel costs, wages, and the like can recover those damages upon proper proof, and I so hold."
Id. at 1191. The court noted in dictum, however, that a shipper could not recover for the profit he would have earned had the contract been completed. Id. at 1192 n. 4.
The Lyra court's award of damages is consistent with a narrow reading of Robins. Strictly construed, Robins held only that the charterer would not recover for the prospective income or profits that he would have received had he been able to use the ship. The question therefore naturally arises if a plaintiff could recover for added costs rather than lost profits. In a search for exceptions to Robins, some courts have held that the case applies only to lost profits. See Note, Negligent Interference with Contract: Knowledge as a Standard for Recovery, 63 Va.L.Rev. 813, 820 (1977).
In In re China Union Lines, Ltd., S.D.Tex.1907, 285 F.Supp. 426. In that case, the M/V Union Reliance negligently collided with the M/V Berean in the Houston ship channel, and the channel was closed for two days. The court in China Union allowed the plaintiff to recover for loss of profits, additional fuel and other supplies consumed, additional crew hire paid, tug hire incurred to turn the vessel, debt time for longshoremen ordered in Houston, and other substantial expenses. The Court found that the vessel's owner owed a duty to all those using or seeking to use the ship channel not to obstruct their passage. The court also held that a collision in the narrow channel would delay all traffic, and that plaintiffs could recover damages that were incurred because they were denied normal access to the channel
The Court noted that had the subcontractor sued in his own right, the suit would be barred as an action for lost profits under a contract:
"The present case is not a suit by McWilliams for the lost profits which it might have earned from the use of the dredges had they not been detained by the delay in the backfilling. To such a suit Robins would squarely apply. The case at bar is a suit by the "owner" of the pipeline project seeking reimbursement of expenses incurred under its subcontract when the project was delayed."
453 F.2d at 1204.
It is difficult to distinguish McDermott from Kaiser Alum. & Chem. Corp. v. Marshland Dredging Co., 5 Cir.1972, 455 F.2d 957 (per curiam). In Marshland, the Court cited Robins and then denied recovery after the defendant's dredging operation punctured a high-pressure gas line to the plaintiff's plant, causing the plant to shut down.
In Dominion Tape of Canada Ltd. v. L.R. McDoald & Sons, Ltd., [1971] 3 Ont. 627, the court explicitly discussed the distinction between added costs and lost profits. The defendants in Dominion Tape negligently caused a power failure that forced the plaintiff to cease manufacturing midway through a working day. The plaintiff paid his employees for the lost time, as required by their employment contract. The judge allowed recovery for the "positive outlays" to the idled workers, id. at 630, but refused to permit recovery for the "mere deprivation of an opportunity" to earn profit from the employees' work, id. at 629
The references in the first paragraph of the discussion are to Rederi A/B Soya v. Evergreen Marine Corp., E.D.Va.1971, 1972 A.M.C. 1555, aff'd, 4 Cir.1972, 1972 A.M.C. 538, and Federal Commerce & Navigation Co. v. M/V Marathonian, 2 Cir.1975, 528 F.2d 907, cert. denied, 1976, 425 U.S. 975, 96 S.Ct. 2176, 48 L.Ed.2d 799
See Petition of Kinsman Transport, 2 Cir.1968, 388 F.2d 821, leaving "rock-strewn path of 'negligent interference with contract.' " In Kinsman II, the Second Circuit held: "Cargill and Cargo Carriers argue broadly that they suffered damage as a result of defendants' negligence and we will deal with their claims in these terms instead of on the more esoteric 'negligent interference' ground." Id. at 824. Instead, this dissent argues that many of the plaintiffs here are entitled to recover under conventional analyses of negligence, proximate causation, and foreseeability. See id. at 823, explaining, "[W]e hesitate to accept the 'negligent interference with contract' doctrine in the absence of satisfactory reasons for differentiating contractual rights from other interests which the law protects"
See Note, Negligent Interference with Contract: Knowledge as a Standard for Recovery, 63 Va.L.Rev. 813, 822 (1977) ("Recently several courts have joined in the attack on Robins..... In re Kinsman Transit Co. is the leading case in this movement".)
Marathonian applied to the rights of time charterers, a factual situation more difficult to distinguish from Robins than was that of Kinsman II. Moreover, this limitation of Robins to time charterers comports with generally accepted notions of fairness--despite the usual harshness of the Robins rule--because time charterers can easily contract with the ship's owner, who would be entitled to recovery, for their protection. In Robins, for example, the shipowner settled its claim against the shipyard; the charterer could have contracted for a share of any such damages. Application of the Robins rule to the original context and to the facts of Marathonian therefore comports with a sense of fundamental fairness
Judge Sneed also based his holding on the traditional deference accorded to fishermen under maritime law:
"This long recognized rule [the right of fishermen to recover their share of the prospective catch]...."
Id. at 567 (quoting Carbone v. Ursich, 9 Cir.1963, 209 F.2d 179, 182). Judge Ely dissociated himself from the "unnecessary" maritime section of the opinion. Id. at 571.
I would go further than Oppen in repudiating the applicability of Robins. Oppen allowed the fishermen to recover--a result that all on our Court seem to agree with--but the opinion fails to draw a very convincing line between the rights of fishermen and the rights of others who draw their living from the water. Certainly the injury from the oil spill to others who make their living upon the water, such as boat charterers who are unable to put to sea, is as foreseeable and as direct as the injury to the fishermen. It is therefore unclear why these parties should not also be entitled to recovery. The court did attempt to distinguish fishermen in that they "lawfully and directly make use of a resource of the sea, viz. its fish, in the ordinary course of their business". Id. at 570. Yet, if those who make use of a "resource of the sea" are entitled to recovery, then it seems a fortiori that those who make use of the sea itself in their business--a boat charterer, for example--would be entitled to recovery. Nor can Oppen 's restricted recovery be explained in terms of special property rights in the fish. No one owns a wild animal, or fish, until achieving capture, and under this rule, the fishermen had no rights to the fish superior to those of Union Oil. See Epstein, Nuisance Law: Corrective Justice and Its Utilitarian Constraints, 8 J.Legal Stud. 49 (1979). After reminding us that no one owns a wild animal until after achieving capture, he argues:
"[S]o it is with unowned fish in Oppen. The plaintiffs who do not own the fish cannot complain if the Union Oil Company captures them. As they cannot complain of capture, they cannot complain of destruction after capture. As they cannot complain of destruction after capture, they cannot complain of it before capture. No theory of tortious liability can make up the plaintiffs' deficit attributable to their want of ownership."
Id. at 52. See also Posner, Some Uses and Abuses of Economics in Law, 46 U.Chi.L.Rev. 281, 305 (1979).
The Oppen court's stopping point is no more logical than that of courts that have followed Robins 's extensions. Today, the majority has difficulty in justifying recovery for fishermen while at the same time denying recovery to all other parties. This difficulty highlights Oppen 's failure to have a conceptually tenable stopping point for the imposition of liability and the denial of recovery. If Oppen is consistent with Robins 's extensions, it is only because Oppen attempts to limit liability on as arbitrary a basis as Robins 's progeny.
The Supreme Court has expanded the rule that physical contact and injury are not necessary for plaintiff to recover damages. America Export Line v. Alvez, 1980, 446 U.S. 274, 100 S.Ct. 1673, 64 L.Ed.2d 284. There, the Court allowed a wife who sustained no direct personal physical injury to recover for her losses caused by injuries sustained by her husband when injured as a result of the defendants' negligence. See Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Aurora Air Serv. Inc., Alaska 1979, 604 P.2d 1090. In Alyeska, the defendant, Alyeska, contracted with RCA, which in turn contracted with the plaintiff, Aurora Air Service, to provide services necessary for RCA to fulfill its contract with Alyeska. All the contracts were terminable at will. When Alyeska modified its contract with RCA, RCA was forced to terminate its contract with Aurora. Aurora alleged that Alyeska had initiated this chain of events to harm it and claimed contract interference. Id. at 1092-93. The trial court gave judgment for Aurora, and the Alaska Supreme Court affirmed. The court held that a case for tort liability was established by proof that a contract was intentionally disrupted. Id. at 1095. See also Moorhead v. State, La.Ct.App.1977, 353 So.2d 1103, 1105, allowing the plaintiff damages for mental anguish caused by witnessing a trespassing bulldozer remove five trees from her property
A recent article asserts that applications of Robins only appear to have created the requirement for physical injury. Rizzo, A Theory of Economic Loss in the Law of Torts, 11 J.Legal Stud. 281 (1982). Professor Rizzo has as his central hypothesis that courts' allowance or denial of recovery for economic loss can be explained by the absence or presence of the opportunity to reallocate losses contractually. According to Professor Rizzo, courts have established a rule that, by denying recovery in certain types of situations, will encourage contracts of indemnity between the physically injured party and those suffering pure economic harm. Id. at 291-97. Similarly, courts permit recovery when it would be difficult or impossible for the parties to form such an indemnity contract. This rule, in turn, reduces litigation costs. Id. at 282. In the passage most apposite to the present case, he says:
"1. Common Property Resources. When property rights are not clearly established as, for example, with respect to fish in streams, rivers, and oceans, channeling costs are virtually infinite. Since no one owns the relevant resource, it is not possible to direct losses through the party suffering injury to his property. Under these circumstances, we would expect the law to permit recovery for economic loss so long as the expected litigation costs are not too high.
....
"Union Oil Co. v. Oppen is the most famous and important of recent common property resource cases."
Id. at 298-99.
Professor Rizzo goes on to say that the court allowed only the claims of the fishermen because recovery by "people who suffered inconvenience in not being able to sail out in their boats presumably could not recover"--"The litigation costs would be too high." Id. at 299. We go beyond Oppen, and beyond Professor Rizzo. We would allow recovery based on particular damages, proximate cause, and foreseeability rather than contractual position.
The majority's opinion in this case suggests that the plaintiffs have drawn an old sword by arguing that Robins should not be extended to cases such as the one at hand. It is true that in the first part of the century there were a number of calls to limit the approach of Robins, but the applicability of those arguments to cases such as the one now before this court is unclear. The clarion call of the earlier movement was an article by Professor Carpenter in the Harvard Law Review on negligent interference with business relations. The proposal in Professor Carpenter's work was for a tort of "interference with business relations for all intentional invasions and at least some negligent ones". Carpenter, Interference with Contract Relations, 41 Harv.L.Rev. 728, 729. The movement may have gone further than the majority acknowledges. See Perlman, Interference with Contract and Other Economic Expectancies: A Clash of Tort and Contract Doctrine, 49 U.Chi.L.Rev. 61, 63-69 (1982). Courts have increasingly allowed recoveries for interference with contract, although this area of the law has developed piecemeal and is badly fragmented. Id
Putting aside that question, the success of the movement for a tort of interference with contract is largely irrelevant to the merits of the doctrine I advocate here. Many of the claimants here are entitled to recover under the conventional tort doctrines of proximate cause and foreseeability. There is no need for these plaintiffs to rely on any doctrine of negligent interference with contract.
A public nuisance is a wrong that affects or interferes with an interest or a right common to the general public. The interference, however, must be more than an infringement on the interest of many people. It must interfere with a right common to all members of the public. Restatement (Second) of Torts Sec. 821B comment g (1977) elaborates:
"g. Interference with public right..... [T."
As Dean Prosser has written:
-02 (1966).
It is well settled that a public nuisance can arise out of conduct that is merely negligent. Id. at 1004. In Piscataqua Navigation Co. v. New York, N.H. & H.R.R., D.Mass.1898, 89 Fed. 362, for example, a railroad was held liable for failure to prevent a bridge from falling into a navigable stream. Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that an obstruction of a navigable channel was a public nuisance that would give rise to a cause of action for damages:
"[A]lthough this right of navigation be a public right common to all, yet, a private party sustaining special damage by the obstruction may, as has been held in this case, maintain an action at law against the party creating it.... In both cases, the private right to damages, or to the removal, arise out [of] the unlawful interference with the enjoyment of the public right, which, as we have seen, is under the regulation of Congress."
State v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 1855, 59 (18 How.) U.S. 421, 431, 15 L.Ed. 435. There is no reason to believe that the "public right" would be limited to navigation of the stream. It could include drawing fish from the sea as well.
The usual reason given for this requirement was that the plaintiff did not and could not represent the king, "and the vindication of royal rights was properly left to his duly constituted officers". Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va.L.Rev. at 1007. It seems to me, however, that the reasons were primarily practical. Courts wanted to limit access so that their time would not be consumed with complaints about public matters from a multitude of people who alleged they suffered some damage. This is especially true when damages are trivial. See id
Carver v. San Pedro, L.A. & S.L.R.R., S.D.Cal.1906, 151 Fed. 334; Piscataqua Nav. Co. v. New York, N.H. & H.R.R., D.Mass.1898, 89 Fed. 362; Page v. Mille Lacs Lumber Co., Minn.1893, 53 Minn. 492, 55 N.W. 608; Wakeman v. Wilbur, N.Y.1895, 147 N.Y. 657, 42 N.E. 341; Gates v. Northern Pac. R.R., 1885, 64 Wis. 64, 24 N.W. 494.

"[T]he long standing rule of law is that a private individual can recover in tort for invasion of a public right only if he has suffered damage particular to him--that is, damage different in kind, rather than simply in degree, from that sustained by the public generally. Concededly, the line between damages different in kind and those different only in degree from those suffered by the public at large has been difficult to draw. But the Court is persuaded that the commercial fishermen and clam diggers have sufficiently alleged "particular" damage to support their private actions.
.... The injury of which [the commercial fishermen and clam diggers] complain has resulted from defendants' alleged interference with their direct exercise of the public right to fish and to dig clams. (citations omitted).

A marina could not recover for losses from the poor business or closure of its restaurant or a gift shop because these businesses do not provide a vital service to a primary maritime industry
A marina or charterer located adjacent to a cordoned area would not recover; because marine access is still available, though impeded, these businesses can continue to operate
I would not allow recovery for bait shop that derived only a small fraction of its business from the condemned area. These businesses sustain losses that may be small or even de minimis. The businesses may also be in a good position to recover some of their losses through efforts in their other markets.
Bait shops that had long-term contracts would be unable to recover under Robins. I would limit Robins to express contracts
A "fishermen's exception" blunts some of the sharpest aspects of this harshness, but it is theoretically difficult to justify that recovery while denying the claims of others similarly situated
The majority criticizes foreseeability because it necessitates a case-by-case determination of liability. But this criticism of "foreseeability" as the criterion for judgment applies with equal force to well-established tort law for physical injury. The unquestioned concepts of foreseeability and proximate cause as established in Palsgraf and its progeny are open to the same condemnation that the majority makes of a rule of liability that would abandon Robins:
"The result would be that no determinable measure of the limit of foreseeability would precede the decision on liability. We are told that where a claim is too remote, or too tenuous, recovery will be denied. Presumably then, as among all plaintiffs suffering foreseeable economic loss, recovery will turn on a judge['s] or jury's decision. .... The point is not that such a process cannot be administered but rather than its judgments would be much less the product of a determinable rule of law."
Majority opinion at 1028.
The majority opinion favors a bright line rule, as opposed to a case-by-case determination of liability, because it enables courts to "adjudicate" rather than to "manage". A bright line rule such as the one the majority proposes, however, requires no adjudication whatsoever. Judges need merely to preside over a self-executing system of limited liability where recovery is predicated upon an easily determined physical injury. The application of such a rule, rather than a case-by-case determination, seems more "management" than adjudication.Monkey Forest Road | Green House Guest House, Ubud, Indonesia, Ubud

Utah at Houston
Time: 8 PM ET, Mar 17, 2014
Spread: HOU -13.5
Total: 205
Betting odds courtesy of Bovada
The Houston Rockets are 44-22 on the season and currently seated 4th in the Western Conference with a 1.5 game lead on No. 5 Portland. The Rockets, however, have lost its past three contests heading into Monday night’s showdown with the 22-45 Utah Jazz. NBA oddsmakers are heavily favoring the Rockets, favoring Kevin McHale’s squad by 13.5 points.
The Rockets’ skid has come against some quality competition. Oklahoma City, the surging Chicago Bulls and Miami all won by eight points or more. James Harden dropped 30 points on the Heat, but it wasn’t enough, as Chandler Parsons has struggled badly recently. Parsons has shot just 11-of-37 over the past three games and against the Bulls he was a putrid 1-of-11. Though the bulk of defenses’ attention is focused on James Harden and Dwight Howard, Parsons is crucial towards the Rockets’ success. On the season, the 6’9″ small forward is averaging 16.2 points, 3.9 assists and 5.5 rebounds per game, but over his past 10 games he is averaging just 11.4 points per game on 35.7 percent shooting.
Howard is looking more and more active, like the player he was in Orlando. The league’s best center is averaging 18.6 points, 12.4 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game, and he’s helped Houston vastly improve its defensive efficiency.
The Rockets will continue to search for the perfect 4-man to pair with Howard, but in the meantime, Terrence Jones has made a compelling case for that role. The second-year forward from Kentucky is posting the third-highest PER on the team (18.0) while averaging 11.4 points, 7.1 rebounds a game, shooting 53.7 percent from the floor and 31.3 percent from behind the arc. Ideally, that three-point percentage should climb another four or five percent, and that would make Jones a very Rashard Lewis-like complement to Howard.
Utah fell 122-104 to San Antonio last night (Sun Mar 16), despite an impressive game from power forward Derrick Favors. Favors posted 28 points on 12-of-19 shooting while also grabbing 10 rebounds and getting three steals. The Jazz are hoping center Enes Kanter evolves into the franchise center, but he struggled badly against the Spurs’ D. Kanter hit just 3-of-11 from the floor, though he did grab 11 rebounds (six offensive). Kanter is shooting 49.6 percent from the floor, which is a mark he should be able to vastly improve on given his soft shooting touch and immense size/length.
The Jazz did select another big man to develop in Rudy Gobert, and Gobert is another physical freak with high potential. The real future for the Jazz still likely lies in what the team does with its 2014 draft pick, as it projects to be very high. With Joel Embiid on the board, Gobert and Kanter both could be gone, and Utah also has to do decide what to do with Gordon Hayward. If the Jazz select either Andrew Wiggins or Jabari Parker, it’s doubtful Hayward will be resigned.
UTA Trends: UNDER 4-0 in last 4 following SU loss of 10 points or more; UNDER 5-0 in last 5 games following ATS loss; UNDER 11-2 in last 13 road games.
HOU Trends: 0-4 ATS in last 4 when opponent allows 100 points or more in previous game; OVER 4-0 in last 4 following an SU Loss; 0-4 ATS in last 4 games overall.
Head-to-head: UNDER 7-2 in last 9 meetings; UNDER 6-2 in last 8 meetings in Houston; Jazz 11-5 ATS in last 16 meetings in Houston.
Recent CommentsWhat are germ weapons?
Biological or germ weapons are living organisms adapted for military use and intended to cause diseases or death in human, animal, or plant life.
They tend to be agents made up of organisms which are highly contagious and rely on this and their ability to reproduce to achieve their potentially devastating impact on a target.
What germs are involved and how are they delivered?
There are a wide range of techniques and agents that can be used in germ warfare.
Diseases which could be spread among an enemy include anthrax, forms of plague, smallpox, yellow fever, forms of Ebola and botulism. A biological agent can come in several forms, including a bacteria, fungus, virus or toxin.
Even very small quantities of an agent can cause very painful death. It has been estimated that a few grams of some viruses, if distributed effectively, could kill millions. There are also concerns that developments in genetic science could be used to make these weapons both more virulent and more difficult to combat.
The most likely way to deliver biological weapons would be in the air, using some form of aerosol delivered by a missile, aircraft, or shell. There is growing concern that terrorist groups might resort to such weapons, and could use them to contaminate food and water supplies. In all cases, though, the effective deployment of such weapons is difficult.
Have they ever been used?
Historically, attempts have been made to spread disease among the soldiers or population of an enemy.
During the 14th Century for example, armies besieging a city might have catapulted plague-infected corpses over the city walls. There are also accounts of Europeans knowingly spreading smallpox or measles when trading with native Americans during the 17th and 18th Centuries.
In the 20th Century many nations have conducted research to develop suitable military biological agents and there have been numerous allegations of their use.
German forces are believed to have used them in World War I. During World War II the Japan used biological weapons against China and experimented on prisoners or war with germ agents.
There have been persistent but unproven allegations that the US military used biological weapons against the Korean and Chinese armies during the 1950-53 Korean War. The Soviet Union is alleged to have used germ agents in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
The Iraqi army is believed to have used germ and chemical agents 1987-88 during a campaign against the Iraqi Kurds. In the 1990s five hidden germ warfare laboratories and stockpiles of anthrax, botulism, and gas gangrene bacteria were discovered in Iraq.
British experiments with anthrax led to the contamination of the Scottish island of Gruinard, which has only recently been declared free of the organism.
Which countries have them?
About a dozen countries are thought to by western analysts to have clandestine biological weapons programmes. Among those who have ratified the Biological Weapons convention, they are China, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Russia. Others about whom there are suspicions are North Korea, Egypt, Syria, Israel, and Taiwan.
The US, UK, and France have decommissioned their offensive biological weapons capability, but retain a defensive and research capability in this area.
Are they a threat?
Along with chemical weapons, biological weapons have been described as "the poor man's atom bomb". They strike fear in the hearts and minds of soldiers and military planners because of their potentially devastating effects, the fact that they can cause a particularly unpleasant death, and the fact that they are very difficult to defend against. The other great concern is that they are indiscriminate.
For that reason there have been growing concerns about their use by terrorist groups against civilian populations. It is thought, for example, that the Aum Shinrikyo sect in Japan was experimenting with such weapons.
Having said all that, it is still very difficult to create really effective biological weapons and to deploy them. And for that reason some analysts regard the threat from them as more theoretical than actual.
Who signed up to the 1972 treaty?
The Biological Weapons Convention has been signed and ratified by 143 countries. It bans the production, deployment, possession and use of such agents.
The convention was agreed in the early days of modern multilateral arms control. There were no policing or verification provisions because, in the depths of the Cold War, it was thought that there was little likelihood of getting agreement on policing anyway, and at the time biological warfare did not receive the same priority as superpower nuclear arms control.
But concern about Iraqi biological weapons programmes placed this issue much higher up the international list of priorities. Also the fact that Russia admitted that, in the early 1990s, the Soviet Union had built up huge biological weapons stockpiles, despite being one of the depository powers of the convention.
Why is the US now backing out of attempts to enforce the 1972 treaty on chemical and biological weapons?
The US says it still fully supports the treaty, and efforts to make it more effective. It just believes that the current protocol is unworkable.
Biological weapons are a particularly difficult problem because they are so easy to hide. The new protocol would attempt to balance the need for an effective inspection system with the desire of many countries to protect legitimate pharmaceutical industries and biotechnology installations.
Washington says the protocol does not improve its national security because it will not be able to stop determined cheaters, while at the same time it can be used by others to spy on its commercial secrets. It says developments in biotechnology need new thinking in terms of policing.
There are reports that it wants to propose curbs on biotechnology exports, for example. But it has yet to come up with detailed alternative proposals. And most of its main allies argue that, while the protocol will not be perfect, it is worth pursuing.
BBC defence analyst Nick Childs says that despite its protestations to the contrary, the administration's position in these negotiations has fuelled suspicions that it is deeply sceptical about the value of a whole range of international accords, whether on arms control or the environment.

There was much debate about this on a Teddy Bear Artist forum I belong to a couple of weeks ago. Someone "pinned" a bear and it was not welcome. For them it was a privacy issue.
It was decided that if t was OK to "pin" that the logo was to be added to the Guild members page.
I have that logo posted there on my page, and on my blog.
I guess maybe that is where it will have to go with Pinterest. If "pinning" is welcome add the logo.
Hey Z,
I just wrote a bit about this on my blog. I don't have a Pinterest account, but I see my photos popping up there. At first, it was a little flattering, but quickly, it got "spooky"....how was I going to be able to protect my photos??? I wonder how far all of this will go...it is infringement...absolutely.
Robyn
I truly understand your pain as this is so conflicting. On one hand...I love saving all these inspiring photos in one spot...and then on the other...I'm always stunned to see my own photos out and about...especially with no reference to their original source. So...what to do? I don't know the answer...don't think Pinterest will be going away anytime soon. I will be interested to follow the comments to your post. Being a grownup isn't what it is cracked up to be!
Z, I just had an email exchange last night with a lovely follower who alerted me that the images on my photography website could be pinned. I freaked out because my website is supposed to have safeguards in place to prevent people from even right clicking and copying my images, much less being able to pin them. I mostly freaked out because the images on my website, unlike my blog, don't have watermarks on them, and they are also high res images which I don't use on my blog.
I have no issues with people pinning my low res images and linking back, I appreciate the exposure and see it as a great marketing tool. I wrote to my web provider and asked them what the heck?!...and why could people pin my images from my website without my permission...so we'll see what they have to say. I do have to say that when the article stated that when you pin something you get the full res image she may be incorrect about that. When you pin off of my website you do not get full res images, but they are still larger than what I would allow or be comfortable with, but not particularly useful for much else. But I also use software that allows me to track my images to see if someone is trying to use them illegally...like claiming them as their own, and unfortunately all photogs need to do this because of the web.
I think it's only a matter of time before we see Pinterest in the news, not being lauded for its greatness but because it is embroiled in a major lawsuit...or someone using it is being sued. I don't agree that it's the same as Napster though, for a number of reasons.
Ok, I wrote a book to say that I too have qualms about Pinterest, but like you, I'm still on the fence!
Kat :)
i have been torn about this issue too....your link is definately informative... recently i have been pinning only pins with a direct link (not from tumbler!)...that is a very small attempt at not feeling guilty about this?? i wonder of pinterest will survive...it has grown sooo fast...the thing is, i really enjoy it and use my pins for inspiration...i am sooo fickle.
you have brought up a very valid discussion...i like that about you, my friend.
erin
xxoo
I have a friend who has been urging me to join Pinterest, and I have been putting it off. Now I am glad I haven't thanks to your post and the link. I read as much as I could of all the legal jargon, but bottom line, the ethical points are too hard to ignore. I feel for everyone who is "addicted" to the site, but best just go back to cutting and pasting from magazines, etc. Thanks Z.
Hi Z,
Well, I haven't joined Pinterest but I do re blog images from other blogs. I always say where I found them but, that's obviously not enough. There are many of my own photographs that have been reblogged or pinned on Pinterest and, I see my own images all over blogland with no credit to me so, how can we solve this? I don't give a **** whether people use my images, but I do understand if it's someones livlihood. I guess this debate will run and run. XXXX
Thanks for your comments re:pinterest. Took me a while to get on the bandwagon but haven't done much. Will wait before I do any more pinning. I do not shop Walmart for all of your reasons. Haven't been to one since 2003 when my mom passed. she loved the prices and just "looking.". glad you brought up the topic for discussion.
Oh gosh, I love Pinterest and had thought I was using it for personal reference. So tired of the stacks of magazines and clippings...easy to get caught up in the pinning. I thought I was giving credit to the wonderful talent in this world and always try to pin with direct links of my source. I don't want to give up my account but I'm with you...copyright infringement is just stealing.
I'll be interested in the outcome of this topic. Thank you for bringing it to our attention.
I appreciate your angst about this. I have wondered about this ever since I began blogging. I have learned a lot about blogging by looking at other blogs as well as following tutorials. I saw quickly that everyone used photos from everywhere but they always cited the source. I assumed it was fine. I took it for granted that Pinterest was the same. I agree with some who say that if you even use the internet for your work then you are accepting an inherit risk but, that doesn't mean I have to be involved in taking your work! So, as someone who values integrity (doing the right thing even if NO ONE knows), I have to really make a decision about everything I am doing. Gosh, just when I was feeling comfortable too.....
Katherine Tyrell's blog, Making a Mark, has 2 posts about 3 to 5 days ago that tells how stop people from pinning your blog photos in Blogger and Flickr using the Pinterest code.
I think Pinterest arose out of so many bloggers all ready posting photos without the proper credit/permission. There didn't appear to be a big whoop about it until Pinterest making money hit the news.
here are bits of my replies to comments, and you can see why I am struggling with this. My friends will tell you, I don't just ponder something, I examine and dissect and stomp on it till it's dead.
Some replies from me to comments so far:
I want to go back and take down my photo of Robert Downey JR, I feel so guilty not giving credit but I was going for the laugh
Now pinterest could go a long way to avoiding these issues by providing a linked pin that would "give auto permission" to use a site such as mine and not use a site where the owner does not wish to be pinned. Lord, we can land stuff on Mars, can't we do this the right away....
It is a real head thumper issue for sure. Lots of discussions, good points and facts everywhere in blogland. After discussing with a friend, I stumbled upon this post.. No matter how many excuses I make for it's positive effects, I am still nagged by that moral issue of permission, not so much the legality but that is scary also. An old school friend's college kid got whacked by the illegal download of music. She was at a very prestigious school and got randomly selected. Court costs and years of fear ended up in a reduced settlement for her of 5,000 in fines. Far less than the hundreds of thousands, but still hard on a 20 something woman..
so head thumping continues..thanks for weighing in...
Ye gads, another modern dilemma... Like tv..when is it too much, when does it raise the social conscience and enrich lives and better conditions ? I abhor "tech readers" for books, because I fear the demise of books, but if it makes people read...ARGH!! headache returning....
and now all those apps people download are legally saving and storing personal info because people blindly signed the Terms of Use. It's a brand new world folks...
But at least we are discussing it and trying to figure out fairness...and that is cool...
I was trying to decide this am if my life has grown exponentially complicated as I aged or as the world changed? I think you know I do attempt to keep my world small and spend most of my free time in the pursuit of helping others and often I feel I am living a "true" life but then some issues tend to bunch up on me and throw me a huge learning curve...But now instead of struggling alone in my chair in my bedroom I put it all out there and wise women like you help me sort it through to a satisfying conclusion.
thanks my friend
don't thank me, I am only the messenger..I felt a mite funny about it all when I joined but ignored that nagging voice because I have enjoyed it so much..as I said I hate being a grownup some days but I have to live with me and that nagging conscience will not shut up! Now if there was only a moral dilemma about sugar so I would be forced to give it up. sigh... oh yeah..my health...
keep the comments coming girlfriends. I obviously need help!!!
much love,
z
I respect that you stand up for what you believe in...I have been to blogs where most (if not all the photos) were copyrighted to someone else, with no acknowledgement of that fact. I've been to blogs where quotes were used, no acknowledgement. I was following a blog from a Mediterranean country...the blog owner used photos and pages of description from a book I had just finished reading, with no indication that the words and photos were not hers. I've had concerns about Pinterest...but I've had times when it would not allow me to pin something from the web. And anything I pin from my own personal creations I expect to be used as other peoples creations. The very fact that I'm on the web in any application puts me in the position of having everything that's me stolen. I do my best to treat other people online the way I want to be treated...that's the best I can do.
You've done the right thing Z.
I would admit I am guilty of looking but I have never joined.
This post is so honest and heartfelt it speaks for many of us.
Susan x
I can't read the link right now, but will tell you that I'm really concerned about it all too.
HHMMMMMMMM interesting. I'm torn. I'd want to do the right thing too. Any way, I may or may not have mentioned you and your tatas in my blog today;)
~Debra xxx
It was such a hard decision for me, but like a band aide, I just hit the delete button and I'm trying not to think about how much I'll miss Pinterest. I had only been on for 4 months! I wondered from the first pin how it was even legal, but figured they knew what they were doing (dumb me). Your article link was an eye opener. I'm not debating it, I just did it. I have a seriously high regard for artist that keep art alive. I personally do "old" crafts. Paper cutting, english smocking, quilling. The thing is, I don't want to take a chance I have someone's art pinned without their permission, it's not right and I consider myself moral and don't want the risk even. Heavy hearted I am no longer a "pinner" :( Boo Hoo. Thank you for the article link.
So much to think about and consider. I will have to read that article and think some more on it. It's a new world where we can 'infringe' on someone so easily and don't mean too! Good post!
hugs, Linda
Hi Suzan...I just discovered this...wondered if you'd read it already!
It's about Google and privacy changes!
Oh brother! This is exactly why I never started a blog. It seemed like it all started out just for fun then it became very competive. Once money is involved in anything the party's over. No I don't have an account on Pinterest. Really I just looked at that as one more place I would start piling up crap that I don't even remember I have. When something becomes this complicated in my life I tend to toss it. With all the stress in life this just isn't worth it. Well, that's my opinion haha.
Kathy
My dear thoughtful Z, you have compiled a set of issues I have had from the start. I have not joined the site because of them. I have folks tell me they pin my images frequently and I do appreciate that but are others not telling me? I have never used anybody else's images on my blog except for my daughter's. I spend so much time right here on the blogs frankly I do not need another enchantment anyway especially with sticky moral and legal problems. olive
i learned a LONG time ago that if you post it on the net, it is out there for anyone to comment, copy, or steal..this includes, ebay, etsy, blog, website, facebook, webshots, etc etc etc..right or wrong..i think it's just one of those things that is going to happen. i feel that you just have to 'know' it could happen, and therefore, dont post it if you dont want it to happen. it's a downside, for sure, but it's just like people coming in your booth at a show and taking pictures of your items...they do it, they copy it, they make money off it, ?? such is life on the net.
after a show, i blog about where i've been, i show tons and tons of picures from the show...it is for entertainment, not for profit, and i always feel i'm doing them a favor...but?? maybe not?? it's a tough call.
there is now a code you can put on your site that will make your photos 'unpinable'...so add it if you dont want your stuff pinned.
funny, just today, i got 2 completely different messages from places i sponsor. one...NO MORE pinterest, and the other "tips to market your items on pinterest"...i guess everyone is gong to have a different opinion....sigh..
Dear Suzan, I just started blogging eight months ago, a newbie to the game.....keeping an interesting,glitch free blog, a business running, a son still at home and all the other daily challenges which arise keeps me hopping. I love Pinterest and honestly wonder how all you gals manage it all! I try to keep things simple, my magazine files are antiquated but work for me, I scan, save and go...I try to maintain balance in my life. It is no surprise to me, that you Suzan, being the person I have come to know in a very short time would be so conscientious and moral about all this..you will do the right thing..much love,N.xo
I opened a Pinterest account but didn't know you are not supposed to pin your own work! and that's exactly what I was doing until I got bored with the whole thing and stopped pinning or doing whatever I was doing. Glad I did!!! I have found pictures of mine in Facebook giving me no credit at all for it and it sucks! Very complicated matter, technology runs 100 times faster that law and lawmakers can!
And here I just joined Pinterest and I am pinning my own photos and linking them with my blog. I did read that there is a way to add code to your blog to block others from pinning photos from your blog but I have yet to figure out how to insert that. Apparently Pinterest made that available because of the issues you have brought up here.
Well, we haven't had a Great Debate for a while so it's high time we did... and this is a good one.
I am a hesitant user and like many, wondered how it could be alright but then figured that they must know something I don't know about the legalities. Foolish me.
It would be so easy if you could only upload your own photos and only re-pin what others upload but I guess that would be too complicated for the inventors.
It's all part of your "playing nice" thoughts... I'm thinking the thing to do would be to only pin your own, and look at what you like on others by Following them - kind of like what we do here... but that might be unwieldy....lots to think about Z, and thanks for the prod.
I'm with you; being a grown up sucks and sometimes doing the right thing isn't doing the fun thing, but once you know something, you can't un-know it.
I just spent the last 2 weeks ensuring my Pinterest pins went to the orig source THINKING that was responsible. What Pinterest tells us @
is to use Pinterest like this:
"Save your Inspirations!
Sha uses Pinterest to save design inspirations for his job. He can reference inspiring design work to share with his team at Trulia."
Their example of how we should use Pinterest. I'm feeling sick.
I wrote to Pinterest just last week suggesting two ideas to help credit the original source. No response back from them so far.
Why not send Pinterest a link to your blog post, z, and ask them to enlighten us.
Z.
I'm going to think hard on it too. On the up side, if I do delete my account, my house will probably be a lot cleaner. :)
Just deleted my Pinterest account. After reading one article after another on copyright infringement & Pinterest's policies. So sad. I loved it... but that's the way the Pinterest crumbles.

You're right dear Z - growing up sucks. And having a conscience, morals, and ethics sucks even more.
What a timely post my friend. I came across Kristen's article a few days ago and, as a fellow attorney, I think her analysis and conclusions are spot-on. I shied away from Pinterest from the git-go - I "peeked" a few times but certainly didn't need another addiction - and I was even more troubled by the copyright issues. I was seeing more and more blogs posting photos that simply said "from Pinterest" and absolutely no link or any way of tracing back to the original artist/creator. Hello? And even if there are links back - so what?).
Anywho - thanks for posting this. I hope some folks take heed - because, as Kristen says,.

I guess I will just pin my own photos.

In this not only the persons in the first line are taken into measure but all that stand in a certain area of the line. Depending on tactic and quality of the fighters this relation varies. Usual rates: sort persons per meter short weapon 1,5 long weapons 1 Reserve and runner 1,5 sum: 4 the line (depth) the long and semi-long weapons: They should stand in two steps distance to the first line (about 140 cm) all following lines hold the same distance the reserve: They should have a distance to the spears of 2 m and about 3,5 m from the first line. distance to the opponent There are three disctances to teh opponent the appears most often (measured from the body middle of the front fighter): The threatening distance is a distance where a passing of the opponent without notice is impossible. no view back can be done without danger.

You enter a new relationship, thinking everything will be filled with puppies and rainbows. You smile thinking he’ll treat you like the princess you deserve to be.
This was what was on my mind when I started seeing this man. It was a journey I did not imagine – one that would change me forever. At the age of 17, I didn’t know anything about abusive behaviour, red flags, and most importantly, sexual consent.
This man was very charming. He was a smooth talker. He knew how to make himself look good.
For a few months, we emailed each other. I would go to the local library every second day after school in anticipation for an email from him. We also texted each other when we could.
I don’t remember exactly what he said to me, but he had me hooked. He was that smooth.
He had separated from his long-term partner who he had a baby with. He was feeding me stories about how she was a psychopath. I believed every word.
He came to Sydney for a week and stayed with me. Prior to him arriving, I let him know that I was a virgin and I wasn’t ready. He said he respected that. I smiled when he said that.
All of that changed on his second night in Sydney.
It was the first time I had shared a bed with the opposite sex. He hid a condom in my bookshelf, and it was that very moment I realised he was going to take my virginity.
We did not talk about sex. We did not talk about what our expectations were. We did not talk about sexual consent.
I do not remember everything about that night, but I remember the shock and pain which happened during sex. I remember putting my hands on his pelvis, trying to push him away because the pain was unbearable. He was too strong and I felt so helpless. I gave up and allowed him to further penetrate me until he was satisfied.
He never once asked if I wanted this. He never checked on me to see if I was okay.
His own satisfaction was his ultimate goal.
I was wearing my Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games t-shirt and I left it on the entire time. I loved that t-shirt, yet after that night I hated it. He had ruined it by creating a memory I did not want it to be associated with.
The worst thing was my baby sister hearing everything because we shared the same bedroom. She was 10. She didn’t need to be exposed to what was happening a few metres away.
I woke up the next morning and I was still in pain. I was still in shock; my brain kept replaying the entire night. I was also emotionally and physically exhausted.
I got out of my bed and went to the bathroom. I had a hot shower to wash him off me. I tried washing my lady bits but I couldn’t because it hurt so much. After getting dressed, I grabbed a bag of frozen peas and wrapped it in a towel. I went back into the bathroom and placed it on my lady bits. The coldness coming from the frozen peas was the comfort I needed.
I still did not know how I felt about having my virginity taken away so suddenly.
He was sitting in the lounge when I walked back to my room. I left him to his own devices whilst I took the sheets off my bed. There was blood on the sheets and I felt disgusted at the sight of it. It was clear evidence of what had happened the night before.
These sheets were my favourite, only to be forever ruined by this memory I did not want.
Walking into the lounge, he smiled at me and said, “You’re shining like a diamond. Last night was amazing”.
I remember that moment so clearly because it was also when my brain was still replaying the night like a broken record. It was also when I felt so dismayed at the audacity of this man. I smiled the best I could and went on with the day.
How dare he do this to me.
The next night, we were sleeping on the sofa bed in the lounge when he asked for sex. I said no. He pleaded. I still said no. He asked why. I knew I had to be straight up with him, so I said I was still sore and I didn’t want to have sex. He wasn’t happy yet he asked for a blowjob. I wasn’t comfortable with the thought of having a penis in my mouth, so I said no. He grumpily went to sleep. I shrugged and went to sleep.
The rest of the week with him was a blur; however, I had sex with him few more times because I felt obligated to.
I remember being dismayed one morning when he said, “Hey Sherrie, last night was bloody amazing. Six times?! Wow.”
I could only remember the three times we had sex the night before — but three extra times? That had me baffled. Until much later on, I realised there was a very high possibility he had raped me throughout the night but I couldn’t prove it.
He went back home. I think I was still in a state of shock because so much happened that week and I didn’t have any opportunity to process everything.
I saw him again in April during the Australian Deaf Games. Again, that week was a blur. Whenever I did not want sex, he would plead until I gave in. By the end of that week, I was conditioned to give sex whenever he demanded for it.
He had already cheated on me numerous times prior to the Australian Deaf Games with the mother of his kid and he continued doing that after the Games when he went back home. I remember asking him why and he said he wanted to see his son. A pathetic excuse.
Something did not feel right. Who would use sex to see their kid?
I left home a month shy of turning 18 and moved up to Brisbane. That first night in Brisbane, I was so exhausted because I did not get a wink of sleep on the XPT train. I was staying at his house, and we had sex and I fell asleep straight after. Approximately 2 hours later, I woke up to find him penetrating me anally. He felt so heavy on me and I couldn’t do anything to stop him so I let him continue until he was satisfied.
It was the most disgusting I had ever felt. I went straight into the shower and cried. I vowed not to allow him to have anal sex with me ever again.
It happened again. And again. Every time it happened, I would experience diarrhoea afterwards. Sometimes I would bleed from my arsehole. I hated it so much. I had told him numerous times I did not like it, yet he continued to rape me anally. The last time he raped me anally, I shat on his penis. He was wearing a condom, yet I shat on him. I was angry with him for ignoring me when I told him I did not like it so I chose to shit on him.
I don’t regret shitting on him. He deserved it.
He never once asked if I liked anal sex. It was always about him.
He used movies to invite me over so he could have sex with me. Every time he asked me to come over for a movie night, I would always think about what movie we would watch and what food we would eat. Not sex.
He would use numerous excuses to coax me into having sex with him. Excuses such as:
- I have blue balls and they need to be emptied.
- Couples should have sex every second day. It’s the rule.
- I need sex so I can sleep well.
It was late August when I realised I needed to stop seeing him. I had turned 18 the month before and I wanted to experience life. I needed to have a life without him. I also knew I deserved to be treated better.
I carried the trauma into my next relationship, where for the first few months I projected it onto my ex partner. The silver lining was that he was very patient with me and he taught me the behaviour, particularly with sex, I was exhibiting was inappropriate. If it wasn’t for him, I would have kept projecting my trauma onto other people. I am so very grateful for Tim* who showed me boundaries, consent and respectful sex behaviour for the two years we were together.
However, I carried this trauma with me for so long. I did not process it until five years ago when I saw a presentation on dating abuse at the deaf mental health conference in Melbourne. It was that very moment I realised I needed to finally process the trauma and start my healing journey.
I am now at this stage in my healing journey where I feel comfortable with sharing my experience with you. Thank you for taking your time to read this and for supporting me during my healing journey thus far.
I look forward to sharing more with you x
Tim* is a pseudonym (fake name) as I don’t want to disclose his real name to protect his privacy.
Oh my god. I”m really sorry it happened to you and I’m glad you came out of it. Thank you for sharing your story.
I’m so sorry to hear that has happened to you. I was a survivor of child abuse. So trauma is a very complex thing to deal with.
I’m sorry that it happened to you. Hope you’re doing ok.
Thank you, Danny 🙂 I am doing well — writing this has really helped me to unpack and process my trauma.Whether or not she’s expecting baby number 2, Beyonce has certainly been busy lately: On top of touring the world with the Mrs. Carter Show and being the face of H&M’s summer campaign, she’s also been working on a special project to bring her sartorial expertise right to our very own closets.

INGREDIENTS
I don't use any particular brands, and sometimes I like to mix milk and white chocolate chips. You can use whichever you like - milk, white, dark or a mix!
My mix of white & milk chocolate chips which add up to the required 3/4 cup measurement.
Mix all the dry ingredients together. I like to use scotch finger biscuits for this recipe but any sweet biscuits work. Stir everything so the dry ingredients are evenly mixed. Set aside.
Add butter, condensed milk and vanilla essence to a small pot and stir over low heat. Ensure the mix doesn't boil.
Once the butter has melted, remove from heat and quickly stir through the dry ingredients
Once the dry and wet ingredients are thoroughly mixed, the mixture should look moist and a little sticky, like this.
Press evenly into a small tray and refrigerate for 1.5hrs (minimum) or overnight.
When the slice has set in the fridge, it is time to melt the chocolate to top it off. I take the slow approach via microwave at 50% power. I stop and stir every 30 seconds, it probably takes 4-5mins.
Spread the melted chocolate all over the top of the slice and return to the fridge for an hour or two (or longer)
Once set, remove the marshmallow slab and slice into squares. Depending on how generous your squares are, you should get 40+ squares out of this mix
Store in an air-tight container in the fridge although it probably won't last long! Enjoy!!
- 250g packet of sweet biscuits crushed
- 3/4 cup mini marshmallows
- 3/4 cup desicated coconut
- 3/4 cup chocolate chips

- 1 tin condensed milk (395g)

The ConversationSpring style from baggallini, the handbag brand that’s part of R.B. Barry’s growing accessories segment.
Pickerington, OH—R.G. Barry Corp., owner of Dearforms slippers and baggallini handbags, said today that its third quarter net profit rose nearly 85% as sales in its accessories division increased offsetting sales declines in footwear.
For the quarter ended March 30, the company said net profit rose 84.8% to $1.5 million, or 13 cents a share, compared to $800,000, or 7 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
Net revenue increased 2.7% to $25.8 million With gross profit as a percent of net sales widened to 45.9% from 44.6% one year ago. Selling, general and administrative expenses were down 2.9% from the equivalent period last year at $9.6 million.
“The strong performance of our accessories segment and its contribution to our operating results combined with benefits realized by eliminating under-performing components of our footwear business add to the viability of our evolving business model and position us for significant growth in the next three-to-five years,” said Greg Tunney, president/ceo.
Slipper Sales Edge Down
In its footwear division, the company reported net sales were down 4.1% to $16.4 million, reflecting fewer shipments to mass and off-price customers. Nine-month net sales declined 12.1% to $94.2 million, reflecting, in part, the impact of the company’s decision last year to eliminate some under-performing elements of its footwear business, loss of its seasonal men’s slipper business “in a national department store chain,” and reduction in the size of some seasonal club programs vs. 2012.
In its accessories segment, which includes baggallini leathergoods and the recently acquired KIVA brand, the company saw sales increase 17.3% (up 15.2% to $27.4 million in its first nine months). Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in its accessories segment widened to 56.3%.
“The accessories segment generated operating profit of $2.1 million for the quarter, up 44.4%; and $5.4 million for the nine months, an increase of 13.3% over the previous year,” the company said.
Tunney said that the company is investing in its “platforms and our people. We are expanding into new and underserved markets. And, we are seeking out and acquiring successful accessories brands that can help propel us to the next level. We are quite confident that we can achieve our growth and profitability targets for the businesses.”
Although Tunney said the company’s 2013 performance will not match its record-setting one last year, “we will end fiscal 2013 on June 29 as one of our industry’s top performers.”At last I've finished the memory quilt for my second child's 21st birthday although I am late by about 18 months!

ANAHEIM, Calif.—Mace CSSS on April 1 announced it had acquired UL-listed wholesale central station, The Command Center, Inc. by purchasing all of the company’s stock. TCCI is a UL listed wholesale central station located in Corona, Calif. Financial terms of the stock acquisition were not disclosed.
According to Mace CSSS VP and GM Morgan Hertel, the acquisition brings 20,000 accounts from 70 dealers to the Mace fold, and adds an undisclosed amount of RMR to Mace’s coffers.
Hertel, who used to be vice president of TCCI, had been pushing for the acquisition and feels the two companies make a good fit.
“Originally, when I was in the dealer business we moved our account to TCCI back in mid ‘90s. One thing led to another and I ended up managing the place for six years. When I left TCCI two years ago we had some initial conversations but nothing came from it then. I knew most of the owners for 20-plus years so there has always been dialog back and forth,” Hertel told Security Systems News. “Recently we came to a place where they wanted to focus on their core businesses and not running a central station at the same time … However, it was more than just my idea. Mace is committed to growing, the funding is in place, Dennis Raefield likes the business, and for the old TCCI owners it made sense because of the long history with me.”
Mace acquired its central station piece, CSSS, in 2009. The acquisition of TCCI represents the company’s first expansion since then. Hertel said corporate management at TCCI would not continue on with Mace CSSS, but would, instead, focus on their individual alarm companies. Site managers would stay on, however, and along with dealers would benefit from Mace’s portfolio of services.
“It’s a good fit because most of the team at TCCI were staff members hired by me when I was there and I know most of the dealers. It’s a little like getting re-married to your ex: You know all the good and the bad and now you have an opportunity to both work on the shortcomings to make a much better relationship moving forward,” Hertel said. “Over time the dealers will be migrated to our stages monitoring platform, which, compared to what they had, will blow them away … All the local site mangers are staying and will have a whole other level of opportunities—like remote video monitoring, two-way audio, and GPS—at Mace.”With its release just around the corner, the maketing machine for 'Oblivion' is in full swing. After a soft start, the trailers have gotten increasingly interesting and two newly released TV spots are no different, selling a big, epic sci-fi action movie that looks genuinely mysterious and intriguing. Watch the spots below!
The first spot feels like a variation on the last trailer, setting up a ruined, post-apocalyptic world and establishing Tom Cruise as a sort of futuristic maintenance man, keeping an eye on things before getting pulled into some kind of crazy adventure involving Morgan Freeman (and chases and explosions). The second spot is the more surprising of the two, not only because it features of a shot of the Moon getting destroyed (!), but because it suggests that Freeman's mysterious (antagonistic?) character not only knows who Cruise's character is, but has big plans for him.
We've said it before and we'll say it again: the marketing for 'Oblivion' is proof of how to sell a blockbuster while keeping it mysterious, showing us enough to get us excited while holding back just enough so we don't know every plot beat when we enter the theater. It's a fine line and one that we wish 'Star Trek Into Darkness' was walking a little better.
'Oblivion' opens on April 19th. You can watch the spots under this sentence.Virtual DJ Studio gives you a mixer-board interface to mix the music file.

Calvin Pryor
School: Louisville
Position: Safety
Height: 5-foot-11
Weight: 207 pounds
In the past, the NFL's most fearsome strong safeties were often compared to missiles: one-direction defenders that seek and destroy. Calvin Pryor certainly has some shades of that -- he can certainly lay down the hammer.
For the former Cardinals safety, though, a more apt comparison is a dive-bombing bird of prey, best when reading, anticipating and driving toward the line of scrimmage aiming not to collide with the target, but snatch or strike deftly. This works best when he's playing in a shallow zone coverage or when he's coming down to blow up a play in the backfield.
Pryor's biggest issue is anything going away from the play, situations where he has to drop straight back or play the single-high safety role. Pryor can read plays and has good enough straight line speed, but his fluidity makes him vulnerable in those spots. Although, he has shown glimpses of being a ball hawk, which at least helps the bird metaphor.
Prospect Breakdown
From what I saw from his Louisville tape, Pryor showed all the makings of a player that thrives when coming down into the box and trying to jump routes and blow up plays. It's the type of role fans have seen from the likes of Kam Chancellor, Troy Polamalu and -- a closer size comparison -- former Indianapolis Colts safety Bob Sanders.
Pryor isn't the type of safety who can sit back in center field and use his range to close on plays like Ed Reed. He's athletic enough, but his pass coverage chops are simply not there yet. Louisville utilized him in that role at times, but didn't get great results. For the most part, the Cardinals had him moving forward toward the play rather than having it come to him.
Pryor has a headhunter's reputation, one that I think is a little unfair. The first play in this cut-up of his game against UConn is a good example of how he can come down against the ballcarrier, but also draw flags (He was called for a personal foul after the play, but I think it's questionable).
Athletically, Pryor has solid measurables. His 4.58-second 40-yard dash at the combine wasn't great, but is comparable to Reed's mark of 4.57 seconds. He's fast enough.
When it comes to safety play, success is more predicated on the ability to process quickly, anticipate and react, a quality that Pryor showed on a regular basis. More than just coming into the box on run support, Pryor showed great closing speed in jumping routes and breaking up short passes.
The way Pryor finds away to slip into the backfield on the biitz (as well as his normal safety position) is impressive. He's strong coming off the edge to go after the quarterback, but it's the way he can slip blockers to create traffic or get to the ballcarrier where excels the most. For example, on this play against Rutgers, Pryor lines up outside the defensive end, comes down, gets past the fullback and makes the tackle in the backfield.
The aspect of Pryor's game that I like the most is that he can come up and crowd the line of scrimmage, show blitz and then drop right back into coverage. This has such a significant impact if a player has the athleticism and awareness to pull it off. It's similar to the impact that a player like Polamalu has on the field, the idea that he can be at the line of scrimmage one second and then covering a receiver over the middle the next.
Outside of playing in the box, Pryor has some issues. He doesn't take the best angles on ballcarriers at times and I've seen him bite on some play action. In coverage, once again, he's best when he's coming down to short to intermediate routes. He's not incompetent when playing in a deeper zone coverage, but his best plays there occur when jumping out/corner routes and the like. He's also good at sniffing out screens. Pryor is simply a different player when he's playing back deep and defender rather than trying to wreak havoc. He can be picked on by QBs when used in such a role.
I can't recall a time where I saw Pryor line up in man-to-man coverage. He'll be an absolute project there. He won't be in a position to match up on a tight end, but could improve in that area.
In terms of ball skills, Pryor wasn't the most productive or consistent defender in that area, but he's very capable. Any concerns in this area should be directed to this clip, in which he intercepts a pass from potential No. 1 overall pick Blake Bortles with one hand while falling out of bounds.
One of the biggest criticisms of Pryor is that he's not a good fit for the free safety role and would have to be in the right situation to flourish. Fortunately for the Patriots, one of those situations happens to be in New England.
Where would he fit in New England?
Pryor could be the strong safety the Patriots have been waiting for.
In recent seasons, the Patriots have had one of the smallest safety units in the league, a trend that continued last season with Devin McCourty and Steve Gregory as the starters. However, with Gregory gone, the door is now open for the back end of the defense to add some beef.
Currently, the Patriots have 2013 draft pick Duron Harmon as the starter heading into the offseason. Harmon's a solid, young option, but still doesn't give the team the stronger, in-the-box safety that they've lacked over past seasons. Barring the return of Adrian Wilson in a significant role in 2014, the Patriots have a need at strong safety.
Even if his role would be limited early in his career, Pryor would serve as an excellent foil to McCourty, who excels in that deep safety role. Pryor's presence would give New England that high-low safety combo in cover 1 and cover 3 looks that teams like the Seattle Seahawks have found great success with. In a perfect world, Pryor could develop into the Chancellor to McCourty's Earl Thomas role. This would be predicated on Pryor improving as a cover man, especially in man-to-man, but he's a good enough athlete to make that transition, just not right away.
On top of his defensive duties, Pryor can also contribute on special teams, particularly kickoff coverage, where he continued to play during his senior season.
Where could the Patriots draft him?
Pryor has been projected to be a first-round pick by most outlets. He'd be a solid value at No. 29 if he falls.

An early work directed by Anthony Mann ("Raw Deal")
that leaves a bad impression, giving few clues to his
future greatness. After sitting through a ridiculous
tale that is filled with plot holes as large as
California, a contrived happy ending is suddenly
thrown in without being earned. This oddity cheapie
film, making its way in the world of noir, was flatly
photographed and the screenplay lacked polish.
Nora Goodrich (Brenda Marshall) is a dedicated
research scientist at the Mindret Wilmott Chemical
Institute in New York, where she's occupied with her
breakthrough experiment for a new anesthetic and also
looking forward to marrying her scientist colleague,
Dr. Stephan Lindstrom (William Gargan), upon the
experiment's conclusion. While backing out of a
garage, Nora accidentally knocks down a drunk woman,
Jane Karaski (Ruth Ford), who mistakenly walked in her
path. The woman is only mildly shaken, but
ambulance-chasing attorney J. W. Rinse suddenly
appears and gives Jane his card and urges her to sue.
Nora drives the woman home and gives her $25, quite
sure everything is okay. That night Stephan comes over
to Jane's apartment and proposes marriage for tomorrow
because the institute is transferring him to their
Paris office immediately. Nora says she can't marry
him until the experiment is completed. Stephan tells
her to think it over and leaves when Nora's beautiful
lab assistant Arline Cole (Hillary Brooke) enters,
she's here to assist an unauthorized experiment at
home as the anxious Nora forgoes clinical tests to
test the formula out on herself. While asleep, the
formula was tinkered with by Arline and it explodes
just as Stephan returns to pick up his briefcase he
accidentally left behind. Stephan puts out the flames,
but Nora is taken to the hospital and suffers from
severe burns to her face--leaving her disfigured.
Arline then uses the opportunity to come between the
couple and schemes to get Stephan to fall for her, as
she has the hospital prevent Stephan from visiting her
and bad mouths Stephan for deserting her because she's
no longer pretty. Nora leaves the hospital and is
confronted at gunpoint by a crazed Jane, who tells her
that the lawyer said the suit is worth $25,000 and
demands that money. When Nora says she doesn't have
that kind of money, Jane steals her engagement ring
and wallet but Nora tussles with her and in the
struggle Jane falls to her death off the penthouse
balcony. The dead woman is identified as Nora, so the
real Nora decides to go to Los Angeles for plastic
surgery and assume Jane's identity. After a year in
the hospital, Jane reads in the newspapers that Arline
married Stephan. She returns to New York unrecognized,
where she gets hired by Stephan to be his research
assistant by coming off as Nora's best friend since
they studied chemistry together at the University of
Vermont. Nora soon learns that Arline caused her
disfigurement and acts to win Stephan back. The two
are planning to go to Paris together without Arline,
when Nora's arrested at the airport for the murder of
Nora, as the shyster lawyer points her out to the
police so he could collect the reward. The nightmare
story ends in the police station with a bogus surprise
ending that left me feeling used.

Dennis Schwartz: "Ozus' World Movie Reviews"
SCHWARTZHuman
Mira took a swig of water from her canteen as she looked out over the herd from atop Shidow, her mount and lifelong friend. The drive this year had been a hard one. The weather was sour and the cattle restless. The other drovers complained at camp, but they would never admit to tiring before the beasts. It was a point of pride. The sound of an alarm in the cattle driver's creole cut through the air and Mira shook off her thoughts. A branch, fallen from a tree, had scared several beasts out and away from the main herd at a start. She read the situation in a glance and made eye contact with two other drivers. Without a word they pulled around, one falling into place to hold the line, the other moving with her as one to begin the pursuit.
Humans are a race of social explorers. Their ambition and wanderlust have led them to inhabit all kinds of spaces across the world. Those who do not travel and bring their people to new lands instead seek new heights of knowledge, insight, wealth or power. This drive also pushes humans to adaptation and experimentation; language, lifestyle and personal beliefs are all open to change. Though they live shorter lives than other common races, they make up for this in their tirelessness in pursuit of their goals.
People of the Plains
Humans' exploratory nature sees them comfortably inhabit every kind of landscape, but they thrive on the open plains their race grew up on. The flat landscapes made it easy to hunt and scavenge for sparse prizes and the clear air nurtured the communication and cunning that eventually lead to the great human civilizations of today.
Naturally Empathetic
Humans have inherently strong senses of empathy, which underpin their interactions with all beings. Though this can be repressed or damaged by ambition or trauma, even the most hardened human will struggle not to "catch" a contagious yawn or sense of panic. This knack for feeling the experience of others often earns humans a reputation as being manipulative or gullible or both.
Innovative And Adaptable
The human drive to reach new heights in all fields has crafted in them a sense of versatility and experimentation. Humans are skilled lateral thinkers and are at home using tools and situations in unexpected ways to achieve new results.

2I made this recipe because we got sweet potatoes, carrots, and onions in our CSA box, and I was so happy I did. One problem with some lentil soup recipes, at least in my book, is that their veggie content is fairly minimal - so while they're certainly still one of your healthier lunch options, there's still a little something lacking. This recipe solves that problem by combining a small amount of red lentils with lots of carrots and sweet potatoes to create a comforting bowl of orange soup. It's great because you get lots of flavor and vitamins from the vegetables, but the soup is also more hearty than a veggie-only soup because of the lentils. Definitely don't skip the squeeze of lemon at the end - the acidity really brightens up the flavor. Serve this alongside a piece of bread for a super tasty lunch.
Curried Sweet Potato, Carrot and Red Lentil Soup with Ginger (adapted from Dinner with Julie, original recipe here)
Serves 4-6
Olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 T minced fresh ginger
1/2 cup dry red lentils
1 pound sweet potato, peeled and chopped (about 2-1/2 to 3 cups)
1 bunch small carrots, peeled and chopped (about 1 cup)
1 tsp garam masala or curry powder
4 cups chicken stock
Juice of 1/2 lemon
Salt, to taste
Plain yogurt, to serve
1. Set a soup pot over medium low heat. Add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Once the oil is hot, add the onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is very soft, about 10 minutes.
2. Add the lentils, sweet potatoes, carrots, garam masala, and chicken stock. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Simmer about 30 minutes, until the veggies are tender.
3. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until very smooth. Continue to simmer until the soup is as thick as you like it (I went another 20 minutes or so). Stir in the lemon juice, and then taste and adjust for salt - you may not need to add any if your chicken stock was salty.
4. Serve with a bit of yogurt stirred into each bowl.
looks wonderful
Tasty looking soup!
Oh wow...this is everything I love all in one bowl!!
I agree with Joanne - amazingly healthy and colorful ingredients all in one bowl. Too good to pass up...
this looks just lovely. a wonderful Autumny soup. bookmarked! (and thank you for stopping by)
Sara - this looks and sounds delicious! I'm totally craving hot soup all the time right now. I've never tried red lentils but I bet it works great here. It's funny you mentioned the lemon juice...I was just talking to my husband about this last night. I absolutely agree that it makes a huge difference in the final taste. That lemon juice just brings all the flavors out!Namibia is a paradise for birding enthusiasts. With habitats ranging from the dunes of the Namib, coastal wetlands and vast areas of savannah to the floodplains and waterways of Kavango and Caprivi, Namibia birding checklist boasts 676 of Southern Africa's 887 species.
In the lush Caprivi Strip, you will find exotic lilac-breast rollers, pygmy geese and African Jacanas. The pans of the Etosha National Park are a seasonal breeding ground for flamingos and home to 35 different species of raptors, including the lappet faced and hooded vultures.
Throughout desert regions, you will see huge nests in trees and on top of telephone poles these are the communal homes of the sociable weavers. Some of these homes have been recorded as being in continual use for up to 100 years.
Lastly, the Walvis Bay wetlands and Sandwich Harbor lagoons are RAMSAR sites, wetlands of international importance, that provide dry season refuge for many species, including much of Southern Africa population of flamingos and the rare chestnut banded plover. Namibia coastline also provides vital breeding grounds for the rare Damara tern.
Below is a list of popular birding destinations within Namibia.
Avis Dam
Avis dam is a five-minute drive from Windhoek City centre en route to Hosea Kutako International Airport. The area surrounding the dam offers visitors a range of habitats to explore, including sweet-thorn savannah and open grassveld, as well as the open water, shoreline and marshy areas created by the dam itself. Windhoek residents and their dogs frequently visit Avis Dam to take long walks around the waters edge and the neighbouring mountains.
Avis Dam is also a paradise for bird watchers. The sounds of the Kalahari scrub-robin, and the short-toed rock thrush often welcome visitors entering from the parking area. Just across the dam in the mountainous area, visitors may spot Monteiro hornbill, white-tailed shrike and a grey louries. During the summer, the European bee-eater and wallow-tailed bee-eaters migrate to the area.
Bushmanland
Bushmanland is home to the glorious baobab tree that supports a wide variety of bird life. Visitors can watch crimson-breasted shrikes, acacia pied barbets, red-billed buffalo-weavers and fork-tailed drongos fly past from under the trees shade. The best time to visit the Bushmanland is after a good rainy season. When the pan next to Holboom is full, you can find whiskered terns, white-backed ducks, comb ducks, fulvous ducks and Southern pochards. Marula trees attract fruit birds such as the Meyers parrot. A visit to the Nyae Nyae Pan gives visitors the chance to see wattled cranes as well as greater and lesser flamingos.
Bwabwata National Park
Bwabwata National Park is one of the best birding spots in Namibia. Birders who have been coming to the area for over 30 years continue to see new species on each visit. The Nambwa campsite is a popular area for birders to spot arrow-marked and Hartlaub babblers, swamp boubous and hurricane trushes. African fish eagle and African harrier hawks regularly patrol the skies over the along the Kwando River. Spotting rare species such as the dwarf bittern can be a real treat for the lucky visitor.
Caprivi
The Kwando, Zambezi and Chobe rivers of the Caprivi region offer birders a once in a lifetime opportunity to spot up to 425 species of birds. African fish eagle, long-crested eagle, African marsh harrier and the western-banded snake eagle rule the skies over this region. At night visitors may spot Pel fishing owl, African wood owls, African barred owlets and black-crowned and white-backed night herons. African pygmy geese can be seen moving between the water lilies. In the channels visitors can find pied, malachite and half-collared kingfishers. Just watch out for crocodiles and hippos!
Daan Viljoen
Daan Viljoen is a popular birding spot just 30 km outside of Windhoek, and can be enjoyed as a day trip or overnight experience. Day visitors will want to concentrate on the areas surrounding the dam where they can find the black and white mountain wheatear as well as golden-tailed, cardinal and bearded woodpeckers. Just behind the dam offers a prime area for viewing rockers such as the speckled pigeon, rock martins and pale-winged starlings. The endemic Monteiro hornbill is the star of Daan Viljoen Game Park, a must see for avid birders.
Etosha National Park
Etosha National Park is one of Africa's greatest wildlife parks and home to approximately 380 bird species. Of Namibia's 13 endemic species, 8 can be spotted in Etosha. The primary feature is the 6,000 square kilometer Etosha Pan, covering almost one quarter of the park. After the rainy season when the pan is full, it is spectacular and abounds with birds including flamingos, pelicans and rare blue cranes. The Halali Camp is the best place in Etosha for Namibian specials such as the bare-cheeked babbler, violet wood-hoopoe and Carp's tit. The open flats of Springfontein are good for spotting both double-banded courser and Temminck's courser while the Okaukuejo Camp holds several species more typical of drier habitats such as the southern pied babbler and the crimson-breasted shrike.
Impalila Island
Impalila Island lies at the eastern extremity of the Caprivi Strip and is bounded by the converging Zambezi and Chobe Rivers and a natural channel known as the Kasai. It is also one of the best birding spots in the world. A boat trip down the Chobe River is a memorable experience. Along the shore you can see white-crowned lapwing and long-toed lapwing and in the floodplains a variety of herons and egrets, including rufous-bellied heron and slaty egret. A walk along the floodplain may provide views of long-toed lapwings, yellow-billed storks and black-winged and collared pratincoles. A highlight of any visit to Impalila Island is spotting a Pels fishing owl along the walking trail on the island.
Luderitz
Luderitz is a charming town on the southern coast of Namibia known for its windy conditions and the magnificent outings it affords avid birders. Along the peninsula south of Luderitz you will find greater flamingo and African black oystercatcher. Luderitz is the only easily accessible area on the Namibian coast where African penguins are commonly found. Boat cruises past Halifax and Shark Islands are a must for visitors and especially birders, as they offer sightings of penguin, swift and Caspian terns, as well as albatross and petrel.
Mahango Game Park
Mahango Game Park is home to a range of habitats, from open water, floodplains and swamps to dry, dense and broad-leveled woodland. This mixture of habitats means that the park attracts over 410 different species of birds in an area less than 25,000 hectares. The woodland area is home to Swainson and red-billed spurfowls and Meveâ€™s Starling. Along the floodplains visitors will encounter the endangered wattled crane and slaty egret. White-backed night heron are also commonly seen in the area to the south of Kwetche picnic site. Bee-eaters including the blue-cheeked, swallow-tailed and little Bee-eaters are a photographer dream.
Walvis Bay
The Walvis Bay wetlands and nearby Sandwich Harbour, where fresh and salty water collide, are two of Namibia Ramsar sites. Regarded as two of the most important coastal wetland in southern Africa, not only for the large numbers of resident species found here, but also for the vast numbers of both intra-African and Palaearctic migrants found at these sites. The best time to visit Walvis Bay is from October to April, when the migrant birds have moved in from the Northern Hemisphere. Walvis Bay is renowned for the large numbers of lesser and greater flamingos. The area is also home to rare species such as the Damara tern, chestnut-banded plover, black tern, red-necked phalarope and black-tailed godwit.
Waterberg Plateau Park
The Waterberg Plateau lies east of Otjiwarongo and towers over the surrounding plains. Over 200 different bird species have been recorded here including spectacular black eagles and Namibia's only breeding colony of Cape vultures. The morning wakeup calls from the Bradfield hornbill and African grey hornbill, along with the spectacular scenery, make Waterberg Plateau a special place to visit.

Beginning and End(Quote) tradition is that 70 (or 72) Jewish scholars were the translators behind the Septuagint. The Septuagint was translated in the third and second centuries B.C. in Alexandria, Egypt.. However, the earliest version was 150 BC and included only a few books of the Old testament as they copied the OT to set up the basis of the Septuagint that Origen finished.
So the “legend” goes like this, .”
However,.
Even..
Thomas Gambill(Quote)?
Beginning and End(Quote), are even suggesting that perhaps the Septuagint translators were relying on Hebrew texts that predate what we currently have in the standard Masoretic text! If this is the case, it is quite possible that the New Testament writers were perhaps more accurate in quoting the “original” Old Testament texts than what we typically find today in most modern Bible translations of the Old Testament . Therefore, to charge that the New Testament writers were sloppy or fraudulent simply lacks the evidence..

Who were the sons of God and daughters of men in Genesis 6:1-4?”
Answer: Genesis 6:1-4 1) they were fallen angels, 2) they were powerful human rulers, or 3) they were godly descendants of Seth intermarrying with wicked descendants of Cain. Giving weight to the first theory is the fact that in the Old Testament the phrase “sons of God” always refers to angels (Job 1:6; 2:1; 38:7). A potential problem with this is in Matthew 22:30, which indicates that angels do not marry. The Bible gives us no reason to believe that angels have a gender or are able to reproduce. The other two views do not present this problem. and apocryphal and pseudopigraphal.

Josiah(Quote)” in Jude 7 that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah is the same as the sin of Genesis 6:1-4 claims too much, for the sin of sodomy is not the same thing as marrying a wife from another part of the universe! In fact, “in a similar way” does not compare the sin of the angels with the sin of the men of Sodom and Gomorrah; instead, it compares the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah with the sins of “the cities about them” (that is, Admah and Zeboiim; see Deut 29:23 and Hos 11:8). Thus the sins of Jude’s angels (Jude 6) and the sins of the five cities of the plain (Jude 7) are held up as warnings of the judgment that could come to others. The fall of the angels that Jude mentions is that which took place when Lucifer fell. To connect this fall with the time of the flood because of the proximity of the references in Jude 4-7 would demand that we connect the flood with the overthrow of the five cities of the plain. But the events listed in Jude are successive, not simultaneous: (1) the fall in eternity of Satan (Jude 4), (2) the preaching of Noah prior to the flood (Jude 5) and (3) the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah (Jude 6)..

The
From H1129; a son (as a builder of the family name), in the widest sense (of literal and figurative relationship, including grandson, subject, nation, quality or condition, etc., (like H1, H251,. suggestions —)(Quote) and were driven from the Garden their children had a natural fear of the people from before, from the low lands and this led to Cain’s plea for protection from these people when he was cursed by YHWH for having killed his brother.
Cain, Kain, Kane
Cain feared those outside of the area where he and his family lived and YHWH marked him in some way that led mankind, outside of this area where Adam and his family lived, to believe him to be a god. Yes, I am speculating, but feel this speculation in no way contradicts Scripture and does help to fill in missing links concerning the development of man and religion, pre-flood, and giving rise to the “mythological” tales that seem to appear in all previous records with the names changing but the tales very similar and very human. The people first created in the beginning were part of the overall creation, but Adam and Eve were created personally by YHWH Himself, not as a cooperate effort as before. Humans outside of the region of the Garden would have seen anyone from that region as gods, or as the children of God – the ‘sons of God’.
With Cain’s departure and with this special marking the people created after the human kind, would then have feared him making him the first god king – a god coming down among men. This marking by the Creator would not only save Cain’s life but give him power over the population of mankind and would be the reason he so easily convinces the peoples he once feared into great building projects. Cain was able to inspire these strangers to help him build the first cities. Why else would a population that Cain feared would kill him seem to so easily come under his command and direction?
(Genesis 4:16-17) And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD (YHWH), and dwelt (lived) in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
Cain was given a special mark, a mark that set him apart and put fear into the hearts of those living in the land of Nod. Where was this land of Nod? Outside of the garden of Eden, on the east side, we are told. Staying with the context of these verses we see that Cain first leaves the presence of YHWH and goes to live in the land of Nod, then we see he has a wife, not before, and then she has children with him. As a “son of God” he takes a wife from among men and has children.
He builds a city and names it after one of his children. This would suggest a work force and a population of considerable size, not some tribal unit of a few people in tents, nomads wandering about, and again demonstrates his rebellion against YHWH.
We see this system of god kings and building projects the world over, the Egyptian civilization being the most familiar, the modeled Babylonian Empire and before them all, the Sumerians — all originating in the Middle East, not Africa.
This is conjecture, of course, but I believe it to be much more believable than the idea of angels taking wives. Speculation is just that speculation and might make great movies or books, but it is still speculation. The idea that angels took wives, meaning they began to marry human women has turned from speculation to doctrine and is allowed to influence other teaching letting doctrines of devils into the Christian religious beliefs. My personal belief (speculation aside), however, is that when the son’s of Adam began to call on YHWH’s Name (Gen 4:26). A sure sign of acceptance, that they were the men called “sons of God”, just as we are called the “Children of god” today because of our acceptance of YaHshua as our Savior. Some attribute this to Seth but look closely, it is from the time Seth’s son, Enos, is born we read of this return to YHWH, “… men began to call upon the name of YHWH.” Nothing about Seth or Enos engaging in this, only that “men” began, in what appears as a return of worship, to call on YHWH, by Name. This marks the timing when this began to happen, true converts returning to their Creator, these “sons of god” eventually falling in their own wisdom, to the lust of the flesh and began to marry (take wives) from among the pagans and in this, like the great King Solomon, were led into false worship and the abandonment of the worship of YHWH. Solomon, of course, came after the great Flood but is a good example of what happened. Solomon did like they had done, backsliding to the whims of his pagan wives (1 Kings 11). Read about it, read all about it and you will see how the King, hailed as the wisest man ever, falls in his later years, turning Israel into one of its most religious periods of all time. The only problem, YHWH is forgotten, Solomon yields to the pleasures of his pagan wives and the result is a very religious nation worshiping all the wrong gods, worshiping the Elohim (gods) of men and man.
More False Teachings by Learned Men
I have a book in my possession, written by, Dr Henry Morris, God and the Nations, in which he makes a case for the “sons of god” being “demons”. I did not gain permission to quote directly from the book, so, I will use my own words to tell you what he presents. This is not a teaching exclusive to him for many of the Evangelical community accept this teaching too. So, what Dr Morris puts forward is not his own idea but the idea – imagination – of many others before him. The great Dr Schofield of the Schofield Reference Bible being one example having written on this long before Dr Morris wrote on the subject. The premise is the same as Dr Morris and Dr Schofield find common ground. Also, adding to this wrong turn in thinking and adding to the confusion is the writings of Zecharia Sitchin and his many books on how the world began.
Dr Morris states (page 33) that the “sons of god” were angels and that these angels were demons. He says these demons possessed women and that the babies they produced, through human fathers, were then demon possessed. This union of demons with women had some kind of nutritional response that led to them having children that became giants. Let’s not forget, this is coming from a man highly respected in the Creation Sciences. He has written several marvelous books on creation and proves his intelligence over and over again. This is the problem, lesser people, like me, would naturally think Dr Morris has it figured out and it took some time and research for me to discover one of my favorite people was deceived on this subject.
It is not my objective to discredit Dr Morris, he is a recognized scholar in the on going debate concerning creation/evolution, and has written a ton of material disproving the “theory of evolution”. Here, however, the doctrinal studies concerning the subject of angels is outside of his expertise. We see Dr Morris stepping outside of his zone of knowledge for some strange reason in support of this false teaching. If a mind such as Dr Morris can buy into this kind of theology then we should all take warning and pray, as followers of YaHshua, that we do not fall for such false doctrines of demons and of other fables.
If Dr Morris had only said this was speculation and was merely putting this out as a consideration for discussion then that would be different, but that is not the case. He scoffs at the scholars that have a different conclusion. Much of Dr Martin’s argument and conclusions concerning the “sons of God” in Genesis 6 contrary to the Scriptures, even denying what our Savior said concerning Spiritual beings not marrying nor giving in marriage (Mark 12:25). His reasoning goes something like this: Saying angels do not marry in heaven does not mean they don’t after being cast out of heaven (The Genesis Record, pages 166-167).
Next Dr Martin sides with the teaching that from this union of angels and human women came the “giants”, or the Nephilim going so far as to call them “half-angel, half-men”. It is relatively easy to dispel the idea that the “giants” (Nephilim) were the children of a woman-demon union. The scripture is plain and needs no interpretation, it states the there were “giants” on the earth at the time these “sons of gods” were taking wives – it is a time marker, when giants (Nephilim) were on earth — dragons, or dinosaurs, maybe (just a thought)? Dr Morris, of all people, should be aware of this possibility as a professional geologist. Having had access to tons of evidence opposing evolution, you would suppose he would have seen this as an alternative, but no, he takes the Scripture completely out of context to say these “giants” of that day were the offspring of demonic marriage unions with flesh and blood women.
There is evidence giants were roaming this earth and some of them were humans, men of stature, heroes, men of renown, great kings and such, but never is it suggested these were the progeny of a union between women and demons — this is a false doctrine of devils and demons. Ask yourself the question, “Would angels of Heaven, cast to the earth, rebelling by taking wives, still be called “sons of god”? Of course not, not then and not today.
Another problem, discussed before, is that of demons taking wives. The messiah indicates this cannot be, that when we receive our new bodies we will be “like the angels of heaven, neither marrying nor giving in marriage” (Mat 22:30). Dr Morris’ way around this is to tell us that the word used for “wife” can also mean “woman”. He tells us that the demons did not take wives but took women, and this by possession. He jumps so far off the path of what scripture is telling us it is hard for me to take anything he has to say about any subject, seriously and makes me question all of his conclusions on every subject. How can such a wonderful mind become so flawed? We should take this very seriously and as a warning to keep our minds open to our Father’s ability to keep our minds protected. For your own protection continue to pray, making a request for the blessing of our Heavenly Father’s Wisdom, not of the world’s view but of His. When men with greater minds than ours can fail and fall into this kind of flaw thinking we need to sit up and take notice and take the appropriate action that our minds are not compromised.
Big Deal, Who Cares?
Why is any of this important? So what if it is angels or men? Christ is all that counts, right? Well, yes, of course but if you can be led off in some other direction you just might be led off into worshipping “another Christ”, calling on another god and not the true God. Identifying these false doctrines helps to keep you sharp and not only that, we are warned of such things and it is a warning my friends, given over two thousand years ago to the followers of the Christ YaHshua..
Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 1 Timothy 4:1-2
Is this the explanation for Dr Morris, or Dr Schofield’s position? Doctrines of devils? Seducing spirits? It is a warning and a sign for the believers of the “…latter times…”. When reading the scriptures we are informed that there is such a thing as false teachings and doctrines of demons, that there are “seducing spirits” (not sexual, please) and we need to be aware of this. A warning such as this should prove to us how we must maintain our vigilance, centering our understanding around the Word of Truth. The deception by seducing spirits and demon doctrines is not laid entirely on the scholars, scholars that should know better, but also laid at the feet of lay-members. You have a personal responsibility in working out your own salvation and in the study of the Word (Php 2:12, 2 Tim 2:15).
 (Myths).
Are your ears turned from the truth? Does your ears itch to hear the next titillating thing? Does getting excited over fables and myths cause you to read more about the amazing possibilities than centering on the written Word of our Father and the plain statements of our Savior, YaHshua? Myths and fables, doctrines of devils and demons, false teachers, wolves in sheep’s clothing, and people of flesh and blood actually being inspired by Satan and his aides. This is all in your Bible as warnings against such things and to ignore what we are told, in advance, is to be foolish.
Do not be a follower of any man for we have but one head, and that is the Messiah, YaHshua and over Him our heavenly Father (1 Cor 11:3). Our Savior, and the message of salvation did not come from made up myths, made up stories and carries with it eye witness accounts of events proving YaHshua as Savior. Beware of those that use fictional writing in an effort to convince you of their doctrine giving demon angels credit for things they are not capable of. It is one thing to speculate within the frame work of the Bible – never denying its truth and authority over any theory or any speculation – turning such speculations into doctrine as though it is the truth is another matter.
“For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord YaHshua the Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.” KJV 2 Peter 1:16
“Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. I n their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up.” 2 Peter 2:2-3 NIV (writing fiction, Left Behind books come to mind as just one example?)
Even back in the days of the Apostle Paul and Peter there were warnings going out to the Church. We have had over two thousand years of the wolves at work, Satan, and seducing spirits working their deceptions. There has always been a body of true worshipers not overcome by fables, fiction writing, or doctrines of demons. Today we seem to be inundated with fictional (fable) writings with the excuse of reaching the larger secular public – as if the written Word of the Living God is not enough!
And through covetousness shall they with feigned words (made up) make merchandise (use) of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not (does not; KJV 2 Peter 2:3-6
“Through covetousness” is to say, “through greed”, a type of idolatry. “Feigned words”, is the same as “words made up”, like the fictional writings of the imagination. Making up things to steal disciples to themselves, making “merchandise” of those buying into their stories, they made up myths. This is going on today just as it was during the time the Apostles of YaHshua were teaching the Christ.
Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Acts 20:30
Sure, they tell you they do this to win converts to Jesus,the false and bogus name of modern Christianity, and I am inclined to believe them and their sincerity, but my Savior, Yahshua, in His written words and that of His Apostles tells me they are wrong – they have the wrong Messiah and are teaching a different Messiah as they mix manmade myth and fictional stories with Scripture. They preach JESUS and of course we know that this is not the name of our Savior, YaHshua, so they are off on the wrong foot from the start.
That aside we can see the key words is “…of your own-selves”, and “…speaking perverse things”. They do just that, and it is easily seen in their fictional books and writings. This attitude, this excuse for using worldly wisdom as opposed to biblical direction is also reaching over into the Christian music. Acting like “perverse” un-believers with the excuse of trying to reach the world. The music of modern Christianity has the sound of the music of the world and at times is just as perverse, especially among the young. Seeking disciples the Worlds way — conforming to the world, they say, to reach the world by copying what the World is doing. And this as an excuse for gaining converts? They search the world over, using modern technology, to gain converts to the other Christ, the other Messiah, making converts of the world, not to YaHshua but to a false Christ they call Jesus.
2Pe 1:16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord YaHshua the Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
2Pe 2:3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. (Their judgment is sure, it is coming)
2Pe 2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgement; (If angels cannot escape judgement how can we expect to escape?)
Read again in a modern translation:
“Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping”. NIV (2Pe 2:12-4)
“We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord YaHshua the Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty”. NIV (2Pe 1:16)(Name restored)

Sons of God Marry the Daughters of Men?
This is a subject I think I have covered with enough simple logic and scripture to combat the false notion that spirit angels married flesh and blood women. However, an article came out in a prominent Evangelical magazine that is fully entrenched in the Evangelical movement. They teach the doctrine of the Rapture and Imminent return, now, it seems, they also support the teaching that the “sons of god” in Genesis 6 really means, “angels of god”. This seems hard to believe when you see the truth they do present and the quality of their magazine, Midnight Call. I will be taking issue with their teaching about angels of God marrying flesh and blood women.
After reading their published article I was inspired to write another article of my own on this same subject again. This time I thought I would like to take a different approach – I will not get into all of the in and outs of every view but instead refer you back to my two previous articles (Go To: Angels Marry Women? Part 1 / Angels Marry Women? Part 2)
where you will find more detail in the debate exposing this false doctrine.
In this article I will rehash some things and attempt to make sense of the flawed thinking of others so well versed in the Scriptures themselves. In my previous articles on this subject I was a bit harsh, claiming the false doctrine is a doctrine of devils. I make no apology for this after all, what else could explain it? After all, I am using Scripture to make this judgement.
(1Ti 4:1) Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
Fire Storm of Error
The four main verses in the center of this fire storm is found in Genesis 6:1-4. When you look at these few verses from Genesis they are clearly being twisted to say something they do not say. It is my hope and prayer you will come to see this as clearly as I do. Now, let’s take a look at these verses and see what they are really saying and how they have to be twisted or added to in order to make a case for the false doctrine circulating throughout the Evangelical movement teaching that angels came to earth, without permission, of course, saw how beautiful women of the flesh were and decided to take some wives for themselves and in this corrupted union came giant babies that grew into giant known as the Nephilim. And, if you read the book of Enoch that has been circulating around, and that some use to prove this error you will read that these giants, these Nephilim, grew to over 40 feet tall (some say 200 feet) and began to eat everything in sight eventually turning on the little people and eating them. Be careful when you quote Enoch, someone might actually get a copy of this fictional book and read it. This, however, is the view of many in this twisted tale of angels marrying women and having giant children. From here, with this idiotic teaching in the background, let us proceed to the four verses in question and see if we can sort this out.
GENESIS 6:1-4 – What Does It Really Say?
Gen 6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
My Comment: Let’s see, no mention of women? Men began to “multiply” and produced daughters. No mention of sons? Is that important? Not really as it is assumed an intelligent mind will understand you cannot have “daughters” without the fathers having a wife, or at least a girlfriend, so we know there must have been women giving birth to “daughters”. This is a prime example of simple logic where every little detail is not supplied to convey a message under the assumption the read possess some common sense – in this case — men do no have babies without women and if men are multiplying then so too are women.
I don’t think Evolutionist, even in all of their absurdities try to tell anyone that daughters appear without mothers, right? Or men appeared out of nothing — or do they? Oh, yeah, some do, it seems, suggesting “spontaneous” appearances of species — creation — strike that last word, they would never use it, better stay with “spontaneous appearance” – no, really, that is a theory floating for some years now. The benefit to this new/old theory is it eliminates the need for the missing links. Anyway, back to the point — “men” is likened to “mankind”, human beings, including women, but it is of note that these men are not identified as anything special – men in general.
The point here, with this leading verse — girls were coming forth from men of no particular quality and this by and through their women friends or wives. This is leading us to the next verse, which takes us to the point of the subject — another type of man, or men called the “sons of God” began to focus on the daughters of these other men.
Gen 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
My Comment: These “sons of God”, apparently exercised some kind of dominion over the other men mentioned in verse one. We are not given details but it is mentioned they took these “daughters” of these other men and made them “wives”. This would indicate they did not take by force otherwise the concept of marriage would not have entered into the account. A King, for example, wants to take a wife from among the common subjects so a deal is struck, the father is paid a handsome sum, given a title, and some land, usually, and the King takes a wife. If the King, on the other hand, taken women by force they are not usually married, and that is not how you take a wife. In this verse a “lust” is demonstrated by a class of men known as the “sons of God”, more accurately, the “sons of gods”. This would indicate a group of men recognized by the “other men” as separate from them and there appears to be no objection from either side concerning these unions.
Here we see the “sons of God” taking a fancy toward the “daughters” of the other men. It does not appear the fathers of the girls object to this as not objection is recorded. Wouldn’t you think that if alien beings, angels or any other creature from outer space, invading earth and taking your daughters as wives there would be some kind of objection, some kind of struggle, some kind of outrage?
There is all sorts of things wrong with this view of “angels marrying” humans and most is covered in my first two articles, Angels Marrying Women. What we do see is two types of men – men and sons – this would indicate both are males capable of having children. Let us not forget, our Savior told us, in His own voice, that angels do not marry, not only that, He went on to say they do not give in marriage either.
(Mar 12:25) For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.
(Gal 3:28) There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
Granted, this last verse is not a specific declaration that there will be no males or females, but when you consider the purpose of being male and female in the procreation of species one could say this is no longer necessary, once we enter the spirit realm in our new spirit bodies. There is to be no racial nor sexual differences once we become like the Messiah. What the teachers of the “angels marrying human women” are suggesting is that angels, once having come to earth sprouted male genitals. Others, realizing the error in this, instead of adjusting to the truth, tell us these alien angels toke of “wives” by the act of possession. One group says the angels possessed the women while others say they possess the husbands and by proxy gave birth to alien beings that became the Nephilim.
If you continue down this false road and insist these angels came to earth, sprouted genitals and actually had physical sex with human women you would then have to assume they produce sperm and with all of this similarity to human men there must then be female angels too. Oops, no mention of female angels anywhere in the Scriptures, only on the minds of men. I think we should stand on what our Savior had to say about the angels, “…neither marry, nor are given in marriage…”
The concept that a term like “sons of God” is not applicable to humans, and applies only to angels, is ridiculous but this is what the false teaching is saying. This, however, is contradicted by the New Testament writings which abound with references to the “children of God” and if “children” then certainly “sons” and “daughters”, wouldn’t you think?
(John 11:51) And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that YaHshua should die for that nation; And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. (Children of God, in reference to Israel)
(Rom 8:16) The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: (1 John 5:2, 1 John 3:10, Gal 3:26, Rom 9:26, 2 Cor 6:18)
(Rom 9:8) That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
(2Co 6:18) And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
.
That last verse is from the Old testament, of course, and demonstrates the same principle. People, even the people of Israel were and have been and are going to be called “Sons of God”. This is not a title reserved for angels, in fact, this is not a title for angels at all.
(Heb 1:5) For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
Tell me you see it, please – what is it that’s makes a “child of God”? It would be the acceptance of the Gospel Message about YaHshua as Savior and the acceptance of YaHshua as your Savior. Children of the flesh are those of this world, doing their own thing, so to speak, some very religious, practicing and following the traditions of men, some actively pursuing the worship demons and, of course, those in denial of any god at all — these areto be outside of those “…counted for the seed”. It is the children of the PROMISE that are COUNTED for the SEED. Can you see this? There is a difference between the two groups (of men) but all are of the same flesh and blood, at least for now.
So, continuing with this thought and taking it back to the world that was, before the Great Flood, can we now see the “sons of God” counted as the seed just as believers are today? There were some, like us today, that heard and believed the Gospel Message concerning our Lord as it was preached to them by Enoch. Believe it or not the world of then received and ultimately turned away from the plan of “salvation”. Reading Jude 14-16 we see Enoch, seventh from Adam, preaching of the coming of the Lord, the Gospel message. This is the same New Testament letter the false and deceived teachers use but fail to notice this part –
(Jude 1:14) And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,
It would only be natural to assume, then, that believers of Enoch’s preaching would be “sons of god”, separating them from other men, just as it is today. Certainly there is the other view, that the “sons of God” were the sons of Adam marrying the sons of Cain, and a couple of other ideas which I have elaborated on in Part 1 and Part 2. Since the New Testament and the presentation of our Savior to the world the Mystery is revealed — Christians of faith are the “sons and daughters of God”. Again we see the Bible is of no private interpretation, interpreting itself.
We need to let the writings of from the Old and New Testament tell us what they mean as these are the words delivered to the Prophets and the Apostles as they were either shown or moved by the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:20-21).
The following verses tell us, plainly, that believers can be and are called “sons and daughters of God”. Leaving the interpretation of men behind let the Scripture interpret the scripture.
(2b 1:5) For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
Can it get any plainer?
If we are “children of God” wouldn’t this mean I can call myself a “son of God”? We know our Savior came in the flesh and is called the Son of God, and we know YaHshua called Him Father and he, the Christ, instructed us to also call on the One he revealed as his Father, our Father. This is undeniable and as believers this is what we confess –
(1Jn 4:15) Whosoever shall confess that YaHshua is the Son of God, God lives in him, and he in God. (NRKJV—Name Restored King James Version))
Our Savior also instructs us to call on our Father in Heaven when we pray –
(Luke 11:2) He said to them, “When you pray, say: ” ‘Father, hallowed (HOLY) be your name, your kingdom come…”.
In Hebrew 2:10-11 we are told our Savior is not ashamed to call us “brothers” and that we are considered “brethren” and called “sons” being brought to “glory”..
(Heb 2:10-12) For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. For both he that sanctifieth (make Holy) and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren (brothers), Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.
Listen, the truth is the “sons of God” were in the world before were those that began to call on the Name of God. The people in Adam’s time heard the gospel Message, they knew the of the coming plan of salvation, but they began to break ranks and marry outside of their beliefs, outside of the truth delivered to them by Enoch (Jude 1:14).
Gen 6:3 And the LORD (YHWH) said, My spirit shall not always strive (Live with or struggle with) with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
My Comment: In the Earth before, that is, before the flood, the Creator’s Spirit was with men. In the Hebrew dictionary the Word “strive” has several meanings, rule, judge, minister, and plead – indicating a presence – this should be a concept the Christian, of all people, should understand. He withdrew His Spirit as it was a constant struggle leading to the ultimate rejection. Man lived longer than we do today because His Holy Spirit was present as a force for life, this, of course is my opinion but in this view we see the reason for the long ages and then the shortening of the age of men. We see a point in the first Earth history where YAHWEH withdraws his Spirit and then limits the years of man, recognizing man as only flesh. Apparently the long years made the people of then seem to think they were immortal. Even today men act and talk as if they are immortal, speaking of themselves in terms of immortality refusing to acknowledge there degenerate condition. It is like all of humanity being in denial. Just think how much stronger this delusion of immortality would be for those living to such extreme ages — would not some begin to think they were as gods?
Gen 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
My Comment: Here is the verse that gets so twisted you have to think it is on purpose, or, is influenced by doctrines of demons (1 Tim 4:1, look it up). “There were giants…” when? “ … In those days” and that is what it means, not that these giants were the product of the “sons of god” marrying daughters of men! It is a time set, a marking of when this began to happen, of when those called the “sons of God” began to marry outside of their faith or outside of their birthright as leaders with a religious responsibility. Once these devout men began to break ranks and marry women not of their belief it would only be a matter of time when these wives would bring their false gods to the table. Men, for the most part, want to please their women – men want a peaceful house and some women, from the beginning have taken advantage of this. We have a mighty example of this from the very beginning in Adam to King Solomon.
King Solomon, a “Mighty Man of renown”
King Solomon, a very wise, and blessed man. If the King had one weakness it was women, women outside of his own race and faith — he liked alien women, so we have a good example of a “son of God” (Israel is called the children of God, and the Kings were recognized the chosen of God. Other Kingdoms even called their Kings, sons of the gods). A King of Israel, looking on foreign women with a lustful eye and taking from them wives, as many as he chose. Does this sound familiar?
There were seven hundred royal bloods and three hundred concubine, a thousand wives – these were daughters of other men, from other nations (1 Kings 11:1-6. So, what happened to King Solomon, once a “son of God”, King of Israel, ruler over the “children of God”? These wives of other men, from other nations, brought with them their false gods and hounding King Solomon for equal rights in worship turned all of Israel into a very religious nation.
We are told as Solomon aged these foreign women turned the mind of the King to other gods. That’s right, these daughters of common men (non-Israelite introduced the “children of God” to a variety of deities, customs and traditions “Authorized by the King”. They filled the Temple with pagan idols and decorated the forest and high places with phallic symbols of Bel/Baal and Asheroth and Ishtar and many other gods. The people had become very religious as they prayed on every hilltop, sacrificed on every altar, went to church often as they honored every god, that is until King Josiah came along, many years after the death of Solomon.
(2Ki 23:4) And the king (Josiah) commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD (YHWH) all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.
Eventually statues of wood and stone (idols) representing these false gods of all the “host of heaven” that had been set up in the Temple were removed by a new King, a young King. Under King Solomon’s rule Israel had become so religious they had nearly forgotten who YHWH was in favor of all the other gods, not only Baal, but of all the host – they were worshiping everything. The worship of the God of Israel became buried in the religious enthusiasm for other religions introduced by the “daughters of men”.
Read about the rediscovery of YHWH and how religious the people were for other false gods and how YHWH was rediscovered if for only a little while in 2 Kings 22-23, and you will see how thoroughly the people of God had lost the worship of YHWH even though the Temple was in their midst. They filled the Temple with pagan idols and the priest were in on it. Consider the Temple today and recognize the similarities.
(2Co 6:16) And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will live in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. NRKJV
The Books of Moses were lost and rediscovered and King Josiah (YosYaH), cut deep into his heart, set about ripping into the false religions and restoring the true worship honoring the only real God of Israel, YHWH. I see this as a parallel of the Christian Religion today. Christianity has been flooded with pagan practices and customs as to lose the site of YHWH and of the true Christ, YaHshua. The Christian Church has migrated to calling on a strange name a name that never existed until around 400 years ago. The Christians follow customs cut from the pagan world of the past and present. The modern Christians engage in Holiday traditions as opposed to the Holy Days and Sabbaths of the Holy Bible. In this we see, again, as in the days of Noah, men of God, children of God, sons of God, turning into something else, accepting the lie.
The Context, The Context, The Context
(Gen 6:5) And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
My comment: This verse, following on the heels of verses 1-4 should be the end of the discussion. “And GOD saw that the wickedness of man…” can it possibly be any plainer? Not the “…wickedness of the angels…”, but “of man” — man, men — no mention of angels and not the slightest hint concerning “fallen angels”. What is the context, then? “…and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” Man’s thoughts, man’s heart and no angels around or even acknowledged. It seems God can see the “wickedness of man” but the teachers of the false doctrine cannot.
The verses in Genesis 6 have nothing to do with “fallen angels” marrying and giving others in marriage. Instead of this we see and account that is all about men and what they were doing. The KJV has once again clouded the waters of biblical interpretation. The hearts (minds) of men is certainly evil and exhibits this historically and in minor ways as well.
You can pick up one Bible dictionary and will side with the fable of the pagans, “gods marrying human women” and yet another Bible dictionary will not. Perceived authorities can be quoted, some pro, some con, but as we move closer to the end it is surprising how this false teaching has grown among the Christian, especially the Evangelical Dispensationalist – those teaching the other false doctrine of the Rapture.
You can pick for yourself which theory appeals to you. For me and others we stick with the scriptures and what our Savior, YaHshua, had to say about angels. Believe YaHshua and you will see something is wrong with the Gen 6:1-4 and with a little research you will find the alternate translation of, “sons of the kings”, this makes more sense as when you get literal with the KJV, “sons of god” the term for “god”, in this case, is the Hebrew “elohim” meaning “gods”, so the KJV should read, “sons of gods, many gods, and is not speaking of the Creator God, or the God YHWH (YaHweh) at all. Even some the Jewish scholars that teach this false doctrine ignore this simple fact. Not all Jewish scholars, of course, support this false teaching that angels equals YHWH’s sons taking flesh to wed and bed. It does appear, however, that the origin of this doctrine has Jewish sources outside of Scripture.”.
The End
There you have it, again, with a few more observations. King Solomon is a prime example of what happened on the Earth before, with men of religious authority or ruler ship, the kings of the time, or even the ruling class of Adams children, being influenced and tempted by women outside of their own faith or class. Women have a very spiritual nature, more so than men, and for this reason they are prey to every kind of “spirit”. Satan went after Eve for a reason. He had plenty of time to assault Adam but found it easier to get to Eve and through Eve to Adam.
We see another example in the story of Elijah. Everyone knows the story of Jezebel and how she sought to kill Elijah (Eli- Jah, means; My God is YaH). She was the alien Queen of Israel, not an Israelite but a Phoenician. She married the King of Israel, Ahab, and brought her false gods and customs, her primary god being Baal (Baal means; Lord, or Master). Apparently during this time there were many god under the banner of Baal, many Lord gods, with many different names.
It would seem the children of God, the Israelites, or, at least, the men of Israel have a weakness for foreign women. This is the very thing (the secret of Israel’s weakness) the prophet Balaam gave to King of Moab, Balac, as a method of corrupting the children of Israel in an attempt to stop Israel from crossing the Jordan river threatening to over run the children of Moab — see Numbers 25:1 and Numbers 31:18. Balaam refused to put a curse on the children of Israel but eventually revealed the weakness of the children and of the “Mighty Men” before the YHWH. Apparently Israelite women were plain (by Moabite standards), by comparison to the made up and haughty women of the sex temples of Moab.
The “Mighty men” of Israel saw the daughters of Moab as beautiful and took of them any they desired. To stop this insult Israel was struck and many of Israel’s mighty men came to their end at the hands of their brothers and kin remaining true to YaHWeH. When this disaster came to an end the invasion finally commenced and the king of Moab, along with Balaam were killed.
Man’s Natural Desire
Genesis tells us a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife (to please her), this is a natural instinct of men (Gen 2:24). Looking back at the account of Adam and Eve we see Eve introducing Adam to a false religion (so to speak), turning from the true words of their Creator by listening to another word, lying words, mixed with the words of YHWH, deceiving them into doubting what they were originally told.
They chose to go with words added to His word putting a subtle twist on the truth, “…you will not die.” In the true religion they originally did not question His word of truth, their faith rested in believing their Creator, YHWH, as small children believe their father but eventually they were choosing to listen to a lesser authority, Satan. Here, then, is another example of a “son of God”, Adam, falling under the influence of a woman. Make no mistake, Adam is guilty as sin — he was standing right next to Eve, and while she took to the temptation, accepting the idea YHWH may have not told the truth, doubting Yahweh’s words, she turned to Adam, standing right next to her and gave him the fruit to eat also, and he did not refuse, he ate too. Imagine — Adam is listening to the conversation Eve is having with the Representative of Satan and not saying a word, Eve says, “Here my husband, eat”, and he does. Maybe it was more like this, “Here husband, worship this way”, and he did. Later Adam blames YHWH for his trouble, he says it was the woman’s fault, you know, “That woman you gave me …”, he says. He blames His Creator, YHWH. If only He, God, had not given him the woman – poor Adam, certainly the victim, poor Adam with a poor excuse. Adam let the woman wear the pants, he was the first hen–pecked husband. Make no mistake all of us men are as guilty as Adam — and all women as guilty as Eve. They may have been the first but they demonstrated a weakness in their nature, a nature we all have in the flesh.
Understand Genesis 6 is to believe what our God, the God of Israel, and now our Savior is saying and has said to us. Believe Him, Believe His words, they are true, but for some reason (you be the judge), there are those teachers of renown teaching this false doctrine of “spirits” (1Tim 4:1) having sex with human wives, giving birth to giants – how absurd! Read your bible, see the truth, believe, and if you want to speculate don’t try to twist the Scriptures to fit your own fairy tale speculations. When someone gives you a verse that smashes your speculation (your mind idol?) accept it. Remember, it is not about winning or losing arguments, it is about having faith in the Word to deliver the answer and with the help of the Holy Spirit of our Heavenly Father and our Savior we will be shown the way and the truth.
Believing our Heavenly Father and His Son, YaHshua let us consider everything man invents, by comparison, a lie.
(Rom 3:3-4). NRKJV
Opinions and speculations can be fun, even lending to keeping interest up in the study of the Word, but we cannot forget, speculation is speculation and your opinion is your opinion but the Word of God is the deciding factor. You should be adjusting your opinions and your speculations to the Word, not the other way around, as we seem to see modern teachers doing today. They follow the methods of Satan, first they tell you some truths then get you to doubt what you think or have heard or read in the Word, then they give you an opinion that is more pleasing to you and your wants and desires and lusts, things to satisfy your flesh, and suddenly you are hooked into thinking “outside of the Book” — this is Satan’s method of self-improvement and there are many that go this way just like Adam and Eve.
(2Ti 4:3) For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; (to rub or scratch or tickle the ear)
Don’t be afraid to accept Scripture for what it says and don’t be quick to speculate. Remember, your opinion is your opinion and as with most opinions coming from biblically illiterate people concerning things they know nothing about they are not worth much — wonder, think, even think out loud, but wait on the Word for the answer. Do not be quick to grab hold of an idea just because some one you think is more important than you says it must be so. This misdirection gets a lot of sincere people in trouble, they grab hold of something that tweaks their imagination and won’t let it go, even if Scripture says they are wrong, they join in with others in trying to use the Scriptures to prove their fancy idea.
False thinking is to assume everything is possible and by this ultimate answer the Word of the Living God is made unreliable — because, among men, everything is not possible, only our Creator has that option. All things are only possible with our God. We are creatures of the flesh, creatures of limitations, bound to certain physical principles that restrain us in spite of what we may dream or wish for.
We are limited we are but dust and are perishing by the thousands every day. It is only by the option of our Creator that we are offered Life beyond the grave, beyond the return to dust. Flesh and blood cannot “inherit” the Kingdom in our present condition and this is our ultimate limitation — death — these bodies of flesh die.
We should not be in fear of those that can destroy the flesh, as that is going to happen anyway, with or without the aide of other men, but we should fear the one that has the power to destroy both, the flesh as well as the spirit. Our only hope of achieving the impossible is by and through YaHshua, through whom we will receive new Spirit bodies fit for the Kingdom to come. (1 Jn 3:2, Php 3:21, 1 Cor 15:42-44)
Here is an example twisting the word of the Living God, from a major Evangelical magazine:
What follows is how it appears in the magazine, MidNight Call, (Issue August 2010, page 12, second column) –
(Gen 6:4) The same became mighty men (Nephilim) which were of old, men of renown.
(Gen 6:4) There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. KJV
Compare the two examples, the first as the magazine printed it and the actual verse. See what they did? By interjecting “Nephilim” they are planting the idea these “mighty men”, or “Giants” are the product of the angel/human union, and they drop the very beginning of this verse to make it fit their idea, or what they imagine.
I will not quote the whole article, but it is clear from the article this is what they teach. Look close at the verse, look at what it really says and is saying — In the original it does not say the “mighty men” were the “Nephilim” but it does say when the Nephilim were on the earth, in those days, these “mighty men” were stepping out of bounds. Look again, these were “mighty men of old, men of renown”, not Nephilim, but men that lived a long time, sons of Adam and Eve (of old) living long lives, famous men (men of renown), not angels, not half breeds of angel/man, but MEN — and when was all this happening? When there were “Nephilim” (giants) on the earth. No where does it ever say these Nephilim (giants) were their children, no where!
Also, with the original writing, it does not say the Nephilim are men. There were giants in those days? Giant what? Dinosaurs? In the Book of Numbers, as mentioned before, this term, Nephilim, is used referring to a family of ‘giants’ or human Nephilim and from this you could say it is possible the Nephilim of Genesis 6, is also referring to men, but still, it could be making reference to giant animals as well. One thing is sure, the Nephilim in both accounts never suggests these are half breed humans and angels. In the Book of Numbers they are consistently called “men”.
Are you the product of an angel? Are you the child of an Angel? Let the Word of God Speak —
(John 1:12) But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, evento them that believe on his name:
Strike Number Three
This is my third try at explaining this and I’m running out of arguments and encouragements for you to receive and study the truth concerning this matter. If you can think of something to add to this understanding please write and let me know. Reread the verse I just quoted closely and ask yourself — Who has the power? He gave this power to become sons of God to whom? Certainly not to angels marrying humans? What seems to be one of the requirements to becoming a son or daughter of God? Is it making sense now? Do angels have the ability to procreate? The answers seem obvious don’t they, when you stay within the realms of the written words, His words to us, right?
If you are still stuck go back to Genesis 6:5 and see the context of the verses leading up to why YHWH destroyed man by a great flood. Then try to find where it says the world of then was destroyed because of the angels, you will not. The subject and the total context is about men and what they were doing. It is all about mankind and their wickedness, not the angels. My understanding is the rebellious angels that followed Satan had revolted before the creation of men.

Once again, I think the verses below need to be brought to the attention of those who think the Angel view of the bible is incorrect.
Personally, I have to ask why God is speaking so plain here by using the words “also flesh”. By the plain reading of the verses, if man is “ALSO flesh”… something else God views as “other than man”… is flesh….right? Plain on the text?
As a matter of context, no animals are mentioned here… Just “Sons of God” Always translated in the Old Testament as angels…. and then, there are the children ( the nephilim)
Here is the whole “Sons of God” and “also flesh” thing in Genesis 6. Tell me what you think after reading it again. You know what is fun? Things seem to get really clear if you reverse the verses 3 and 4… Just for a mental exercise. I don”t mean to encourage taking things out of context, but could it be the way the Hebrews used Grammar that makes this so hard? Take a look at how it reads, and pay attention to the use of the word “ALSO”.
Genesis 6 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. (next two verses flipped)
4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
3 And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he ALSO is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
With the reversing of the two sentences, the also flesh verbiage looks a bit clearer as a matter of grammar and paragraph structure… but you dont need to do that, to see that God addressing 2 different kinds of flesh here. Something that God does not consider man… is flesh… and man… is also flesh. In fact, the way its written, it appears that God is a bit upset about having to do the flood thing to man “also”?
And there is no reason to start with the “doctrines of demons” stuff. This is the kind of thinking that closes peoples minds to Bible study. Here are the facts known even to non Christians. Jesus described a reality about demons and angels that makes people uncomfortable…a lot of people. I understand. But the reality Jesus describes does indeed include angels. And Jesus spent almost half of his career casting out demons. These are facts on the plain reading of the New Testament, straight from the Gospel. I think people have a right to ask what this was all about, and I appreciate people like the author who actually search the scriptures to try to understand it. We have to do as the author has done here. If you have a view, based on scripture, then state it, and support it.
From other research I have seen on this, all of the Apostles, and the Jewish Scribes believed the Angel view of the Bible. So did the early church fathers. The Daughters of Seth view did not come into being, until after 200 AD, when these verses were re-interpreted to satisfiy the VERY uncomfortable Greeks and Romans.
So the “doctrines of demons” fear mongering was happening back then too.
I wish the Church fathers had the guts to face off with the Greeks and the Romans. I wish they just left the initial interpretation alone. The interaction between Jesus and the demons makes huge sense when you take the Angel view of the bible. In fact, the whole Bible makes a lot more sense. Thanks for the article tracking the lineage of these…. “men of renown”.

“This could only happen through his mother, Ham’s wife, having the Nephilim gene herself, since we know Noah in all his generations was 100% human.” The Curse of Cain was pronounced after an act with Noah’s wife. Maybe she was not the the mother of the three sons.

Thank you for the enlightening study. You’ve evidently spent a tremendous amount of time compiling verses substantiating your assertions. I believe many if not most Christians fail to comprehend that the term, Sons of God referenced in the Old Testament differs from the Sons of God referenced in the New Testament. Thank you, again.

Begining and End, excellent site, great job with your exergesis and biblical study. I agree with most of what you have stated. The one exception would be that fallen angels have not intermingled after the flood. In fact I tend to believe as the Lord stated when speaking about his second coming, “as in the time of Noah”. And that Satan performing suposed miracles and lying wonders, will come as an angel of light. It can be no coincidence that there has been so many advancements in DNA research and genome science,and the field of genetic science, giving evidence of Satans attempts to corrupt God’s creation. My question is for you sir, what do you think of the Alien connection to the Nephilim as proposed by Chuck Missler. It’s interesting that in these last days that we live in that there is a rise of paranormal and belief in Alien visatation. The Alien visitation may indeed be one of satan’s deceptions.

I agree The DNA stuff is interesting. As a biologist, I had to steep myself in the intelligent design scholarship to see what in blazes was up that was upsetting the “Darwinian camp” so much. After two years of reading, I suddenly broke out in laughter…. some kind of spontaneous uncontrollable joy. This was 10 years ago. I said to my husband…”Oh.. no… the Powers that Be are going to have to haul out some kind of intelligence other than God, because Darwin is dead! Our children are going to have a chance to revisit the Scopes Monkey Trial!!”
The hubby’s a Doc… so… he says… “What??”
“Yeah, watch this” I said, “Next thing you know, there will be ALIENS, and the aliens will have to be our “Creators”… just watch. It will have to happen within the next six years. That’s about all the time they have to get some other lie going to give people an option other than God. The scientists around the world are going to catch on to this pretty quickly. The lay people will not be far behind. People who don’t like God are in DEEP do do right now”.
Sorry, if I smile about it. But I am a biologist who is so sick of fraud in science. You Go God! One of the perks of Bible Reading? ….The ringside seat! We have an awesome God.
I can’t tell you how much I am enjoying all these Ancient Alien shows… The first time my husband saw it, he looked at me and reminded me of what I said, and smiled. …..And the latest show this week on the Science Channel? “The Definitive Guide to Aliens???” Really. This is science now? The “definitive guide”? Our Creator is coming at science like a freight train.
Researching the Angel view of the bible has had it’s benefits for the secular public as well. I am beginning to see testimony sites from non Christians who were having “abduction problems”, and they are gathering to help one another because they have discovered that you can chase off the Aliens when they come for you if you tell them to leave, in the name of Jesus. I think that is interesting. If we get more of these web sites with hundreds of testimonies, it will be telling, will it not? To our author. Thank you for doing such a careful study.

Hi Linda,
Thanks very much. If we follow the Angel/sons of God perspective in Genesis 6 and 7, we see that also, many animals were corrupted as well. So we can know from Scripture that some type of genetic alteration/defilement was taking place in the Days of Noah. Additionally, the Bible discusses human-animal hybrids. It mentions the satyr, which is a half goat, half human creature. There is also an actual supernatural process of DNA alteration in Scripture found in the book of Daniel. for more on this see our article: UK Labs Have Secretly Made 155 Human-Animal Hybrids. God bless.

Linda – The powers that be are using predictive programming and you are right on track… The latest movie from Ridley Scott, Prometheus, was about an Alien Super race that came here and planted humans here from their own DNA. Ironically, the ‘Alien’ was a very, very large Giant. Wow! Now you got me thinking!!!

Thank you Linda, it’s great to hear from a Biologist. What many evolutionists fail to understand, is that the new belief is that the next phase is the spiritual phase, which means they become Gods and that those that seeded man the “aliens” are returning as our saviours. Once you introduce any form of spirituality Darwinism is dead. This is why they are grabbing at straws as to how to pull off the next huge deception into fooling the human race that there is no God, but beings from outter space.
This is why the vatican a couple of years ago, stated that “if there is alien life, then we should accept them as our brothers” so they are preparing us for the great delusion which the bible says God lets happen, so that they may all believe in the lie, because they took no interest in the truh.

Socram(Quote)
Hi Socram,
We’re actually not all adults here, hence the censoring of your comment. But I think your question is asking from a very modern-day perspective (where “adults” get married in their 20s, 30s and 40s) where in ancient times, marriage was something associated with the onset of puberty (i.e., the average man was a lot smaller at the start of puberty – which on average is at age 11-12). So men at that time would take wives at a much younger age and smaller stature than what people do in Western culture today.
Either way, going just by Scripture, we know that there giants who were born “of the giant” like the sons of Anak in Numbers 13. Anak, who is discussed in detail in Part 2, is not an angel. He was a giant. And so was his father. So there can be no confusion: they conceived with human women and had hybrid, giant offspring. While we are not told all of the mechanics of this, it’s not really necessary to know in detail to understand what happened. I hope that helps, God bless.

Good question. I can understand the Angels because they can become so much like men that the men of Sodom could not tell that the angels were not men. But… how exactly do these flesh and blood giants manage to procreate with normal sized women, unless there were female nephilim also?
I find no scriptural support for female nephilim.
That is why I always assumed that a few angels were sent after the flood to repopulate the nephilim in the promised land, once they knew where to put their offspring.
I did not realize there was a lineage. One unscriptural thought is contained in one of the versions of the Book of Jasher I read. The Bible indeed mentions the book, but who knows how badly it’s been corrupted. Still, apparently, while creating these giant offspring, the angels were also doing some biotech and “mixing of animals”. That can be done, for sure even now, in a lab today. Google “human ear on back of a mouse”, in Google images. You might find the photo of the mouse scientists did with a human ear on its back. This is all very weird. But it’s much easier to do than test tube animals.
So here is one theory to ponder for a fit with all the evidence? It might be that Hams wife was taken, and artificially inseminated? Not too hard to do. She may have even gone willingly at some point?
Strange theory, but I would not put anything past a bunch of rogue angels who’s main objective was polluting the human genome under the radar. Giants are not exactly able to get “under the radar”. And 400 years is plenty of time for them to figure it out.
Does it fit the evidence?
Its a thought that works with the genealogy in this article, and with the events in the promised land where the giants reappeared. It does not require a lot of technology to do. Farmers inseminate cows daily. And, frankly, it seems to even go along with the reality we are dealing with when it comes to this “alien abduction” claim. That sounds a bit biotech too. Just a thought. I have been wondering the same as you.

really looking forward to a part 2!!
im just now starting to try and learn about the hidden stuff of scripture. and the idea of giants and lilith and enoch and in general pre-flood noah is fascinating and the potential that they could theoritically return somehow given the same scriptures say the later days will be like the days of noah if a frightening but fascinating concept. really hope to hear more on the subject
kayne(Quote)
I was stuck on the Lilith thing early in Bible study, until someone explained to me the following. Genesis has two, not one, record of creation. The first mention of woman, where God creates man and woman at the same time, is the record of creation. Its purpose is to locate the creation of man and woman on the time scale of the general creation or first record. At the end of that record, God wraps it up:
Genesis 2: 4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,
The second record is the record of the creation of MAN where God focuses in on the details of the creation of man and woman in detail. This is the record where he creates man first, and does the bit about the rib and the woman.
People (even ancient Jews ) think these are two separate women being created at different times. The bible does break these into two different records. One is the account of creation. The other is a close up on the creation of man and woman. Lilith comes from faulty reading, usually from someone who has not caught the shift in records. This is my understanding.
Linda(Quote)
Hi Linda,
Thank you for your excellent comments. The “Lillith theory” is complete heresy and has no Biblical support. The simple test of this is that you could never come up with the Lillith theory from just reading the Bible on your own. That idea has been added to Scripture. There is no woman named Lillith in the entire text. And the New testament Scripture makes the order of creation clear:
So the questions always comes back to whether we are going to believe the Bible, or believe what someone told us instead. And as Bible-believing Christians, Scripture should always be our authority. God bless.
Beginning and End(Quote)
also it is said every creature survives the flood. so that EVERY word is key. it implies for some reason or another someone screwed up and let the giant bloodline survive. in various ancient texts it seems to indicate that noah was supposed to kill someone but didn’t and that someone carried the giant bloodline. that someone was a female(Ham or Hams wife i cant remeber if Ham was a son or a wife now lol) but regardless that particular female carries the giant bloodline. since females dont ever show it just like females carry color blind genes but never actually are color blind this likely goes under the radar. its also rumored noah commits adultry and thanks to Lilith between the adultry and giant bloodline in Hams DNA the race resurfaces it is just not quite as powerful as before.
kayne(Quote)
It doesnt say every creature survived, but it Does say two of its kind!
I believe animals and humans were a lot bigger then,there has been insects with air pockets proving there was 50% more oxigen in the air ,hence i believe when Adam was leaving he walked the earth the same time giant creatures (dinasaurs) did. But come to think of it ,it Does say that nephilim sinned against animals and the plants, so there could be something there as well when it comes to really big creatures.
reignyeshua(Dan)(Quote)
” And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.”
see every living thing comes into the ark and apparently two of its kind. now to make a giant all that is needed is a human and some Angel DNA mixed into a human. so all it really takes for the giant DNA to cross over is for one person to carry it. so.
while i am not saying angels couldn’t of repeated the act that is certainly possible what i am saying is the bible seems to make clear every creature gets onto that ark and lives. Noah is commanded to take every creature as well. now whether the giants are excluded from the every creature command or not i don’t think any of us can say for certain but the bible does seem to say noah is commanded to take every creature.
i think part of the problem is this article does not address Lilith.
i would recommend reading
to help connect the dots some more. because really you can’t understand giants without understanding Lilith as she is the one that supposedly starts the entire bloodline to start with.
i would also say you are right the giants sinned against animals. and later in the old testament we see The Lord warn against beastility which is kind of an odd thing. my guess is for all flesh to become corrupt(seriously let that sink in) i am suspecting we had a ton of angel/human/animal mixes floating around. also some of the dead sea scroll lost bible books point out a relevance to noah and his appearance and some even state noahs dad was scared that noah had giant blood in him. so it seems there is a reference to noahs appearance as part of the perfection he had in his days. i’d suspect Satans great plan at that time was to pollute the bloodline to a point where Jesus couldn’t come and thus the flood. it also partly explains why israel is commanded to completely wipe out all things later on concerning the giants food, people, babies, animals everything. i’d suspect what noah took into the flood was the last pure form of every bloodline.
as far as how it could of carried over? according to that book i linked which i would highly recommend it is a great read. Noah is commanded to kill hams wife if i recall. he messes up and doesn’t do it. ham supposedly has the giant bloodline in her. however apparently women don’t show it similar to the color blind gene women are never colorblind but they do carry the gene. then later noah whether voluntarily or by being tricked commits adultery or in other words an illicit sex act. now such sex acts are where Lilith can manifest herself within the child. and notice that noahs curses that group of people. this could then be where the giant bloodline resurfaces. again i am not saying angels did not come and commit the sin again but we must also remember the original group that did it were watchers over earth so it is possible The Lord did not set up a new group of watchers so if angels did it again they were errant and lost and not as organized.
also to mate in the first place they needed Gods ineffable name which Lilith has and the angels do not. Lilith and the head watcher create originally a child completely seperate to the giants and truly a seperate seed to rival eve’s seed. this child lacks all connection and bloodlines to eves seed. so i do not think this act was repeated exactly as before.
so either Lilith does not want a second child, The Lord won’t allow it, the seed is carried over in the ark, or angels repeated the act but not with Lilith but still got the name from her?
i find the topic fascinating. my only real complaint is being LDS i wish some of these scholars on the subject would take a look at some of the LDS scriptures to see how they fit in but alas i am forced to do that myself. i also find it fascinating yet somewhat terrifying as the new testament states plainly the days of noah shall be like the latter days so does this mean the return of the massive hundred foot tall giants? the animal human angel hybrids? is the anti-christ really a manifestation of the lost blood line? and what exactly is all flesh becoming corrupted? i think we humans shut ourselves out to the possiblity just because we don’t see it occur yet i think there is some great mystery in the days of noah and some mystery that is just so terrifying we refuse to search it out, really the implications of giants and Lilith are just terrifying.

Hi Kayne,
Thanks for your comments but I have to respectfully disagree with almost all of it. There is no Lilith in the Bible and Beginning and End is a Bible-believing Christian ministry. As such, we do not give any credence the extra-Biblical books of Joseph Smith and the Latter day saints (i.e., the Book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price, etc.). We believe in the God of the Bible and the Jesus Christ of the Bible, who is God, the Creator and Savior. Mormonism preaches a different God, different Jesus and different Gospel.
Of course you are free to share your thoughts but as a Watchman ministry we just want to make it clear to our reading audience that we do not agree with LDS doctrines.
Beginning and End(Quote)
actually lets look. Lilith is found in the bible if we read closely first genesis chapter.
we see here God made male and female. both of them. we also see this is not the same account found in genesis chapter 2 because apparently “every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.” notice unlike in chapter 2 verse 17
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
here notice the commandment is different! suddenly there is a tree that cannot be eaten. so clearly this is telling of two different accounts of a creation of a woman.
we will also note that in chapter 2 at this point eve has not yet been made. also note that chapter 2 verse 20
And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
here for some reason Adam is expecting to find a helpmeet. which makes sense given a female was created in chapter 1. notice eve has not yet been made! so here he gathers every living creature and names them and finds no helpmeet now why would adam be looking for a helpmeet amongst non human animals? well clearly because in chapter 1 God made a female previously for him.
let us also then look at chapter 3. the famous serpent. now even including my LDS scriptures and lost bible books in the dead sea scrolls there is only one instance of an animal talking(at least that i am aware of) and it is used as a point of shock and to show how dumb the human is and it is quite clearly shocking. but somehow eve holds a conversation with a “serpent” and has no shock value to it. the conversation goes on for so long that this serpent tricks her. Adam also has no qualms about talking to this serpent and later on the three of them are standing before God and again no mention of this serpents speaking ability. seems odd and inconsistent with the other animal talking story.
we also have this tidbit….chapter 3 verse 15
And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
this implies there must be a seed that this serpent raises aka the giants although they are half eve’s the serpents only true recorded 100% independent of eve’s seed is Azazel(spelling?) from the book of the enoch which the author of that book points(the one i linked) out even gets mentioned in the bible. for the seed to truly be the serpents it must be 100% seperate from eve otherwise all seed is eve’s and eve cannot be put into rival with her own seed according to that scripture. now some might supposed this is Lucifer but Lucifer is not mentioned. nor is there any instance of Lucifer having the power to create children see as he is cast out of heaven without ever gaining a mortal body he cannot create seed. he can have adopted children as followers yes but that is not what this statement saids the serpent’s seed and eve’s seed are locked into enmity.
some might suppose this was a snake with legs while possible we are still left with a snake talking and bearing rival seed to eve which again does not make sense.
in essence the serpent has to be a human female or at least she was once human.
also according to that author of that book i linked(seriously read that book best case for Liliths existence using the bible ive seen anywhere) according to the hebrew genesis chapter 2 verse 23
And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
this is NOW bone of my bones is reference to at this repetition or in otherwords at this particular instance. in essence this particular woman as in i’ve seen a woman like her before. marking the indication that there was a previous woman. at least according to the hebrew translation
i will not go into every detail(my friend is reading my copy of that book) but there is so much more even found in the first 3 chapters referencing the creation of a Lilith character. but as we can plainly see God created a female in chapter 1, a second female in chapter 2, and at some point between chapter 2 and 3 Lilith gets her name, is called the serpent, and her seed must rival the seed of Eve. either that Eve’s seed is rivaling the seed of snakes everywhere those pesky bums plotting to drag us all to hell is what they are doing i know it.
so there we have 4 instances right there referecing a human female. the book has 19 other cases that are equally well done. drawing parallels to the bitter water trials, the sacrifices of the old testament, and other stuff.
so read the book yes? Lilith is quite clearly found in the bible. adding stuff like the book of enoch is just icing on the cake. although the case for her much like 100 foot tall giants can and is made exclusively with the bible it is just after the bible facts have been established we can then look at things like the book of enoch to fill in the details.
my point of mormon scriptures that was not to convert you to the LDS faith although that would be nice my point was i see christian scholars look through every translation of the bible, dead sea scroll texts, and every story out there but almost always fail to look at the LDS scriptures as a possible add on or explanation. so i don’t take offense at you personally i just wish christian scholars when researching hidden topics like nephliem which lets face it is not accepted in any christian religion it is still a fringe despite they are painfully obviously in the bible. although it is the exact same Jesus logic dictates it has to be otherwise LDS folks wouldn’t use the bible.
i also want to say i find the fact you don’t look at non bible texts as odd when one must realize the giants while in the bible their best descriptions are outside of the bible. there is also the fact that the giants are thought of at least in my experience by christians as maybe 9 to 10 feet tall and certainly not a result of a angels mating with humans and certainly not 100s to thousands of feet tall. granted i do enjoy people backing their claims with the bible the true story of the giants and noah is quite clearly hidden in places other than the bible which apparently just provides a pointer to these other places. in fact i am just as sure you would get laughed out of a congregation for teaching this as i would get laughed out of teaching it at a sunday school class. although i could be wrong some folks may be open to the idea.

Smith, who grew up in Plant City and never forgot his hometown roots, had a resume like few others: Rhodes Scholar, former American and International Bar Association president, one-time interim president of the University of South Florida and early crusader for civil rights.
He joined the Carlton Fields law firm in 1953 and helped build it into one of the largest firms in the state, with 300 lawyers. He was the 112-year-old firm's president emeritus at the time of his death and made daily visits to his office until recently.
"A giant of a man, and I mean a giant of a man has died," said retired Senior District Court of Appeal Judge E.J. Salcines. "He was a great example of the very best in the legal profession and a great friend."
Salcines said he met Smith shortly after Salcines graduated from law school 50 years ago. He immediately was drawn to Smith for legal wisdom.
"He was a mentor to a lot, a lot of lawyers all over, including me," said Salcines, a former Hillsborough County state attorney. "He led by example and was one of the best in the legal profession."
Former Tampa Mayor Dick Greco recalled that Smith, then Tampa city attorney, helped guide officials through racially turbulent times in the 1960s. Smith, the police chief and NAACP representatives often went to Greco's home on Davis Islands to discuss how to defuse tensions.
"He always had a steady hand in everything he did. He would sit in my living room and he would go over how to best handle anything that came up," Greco said.
"He was a brilliant individual who above all else cared about people."
"I loved the guy and so did everybody who knew him."
Smith had a heart for the less fortunate. In the 1980s, as American Bar president, he rallied lawyers to defeat a proposal to eliminate federal funds for legal services for the poor, said Dick Woltmann, president and CEO of Bay Area Legal Services.
"If not for William Reece Smith, legal services to the poor would probably not exist in this country," he said. "Reese was one of the great supporters of legal services for the poor both nationally and locally."
Smith, founder of Florida Legal Services, encouraged private attorneys to donate some of their time to help the poor, Woltmann said.
"It is a great loss when someone like Reece passes," he said.
Smith was born in Athens, Tenn., and grew up in Plant City, where childhood friend Hilman Bowden marveled at his intellect even at a young age. When the neighborhood boys gathered in Smith's yard to play after school, the sessions always ended after about an hour when Smith's grandmother, Mary Noel Moody, called him inside to tend to his studies, Bowden said.
"He went right inside. He took his studies very seriously. He was absolutely brilliant," Bowden said.
Smith and Bowden sometimes double-dated as teenagers and forged a friendship that lasted a lifetime.
If at no other time of year, Smith and the 89-year-old Bowden would visit during Plant City's "Florida Strawberry Festival." Bowden last saw him in the fall, when Smith was inducted into the Plant City High School Hall of Fame and tossed the coin to open the Raiders' homecoming game.
"He was a real Plant City boy through and through. He was a tremendously successful attorney but he never forgot his hometown," Bowden said.
Smith, born Sept. 19, 1925, graduated in 1943 from Plant City High, where he was quarterback. The World War II Navy veteran also played quarterback at the University of South Carolina, where he led the Gamecocks to the Gator Bowl. Later he went to law school at the University of Florida and then to Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.
Smith practiced law in Plant City and taught law at the University of Florida before joining Carlton Fields.
His community service was legendary, including interim USF president, 1976-77; founding president of the Florida Orchestra; president of the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce; trustee at Bethune-Cookman College and chairman of the chamber's Committee of 100.
He is survived by his son, William Reece Smith III, daughter-in-law, Rachel-Anne Winter Smith, grandson William Reece "Liam" Smith IV, and other family members.
Reece Smith was an active member of the Hyde Park United Methodist Church in Tampa, where funeral services will be held at 1 p.m. Thursday. A visitation will be held from noon to 1 p.m. at the church, and a reception will follow the service at the Chester Ferguson Law Center of the Hillsborough County Bar Association, 1601 N. Tampa Street. Private burial services will be held in the family plot at Plant City.We created Pandora to put the Music Genome Project directly in your hands

A typical day used to be spent doing physical labor, but that is no longer the case. The inactivity most of us experience as part of our daily career routine can increase our risk of dying. You may make time to go to the gym an hour or two a week, but if 40 other hours are spent sitting at a desk or sitting during your lunch break, you aren’t actually compensating for it while you’re at the gym.
While many of us mean well and fully intend to walk more on our lunch breaks or go to the gym more frequently, we are often so mentally tired after a long day at work that we wind up laying on the couch at home watching tv instead.
Humans have grown to be less active
In the 1960’s, approximately 50% of US jobs required heavy to moderate physical activity. This was a time when factory jobs were still common place and employees were on their feet all day whether doing heavy lifting or not. Now, however, that percentage is a measly 20%, meaning a whopping 80% of American jobs are almost wholly sedentary or demand very little physical exertion. The unfortunate truth is that most of us spend our workdays glued to our chairs staring at a computer. Sitting, is now an epidemic.
Think back to your childhood. You used to run around playing outdoors. At school you had P.E. classes and may have even been encouraged by your friends to take up a sport. Unfortunately, as you grew up, your opportunities to participate in physical activity became less available. While working for an income is a huge priority, should it really come before our health? Unfortunately, it seems most of us have said yes and thus, have stopped moving very often.
Even though you may do exercises once in a while, exercise alone isn’t enough to make you more active in general. In one study, two groups were analyzed. One group was very active, exercising more than 7 hours a week. The other group spent more of their time sitting down. The less physical group had a 50% greater risk of death. As if this isn’t a scary enough result, the same group also doubled their odds of dying from heart disease.
Get up and get moving
The goal is simple: move more, sit less. Look for small ways to incorporate more activity into each and every day. Maybe tomorrow you could share this article with a coworker and make it a goal to walk every day on your lunch break together. Try to fit in two miles a day. And if you have stairs in your office, try to take those rather than opting for the elevator.
This video also has some great recommendations you can try!
For even more inspiration, check out this article for exercises you can do while you’re at work: 29 Exercises You Can Do At (Or Near) Your Desk
Stand up now!
Don’t get so carried away with big goals that you disappoint yourself right away; try to start small. When you find substitutions in your daily life (such as taking the stairs at work or even standing and pacing while you talk on the phone), you can quickly start some new habits you’ll be able to keep in the long run.
While sometimes it can be so tempting to get home from a long day at work and lay around and binge watch your favorite series, you’ll be happier, and much healthier, if you can make it a point to be active. If you’re a pet owner, you’ll also feel better about your relationship with your pup — take them for a walk! Your healthy heart, and your furry friend, will thank you. If you don’t have a pet, link up with a neighbor who would help you stay motivated and accountable.

The ladies of the Pine-Richland field hockey team are going pink for their annual Play4theCure game against North Allegheny.
The field hockey team members will raise money for the National Foundation for Cancer Research (NFCR) during their game against the Tigers on Tuesday, Oct. 15.
The junior varsity game will begin at 6 p.m. and the varsity game will begin at 7:30 p.m. at Pine-Richland Stadium. Admission to the game is $5.
A pink T-shirt, designed by sophomore art student Erica Davis, will be sold at the game for $10.
The T-shirt plays off the team's theme for this year, “Whatever it takes!”
There also will be a bake sale and other fundraising activities. All proceeds from admission, T-shirt sales, bake sale and donations will be donated to the NFCR.
The team will be wearing the pink T-shirts and pink socks in recognition of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Players will use a pink ball.
The Pine-Richland Field Hockey team has been participating in Play4theCure for the past five years, said former event chair Mary Haenig. It started out as a team service project and grew into an annual event, she said.
“It's a great event and every year they've raised more and more money,” Haenig said.
Along with being a popular event, the game also is sure to draw in a lot of people for the match-up against rival North Allegheny, Haenig said.
Play4theCure began in 2006 as an annual indoor field hockey tournament in Feasterville, Bucks County, to raise money for breast cancer research, according to a NFCR statement. It has since expanded to include more than 500 recreational, high school and collegiate sports teams, and officially partnered with the NFCR for the first time this year.
The NFCR is the leading cancer research charity dedicated to funding research and public education relating to cancer prevention, earlier diagnosis, treatment and a cure, said Pine-Richland director of communications Rachel Hathhorn in a statement.
Aafke Loney, event chair, said Pine-Richland field hockey has donated money to Susan G. Komen and other cancer-related charities in the past, but this year they are raising funds for the NFCR.
“The girls really enjoy doing this,” Loney said. “It's such a great event. There's a lot of kids on the team and parents who have been affected by cancer or have had loved ones affected by cancer. So everyone rallies around this event.”
Last year, the Play4theCure event raised more than $300 and the team hopes to raise even more money this year, LoneyTuatara

“These new essays are mostly set in Iowa and Nebraska; in each, the author moves easily from the concrete to the abstract and back again, blending history, science, personal reminiscence, observation and reflection—inspired by topics such as the formation of geodes, memories of her grandmother, bird-banding at Schramm State Park, volunteer work among the poor, or her experiences with claustrophobia. . . .

The Great British Bake Off, BBC1, 8pm
Like this? Did you know we have a dedicated TV and Film page on Facebook?When I bought a tilt-shift lens for my landscape photography, I soon discovered how to shoot panoramas without the need for a nodal slide. But I noticed some parallax problems. The answer to this was the Rogeti TSE-frame.
I love my tilt-shift lenses. First, I bought a Canon TS-E 17mm f/4L. I was planning to use it for my landscape photography if 24mm was not wide enough. Besides extreme wide-angle purposes, I could use the tilt function to maximize the depth of field and the shift function for easy panoramas without the need for a nodal slide. Or so I thought.
Panoramas With a Tilt-Shift Lens
Parallax is the biggest issue with panoramas. It happens when the camera is not rotated in the correct way. The axis of the rotation has to be at the entrance pupil (often mistaken as the nodal point). For that, you have to use a nodal slide, which will allow you to prevent parallax. When using a tilt-shift lens, it is possible to use the shift function to change the view, allowing to shoot three photos without the need to rotate the camera.
But I soon found out it is not without parallax. By shifting the lens, you change the position of the entrance pupil from left to right or right to left, thus introducing parallax. It may not be visible when shooting objects in the distance. But when you incorporate objects in the foreground, parallax errors will occur.
Perhaps in landscapes, this could be avoided by leaving anything close to the foreground out of the frame. But for real estate photography, it definitely could be a problem.
Unfortunately, there is no way to correct this without the use of a nodal slide and rotating the camera at the entrance pupil or shifting the camera while keeping the entrance pupil at a fixed point. This could be done if the tilt-shift lens had a tripod collar, but Canon did not incorporate this in their tilt-shift lenses. Then, I heard about a Chinese company called Rogeti. It offered a TSE frame, which was basically a custom made tripod collar for a select number of Canon TS-E lenses. This would be the answer to the parallax problem.
The Rogeti TSE Frame
Rogeti produces some nice panorama products, like a geared tripod head, L-brackets, and some things for GoPro users. Their TSE frame is made from lightweight anodic oxidized aluminum, adding only 215 grams to the lens. It is not cheap, so I was in doubt for a while if I would need this frame for my photography.
The TSE Frame III (the third version) is very well built. It fits both the TS-E 24mm f/3.5L II and the TS-E 17mm f/4L. A few rubber mounts hold the lens without leaving scratches, and there are four spirit bubbles that match the different angles in which the frame can be used.
Rogeti provides a nodal slide with the TSE frame and a bracket that can carry a smartphone or gray card to block sunlight. This is very handy when using the TS-E 17mm f/4L.
Installing the TSE frame is very easy. When installed, the frame does have a few issues. It is difficult to reach the knobs, and the distance scale is difficult the read. The depth of field scale is completely blocked. But the biggest issue is perhaps the lost ability to use the tilt option. Although this is the price you pay for adding a tripod collar: it limits the full potential of the tilt-shift lens.
On the other hand, the TSE frame's purpose is for shooting panoramic footage. If the lens is used with the tilt option, you will probably not use it for panoramic shots at the same time. Because it is easy to install or remove the bracket, it won't be a major drawback, I think.
Panorama Shift Possibilities With the TSE Frame
The idea of the TSE adapter is simple. Those who know something about panoramas and nodal slides know how it works. Instead of moving the lens, the adapter allows you to move the camera instead. This way, the image circle of the TS-E lens will stay at exactly the same position, while the camera shifts to capture the whole diameter of the image circle. This way, you can be sure there is no parallax at all. The next two animated GIFs show how it works
There are four ways to use the TSE frame for panoramas. If you also count the different orientations, you end up with eight possibilities. First of all, the TSE frame can be used in the horizontal orientation. Second, the TSE frame can also be used in a diagonal orientation, allowing a field of view that is more than 2.5 times the original field of view.
Shooing in a Horizontal Position
By mounting the TSE frame in the regular horizontal position, you are able to shift the camera up and down or left and right. This can be done with the camera in portrait orientation and in landscape orientation
The field of view will be 200% in vertical shift with the camera in landscape orientation or lateral shift in portrait orientation. A vertical shift in portrait orientation will increase the field of view 167%, just like a lateral shift in landscape orientation.
Shooting in a Diagonal Position
When the TSE frame is mounted diagonally, it is possible to shift the camera across both diagonals, increasing the field of view up to 251%. It is possible to use only the top half of the frame, of course, preventing a horizon in the middle. This will increase the landscape orientation to 147% and the vertical orientation to 171%.
If a TS-E 17mm f/4L is used in this way, it is possible to obtain an amazing field of view, with an increase of resolution at the same time. If you don't care about the increased resolution, you could also shoot with a 12mm ultra-wide-angle, ending up with nearly the same angle of view.
Using the TSE Frame in Real Situations
Due to the limited amount of weight, it is easy to leave the TSE frame connected to the lens while transporting it in a camera bag. Using the frame is simple: just place it on the tripod, level the camera, and shoot. Rotating the knob for the shift can be tricky, just like loosening the locking knob. There is not much space between the frame and the camera body. Also, the levers for rotating the camera might be difficult the reach.
When using the frame for vertical panoramas, the weight of the camera requires you to fasten the locking knob. But this is not due to the frame itself, but the way the TS-E lens works. Just like panoramas in the traditional way, with a nodal slide, you have to take your time to properly set up your camera. I don't mind, because it is spending time photographing. This kind of photography is not about speed and shooting quickly before moving on.
Although horizontal panoramas are the first thing that comes to mind, the TSE frame is perfect for a vertical panorama. If you used a nodal slide, a vertical panorama would require a 360°/180° setup. The TSE frame allows us to keep the camera horizontal while shifting it from top to bottom. It allows perfect shots with a nice foreground. The first three examples below are made this way, and the last three examples are horizontal panoramas.
I needed to make sure the distance was set correctly, because the depth of field scale is barely visible. Setting the hyperfocal distance becomes a bit tricky. This is the biggest problem with the frame, I think. Although with a bit of practice, you get to know the right distance for a hyperfocal setting. If you want to use the tilt function of the lens for maximum depth of field, you need to remove the TSE frame.
My Conclusion
I had my doubts about this Rogeti TSE frame, especially concerning the price. It is just over $300, and that is a lot. But I decided to give it a try and ordered one. It makes panoramic photos very easy without the risk of parallax. Compared to a nodal slide, there is no rotation, and it will prevent the typical curvature of horizontal lines in panoramas. But at the same time, it will stretch the sides of the image. For landscapes, this is not a real problem, but for real estate, it may give a strange look to the image.
I haven't used it in real estate yet since 24mm and 17mm work well for most of the houses I have to photograph. But I definitely will try soon to see how it turns out. For landscape photography, it gives a nice addition when you already use tilt-shift lenses.
What I Liked
- Avoiding parallax with landscapes
- Four spirit bubbles for every possible orientation
- Lightweight
- Well constructed
- Rubber holders to prevent damage to the lens
- High resistance hinge, stays open for easy assembly
- Nodal slide provided
- Holder for smartphone or gray card to block sunlight
- Usable for the TS-E 17mm and the TS-E 24mm
- Arca Swiss compatible mount
- 3/8" and 1/4" threaded screw hole provided
- Both horizontal and diagonal mount
What I Didn't Like
- No possibility for tilt anymore
- The focal distance scale is not easy to see
- Depth of field scale is almost completely obstructed
- Knobs for shift are not easy to use anymore
- Gun sight is provided but will be blocked by the camera
- A separate holder is needed for the TS-E 50mm f/2.8L
Alternatives
I have found two alternatives on the internet. First, there is the PPL TSE adapter. It is a piece of aluminum weighing 370 grams. It is not as flexible and requires a screwdriver to change the TS-E lenses. It is also much more expensive.
The other one is the Sunway TS-E24 bracket. It is heavier and less flexible compared to the Rogeti TSE adapter. But, just like the PPL, the adapter seems less bulky, thus leaving the focus ring and depth of field graphic visible. The Sunway is less expensive and seems to be a good alternative to the Rogeti.
Your Thoughts
What do you think of a TSE frame for parallax-free panorama with a TS-E lens? Do you think it is worth it, or just a piece of equipment that doesn't add a lot of value? Or perhaps you have an alternative for the Rogeti TSE frame? Please let me know in the comment below.
I have two Agnos Jumbo brackets for my Nikkor PC-E lenses and I love them! Especialliy with subject nearby or macrowork with the 85mm it is a great addition. I modified them slightly to decrease the height.
I did not know this one. It is great how they managed to keep the tilt available. I wish the Rogeti had this too.
Thanks for sharing. Looks like a great product
Yes, it is a great product, afaik the only option for Nikkor PC-E's.
I find if wanting to replicate the "idea" of large format then using a tilt shift lens in this fashion works well. Still life or architecture is where this type of kit works very, very well. The inability to change angle of tilt is where this, for me, misses the mark. I can take a panoramic head and create a landscape that feels like the viewer is in the image because you can bring the closest parts of the foreground even closer to the viewer with defining detail while utilizing the panoramic ability of the head to and a general zoom lens to create wide angles of view while also capturing detailed mid ground subjects. Then when doing a mixed focal length panorama you can take advantage of the additional detail while making the image itself easier to put together in post. Overall, the pano head versus the tilt shift with rotator option, for me, the former is more valuable to me as a creative, but that's again for me and what I like creating. It's a neat piece of kit.
You mention a mixed focal length panorama? Do you mean you change focal length between individual shots while shooting a panorama? Can you explain this because if this is the case, I would love to learn more about that
Sorry for not getting back to you faster. Ya, I can go over it with ya. Just send me a DM on FB.
No Problem. I have send a message on FB
Interesting and detailed article. I’m amazed the niche businesses out there who come up with these devices.. A pity it doesn’t tilt as well. In many ways it’s like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. For most people it would be overkill but at the top end small improvements matter. For me as tilt shift owner it’s interesting as it performs shift the correct way in that the sensor is moving. Well done on the article. More please.
I will try to write more :)
Thanks for the comment
in 2013 I had a TS-E tripod collar from the Hartblei.eu
the web site still exists, but I don't know, what the status is
I found it very usefull but just too bulky and sent it back
at that time I used my Leica M9, it was my only full frame digital
the second image is a comparison between the 17mm TS-E shifted in all directions and combined to a panorama shot and the overlay with original shots with the other focal lenghts
I can imagine you did find it bulky. Especially when you carry it with you when using such a compact system. I guess you did not like it enough to keep using it.
The comparison is something I noticed also; 12mm ultra-wide angle covers almost the same diagonal field of view. Thanks for sharing. It is a great addition to the article
How hard are these rubber mounts? Do they leave indentations on the lens barrel after long time use?
These rubber mounts do not tighten the lens enough to leave any mark. The bracket fits real snug without any presure.
I don't see any marks whatsoever. :)
I’ve been tempted to pick one of these up—I have both the 24 and 17mm TS-E lenses... I just have a gut feeling I wouldn’t use it all that much. Also, I haven’t had any parallax issues with creating shifted panoramas... I’m sure this would help but is it worth $300? I don’t know. I am very tempted to pick up the geared tripod head Rogeti just released however!
Actually, I remember one or two times where I wish I had this where I had to try and get more of the structure I was shooting in the frame. The first time I didn’t even have the 17, so I created a less than ideal “crop” of the scene by shifting the 24 to its limits. But the second time I was pushing the 17 to the limits by shifting and I recall that stitching that mofo together afterwards was not easy...
I understand your dilemma. I experienced the same dilemma.
It is always possible to choose for rotating the lens around the entrance pupil with a nodal slide. It is less expensive, and it works if you don't use the shift function
there is a very big difference:
if you shoot images from one image circle like a TS-E lens or a medium format lens
or you rotate the lens!
When you rotate a lens, even with perfect nodal point correction, you always get distortions like round lines of buildings. To a certain degree you may correct it in post, but you have to add new calculated pixels. This is a problem with architecture but of course less in landscape.
I add a picture with a Sony Nex-7 (infrared converted) adapted to a Hasselblad lens with a Rhinocam adapter. This adapter allows to move the camera and shoot multiple images in two rows, that fit perfectly to one high res high megapixel image
and one more a Nex-6 with the same adapter mounted on a 4x5" back of a Gandolfi camera. With this you may use the full shift and tilt options of the large format and get images of up to a few hundred megapixel
happy shooting
dierk
You are absolutely correct. When rotating the setup you will end up with straight lines being bended (I hope I said that in the correct way). This was one of the reasons to choose a tiltshift lens for panorama shots.
But for landscapes it isn't that obvious, as long as you don't make panorama's that are more than - let's say 120° - . For architectural images it will be seen immediately.
If you are shooting panoramas just once or twice, the nodal slide will be a good alternative, even when you need to corret the image in post. It saves you a lot of money. But if you need to shoot a lot fo these images, it becomes interesting, I think.
I love to see your setup. Both of them. I think it is a better sollution than a tilt-shift with a bracket.
But less easy to take with you.
Thanks for sharing. :)
with this setup there is a huge limitation compared with a 24mm or even 17mm TS lens!
you are obviously limited to the available wide angle lenses for medium format with about 40mm and for the large format of about 90mm.
But if this is ok. for the job, it is great. I love for example the Zeiss 120mm macro lens of the Hasselblad for product shots - or I use the 85mm PC Micro Nikkor and have tilt and shift and stitching all together :-)
I have the impression, that I could offer a separate on this topic post to Fstoppers :-)
last example: Sony A6000 with 85mm PC Micro Nikkor with tilt and stitched shifted,
printed 2m wide :-)
Recently I used the Fujifilm GF 23mm lens for the (almost) medium format sensor GFX100 camera. And I believe there are already some shorter focal length available for those cameras. Are these lenses a possibility for your setup?
it is called medium format, but with 44 x 33 mm it is in the middle between 35mm and the normal 6x6cm (56x56mm) format of the lenses, I used. When you stitch two 24 x 36mm you may get 48 x 36mm and this is even more than the GFX100 offers, and with a 42 MPix sensor the resolution is very close, not to mention the new 60 MPix sensors. The image circle of a 44 x 33 camera will be much smaller than with a normal 6x6 camera and will not support more that two shots for stitching. Besides that, I assume, that the lenses for the GFX need the electronics from the camera to operate the diaphragma.
One more example
Sony A6000 with Zeiss Makro-Planar 4/120mm on Rhinocam adapter
stitched from 12 (4x3) images, 180 MP, 13.400 x 13.400 pixel
and a 1:1 crop
judge yourself :-)
Nando,
I would like to add some experiences with 17mm TS-E stitching.
I do stitching with any lens since about 15 years, some with a nodal corrected pano head, some with tripod but most hand held
all pictures with 17mm TS-E
the first picture with tripod and shift left and right and compensated the 12mm shift on a macro rail by the same amount (Leica M9)
the second picture with very close foreground from tripod 3 images in portrait orientation, no problems with the foreground (Leica M9)
the third image in a church two images hand held! in panorama orientation (Sony A7RII)
as long as there is not a too close foreground I don't see any problem
Thank you for showing the examples.
You are correct. Without a nearby foreground it won't be any problem.
There‘s also an adapter option by German company pocket pano and they chose a significantly different approach. I think their adapter is the lightest and smallest on the market and it enables tilt as well...
I bought it about a year ago as the Rogeti was double the price compared to the Pocket Pano version. So far I‘m happy with mine. But man, I‘d love to have the diagonal shift function that is built into the new Rogeti adapter.
I have checked this product.
The pocket pano is nothing more than a regular nodal slide setup for 360°/180° panoramas. Nothing wrong with i, but not primarily for tilt-shift lenses.
Hey Nando, thank you for your immediate reply. I‘m not sure if we‘re talking about the same product. This is what I meant:
It offers rear shift just as the Rogeti or the sunwayfoto
I am sorry, I missed this one. y mistake.
Looks like a great product. But only for the TS-E 17L if I am not mistaken? Would be great if it also would fit the TS-E 24L
I guess that‘s not your fault. They didn‘t really announce this anywhere publicly as far as I know and I just happened to know it by accident. Being German myself might have helped, too.
There‘s one frame for the 17+24mm TS-E and they have a brand new one for the 50mm as well now. Just like the line-up/compability of the Rogeti frames.
By the way. Designwise I prefer the Rogeti frame by a lot. It just looks way cooler 😂 plus the 45 degree position of the Rogeti frame is also a nice benefit, as the PocketPano doesn’t offer the same convenience when stitching diagonally.
A tripod mount at a 45° location would fix this easily. I wonder why they didn't incorporate this
I can tell you as I asked them multiple times 😀. They have the two positions in 90 degree position to fully enable every possible combination of shift and tilt mechanism.
And they said it‘s easy enough to just rotate the tripod head about 45 degrees to enable diagonal shifts. While this might be true I think this still brings some problems when using just about any head except for accurately centred heads like the cube. For example, using the Manfrotto heads: when tilting the tripod head to 45 degree one‘s moving the entire camera setup about 10cm to the side and this might destroy the perfectly aligned camera position forcing to compose everything again.
They even told me it‘d been no problem to add the third tripod mount in between, they just didn‘t see it as a benefit. I disagreed but for now the design will remain as it is.by Radar Staff

It's the old bread-and-circuses plan -- the budget hurts ordinary North Carolinians, but we'll have awesome sports teams to take our minds off the pain.
Hmm, I didn't know about this one. Bread and circuses, indeed. Sadly, I've found out firsthand how dangerous it is to criticize an employer's basketball team.

Do academic scholarships pay in-state rates for out of state kids?
"How bout a Fresca? Mr Scholarship winner."
Posted by: Mick | Aug 06, 2009 at 04:01 PM
Yep, in grad school, I had plenty of friends who were academic all-stars from out of state (or out of country) who got in-state tuition rates.
Posted by: Patrick Eakes | Aug 06, 2009 at 05:34 PM
Why do academics hate athletes so?
If what PE says is so.... where is the outrage? Either scholarship recipients get in state prices or they do not. It is right and fair or it is not. Goose.... gander. blah.

Posted by: jb | Aug 07, 2009 at 01:38 PM
Nice piece. I likes and I agree.
Does strike me as odd that all of the hoopla is over athletes not just out of staters getting in state rates. Seems selective outrage to me.
Kinda like the Northern Guilford debacle. All kinds of kids are there "illegally" but athletes take the heat. Waste-oids, motoer heads and geeks get a free pass.
Typical academic prejudices abound.
Posted by: Mick | Aug 07, 2009 at 01:55 PM
The nerve! Academics have no right to set expectations for an academic institutions, just because they have a brain. Geez! Makes me so angry!
Posted by: Played Ball in Collige | Aug 07, 2009 at 02:15 PM
I don't think it's a matter of academics "hating" athletes, but of universities setting priorities that put school over sports, and expecting big-money sports programs to fund their imported talent.
Posted by: Ed Cone | Aug 07, 2009 at 02:22 PM
You know, I was thinking(which is dangerous), what great free advertising UNC got on their NC run. But what the heck, I understand they had 20,000 applications for 4,000 spots this year.
Posted by: Kim | Aug 07, 2009 at 02:53 PM
Athletes meet minimum standards for admission so Played Ball is just hating.
Is the issue some athletes getting admitted over academically superior candidates or is the issue in state tuition for out of atate students or is it just plain academic snobbery and athletes getting in state prices but it is OK for academics to pay in state prices regardless of residency?
Seems "unfair" to me to single out athletes in the out of state/in state debate.
Posted by: Mick | Aug 07, 2009 at 02:57 PM
"Athletes meet minimum standards for admission."
"Minimum" often equals "minimal" when it comes to bigtime football and basketball.
Those sports are quasi-professional endeavors at state universities.
That's not to say there aren't plenty of bright, hard-working students in the mix. And, as Kim says, the publicity can be good, and many of us enjoy college sports greatly.
But let's be clear about what's going on with these programs.
If you want to argue that importing talent at a discount to help big-money programs win more football and basketball games is a worthwhile endeavor, and that continuing to do so when academics are suffering in a budget crisis makes sense, have at it.
Posted by: Ed Cone | Aug 07, 2009 at 03:58 PM
Ed,
The issue as you describe it, to me, is legit. Albeit tilting at windmill-ish. But, I still cannot grasp the diff between an out of state brainiac getting in state tuition is OK but an athlete..... OH NOOOO. Some local kid and we tax payers still get screwed. And attendance at HI IQ Bowls is way down I hear.
Would you like to argue that UNC-CH would enjoy it's current level of national prominance w/o basketball? How'd you put it... "have at it". That's a little more than a nod to good publicity.
And, lets also be clear that some of these programs generate ba-jillions of dollars for the respective communities and oh yeah Greensboro from time to time. It aint all bad. Out of whack a bit perhaps.
If your argument is fairness and/or budget crisis then out of state kids pay out of state fees all across the board. Not just athletes. And I do suggest reading the not-linked link supplied by jb above.
Bunch a egg heads tryin to "rooorn" my life.
Posted by: Mick | Aug 07, 2009 at 05:16 PM
Mick, I'm an ardent, lifelong Tar Heel fan, and I think athletics add a lot to a school and to the state, and also that athletics are part of a well-rounded life (although D1 revenue-sport athletics are not really something that the vast majority of students will ever hope to experience).
But on general principle, and as a taxpaying citizen of North Carolina, I absolutely favor academics over bigtime sports, and I have no problem at all saying I'd like to see more money used for academics, including scholarships for the best students and pay for the best teachers, while big-money sports can pay a bit more to import their talent.
So there you have it: much as I like big-time sports, I think our university should place more of a priority on academics.
Posted by: Ed Cone | Aug 07, 2009 at 05:52 PM
Well said and agreed for the most part.
But I obviously disagree on the issue of the scholarships. All or none as far as I am concerned. It is taxpayer money afterall.

Abstract
Coalition military forces have become the norm, and to be ready for multinational operations, militaries must prepare using relevant training, education, and exercises. Many nations and security coalitions use advanced distributed learning technologies to, at least partially, meet this demand. Towards that end, this paper examines the intersection of multinational military training and education and innovations in learning science and technology, specifically those involving distributed learning. To write this piece, authors from 12 nations/NATO collaborated. Content contributors serve as military officers or civil servants in their defense ministries, and each works in the technology-enabled learning domain. The paper begins by highlighting national strategies in support of multinational collaboration. It then discusses collaborative efforts involving technology-based learning. Next, it describes a survey of the authors’ organizations, which examined their priorities, challenges, and uses of distributed learning. Finally, the paper closes with our survey findings and recommended next steps for consideration by coalition military training and education stakeholders. Some key findings from the survey include the following: Use of distributed learning is expanding across the board. On average across surveyed organizations, enhancing the instructional quality (pedagogy/andragogy) of distributed learning ranks as the number-one focus area. Mobile learning and, possibly, game-based distributed learning may see an uptake in use, but there are unmet needs in the areas of learning analytics and, correspondingly, xAPI and learner/teacher performance dashboards. Finally, international partnerships—specifically in the area of distributed learning—yield tangible benefits.Is European VC really out-performing the US, or is this wishful thinking?
Crowdtap Raises $7 Million To Help Brands Connect With Their Influential Customers
There’s been a lot of debate about the role of VC backing for startups in Europe recently, not least because we’ve been pushing the issue to try and provoke a response from European VCs who – with notable exceptions of course – tend not to come out fighting quite as much as their US peers. The majority of European VCs tend to blog less, tweet less and, as a result much of the debate about VC comes from disgruntled European entrepreneurs. But now one really has come out fighting.
German VC firm Earlybird has produced a long slide presentation and written notes – written by Hendrik Brandis and Jason Whitmire – that argues that although the European venture industry is a quarter of the size of the U.S. market, proportionally speaking it is outperforming the US VC industry in returns. As a result, Limited Partners (LIPs) – the funds that invest in VCs – should start sitting up and taking notice. It has to be said of course that as VCs across the globe battle for funding, it is in their interests to come out swinging from their corner to fight for these funds. But let’s hear them out.
Earlybird argues that European VCs are achieving some of the best multiple exits in the world, and that it’s not just the old tired example Skype which is driving this. It also argues that because there are less VCs in Europe, it’s more of a buyers market, capable of better returns as a result (we’ll leaving the fuming entrepreneurs aside for a moment).
Here are the slides:
However, it’s a rather rosy view of European VC, so we took Whitmore to task for some of the assertions in the slides.
POINT 1
On slide #4 there is a slide showing the amount invested and returns. But it is unclear if the two are linked. In other words, are those the returns for that amount invested? Or is Earlybird saying concurrently that amount was invested while that amount was returned. If it’s the latter, this slide is irrelevant. Funding has been down over the last 24 months, as we’ve reported, so of course the comparison will be dramatic. Our guess is many of those returns are NOT from companies founded over the last 24 months.
Whitmore: No they are NOT linked, this is the money going into the industry and money coming out of the industry in a specific year. We believe the slide therefore is very relevant.
POINT 2
Slide number five looks impressive until you read the description. It says “proportionately europe is producing higher exit multiples than the US,” actual exit values are 25% lower. Again, given the pull back in funding, this feels like manipulation and it certainly doesn’t back up the email that Europe has surpassed the US. That’s like saying Israel has surpassed China because the per capital numbers are stronger. Of course they are stronger. china has more than $1 billion people. Capital efficiency matters, but entry level valuations do not since investors will have a liquidation preference.
Whitmore: With respect to multiples Europe has surpassed the US, you will not find any data anywhere contradicting this. This is the core of our message, i.e., if you look at it from the LP (i.e., investor in any given VC fund) perspective, the absolute size of the industry does not matter, only the multiples (performance) in specific funds matter. And in the title of slide slide we say “individual fund performance has surpassed the US” – we are NOT referring to absolute industry size, which what you have inadvertently mis-interpreted. So the hypothesis that the relationship is so dramatic because funding has been down is not proven here (even in Germany, where we have had an average of $400m invested for the last 7 years).
POINT 3
Slide #6 – same issue as Slide #4. It’s unclear that the amount invested directly correlates to exits seen. Also that is showing sheer *number* of exits over $100 million calling those homeruns. That’s not a home run in silicon valley. If you looked at actual *dollar value* US has to dwarf. Consider linkedin alone. It’s a $10 billion company. We doubt two years of European exits add up to $10 billion. And even if it did, Facebook, Zynga, Groupon, many of the largest companies in the US are holding off on going public. Are those factored in at all? Clearly not, or they wouldn’t be sending an absurd note saying Europe is outpacing the US in returns.
Whitmore: We do not share these arguments, i.e., it is still impressive to see that Europe has a higher SHARE of exits of $100m in the venture industry, this is a fair analysis. The above argues that the outliers are in the US ($ multi-billion exits) which is true), but the average exit value in the US is only slightly higher (20%) so it does not make a huge difference. So these examples do not change the picture, not to mention that Groupon, Zynga are not exited yet and are not factored into the data (but Google is factored in). Also, if the last 2 years of European exits already add up to $15 billion, we think the next two years will be double to triple this given the points made in slide 30 (i.e., most post-bubble European VC portfolios with great companies are only now at the inflection point to start major exits).
POINT 4
Slide #7 makes no sense. it’s a smaller industry. saying a higher percentage are “top quartile” is asinine as a concept and a comparison. It’s still a fraction of the US number overall. That doesn’t mean country on country returns are better, which appears to be what Earlybird is trying to argue.
Whitmore: The absolute numbers do not count if looked from an LP (investor in VC funds) perspective, i.e., the RELATIVE numbers are what matter.
POINT 5
Slide #8 says “forget the charts” – this is contradictory.
Whitmore: This was meant to illustrate the aforementioned results by looking at the actual great exited companies (without the need for charts) – you are right this point can be made more clearly.
POINT 6
Slide #9 , see the Linkedin point. ALL of these $1 b+ exits add up to about 1.7x LinkedIns. That doesn’t count ANYONE else exiting in the valley.
Whitmore: Again the focus here is on European performance and exit multiples, not to compare [with the US].
POINT 7
Slide #10 is interesting and probably the strongest point, but it bears noting most of the US’ strongest companies of the last decade haven’t gone out yet, which has been pretty well documented. This could become irrelevant in a year. and given the preceding slides, we’d want to see the underlying data.
Whitmore: Good point, and we can send you the underlying data.
POINT 8
Slide #12 makes our point about slide #4 and #6. Earlybird is measuring returns now which were made from MUCH higher amounts of capital against concurrent funding numbers that have since declined.
Whitmore: We are saying that supply has declined (which you confirm) and demand has increased in deal performance, in which case the aggregate amount of capital entering the market is not as relevant.
POINT 9
Slide #15 makes our point about why slide #7 is spurious reasoning.
Whitmore: We are more focused on looking at the is data through the eyes of VC investors (LPs), who are mainly interested in top quartile results.
POINT 10
The remaining slides argue why a paucity of venture capital in Europe mean only the best deals get funded at low prices. Again, valuation doesn’t actually correlate to returns – amount invested is the input. Also, that’s a great argument for why to be bullish on Europe but has nothing to do with a comparison against the US.
Whitmore: Good point, however valuation does matter (as well as money in) and both are currently more favorable in Europe because lower amounts of funding and lower valuations.
POINT 11
Slide #26 – again these are pegging everything to $100 million exits. That’s not a homerun in the valley. The reason amount invested is larger is because most investors would be aiming to build a bigger company. If you looked at $1 b companies the comparison would fall away because Europe has only had a dozen $1 b exits in two years.
Whitmore: These are pegged to $100m PLUS (so not just $100m exits), but at the end of the day even exit valuation does not matter, only exit multiples matter (from the LP perspective). So if you invest $50m at a $1Bn valuation and you have at 10Bn exit, the investor only has a 5x return, so multiples are the only thing that matters in the VC industry, and you are looking only at the absolute numbers. We argue that European venture capital we can live with significantly lower exit valuations and still make better multiples, as we invest at lower entry valuations at less money.
POINT 12
Germany has had $4.4 b in exits in the last 24 months. Again that’s half Linkedin. Great for germany but it doesn’t prove Europe is out performing the bay area in any respect
Whitmore: Importantly, we are not arguing that the European and German venture industry is outpacing the US, we are arguing that the PERFORMANCE is outpacing the US, and this is what is relevant for LPs / investors into venture capital. We are not challenging the fact that the US VC industry is MUCH larger than Europe. We are only talking about MULTIPLES and PERFORMANCE from the LP perspective, and this is what is relevant for LPs / investors into venture capital. This is very much different from the “we have LinkedIn and you don’t” perspective.

We went to see the famed Amish faith healer, Solomon Wickey, whose home in rural Amish country is not far from my own.
His recent death has inspired us to share our thoughts and memories: a woman bent over in some strange position. To see Solomon, she endured a four-hour ride in the van lying down at an extremely awkward angle. Solomon told her to get up so he could perform a procedure. She said, “I can't.” He said, “I think you can,” and she got up from her chair! She was crying as she told us this.
Another woman brought her son for a “maintenance treatment.” When the boy originally visited Solomon, he was bent over with a so-called spinal deformity. Solomon said “virus be gone” as he clutched the boy's abdomen. The boy is now straight as an arrow and playing soccer.
Another woman had been holding her supposedly incurable, fatal cancer at bay for nearly three years with an herbal regimen designed by Solomon. Another cancer-ridden young woman, diagnosed as terminal, came out of the office crying tears of joy and hope. He told her that her cancer would be cured by taking the recommended supplements.
A woman in a wheelchair came accompanied by two young female friends. She had been injured in an automobile accident with her then boyfriend, a basketball star at Indiana University. Solomon told her doctors aren't always right and thought she would walk again, which brought a strong emotional response with lots of tears. Jan says, and I agree, “There was profound poignancy and healing in that waiting room, the likes of which I do not believe I have ever experienced again.”
Solomon's followers can be found all around the world. But he is not without his critics. He's been called a “quack,” and in 1983 he was hauled into court by the Indiana attorney general for practicing medicine without a license. His supporters packed the courtroom in Decatur for his trial. He eventually was free to continue his practice, which is grounded in the natural world, treating with herbs, not drugs. A news article quotes him as saying that his goal for his patients is to teach them to “balance the whole universe physically, mentally and spiritually.”
Obviously Wickey brought a different point of view to a medical establishment that knowingly puts dangerous drugs on the market, trumps up diseases, heralds cures for illnesses that have no scientific research to back it up and smothers treatments that can work for dreadful diseases like cancer, all in the name of profit. Right there is a major difference. Wickey didn't do his work for profit. He didn't charge. You didn't need insurance to see him, you didn't need to worry about how you're going to pay the bill.
Here I need to point out that I am a benefactor of modern medical technology. A gifted doctor patched up my elbow after I smashed it, giving me the use of my arm. Another doctor blessed with healing powers cracked open my chest and with a steady hand sewed five new arteries into my heart, in the process saving my life.
They saved Jan's life, performing surgery for a stomach ailment. For sure, modern medicine has its place. But so does a Solomon Wickey. Would I go to him for open heart surgery? To restore my arm with metal plates and screws? No, I would not. But what if I had gone to see him years earlier? Maybe, just maybe, I wouldn't have needed the open heart surgery. Or suffered a stroke.
We need the Solomon Wickeys, not instead of traditional treatment, but in addition to. As our visit so dramatically documents, what Solomon gave to his followers is the most potent medicine of all: hope. And that makes him an American hero, captured beautifully in this poem Jan wrote:
On Seeing the Amish Healer Solomon Wickey
Before the weave of coarse cotton,
Before rough hands turned the plow,
It was coiled everywhere,
Serenely moving waves
Summoning tides
Guiding rocks, trees, and stars.
Wordless, beyond joy or despair,
Fate or time.
Shape shifting,
Barefoot Buddha,
A robeless priest,
An Amish shaman
Sits in a Chaco Canyon office
With Chamayo floors and walls.
Sunlit arches
Allow broken entries,
Watershed eyes,
Wheelchair legs.
Crippled hands
Carrying certificates of doom
Suddenly, wind, wave, and earth cured.
Solomon speaks Pre-Navajo,
Syllables for wind and wave sounds.
“Give the glory to Jesus,” he says,
Translation from the Book Of Photons:
All glory to wind, fire, stars, and sun.
His face is not Amish, Jesus, or Buddha.
It's a petroglyph,
Aboriginal,
Constellations marked with ancient hands.A referee in Ethiopia was attacked by players after he made a controversial decision in the country’s premier league.
The game between military team Defence and Welwalo Adigrat University was heading to a 1-1 draw when the referee ruled the ball crossed the line and awarded a goal to Defence.
He was then chased down by Welwalo Adigrat players and was punched to the ground by one of their coaches.

It’s simple enough to make eggs and coffee for yourself in the morning (at least, I would hope so), but sometimes you don’t want to be bothered, or maybe you suck at cooking.
Either way, State College is home to plenty of places to grab the first meal of the day, and plenty have their opinions on them. The Waffle Shop is a fixture, churning out a breakfast worth the wait in line since 1972 at a turnover rate that would make the Supply Chain department blush. The (fake) Waffle Shop downtown is quick, convenient and cheap as all hell, making it a favorite for those who don’t want to move too much on Sunday mornings. Irving’s breakfast special has become a religious experience for many. The Corner Room and Nittany Lion Inn have their buffets too, both of which are excellent. Hell, even Denny’s, IHOP and those nasty East Halls eggs have their place as favorites among Penn Staters.
Last Friday, though, a new challenger approached, and fully staked its claim in my heart (both with cholesterol and love).
The Naked Egg Café is located 10 minutes southwest of Old Main, about halfway between campus and Whipple Dam State Park. That’s a bit off the beaten path for your average student, who probably avoids most things that aren’t within walking distance (or at least have a CATA stop nearby), but it is worth the ride. In a rather unassuming spot off of Pine Grove Road, it just has the feel of one of those places you drive past and always mean to try. A relatively small brick building with purple and green painted interior that the girls in our group periodically described as “so cute,” the restaurant has a much different atmosphere than that of the State College breakfast institutions. A calmer, quieter atmosphere made for a much more relaxed meal than, say, the vibrant energy of the patrons of the Waffle Shop (although Get Low was being played very softly as mood music, in case you wanted to subtly turn up). Tables adorned with Cholula and specialty espresso drink menus reminded me of some of the breakfast spots I love in New York. The experience of it all was different than what I was used to here, that’s for sure.
Destined to give everything a fair shot, I recruited Onward State editor and dedicated Irving’s employee Ali Fogarty, OS photographer Jenna Seco, who could be at the Culinary Institute of America right now, and Jenna’s boyfriend Dan Stepanov, who probably was just hungry. They all contributed to this post.
The coffee and orange juice came out first, fresh ground and fresh squeezed, and you could definitely taste the difference. Dipping the banana bread slice I ordered to start in it may have been a strange move on my part, but was delicious nonetheless. The cake was moist but crumbly, the ideal combo for a banana bread. The big guns came a few minutes later, as we all over-ordered for the sake of trying it all (I was buying, so fuck me, I guess). Jenna and Ali both got omelets, while Dan and I went with “The Whole Farm,” which came with eggs, bacon, toast, an english muffin, and tater tots. Oh man, the tater tots. I never really think about them as a breakfast food. I don’t really ever think about tater tots unless someone’s making a really dated Napoleon Dynamite reference, to be honest. However, these were incredible. In fact, I’m going to go out of the order I was planning for this article to extoll the virtues of Naked Egg’s tater tots and eggs together on a plate with hot sauce. Hot damn. Make sure you get these as your side, they were awesome. My meal was perfectly proportioned, the eggs scrambled right, the bacon crisp but still chewy, the english muffin toasted but not burnt and those tots, man.
As for our omelet orderers, the praise was unanimous. Courtesy of Ali:
As a big fan of bacon, I opted for the piggy omelette, though I chose to substitute the sausage for tomatoes and standard eggs for egg whites. When our food came out, I was pleased to see that my omelette was both huge and overflowing with filling. The egg-to-meat-to-tomato ratio was spot on, and the egg whites were peppered to perfection. The tomatoes were not overcooked, and while the bacon could have been a bit crispier, the ham was perfect. It wasn’t slimy like breakfast ham can be at times but rather more like those really good spiral cut hams you get for holidays. Muy bueno. The tater tots were fried just the perfect amount — crispy, but not burnt.
And Jenna:
When my food first came out and I saw my fluffy, white omelette it looked like the most comfortable pillow in the world. Then, it was love at first bite. The only thing cheesier than that statement was my omelette. The tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach and green peppers were in every single bite. I didn’t get one bite of tomatoes and then one of peppers, it was evenly distributed throughout the whole omelette.
The two items we shared as a table received praise as well. First, the Fatty Patty pizza. Caramelized onions that Ali described as perfect, smoked gouda, spinach and bacon on top of the pie made it a heavier dish (“one slice was plenty satisfying”), but a good one. A breakfast restaurant serving pizza, and serving it well, in State College no less, impressed me.
The Pièce de résistance, though, was this beauty:
When done right, Eggs Benedict is the best breakfast food out there. The gooey richness of the egg, the salty smoky ham, the crispy english muffin, and the buttery, creamy hollandaise on top provides a combination that very few dishes can bring to the table (pun absolutely intended).
Courtesy of Ali:
Having never tried Eggs Benedict prior to today, I was really impressed. I didn’t have any expectations for the dish, but once again the ham was some of the best I’ve ever had and the poached egg was very, very good. The hollandaise sauce had a nice flavor that wasn’t too overpowering, but again I’ve never tried it before so I can’t say how it would stack up to other locations.
While Ali merely adopted the Egg Benedict, I was born into it. The Eggs Benedict game is my hustle, and I’d ride and die for it. Having tried it at many, many places all over the world, I can safely say that The Naked Egg’s Eggs Benedict was the best I’ve ever had. Seriously, it’s worth the trip just for that. The asparagus was a great complement as well and a nice break from the carbs and proteins that made up our morning.
By the time we left, we were feeling rather lethargic as a unit. It was Friday, we were hungover, and we had just eaten enough breakfast foods to feed a small island nation. However, Jenna summed up the whole thing in the discussion on the ride back when she said, “I’m sorry, I love The Waffle Shop, but this was much better.” The food’s quality, the attentiveness of the service staff, and the feel of the place were all fantastic. There’s a bit of a greasy feeling associated with diner-style breakfast spots (which is part of the charm), but you get none of that here. It’s a different world, and in food there’s no comparison: Among a plethora of places serving breakfast in the area, Naked Egg’s cuisine reigns supreme.
Seriously, go now.Following the most widespread and destructive tornado outbreak of the season so far on Saturday, damaging storms will threaten more lives and property today along the Southeast Coast and in the Ohio Valley. Isolated tornadoes could strike a few places in the Southeast.
Deadly and destructive tornadoes tore through many cities and towns of the South on Saturday and Saturday night. There was a total of 54 tornado reports across seven different states. In Mississippi, which was hardest hit by tornadoes, many houses were leveled and 10 people were killed by long-tracking tornadoes.
Communities from the Delmarva Peninsula and eastern Virginia southward to the Florida Panhandle will be at risk for severe thunderstorms as a major storm's cold front sweeps toward the Southeast Coast. A second zone at risk will be over the upper Ohio Valley.
Cities that may be threatened by violent thunderstorms today, include: Norfolk, Va., Raleigh, N.C., Wilmington, N.C., Columbia and Charleston, S.C., Savannah, Ga., Jacksonville and Tallahassee, Fla., Pittsburgh, Pa., Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio.
Damaging wind gusts over 60 mph will likely be the biggest threat from the storms. The winds will likely down power lines and trees, littering some neighborhoods. Fallen branches and trees can damage vehicles and houses as well as threaten to injure people caught without shelter.
While there is not as high of a threat for tornadoes today as there was on Saturday, a few tornadoes may be spawned by the most powerful storms. Remember, it only takes one tornado tearing through a neighborhood to cause demolition and loss of life.
Pounding hail the size of quarters and golf balls remains a threat today and can cause damage to vehicles and windows.
Some areas will get hit by more than one round of strong storms during the day and the evening.
People are urged to stay alert to the stormy situation. Peaks of sunshine between rounds of storms could be deceptive and may actually enhance the threat of storms later in the afternoon.
Flash flooding is another concern with the thunderstorms, especially for low-lying and poor drainage areas.
Flight delays are likely at some of the major airports, including in Washington, D.C., as drenching showers and potentially damaging storms roll through today.
Blinding downpours can slow travel along portions of the I-95 corridor.
Frequent lightning will accompany each thunderstorm that rattles the Southeast, regardless of the thunderstorm's severity. Seek shelter immediately if you hear thunder, since you are then close enough to get struck by potentially deadly lightning.

Mm..(Junk) Food: Interview With Junk Food Guy
I don’t know what the fuck kind of.
Speculation ran wild for the two week period before Andersen’s hiring was announced. Many different names were thrown around but never was Andersen mentioned as much as others such as Chris Pedersen and Mel Tucker. Andersen was a very under the radar hiring, but certainly a good one.
Most Wisconsin fans will remember Andersen for the game against Utah State at Camp Randall on September 15th, 2012. The Badgers snuck out with a 16-14 victory after Aggie placekicker Josh Thompson missed a potential game winning field goal in the game’s closing minutes. Afterwards, Andersen stated that Badger junior Chris Borland was the best linebacker he’d ever seen on a football field. One can’t help but smile looking back at as comment such as that.
Andersen is most revered for his defensive prowess, as were Alvarez and Bielema. Prior to his arrival at Utah State, the Aggies ranked outside the top 100 in overall defense. In 2012, the team ranked 15th in overall defense and 8th in scoring defense, allowing just over 322 yards and 15 points per game. Besides his reputation for defensive excellence, Andersen is revered as one of the better recruiters in all of college football, having been named one of the nation’s top non-BCS recruiters while at Utah. He has made a name for himself in turning average recruits into great college football players and getting the most out of what he is given. One can only imagine what he can do with improved facilities, funding, coaching staff, and administrative support.
When asked about the hiring on Thursday, Wisconsin Athletic Director and Interim Head Coach Barry Alvarez talked about Andersen as a perfect fit for the Badger program and mentioned a conversation he had with Urban Meyer during the hiring process:
“(Meyer has) had some very good assistants,” he said. “Urban told me that Gary is in the top five of all of them; he’s the real deal. I said, ‘Would he fit here? Would he fit in the Big Ten?’ He said, ‘Absolutely.’”
If you don’t want to take it from me, and you don’t want to take if from Alvarez, take if from Urban Meyer - easily one of the top coaches in the country. In regards to Meyer, we must remember that Andersen coached under him and will have a great advantage when playing against Meyer’s spread offense when the Badgers take on the Buckeye’s each year.
Finally, if you’re still not sold on Andersen as a coach or a recruiter, hop on twitter and see what some of his former players and beat writers that covered him at USU are saying about his departure. After accepting Alvarez’s offer, Andersen made personal phone calls to each member of the Utah State team to tell them the news. The man is highly regarded and we are lucky to have him donning the red and white.
Overall, I am pleased with the hiring and happy that this whole ordeal is finally coming to an end. We knew it was best to trust Alvarez in the hiring process and he went out and got us a great ball coach. I think it’s best if we reserve our judgments at this point and see how Andersen fills out his staff and manages recruiting in a new area. For now, let’s just enjoy this Rose Bowl and savor every moment of having Alvarez back on the sidelines for the next couple of weeks!)While looking for topics to choose through in our large selection, one caught my eye immediately. When I saw the role of fathers, I knew that this would be an interesting topic to do further research on. When I have a problem with school or friends, I go to my mom. But, if I need help fixing something or wanted someone to play with when I was little, I turned to my dad. Why is that?
In our Psychology book for this class, it explains in four ways how mothers and fathers differ:
1. Fathers tend to be less attentive and affective when the the baby is still very little.
2. Fathers tend to spend less time with the baby, even if the parents are home an equal amount.
3. When fathers interact with their children, they are the more playful then mothers usually are.
4. Lastly, both young boys and girls go to their father first, oppose to their mother, as a playmate.
So maybe that is why many kids would go to their mom for emotional things and their dad for physical work. But you need your father just as much as you need your mother! So, I looked up some facts about Fathers that were pretty remarkable:
- Odds that the average man will become a father: 1 in 2
- Number yearly who take permanent leave to become stay-at-home dads: 143,000
- Number of current fathers who would still want to have kids if they could do it over again: 19 in 20
These are only a few, where the rest can be found here.
To leave you with a small clip, fathers play a key role in the lives of his children, while some go above and beyond, the smallest gesture means a lot!
This post made me think about my relationship with my parents. I tell my mom much more personal things such as problems with friends, boyfriends, and things like that where I talk to my dad about work and school and politics. There are somethings that I would NEVER tell my dad! I liked that you also did a little research and found out some more facts about fathers.the 12 best female pop duets ever
With Rita Ora, Charli XCX, Cardi B and Bebe Rexha teaming up for the anthemic Girls, we look back at some of the greatest girl power collabs of all time.
Regularly, music fans get themselves into a tizzy debating on Twitter about which of today’s crop of female pop stars should join forces in a display of girl power to record a 2018 version of Lady Marmalade. This happens because, as everyone knows, women make the best pop music (sorry, it is fact).
There have been some attempts to recreate the mystical female force that Xtina, Pink, Mya and Lil’ Kim exhibited, too. Earlier this year, Dua Lipa enlisted the help of Charli XCX, Zara Larsson and Alma and MØ for a live version of her hit IDGAF; Charli also brought together Alma and Tove Lo for Out Of My Head from Pop 2. Then there are the other female collabs that have sizzled: Beyoncé x Nicki, Ariana, Jessie and Nicki, and now Rita Ora, Charli XCX, Cardi B and Bebe Rexha with their new female-lovin’ anthem Girls.
To celebrate so much greatness, we’ve decided to look back at the greatest ever female collabs.
1. Britney Spears and Madonna, Me Against the Music
After The Kiss at the VMAs, it was inevitable that Britney and Madonna would record a song together. The result is the kind of slick and sweaty R&B pop that you want from two of pop’s power players. And there’s literally nothing better than when Madonna coos: “Hey Britney, come over here I’ve got something to show ya.”
2. Lady Gaga and Beyoncé, Telephone
Beyoncé telling Lady Gaga that she’s been a bad girl before they go off and kill a whole diner full of people is one of the greatest music video moments of all time. Telephone is also the sort of pop banger that you want two bloody megastars like Bey and Gaga releasing. It’s absurd and bombastic and just totally insane.
3. Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, When You Believe
In this house we stan vocalists. Specifically The Voice herself Whitney Houston and vocal acrobat Mariah Carey. The fact that this song came about after years of rumoured feuds and shade throwing, is perhaps a testament to the song’s message: who knows what miracles you can achieve when you believe?
4. Destiny’s Child and Celine Dion, Emotions
This entry is technically cheating as it was never recorded and released by both artists together, but there is a lot to be said for this totally insane duet between Celine Dion (!) and Destiny’s Child (!!). Not only does Beyoncé really go for it, but Celine exhibits some power behind her falsetto, even if she does look a bit like she’s stumbled into the wrong room for karaoke.
5. Eve and Gwen Stefani, Let Me Blow Your Mind
Dr Dre’s minimal and breezy production barely contains the attitude that both Eve and Gwen Stefani exude on Let Me Blow Your Mind; it’s the sort of song you wouldn’t want to meet down a dark alley. Eve spits bars of fire, while Gwen’s aloofness is the epitome of cool. This is “you can’t sit with us” in musical form.
6. Brandy and Monica, The Boy is Mine
Ahh, Brandy and Monica. While normally we’d put the brakes on a song where two women battle over the affections of a man (gross), The Boy is Mine was actually inspired by Brandy watching an episode of The Jerry Springer Show, which is 100% amazing. Also, Monica and Brandy collaborated to quash rumours that the pair were feuding, too. And then there is that Darkchild harp and the piston-like percussion. Total perfection.
7. Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj, Bang Bang
Sure, at times Bang Bang verges on being a racket, but this Number 1 smash featuring Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj is maybe the closest we’ve come to a replica of Lady Marmalade in its sheer pop recklessness. It’s a throw in the kitchen sink kind of song but sometimes that’s what the world needs.
8. Beyoncé and Shakira, Beautiful Liar
We’ve included the Freemason’s remix of Beyoncé and Shakira’s Beautiful Liar because it is clearly the superior version of this stomping wronged-woman anthem. Shakira’s unique warble compliments Beyoncé’s flawless vocal delivery, the pair shaking their hips like no-one’s business.
9. Lady Gaga and Christina Aguilera, Do What U Want
Imagine if, instead of performing this on an episode of The Voice, Xtina and Gaga had debuted this duet as a lip sync for your life on Rupaul’s Drag Race. Now THAT would have been a moment.
10. Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé, Feeling Myself
Why is it taking so long for Beyoncé to release a rap album? Seriously, B! Nevertheless, Feeling Myself is one badass tune that’s so fire it could stop the world. The hypnotic production and Beyoncé’s soothing voice offset Nicki’s unpredictable virtuoso and delectable boasting.
11. Christina Aguilera, Pink, Mya and Lil’ Kim (+ cameo from Missy Elliott), Lady Marmalade
God is clearly a woman because how else would this, the greatest achievement of womankind, have come into existence? Mya’s innocence, Pink’s grit and Lil’ Kim’s blunt-as-they-come contribution are more than just warm ups for Christina’s colossal final verse. But goodness, when Christina comes in it’s like an angel descending from heaven. The vocal runs. The sheer confidence. The crimped hair! The greatest of all time.
12. Rita Ora, Charli XCX, Cardi B and Bebe Rexha, Girls
Because it’s new and shiny, we’re also going to include this new girl-lovin’ jam featuring a Who’s Who of today’s female pop upstarters. Rita (back from musical purgatory) is confident, Charli is boastful, Bebe is vulnerable and Cardi is, well, Cardi.

5.0 Mustang & Super Fords
2011 Ford Mustang GT - Last Ride
2011 Tribute Mustang
Sal Valdez was only a teenager when he first met Joe Gosinski, and he readily admits that his first impression of the late owner of Chicane Sport Tuning wasn't a positive one. "I didn't think much of him," Sal tells us. "As I got to know him more, I actually thought he was a jerk. If you went into his shop with cheap parts, he wouldn't install them. His motto was ‘buy the best and buy it once.' But when you're 18, 19, 20 years old and don't have much money, what are you going to do?"
Despite their initial differences, Sal and Joe became good friends thanks to their common passion for Mustangs. Sal also came to realize that Joe's stubbornness was because he cared deeply about his customers. "He'd rather not sell you anything and have you come back later to get something you really need," Sal recalls. "He didn't want to just take your money--he wanted you to have the same passion he did. He wanted you to feel how he did. He felt that way not just about his own cars, but about all of his customer's cars." Even with his newfound respect for Joe, Sal's meager income meant that he still couldn't afford the shop owner's services for quite a while. "I used to hang out at Joe's shop--not even having a Mustang at the time--just to harass him," he remembers. "I always told him I would come back with a Mustang and have him build it." Sal did finally end up buying his first Mustang right out of high school--a '99 V-6--but still couldn't afford to turn the car over to Joe's care. "It was a lot of fun, but I didn't do a whole lot of work to it."
After several years, Sal finally saved up enough money to buy a new Mustang. His plan was to simply turn the car over to Joe and tell him to run with it until the money ran out. "I had that much trust in him," he tells us. "Unfortunately we didn't make it that far." Sadly Joe never got the opportunity to build Sal his Mustang. On Christmas Eve in 2010, Joe was murdered at his shop, shocking the Mustang community. For quite a while Sal forgot about the idea of building a Mustang. After all, if Joe wasn't going to build it, then who would? Then he heard that one of Joe's former employees, Matt Bernal, was thinking about doing a Mustang project. Ford had originally approached Joe to create a Mustang for SEMA and had asked Matt if he wanted to continue with the project. He was up for it, but unfortunately didn't have the financial means to take on the costs that were associated with the build. That's where Sal comes in, thanks to his wife. "I wasn't going to buy the car anymore, but my wife said, ‘Why don't you let him build it as a tribute to Joe?' I was still kind of skeptical because I didn't know if I trusted anyone else to build the car."
Eventually Sal decided to partner up with Matt, and the Last Ride project was born. Initially the going was slow, as neither really knew where to start. After posting some design sketches in a few Mustang forums, though, various companies started to offer parts and services. "Most of the sponsors knew who Joe was, had worked with Joe, or had a relationship with him one way or another," Sal told us. "They read about what happened and wanted to contribute." One of the first companies to offer support was Vortech Superchargers, who provided its V-3 Si-Trim supercharger system, complete with an Airaid cold-air intake. Shortly after that, Doug Thorley headers contacted Sal, eventually contributing a set of its Tri-Y headers and an after-cat exhaust system. Interestingly, both companies also used Sal's car to develop produces for the Mustang's new 5.0-liter engine. Adding to the Mustang's power potential is an intercooler spray system from Nitrous Express.
In the handling department Sal kept it simple yet effective. A set of Saleen Racecraft N2+ adjustable coilovers as well as Hellwing Motorsports sway bars front and rear do the trick, providing an aggressive stance and optimal handling for both the street and the track. Baer 14-inch brakes with six-pot calipers and drilled and slotted rotors provide a necessary boost in stopping power, and sticky Falken FK452 tires are mounted at all four corners. While Sal knew that having plenty of horsepower and great handling was a good thing, he knew the looks of the car were even more important if it was really going to be a tribute to Joe. Yellow had always been one of Joe's favorite colors, so it was a must that it would be included in the look of the Mustang. "He liked sticking yellow on everything," Sal says. "He stuck it on black, he stuck it on blue--he stuck it on everything. Whatever color of car he had, he would put yellow on it." The bright color was incorporated throughout the entire car, from the BASF painted-on graphics (no decals here), to the six-piston calipers, to the Corbeau racing harnesses and rollbar.
Sal also knew Joe would have wanted the car to have an aggressive look. Fortunately Trufiber, based in Corona, California, heard about the car and wanted to get involved. Its carbon-fiber ram-air hood, front fascia, side skirts, trunk lid, and rear diffuser can be seen on the car. Vossen also provided a set of its CV3 20-inch wheels, which Sal painted black to match the rest of the car. RK Sport provided a carbon-fiber roof skin; a Boss 302 Laguna Seca rear wing from CJ Pony Parts completes the look of the rear. As a final touch, Silverhorse Racing offered to make a custom billet fuel door with the car, CNC machined with the phrase Last Ride. Inside the Mustang, the race theme continues with a seat of Corbeau LG1 seats in gray and black suede paired with the aforementioned matching yellow harnesses and rollbar. Sal also installed a set of pillar-mounted Auto Meter carbon-fiber gauges to keep tabs on the supercharged V-8, and added a custom digital shift knob with the Chicane Sport Tuning logo as a final touch.
After months of hard work and with the help of countless members of the Mustang community, Sal was finally ready to unveil his tribute to the automotive community. The car made its debut at the 2011 SEMA show in the Doug Thorley booth. "So many great companies pitched in to offer help and their services once they became aware of the purpose of this build," Sal tells us. "Without all of them, this car would not have undergone the transformation it did in the time frame that it did." With the car finally complete, we asked Sal what Joe would think of the Mustang built as a tribute to him. After a long thoughtful pause and a grin, he answered: "There'd probably be things that he wouldn't like about the car. He'd criticize it no matter what, just because he's a perfectionist. "He'd like the color on it and he'd dig the rims. I think he'd enjoy it."
Horse Sense: When Joe Gosinsky was tragically killed in 2010, his good friend and customer Sal Valdez decided to build a tribute car with the help of the Mustang community. The result is the Last Ride Mustang that debuted at the 2011 SEMA show.

- innovative small and medium businesses can start and prosper locally
- doctors and other professionals are more likely to remain (or arrive!)
- so do students, if they can follow courses remotely
- income from local taxes increases
Now, hat’s the best technology in those cases, wireless or fiber? Maybe, looking at these stories from the Open Days, there is no single answer.
Wireless Networks success stories from Vodafone: Hofbieber and Civita Castellana
Hofbieber is a German community of 6400 people living on a 90 sq KM area, recently covered by an LTE rollout. Before that, 384KB ADSL was the fastest option available for about half the residents, and there was strong demand from local businesses for faster connections.
In order to provide real broadband to all the areas of Hofbieber the major went for mobile networks because “we couldn’t wait 5 years”. After the rollout, Internet usage in businesses increased, and today Hofbieber residents see their town both more attractive for new companies and better served in several fields.
The district around Civita Castellana is one of the areas covered with HSPA+ or LTE radio networks by the Vodafone 1000comuni project. Until 2010 the whole district, that includes 8 municipalities hosting 70 companies that produce 50% of the quality ceramic tiles and sanitary wares made in Italy, had no broadband. Therefore, Assessor Paolo Bianchini said, “local ceramic entrepreneurs were forced to spend and pollute a lot to present their products in Trade Fairs around the world, in order to stay competitive on international markets”.
In 2010, when those same entrepreneurs officially asked for broadband, local politicians of all parties invited Vodafone to deploy its high-speed mobile network in the area. Now, Bianchini said, “broadband will help those companies to keep the Arab market and enter the Russian, Indian and American ones. Besides, broadband is also helping local unemployed people to find job opportunities more quickly and to get training online”.
Why Wireless is good
Stories like these are why, according to Vodafone, HSPA and LTE radio networks are THE answer to rural broadband demands. Only such networks provide a cost effective, simple to deploy, future proof infrastructure that also enables wireless Internet Radio, Telefony and IPTV. “Mobile network can be expanded if and when demand increases, whereas in fiber networks 80% of the cost is digging, that is an all or nothing work: what if nobody uses them after 10 years?” asked a Vodafone executive.
A Fiber To The Home success story from Denmark
ERISA presented the Midtsoenderjylland FTTH deplloyment, that started as a bottom up activity in 2002, when there was no support for broadband rural areas from the national government or incumbent operators. That year, an analysis from local authorities, politicians, university visionaries concluded that:
- optic fibre was the only solution capable of delivering triple play services to everyone, everywhere in region
- a master plan was needed to build at the lowest possible cost a complete fibre ring network, owned and operated by the municipality both for its own use and for leasing capacity to private service operators.
Besides coordinating digging projects and building the network step by step, the project acted as catalyst for local access networks owned and operated by local electricity coperatives. Such companies, having a 20yr timeframe for ROI, are different from telcos, and using the network they could make their grid smarter and more efficient.
The results seem very positive: fiber was and is seen as the only solution capable of delivering triple play services to everyone everywhere in region, and “a single fibre infrastructure is enough if open and neutral”. The only (general) problem mentioned for such deployments is quality of the materials used for canalisation: “it is necessary to set standards to avoid big trouble in 20 years if people buy cheap equipment”.
So, what’s the real answer? It probably depends on many factors, including geography and residents density (not to mention that there are almost 10 years between the two projects!). From my point of view, what matters is what somebody in the audience noted: if, when it comes to town, broadband is empty, that is there are no useful e-government, e-health, entertainment and business services in it… what’s the point?

Garza was an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery and emergency medicine at the Stanford School of Medicine. In addition to his duties with the 49ers, Garza taught undergraduate classes in human physiology, sports medicine and exercise anatomy at Stanford. He also tended to Stanford’s intercollegiate athletic programs.
Garza’s primary research focused on the prevention of traumatic brain injury in athletes. He was conducting extensive studies on the risk of concussions by fitting athletes with mouthpieces to measure the impact of collisions.
The 49ers confirmed Garza’s passing and released a statement Tuesday night.
“The 49ers organization has been informed of a tragedy. We were saddened to learn Dr. Dan Garza died unexpectedly Tuesday. Our sincerest thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this trying time,” via Matt Maiocco of CSNBayArea.com.Rothschild Bride's Turner Landscape May Sell for $26.7 Million
A painting of Rome by the 19th- century British artist J.M.W. Turner bought by a member of the Rothschild family is expected to fetch as much as 18 million pounds ($26.7 million) at a Sotheby's auction in July.
Turner's 1839 canvas, "Modern Rome -- Campo Vaccino," will be on sale for the first time since 1878, when it was purchased on honeymoon by Hannah Rothschild and her husband, the 5th Earl of Rosebery, the future U.K. Prime Minister, the New York-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
"The family thought it was a good moment to sell," Sotheby's U.K. Deputy Chairman David Moore-Gwyn said in an interview. "Recently there has been a series of strong prices for magnificent works that are fresh to the market, and we don't know what's going to happen in a year's time."
Record prices of 29.2 million pounds for a Raphael drawing at Christie's International in December and 65 million pounds for Giacometti's 1961 bronze "Walking Man I" at Sotheby's last month have encouraged sellers to enter high-value works into auctions.
The twilit view of some of the Italian capital's most famous monuments will be included in Sotheby's July 7 auction of Old Master and Early British Paintings.
Rosebery paid 4,450 guineas -- an old British currency -- for the 4-foot-wide (1.2-meter) work, and it hung in the family's country mansion, Mentmore Towers, Buckinghamshire, and their London residences for a century, said Sotheby's.
Rosebery Heir
The Turner is being sold by an unidentified descendant of the 5th Earl, said Moore-Gwyn. Harry Dalmeny, heir to the present 7th Earl of Rosebery, is deputy chairman of Sotheby's U.K.
Joseph Mallord William Turner is regarded as the U.K.'s most important pre-20th century artist, said dealers, and.
"He's one of the few artists who transcends the field of British paintings," said Moore-Gwyn. "There's a real chance that the painting will appeal to people who have never bought in this area."
A canvas that is thought to be Turner's last view of Rome was a desirable subject, and the painting was in unusually well-preserved condition for a work by the artist, said Moore- Gwyn. It has never been restored and has a low estimate of 12 million pounds.
"These trophy assets really do well," said Philip Hoffman, chief executive of the London-based Fine Art Fund. "There are still huge amounts of cash sitting in bank accounts waiting for something to do and there aren't many opportunities to buy magnificent paintings from old provenances."

The Owls, who made an abrupt move from the Mid-American Conference to the Big East during the offseason, have been in talks with officials at Hawaii to get a game in December.
And Hawaii is open to discussions.
"It's very far from a done deal. We're going through the due diligence," acting athletic director Rockne Freitas told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.
Because of how quickly Temple had to cobble together its current schedule, the Owls only have 11 games and with a 3-3 record, would like as many opportunities as possible to make the best bowl game possible.
Hawaii currently has 12 games on its schedule, but an NCAA provision allows the Warriors and their opponents to play 13 regular-season games, one above the normal limit.
But when would these two teams meet?
Temple's final game is Nov. 23 against Syracuse while Hawaii's final game is a nonconference matchup against South Alabama on Dec. 2. That would mean the game would have to take place on Dec. 8, a date that has been reserved for the Army-Navy game. The game moved to that date so that it would be the only football game on that day.
The Mountain West gave Hawaii the green light to pursue a game against Temple, but the university is still waiting for clearance from the NCAA. If this game does happen, it would be one of the few times a matchup was scheduled in the middle

Pastor James and Alexis Wright have served faithfully in ministry for a combined total of over 65 years.
After serving faithfully in various capacities including; Music Ministry, Men’s Ministry, Church Administration, Evangelism and Youth Pastor, they began to feel the call of God was confirmed upon their lives and the birthing of GDIM was in their spirit several years before it manifested.
While still serving faithfully in their local church they began to prepare themselves for the next assignment and made the decision to continue their education at New Spirit Theological Bible College where they earned degrees in Christian Education, Christian Counseling and Theology.
After much prayer and understanding that they would be embarking upon the greatest endeavor of their lives, they took the leap of faith in October 2014 to obey the call of God on their lives.
God had already given the name Greater Destiny to Pastor Alexis Wright several years prior, but at the time she did not know that it was to be used as the name of the church. Pastor James Wright added “International Ministries” and on October 21, 2014 Greater Destiny International Ministries was registered and legally incorporated by the state of Florida as a not-for-profit corporation.
Over the next three months, they held prayer services in their home seeking God for further direction and also receiving counsel from men and women of God who were divinely positioned to speak into their lives during this season.
In January of 2015 after praying and driving around the city looking for a location to host the services, they were directed by God to contact Pastor Shirley Cherry and she agreed to meet with them immediately. During this meeting, they shared their desire to use the sanctuary of Lighthouse Christian Fellowship to host a weekly Bible Study Service. Not only did she agree, but there was such a divine visitation and approval from the Holy Spirit to move forward.
After that meeting, they began working diligently on their plans to host the Ministry Launch Service on January 29, 2015. They invited Pastors, leaders and those that God had strategically positioned in their lives to make declarations and decrees of the blessings and favor of God upon the birthing of this ministry.
The first service was held on Thursday, February 5, 2015 and they have continued to serve faithfully with covenant disciples and supporters that come week after week to lift up the name of Jesus. Greater Destiny International Ministries has hosted Community Outreach events, launched Destiny’s Kidz (Youth Ministry) and Destiny’s Woman Empowerment and Life Enrichment Ministry.
September 2020, the Lord has again expanded our borders and we have relocated to the beautiful campus of the HC Multi-Cultural Center at 6651 Crestline Drive. We continue to move forward by faith, trusting God to manifest all that He has promised and that the mission and vision of the church will be fulfilled.I will be inactive for 1 to 3 weeks, getting back in the end of January.

She's known to use "btw" a lot and to not spell very well. Only wielding her adorable personality, courage and a little too much faith in humanity she has managed to survive through the depts of time called the "newbie time". She has slayed great evil with them legendary master blade of...something (I will think of that, later). She has travelled through many dimentions as her destiny still reach futher...

Kiersten aka. KNKHungergames - Awww, Kiersten. You are so perfect, and yet you keep calling me perfect (seriously I don't get your logic here). You have me as your rolemodel on this wiki which is a very great honor for me. I don't get why you would want me as your rolemodel, but thank you ;-; She also made the first game that I ever won with my tribute, May Morningleafs. She is also SUPER friendly on chat probably one of the kindest girl on there (probably one of the kindest people I ever met). You can always seek help from her, and I have a lot of respect for her. You are so helpfull and I do my best to help you too :3

You are also really funny with your "the hunk of THG wiki" thing, and the faces you make on TC, you always make me laugh, thank you so much for that. You are also really smart and encourage my English, thank you!
Oli aka. Evilharibomadness - Now, this guy. He's so sweet sometimes, and a good listener. He can also be really funny sometimes too, and knows how to lighten the room, just the right way. Sometimes, I wonder if he knows how nice he is, I really hope he does, cause he deserves it! He is also my "speaking perfected English" buddy, with whom I can pratice my vocabulary! We seriously need to pm more!
Dani/Anni aka. Rawrimmaeatya - This girl, she is like...awesomeness... the pure image of awesomeness. Look in a dictionary under "awesomeness" and a picture of her appear. Anyway, we also have the best ship ever, where we spam in pm, and discuss randomness. ANNI FOREVER! In Anni, she's obvious the smart one, while I am the not-so-clever one, who seems to forget the most elementary stuff. But you are kind to me even when I am being stupid! XD Also a fellow mod who's really good at being it.
Daniel/Luke/Panda Eater aka. Justafox - I have known Luke for a little while, and I really like our friendship. He is clever and nice to talk with. When I was a new mod, he was really helpfull, always helping me with the different mod-stuff which I am really thankfull for. We often skype and I really love it, I wish he would be more on here. His poems are great too, I wish he would acknowledge that (he is always like: "NO!" when I tell him that they are beautiful.)
Hunter aka. HKTlovesGlimmer - A great user who's always friendly on chat and always seems ready to help. He is very outgoing and deserve to be respected! I wish he would be more on!
Lily aka. Lily! - Oh, Lily. Probably one of the most passionated people I know, she always cares for everything. She also really help me out once on Ask.fm (not gonna tell ya what taht was >:D) which just made me so thankfull that she would go out of her way to help me. She's upbeat and excited which is quite fun to see, but helpfull and a good friend :3. I still remember the first thing she really said to me was: "MOD MY BUTT!" at THGRP and now you are mod on here! Oh and she's nice to discuss "Django" with. "Lily, tell Miss Laura goodbye."
Mia aka. 66mc - Why you weren't put on my friendlist sooner, I will never know. You are always kind to me and everyone pretty much, as you are one of the kindest users on chat! You are always ready to listen to me when I ask for comforting or advice, and you never judge me for anything I say. I am so thankfull for that, I think I would have gotten insane without you! XD She's a great fellow mod too. I am so thankfull to have you as a friend of mine and I have a lot of respect for her and her enormous amout of tolerance.
Savanna/Vanna aka. Frostsnake - The first time I met this girl was in a game, and she really impressed me. We didn't talk for a bit and then she out of nowhere just complimented me and after that... Well let us just say that we have been bestos! I admire your mature mind and your friendlyness (except from when you are EVIL then you are EVIL XD) You are also super funny too, and I love your microwaving skills XD. I am so sad we couldn't do our secret plan! Awww... And she's fun to talk with over skype, although I have a hard time understanding all of the smileys she makes (seriously, what does a pizza-smiley mean in Savanna-language?).
Annabella/Fox/Bella/Axed aka. Axedfox - AXED! Oh my god why aren't you on here already? Fox has been one of my earlier friends. She's always so awesome to me. She has also seen the impossible. She has experinced "An angry Anna". Weird, I know. But she actually listened and help me. Anyway, she is also very helpfull when it comes to making tribute and her games and writing are just awesome! She also makes really good her games herself!
Gruff aka. LeGruff - Gruff and me met each other quite resently, and yet, I already feel so close to this guy. He is so nice to me and manage to make me laugh in hard times. He deserves so much but never seem to realize it. I will always try to help him as much as I can. Gruff is just a really kind person. He wants to help everyone, so I wish he would stop and just use a bit time on himself too, cause he really deserves it! He's also my zombie, he has eaten my arms a couple of times and every now and then goes: "BRAINS!" but I don't mind, I luff my zombie!
Jade/The Admin aka. Rainbow Shifter - When me and Jade first really met, it was around the time when I first got mod. I remember her saying she was going for admin, and I honestly never doubted she would become one other as we both adore the awesome country of Japan (we both been there!). She has also been sorta a "drawing mentor" for me, tirelessly looking at my different drawings, giving me useful advice (THANK YOU!). I was so happy she got admin, she really deserved it! She is extremely helpful to me with my questions and knows so much about this wiki! A good admin and a good friend, what more can you wish for? XD
Caylin aka. ~Poundthealarm~ - I guess I haven't talked to Caylin for the longest, she's a newer friend, but I have known for a awhile. When she first joined, I was very impressed with how quickly she made friends (back then I was still in the newbie zone!) so I always admired her for that. It's now, that I actually talk a lot with her but she's pretty funny and nice to Tinychat with. She made me really happy when she told me she missed me on chat too :3
Thanks c; Sticks and stones may break her bones,but words will make her starve herself to death. 23:48, April 13, 2013 (UTC)
Kekai/Cheesecake aka. Hybrid Shadow - Kekai, :3. He's love by everyone and those "everyone" include me! I still remember how he as a new user, would discuss cheesecakes, and how I would buy him 1000 cakewives that he would brutally eat! I remember how I sorta knew you become a great user, and you did (although I never predicted how long his backstories would become...) Now you're all grown! We have this friendly fight of lengths of backstories, which I always seem to lose but I still like it. We have fun rp'ing and talking about random stuff (vocaloid, Hawaiian/danish weather, etc.), and makes me smile with his contant ":3". Although may not talk as much because of timezones, I still consider him to be a great friend of mine.
Rosalind aka. TheMysteriousGeek - Rosalind is one of my more recent friends. We met at chat when the "Hurt/Heal games" and quickly became friends because we share the same opinions on most careers. We grew even closer discovering we have a special intrest for final fantasy together and we listen to a lot of gamemusic together when she's online. She's very kind and a good friend. I also really admire her, how long she has been on this wiki and is still active. That's really cool, and I really hope she will stay active!
Colin Aka. Beetee19 - Colin is one of my best friends on wiki and has been for a while. It all started with Cloveismywife's Vengeance Games. He had entered Azalea and Axl, and I sorta killed Axl with a plan of mine, and used Azalea as bait... whoops... But it was first after a while I actually got to know him. He came on chat and I remember thinking that he was a really nice guy. Now, we pm regularly, usually about bacon, or fangames or how awesome this wiki is! I was the first person ever to guess his name! It's always loads of fun to talk with him, and we're sorta plotting to rob the secret bank of China... Don't tell, or we sent Trick for you...
You rock too, Anna! But...what part of 'secret' don't you understand? ;P --And though the course may change sometimes, rivers always reach the sea... 05:06, May 4, 2013 (UTC)
Erlend/Viking aka. PumPumPumpkin - "Erlend... you do not scare me... but you do manage to creep me out." That's the thing I tell Erlend the most and I stand by that. Erlend is a slightly creepy and weird friend but he's also one of my closets friends I got. I love it when we Tinychat together, he's one of the few people who will talk longer convos. His evil "huehuehuehuehue" laugther makes me smile (although it sometimes creep me out too). He's also Scandinvian, like me! He's probably one of the people I talk with the most and I am very thankful I got to meet him. Whether he's being creepy, dirty, or nice, Erlend is awesome.
THERE ARE SO MANY I NEED TO ADD! AND I WILL! JUST NO, one day. After a while we began to know eacT NOW; I AM TIRED! PUT YOUR SIG BELOW IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I REMEMBER OR WANT TO RUSH ME!

My Tributes
If you copy my tributes I will go CATO on you! >:D
Detria Glace
Pronounciation: "Di-trih-a Glaeis"
District: 5
Gender: Female
Age: 14
Appearence: Detria is very frail looking. Her body is thin, as she has not been eating enough ever since her mother divorced her father so she is very thin and frail looking with almost no mucsels. She is one of those girls that seem so weak that you could break them in half, like a twig. Her hair falls down her back, long and black, all the way down to her weistline. She likes to hide her face behind it and almost never put it up in a ponytale, she would rather just have it lose so that her face is hidden by it. Her eyes are a deep misty light grey color. Her skincolor is very pale, almost making her look a bit sick, and that makes her look even more frail.
Height: She stands 5'4. It's a tiny bit taller than most 14-year-olds. Her height, her small muscels and the fact that she is already very skinny makes her look extremely frail, like she could break any second. That is both good and bad. Because of her light weight, she barely make any sound while walking and she doesn't cause my attention to herself, however her skinny body and small amount of muscels makes it so that she's quite weak.
Personality: Detria has a minor form for autism. She is very shy and stays away from most people unless she likes the person a lot or if they have done something remarkable. She almost never speaks but she is hyper intelligent cause of her autism, but she, again, never speaks so no one ever notice, and people seem to think she's an idiot. People seems to treat her like she is crazy but really she is not that much diffrent. She really just want people to stop stare and treat her normal. She dosen't wanna cause trouble and almost never fight with anyone. If anyone called her names she would just walk away and pretend like she didn't hear it instead of standing up for herself and fight back. She likes to be alone and often comes of as very mysterious to strangers. She hates to look other people in the eyes, and tries to look away when people look her directly in the eyes. She is very insecure and always seem to doubt herself, and is very scared to cause attention.
Backstory: She was 4 years when her family found out that she was autistic. Her father started to ignore her and when he finally would talk to her he would scold her. Detria got very depressed by it and very sad. She told her secret to her best friend. Two days later her secret was known by the whole school and her friends started to ignore her and gossip about her and spread rumors about her. Her mother got so angerd at her father that she decided to divorce. After that Detria and her mother moved to the poor part of distriWeapon: Because of Detria's shy nature and frail apparance most people counter her as no threat what so ever, however, that is where they would be wrong. They were short on money but Detria took two tesserae and her mother worked hard, however Detria was faced with hunger in bad periods of time. She often felt guilty, that it was her fault that her mother had left her father, and she did get really depressed. Only one of Detria friends stayed with her through all of that. His name was Koto. He never really said much but when they parted in the justicebuilding they kissed. Detria will do everything to get back to her only friend.
Weapon: Because of Detria's frail apparance and shy nature, most people tend to not her find her a threat, and don't even think she can handle any weapon. That is where they would be wrong. Detria can use two weapons. Her first weapon is throwing knives. With them, it doesn't matter if she's strong or not. All that matters is her speed and aim. She has trained with them through her life, in fear she would be reaped. Most of Detria's talents comes from her autism, but not throwing knives, that is why it means so much to her. Her second weapon is a blowgun. Like with the throwing knives, Detria does not have to train her strength to shoot with it, the only thing she needs is aim and speed, which she likes.
Strength: Detria has lived her whole life trying to avoid other people noticing her. If she were noticed then it would lead to bullying so she would always try her best to blend in and is almost never noticed unless she wants to be noticed. That has also made her very stealthy, and she could be a very good theif if she wanted. Her autism has made it so that she is hyper intelligent. Using her life in the shade, trying to avoid others gace, she has become quite good at observing, as she tend to observe others.
Weakness: Her autism is her biggest weakness as it make her very anti-social. She has a very hard time speaking to anyone, especially strangers, and would have a hard time making allies in the arena. She haven't been eating enough ever since her mother divorced her father, so she is quite weak and she could be beaten easily in hand-to-hand combat.
Fears: Detria HATES when many people are looking at her at the same time, like 8 people or more. The many glaring eyes just seems like needles punturing her, judging her, finding her mistakes. She never ever performs on stages duing to the fact that a lot of people are staring at her, eventhough her intelligence could make her place first in most quizzes and such. She is also quite scared of getting into any kind of conflict, as she is carefull not to cause any trouble. The sole thought of gettting attention from people who she doesn't know just scares as she is scared that people will judge her
Interview angle: Detria is very nervous, as her autism make it so that many people looking at her, scares her to death. So when she has to answer a question, she answer with one word/sentences, and never opens up, which makes the interview quite un-personal and forgettable. In fear that she will pass out, she will only look at ceasar and never look once at the audience, and their gazing eyes. The only that keeps her from running of the stage is the fact she wants to go home to Koto desperately and knows she will get no sponsors if she runs away. Although she is scared to death by their staring gaze she manage somehow not to look that way just very nervous
Bloodbath plan/ stratedgy for the games: Detria will in the bloodbath only run in to get one or two things, mostlikely food or water, and she will get out there before the first career reaches the cornucopia. She will run into a covered area and then she will hike and get as far away as possible, and then hide out when she need to sleep.
Alliance: Detria's austism make sociallising very hard and she will only ally if she is asked. She has difficult trusting other people and will probably only ally if the person has caught her attention by duing something, maybe helping her out or something like that. Her autism make her uncomfortable around too many people, so she will only want to alliance with 2 people (excluding herself) or less, and would never join a big alliance.
Token: Koto gave her his black workgloves, as they parted in teh justicebuiding. Detria knew it was his own way of saying: "Stay safe", and those black workgloves means more to Detria than anything else. She will wear them throughout the entire game, oonly putting them off if she has to.
Serina Frostswords
Pronounciation: Se-rih-na Frost-swords
District: 10
Gender: Female
Age: 15
Weapon: Serina is extremely skilled with a crossbow (Works like a bow but has much better aime and is much stronger so that you can from far away, it takes more time to reload than a regular bow). Ever since she bought it to work as a foxhunter, she has pratice with it and she almost never misses fleeing foxes, and other predetors. Serina is also pretty skilled with a knife. Sometimes, when her arrows only hit the stomach of the animal she would have to finish the beast off using a knife, and she would also skin the animals when she was done with killing them
Strength: Serina has always been very agile and quick It was a requirement when you were hunting foxes, as they tended to try and flee, and Serina would have to aim and shoot fast to get a right hit in. Serina is also very stealthy for more than one reason. She would be a thief and steal from the richer people in District 10. It was dangerous, and Serina knew that if she were caught she was dead meat, however she was never caught. Also when she hunted foxes, she would sometimes prefer to stalk her prey, rather than to kill quickly, which has also trained her stealth.
Weakness: Serina has starved ever since her mother was killed and eventhough her job trained her physically, she never really got a lot of muscels and such by it, so her strength is pretty bad, and she would not do very well in hand-to-hand combat, unless she would be able to use her agility to her advantage, but that is kinda hard for her if she were to be wrestling with someone. Also her rough past has taught her not to trust anyone so she has a hard time getting an alliance.
Fears: Serina doesn't have much fear in her body. Fear seemed stupid to her. If there's a threat, you should elliminate it, not run away from it. However there is one thing that can make her scared, and that is the thought of getting attached to anyone. It has pretty much been a fear in her life, ever since her mother died, but now, going into the games, she's even more scared about it. She could not imagine caring for someone in the arena, and she's really scared that that will happen. Althought she would never admit it that the thought of getting attached scared her.
Appearence: Serina has a small body however she doesn't look frail. . She has been using most of her life, outside hunting foxes so her skin has gotten quite tanned. Her body has small invisible scars, every now and then, cause her foxhunting didn't always go so great when she was still a newbie-hunter. The scars and the tan make her look pretty tough. She has never been fed enough since her mother died and is thereby pretty thin and has no muscels what so ever, however, again, her strong personality makes it unoticed. Her hair goes down to her shoulders, and it's always put up so that it doesn't get in the way, and it's red as fire and ember giving her a fierce look. Her eyes are dark-grey, almost black, making her look even more fierce. Her glares are very scary.
Height: She stand 160 cm/5'2 feet which is pretty short for a 15-year-old however Serina's strong personality makes it so that her lack of height is unoticed. Actually most people if they had to guess would think that Serina was two inches taller than what she really is. She unconsiously simply just intemidate people which make her seem taller than what she really is. She's skinny and un-muscular however she also unconsiously "intemidate" people, making them think of her as more muscular and with more natrual body weight.
Personality: She has always been fearless but her mothers death made her very coldhearted. She never cares for anyone, as no one cared for her. She will not think of her past in any way other than to look at mistakes and learn from them. She is not afraid to brake anyones limits if she need it for her survival and she is not afraid to step on anyone. She's a person who doesn't take crap for anyone, and although she won't start fights, if anyone starts a fight with her she will make sure they regret it. She has a good amount of confidence, and is very much a realist, knowing what she's capable of, and what she's not capable of. She's pretty sly. Also she's very determined and will always want to finish anything she starts, even if it will cost her life. She enjoy revenge, but isn't impacient about taking it, as long as she get's it.
Backstory: Serina started with a pretty okay life. She was an only child, and her parents were very kind to her. Her parents were wealthy and she had enough food. Serina used to be a sweet little angle, a smiling girl who wouldn't even hurt a fly and always volunteer for charity work and such. But that changed when she was 12. A woman was robbed from all of her posetions, and that woman sadly had a bad relationship to Serina's mother. The woman told false evidence and Serina's mother were arrested and then whipped to death in front of the entire district, and Serina and her father have to pay a huge bill, thus losing all their money. Serina turned coldhearted and serious. She never cried, she refused to show weakness. Serina and her father had it rough afterwards. They did not have enough money to bring food so after school she works as a foxhunter. She would hunt for fox's and other predetors in the outskirts of the district. By selling her moms necklace she bought herself a crossbow. Her father wouldn't talk her for weeks but she didn't care. Four months before reaped her dad died of sickness. The communety homes was already overfilled so it was decided that she could live in her house. She had it ruff and did barely eat but she maked it by stealing from the richer parts of the district. She was never cought. She never shed a tear for her dad. By the time she was reaped she was a master with the crossbow. All that time through, Serina never really have anyone she could turn to. Her parents were dead, and she really did not have any friends, cause she did not dare to trust anyone and most people was also afraid of her.
Interview: Serina will take a confident approach, not showing nerversity or fear, which come of as a bit intemidating. She will also be quite sly and mysterious, and would never reaveal any weaknesses/strength or such. She will also act quite determined, acting like she knows that she is able win the hunger games and survive.
Bloodbath plan/ stratedgy for the games: She runs fast so she graps the stuff 5-10 meters away and then get out of there. Sneak back to the cornacopia to see if her crossbow is there. Its much likely that no one would take it (Its very difficult to shot with I you don't know how) so she would probaly sneak in and take it. If the careers camp out there she would wait for a good chance to take it. After that she would hide out and shoot lone tributes
Token: Serina has no token, she never cared. She didn't get why she would want to be reminded of her home when ehr life was so bad. Another reason to the fact that she choose to not have a token was that she did not know anyone who could give her any. She was an orphan, and she did not really have any friends whatsoever. However during the days up to the games, she stole a simple platin ring from her escort, just because she could. She thought she mind as well wear it into the arena.
Alliance: Serina has trust issues and has a very hard time approaching anyone. If someone approach her and ask for alliance, she may join in, but probably won't get any real friendship with her teammates. It would only be for survival. She may ally with the careers if they see her skills and ask her, but she won't ask them, as she recorn that as a sign up weakness. In the arena, she would probably find it even harder to get an ally, and would probably only ally if her life depented on it.
Skye Silverguard
Age: 13
District: 3, 5, 6 or any really, as long as there is some kind of forest, and it's not careers.
Personality: A shy girl who rarely smile. She likes being alone and dosen't say that much. Because of that people usually underestimate her. People think that she's a daydreamer but she's actually very observant. She is very intelligent and always calculate everything. She has a tendensy to underestimate herself just like others use to underistimate oppersit of a "hot-head" and will rather just say nothing than fight back when yelled at. She has turned quite humble since the abusement began.
Backstory: She lived a perfect life...well until she turned 10. Her big sister, Diana (21-years-old), moved away to get her own house. It was weird for her parents, they always imagined Skye and Diana would keep on living in their house. It also hit Skye really hard as she was always close to her sister, Diana was more like a parent for her than a sister. And then, sometime after, Skye's mother got sick with cancer, and died shortly after. Skye's life was falling apart, as she only had her father, whom she had never been close with. Skye's father didn't cope much better with it. He began to drink and then abuse Skye physically, beating her almost every day. She lived with the pain for until she turned 13.. Skye's face was pressed against the three nails causing three extremely deep wounds on from her hairline to her chin. The next she walked to school but when the teachers asked she said that she had fallen on asfalt ground. Even after that, she still tried to protect her father and didn't blame him. The teachers didn't believe it of course and called the peacekeepers. The same night her father was hitting her the peacekeepers came busting in through the door and saw him hit Skye. They arrested them and Skye was moved to live with her sister. Her sister didn't have job but she hunted in the forrest to get food and money. From that point on her sister trained Skye and Skye helped her hunt and eventually learned how to make traps, shoot with bow and recornise berries. After the abusement Skye have gotten closed of and quiet but she really is a kind girl when you get to know her. She has just been through a lot.
Apperance: Skye is beautiful. Well, she was. She was one of the those girls that people would think would grow up to be a model. But it changed when she got that scar. Skye is a tiny bit taller than most 13-year-olds, standing 5'2. She doesn't have very many muscels and looks weak but not frail. She's pretty thin, but not skinny. Skye has long blonde, almost white hair that goes all the way to her weistline. Her eyes are darkgreen like a healthy forest. She would look beautiful. But her scar hinders that. An ugly scar created of three lines, streching from her hairline, all the way down to her jaw. They go through eyesbrows and over eyelits, making it look very brutal. People used to call Skye "beautiful". Now, they just look away from her, saddened.
Height: 5'2
Weapon: While being in the forest, her sister has taught her how to handle a couple of weapons. Skye first thought she was bad with weapons, as she didn't see herself as a fighter however after a while of training and trying around with different weapons she found two weapons that she was good with. The first one was the bow and arrow. Skye's lack of strength would not matter, only her accuracy and agility to shoot. After Skye's sister gave her a bow she quickly mastered it. She was born to shoot with a bow. Skye also had a second weapon she could use. An awl. A bow and arrow were good to hunt with, but if Skye didn't make a deathly shot, she would have to finish the animal off with a melee weapon, but most weapons was to heavy for Skye. However Skye tried an awl and found out that the little needle like weapon was great to use. Like the bow, she didn't need strength, just accuracy and agility.
Strength: Skye has always been an agile girl. Quick on her feet, and never seeming to trip. She would need that, to quickly get away from her father and up to her room, when she sensed that he was in a bad mood. Her agility is what makes up for her all size and weak body. Cause of all the time she used in the forest, The skills she masters the most is climbing. Skye would always be the one doing the climbing when her sister and her was out in the forest. Climbing made her feel free. A new person. At first she would only climb trees but her skill has developted and she can now climb pretty much anything. Her last skill is traps. Sometimes, Skye would prefer to rather be paticient than chasing an animal with a bow, and so her trapping-skills was needed.
Weakness: Skye has never had a lot of strength. Her light weight made it so that she didn't need a lot of muscels when she would climb, so her muscels never really got to grow a lot, and her small physical apparance didn't help either. Because of that, she's quite easily beaten in hand-to-hand combat, cause, again, she never really had many muscels. Also she's quite insecure and would always doubt herself, and although she can svim, she's not very good at it.
Fears: After what happened in her past, with her father giving ther that scar, she now gets terrified if anyone touches her face, the only exceptions was Skye's sister. Also Skye really hates arguments, and she is often scared if someone will force her into. Also, cause of the physical abuse, Skye has a rational fear of being hit. She has tried to forget the memories of her father hitting her, but will be almost forced to remember it if she feels that pain again.
Interviews: Skye will be slightly nervous (but not scared) having to stand in front of the big crowd of the Capitol and the entire Panem. So, because of that she will seem a bit shy, but also quite sweet and charming. She will act quite humble and insecure because she's very overwhelmed by the Capitol. She will seem quite clever to the other tributes, in her own unique way.
Bloodplan strategy/ strategy for the games: As the timer ticks down, Skye will use the time orientatating herself in the arena, trying to see where the covered areas are and see if there is a forest like area somewhere. When the timer reaches 0, she will run in very quickly and get thing within a 5 meter range, but she would never go longer in. When she see that the careers has reached the cornucopia, she will run off towards the forest area, or if there isn't one she will go to a covered area.
Token: Skye took the silver picture frame she broke (that is what caused her scar in the first place) and got it melted into a arrow-head shaped charm that she keeps in a string around her neck. She originally gave it to her sister but her sister told her that she should keep it.
Alliance: She's kinda shy so she stays away from most people. Because of that she won't ally unless asked. She is a good people analyser and won't ally with just anyone, only people she has "analysed" to be okay. She is more likely to join with an older female tribute that reminds her of her sister. She prefers to keep her alliance small, a maximum of four people including herself.
May Morningleaves
Is being updated!
Age: 13
Gender: Female
District: 11
Appearence: May is quite pretty. Healthy and young. She seems to have this aura of warmth around her, making people feel comfortable around her. Everything about her seems young almost a bit childish. Her skin is very brown. Her hair is black and straight, it flows from down, reaching a bit under her chest, but it's usually kept up in a ponytail or a bun to make sure it doesn't get in her way. She hasn't have much to eat and is therefor quite thin but not skinny, though. Her eyes are so dark brow that most people think that her eyecolor is black, and it's hard to see her pupils in contrast to the dark brown.
Height: May is rather small of her age, only reaching 5'0 for a 13 year old. This make her appear less supirior and more young and has probably favored her. Some people may just think of her as a robot if she didn't look young so her height is one of the few things that can help people pin-point her real age. This also make her look pretty cute and somewhat childish. People seem to relax in her presence. Her small height has also caused that she's not very strong and her being underfed doesn't really help that.
Personality: Although she is very young and looks very young, her mental age is anything but childish. After her father died, she became extremly responsible and very dedicated, and she always makes sure that she has her stuff done, so that she can help people who doesn't. She's a natrual leader but she doesn't dare to step up unless there isn't any other leader, because she's scared that people will hate her if she just takes the leadership without approval from others. Because, beneath her respondsible facade, she's actually very stressed and sad, trying to always be perfect. She's such a perfection, only accepting the best from herself, and if she fails she feels so guilty, that it eats her up and almost tears her apart. But she never tell anyone how stressed she is as she doesn't think that anyone will care. She tries her best to be friendly and happy, if she can but beneath she's under the pressure of her perfectionistic self. She is quite serious, often, and can be coldhearted if situation creave it. May has given too much of herself for so long, that she doesn't even seem like a child anymore. She seems like a adult, trapped inside a child's body. But few things, such as climbing, can awake the 13-year-old girl hiding deep inside May.
Weapon: When you look at May, you wouldn't believe that she's very powerful. You wouldn't think she could use any weapons. That's where people would be wrong because May can wield two weapons, to a very good extend. Her primary weapon is a machete. She learned how to use one when she worked in the orchards, cutting down branches and leaves that hangs in the way. However, she can and will use it to kill if she's put in danger. Her second weapon is a Shepherd's sling. A piece of tight fabric where you can place a rock in, and hurl it off towards your victim. May would use those in the orchards, if she needed to shoot something down from the trees, or scare small animals away. The weapon looks quite puny and does have a hard time killing, but a shot to the head, can cause permanent braindamage, and the weapon is quite good to quickly make May's foes unable to fight. When May encoutered animals in the orchards, she would use her sling, to send a rock to their head to petrify it. Then, she would kill with her machete. Those days, May's siblings would eat good.
Background: May was born into a poor family as the older daughter. She and her parents lived happily together. But then, when May was around 7 years old her mother got pregmant again and it was triplets. May was overly happy on her mother's behalf, eventhough they didn't have enough money to effort taking care of triplets. May signed up as a orchard worker to make more money for the family. After school she worked in the most overgrowed orchards. She would climb in and use a machete to cut through branches and other plant-stuff if there was too much weed/branches in the way. She wasn't paid that well but it was enough plus she learned how to use a machete. Although the family had a hard time working it around the money, they made it okay... Well until, her father died. He was caught in a riot and shot down by some peacekeepers even though he didn't even participate in the riot. The family was devestated. May had to work harder and help her mother taking care of the triplets. They barely managed to get food. But even more changed happened in May's life. Her mother was raped, and got pregmant again. 9 months after, another little sister was added to the family. Because of this, the family could barely feed themself. Her mother and May had to take work-shifts, where one would work and the other would take care of the children. Because of this, May matured much faster than she was supposed to. As a 13-year-old she's barely a child anymore. She's a adult trapped inside a girl body.
Strength: Well May's best skill her ability to climb. No matter how tall the trees is she will never be afraid of climbing because she would never fall because of the time she has spent in the orchards, climbing around. She can climb almost anything and do it swift and silent too. Another skill she has developed is her agility. It mostly came from all her climbing, because she would have to be quick but also dodge a lot of branches and such that would block her ways in the overgrowned orchards. Another skill she learned was about edible plants, which was edible and which wasn't. Going around in the orchards, she would quickly learn about different plants, and when no one was looking she would pick a few to take home to her starving family.
Weakness: May isn't strong. She's agile but has never had much muscle training. Her being underfed has kept her from devolping strength even with her daily physical activity. That makes her very easy to beat in a hand to hand combat. She could have been stronger if she had been taller, but she's also rather small of her age making her even easier to beat. Another weakness of hers is that she can be soft towards 12-year-olds. She will kill in The Hunger Games in order to survive but she can't kill 12 year olds. She has siblings that age and she just think that as the older one, she should take care of them. Not kill them.
Token: May carries a green necklace with a wooden leaf as a charm. The necklace was her grandmothers and May's mother wanted to give it to May when she got older but because of May getting reaped, May's mother decide to give it to her already. The necklace is a small string with tiny dark green beads. In the middle their hangs a charm made of wood, shaped like a leaf. It wasn't an original part of the necklace, but May's siblings made it for her.

Lia Skyward
District 6
Gender Female
Age 17
Physical Description: Tall and skinny with a few muscels perfect for sprinting and running. She has long black hair, that is wavy but not curly, and it flows down her back and reaches her navel. She has quite tanned skin and warm nutbrown eyes. She's quite pretty, but will probably have a hard time convicing anyone she's a threat in the games.
Strategy: She is very fast so she will in the bloodbath go in to get a bow or a spear, whatever is futherest away from the cornucopia. She will run in, and try her best to be quick so that she's gone before the careers reach the cornacopia and starts to kill. She will run to the woods and climb a tree then climb futher away. She will climb all day in the woods never staying one place for more than one hour unless she will sleep there
What did they do in Private Trianing Session? She will show of her amazing sprinting on threadmill, then she will take a bow and climb a tree in the fake forest. She will shoot diffrent stuff in the trainingroom while climbing form tree to tree.
Personality: The best word to decribe Lia is: helper. She is always ready to use time on helping other even if they don't want her to/ ask her to. She will gladly lose a limb to save a friend, but sometimes she willing to sacrefice a little too much for her own good. She has a friendly attitude but can be defernetly be serious when needed. Lia isn't really shy but she prefers to meet a few people and be with them instead of a lot at ones. She try her best to be kind, but may sometimes be too kind for her own good. Although she is friendly she don't talk too much mostly cause Dawn's death have still left scars on her. She wants to protect everyone. Eventhough she's helpful and friendly, she's also quite mature after having to take care of Dawn for long. She became her new mother and matured beyond her age because of that.
Backstory: She lived in the house in district 9 with her pregmant mother and her 3-year-old sister, Dawn. Her mother died while delivering and the baby did not survive. That left Lia, who was only 14 all alone with her sister. Because of the fact that most of the communety homes where already more than filled up the goverment decided to give her two options: Move to a communetyhome, or stay in her house and take care of her sister. Although it would be easier for her to just live in the communety home for a few years she knew how they would treat Dawn and she knew that neither Dawn or herself could not live with that so she decided that she would live with her in their house. She signed up as a orchard protecter where she would shoot predators that would try to get into the orchage. It brought in some money but hardly enough. She would also, when she had time work as a "runner", delievering groceries and such to people who were too lazy to go out and buy them themself. She managed till survive 2 years when Dawn got very ill and died in less than a week. Lia was completely destroyed by it and pretty much went all down to the lowest point. She ended up moving to district 6, simply cause 9 reminded for too much of Dawn. She was put in a mental institution for some months and then finally got out. She beagn using her bow and arrow to hunt in the forest to get her thoughts away from Dawn and death. She would sometimes wake up in the middle of night, unable to sleep and just run out of her house, run and run and run until the grieve faded. She signed up for adopting two other children a week before the reaping. She was reaped before she actually reach meeting the children she was supposed to adopt but will do everything to get back to them.
Weapon: In the orchards, as a protector them, Lia would always use a spear to fight off animals who would destroy the crops. They were good cause even if the animal got close to her she could still use the spear to fight in melee. Lia is very talented with a Bow and arrow. After Dawn died, she used a lot of her time in the woods hunting to get her mind on something else, and so got quite talented using one.
Skills: Lia's body is made for running. She outspeeds almost everyone, even the boys can't seem to catch up to her. Lia enjoys running too, it helped her get through her sorrow with Dawn, as it made her mind focus on something else. Another one of her skills is climbing. She seems to, just like with running be very quick at using her strength to get up on different things. Last, she's also very good at dodging, both while running and just in combat do to her fast reflexes.
Weaknesses; Lia isn't very coldhearted which is a great problem, and has a very hard time killing anyone unless she was in direct combat with them. If she passed by someone who was sleeping or had not seen her she probably won't be able to kill them cause of her personality. Although she can kill if her life depends on it, she would never kill a 12 year-olds. Lia thinks it's horrible to kill someone, and killing someone who aren't even a prober teenager yet is too much for her. Also, Lia isn't strong but isn't weak either, yet she has a very hard time in Hand to hand combat. It's just too creepy for her. Firing an arrow through someone's heart is one thing, killing someone with your bare hands is another. Also her skinny body works as a disadvantage as she isn't that strong.

Weaknesses:She tend to not trust anyone. She can't swim and she's pretty loud. Usually has a long fuse but if you really set her up then you are in big trouble cause she can't control her anger when she loose it. Also if she grows on an ally she may sacrefise her life for them, and she has a really hard time killing innocent and weaker tributes. She would never kill a 12-year-old cause of what happened with Johannes.
Fear: Having to kill a weaker tribute.

Personality: She is very threadning and most people that don't know her are very afraid of her. Although she dosen't talk much she is actually very loyal to her friends, will even sacrefist her life for them if that is what is needed. She is very masculine and tomboyish, and if she cut her hair epople would think she was a boy, cause of her tough facade. She has a long anger-fuse but will totally loose it if you really set her up. She is very coldhearted after what happened to Johannes and has never forgiven herself for it. She hates seeing stronger people pick on weaker.
Backstory: When she was seven she was moved to a communety home. Although the goverment were the official rulers of the home, Katriona quickly learned that it really wasn't the goverment, it was a group of strong older boys. After six years where she avoided them she saw one of them beating up her best friend, Mary. She got mad and attacked. Even as 14 year old she was strong and she had the element of surprise with her so she beat him up. After that she was the target of the boys and where beat up weekly. That was when she started to train. One of the boy ones tried to beat her up but she had gotten much stronger and she beat him. She continiued to train. Ones when she was 17 four boys attacked her and she beat them all up. After that the boys left her alone, and Katriona would beat the boys whenever they would try to beat up someone else. But the boys still wanted revenge... and they got it. A 12-year-old boy, Johannes, had grown on Katriona after she once helped him aganist the boys. Johannes had gotten so thankfull that he bought Katriona pastry from the bakery, using all of his money. Katriona had never had anyone thank her for saving them, and Katriona liked hím (the friends way!). The group of boys cornered Johannes when Katriona were away, and beat him up for hours when one of them accidentially pushed the nose-bone through Johannes' skull punturing his brain and killing him. Katriona found the body of Johannes lying in the gutter. She knew it was her fault, she knew that this happened to Johannes cause of her. She stopped protecting the younger children, and let the boys take over the communety home and got her own little hut in the outskirts of the districts.
Interview Angle: She will be very intemidating, and confident but not cocky. She will not hide her hate for the Capitol. She will answer stuff with one word if she feels like it and won't lie eeven if the truth hurts others.

It made her really motivated and soon after made it into the best academy in *insert district*. She began to take a lot of material arts, but no matter how much she tried she could not get musular, however she did get very good at hand to hand combat. At her academy she was first the "new girl" that wasn't to take note of however when one of the girls saw how good Shermaine was doing in hand-to-hand combat the other girl challenged her and Shermaine won after much struggle,. They became rivals and that was even more motivation for Shermaine. As the other students on the academy saw her serious nature they first off began to kid around with her.

The boys found her facinating cause of her harsh, mysterious nature and the girls envied her. Shermaine didn't give a damn. For her it was the training and her honor that mattered and nothing else.

Personality: A shy girl that keeps most to herself. She is normally not very coldhearted and want to protect everyone but some situations can make her go into survival mode however she could never harm somebody 12-year-old or younger cause she has siblings that age. She likes to be alone and use most of her freetime: writing, reading, running, doing karate or shooting with her crossbow with has been the only talent that she was good at the first minute she tried. She is one of those people who would do everything she can to help and others can easily take advantage of her.

Ana Shadowsinger
Districts: 3, 8, 6
Gender: Female
Age: 15
Personality: Ana is muted. She is used to being bullied that why she is kinda rough to herself always demanding the best from herself. She is quite a loner not on purpose but because no one wants to be friends with the muted girl. She is pretty intelligent but because of the fact that she can't speak people don't notice. They all think she's slow and stupid, just because they're so used to the lack of communciation coming from her. She is a person who does good alone and keep trying to tell herself that she doesen't need friends. If anyone where to try to communicate with her they would discover that she really friendly but she never learned sign language cause that would too expencive for the family to pay for. She always wished she had friends, but that thought became more and more a distant dream to her. Now she tries to tell herself that's it's alright. That she does not need them. The only way she can communicate is writing her throught in a little notbook she always have with her.
Backstory: Ana was born muted and have been it her whole life. As a child, she would live a rather solituded life. Her parents kept her away from the other children, and took care of her in home instead, before she was old enough for school. Ana never understood why. But soon, she learned. Because ever since she started in school live has been pretty rough. She is a group bullies favorite victims cause she can't call for help. It was a like a slap in the face getting hit by reality. That not all people were like her parents. That some people wouldn't accept her only because she lacked the ability to speak. They often lock her down in a cellar or sometimes even beat her up. Because of this, Ana became a rather closed off girl. She locked herself in this state of mind... that she didn't need other people. That she could survive without friends. It wasn't that the other children were mean to her. They were just used to not being able to communicate with her, and so they ignored her. She became like air to them. Just there, unnoticed. Her life wasn't that bad though. Why? Because of her parents. She didn't have any siblings, but they supported her through her life. However, one day, she walked home from school, her mother was no where to be found. Her father was often gone, he was a painter and would go out to hunt for inspiration. But her mother would always be there to welcome her after school. They had enough money for her mother to not work. But that day she weren't there. She had dissappeared, and she did not return. Ana has always wanted to find her but have run low of clues and has no idea what to do. Now, all she got left is her father. She lives in tiny house with her him. He is painter -as mentioned before- and was ones really popular in Capitol but ever since her mother disappeared he haven't touched a pensil. Somehow, he couldn't find inspiration. They moved into a smal house as they slowly lost money. Ana's father did try to paint but could never make himself paint anything other than black space, that couldn't sell. They barely didn't starve cause they sold the picture her father tended to keep.
Height: 165 cm

Her eyes are very dark blue. She has a few muscels but it's nothing special. She's neither strong or weak. Her body is slim, but she's not thin, as she has had enough to eat.
Weapon: Ana uses a bow and arrow. She has been praticing with it ever since she was 10 years old. Why? Because mainly of boredom and fear for the games. She didn't have any friends and had to entertain herself. And her fear from the games told her it would be a good idea to pratice some weaponry. After trying a lot of different weapons that she could get her hands on, she realized she was best with a bow and arrow. She had this special talent with it, that she had with no other weapon. She knew that if she was going into the hunger games, she would want to go in with that weapon.
Strengths: Fast, climbing
Weaknesses: Communecateting, close combat, hand-to-hand combat, also people have tendensy not to listen to her oppentions even when she writes them down
Fears: Cause of the fact that she locked in a pitchblack cellar, total darkness that she can't see through will make her fell that she is being choked.
Interview Angle: She will use most of time writing on an electronic board. The capitol audiecence is bored meanwhile and when a electronic voice finally reads her answer out loud the capitol have waited to long to care, plus it doesen't get very personal and that's what the capitol want to see
Bloodbath Strategy: She is fast so she will rush in and get a bow and arrow then she get out of there
Token: A little note book with an attached pen so that if she should end up in alliance she can communecate somehow
Shay Cobblestone
District: Capitol
Age: 17
Backstory: Ever wondered why the presidents of Panems enemys would just for no appearent reason drop dead? The President had many enemies, but couldn't possibly get rid off them all by himself. And it wasn't himself. Most of these these "mysterious and unfortunate" deaths was caused by Shay Cobblestone. Her story starts in District 2. She was born there and lived there with her parents. Her father loved Shay, but her mother didn't really care about Shay, so they were never the closest. And when Shay's father got cancer, when Shay were only 8-years-old, Shay was heartbroken. He was put into a hospital, but the cancer (braincancer) had already gotten very strong, and the doctors told the family he probably weren't gonna make it. But the mother and Shay loved him. The family used all their money on her father, in a desperate attemp to safe his life. They sold most of their furniture. Shay stopped at the career academy, so that they could use the money on her father, and instead, Shay began to work as thief, to get more money, although she was only 8-years-old. The mother and Shay tried their best to give enough money, so that there could be found a cure for the cancer but nothing helped. And Shay's father did die. Shay felt into a depression. Only 8-years-old and already lost the person she cared most for in the world. She didn't steal anymore, she couldn't do anything anymore. It had all been for nothing, and everything seemed pointless when her father died. Because of all the money they had used, Shay and her mother's family got into extreme dept. They had used all their resources to safe him, all for nothing, and now they were left with no money at all. But her mother had seen Shay steal to get money. She knew that Shay had a special talent for sneaking, stealth and stealing. Her mother contacted the President's secretary. They made an illegal deal with one of the presidents trusted allies and "sold" Shay to the presidents care. They send Shay to a training facility where they could see how good Shay was, and how much money they should pay for her. Only being 8-years-old, Shay had no idea what was happening around her. Shay showed her fantastic stealth, and the deal was sealed. Shay's mother got enough money to pay all her depth and live a luxurious life and Shay was taken into the President's care. Here she was trained from the age of 8 to be one of the presidents most deadly weapons, his own little personal assasin. Her stealth was perfectioned, she became so good that she almost seemed invisible when she sneaked around. In the training, Shay didn't think anymore. She got over her father, forgot her mother. Became a machine. After reaching the age of 12 her missions began. She would easily sneak inside the house of her victim, slit there throat in the middle of the nigth and be out of the house in less than 10 minuets. It was easy. She killed The President's enemies and allies, whoever seemed to threatned him. All The President had to do was just to tell her about her mission, tell her where she could find her victim and then, the victim was killed after a day. Since Shay was sold her feelings and personality was closed off and she became cold and hostile, more like a robot than a person. Closed off for everyone. She never needed anyone, she never loved, and was never loved by anyone. Sneaking, killing, waiting for a new mission. That was her life. She didn't enjoy it but she did not hate it either. To Shay, it was just like any other job. Living in the capitol she still had to attent the reapings. When she was reaped, The president was mad that his own little personal weapon had been reaped but couldn't do a thing about it.
Personalty: She used to be a really sweet girl who would always go out of her way to help others. She was a social butterfly in her younger days, but the training and the first time she had to murder someone made her extremely coldhearted. Now she is hostile towards everyone and hates to talk more than nessecary. She never had any friends after she was sold and can't really do good social. She seems very intimadating and mysterious to others and many people in the presidents palace where she is when she has some days off are scared of her. She's almost fearless, and only fear death. Most natrual human feelings has left her and she has become more like a calculating assasin robot rather than a teenage girl.Weapons: Daggers, Throwing knives
Strengths: Stealth ,escaping, very quick, sneaking
Weaknesses: People tend to stay away from her, she isn't strong at all (there was no need in her job), is easily beaten in hand-to-hand combat (cause no one ever came in direct combat with her)
Appearance: Pale, dark grey eyes that are almost black, black hair to the beginning of her chest usually in a high ponytale, 5'5, slim
Token: She has none as she really doesen't care to get any. She doesen't care for anything to remind her of home cause she had been sold a long time ago.
Allies: She won't ally, she doesen't like to have others around as she thinks they will come in her way. Even if she wanted allies, no one would have probaly wanted to ally with her.
Interview ancle: Mysterious, a little hostile, a little intemidating, sly
Strategy: She is very quick on her feet so in the bloodbath she will go in, get some knives and maybe some backpacks and then she will get out of there. As for the games, she will work at night, where she will track down lone tributes and slit their throat as they sleep.
Silver Becket
District: 9
Gender: Female
Age: 16
Personality: Silver was always recjected from socity, and no one has ever tried to approach been friendly to her, which has made her extremely closed of. She is kind of a loner, not really on purpose but because no one ever wanted to talk with her or tried to get to know her. She has gotten untrustful towards most people and only really trust Daniel. Because of her treatment when she lived in her city, she's now sorta cold, especially to strangers, and doesn’t let herself trust or be attached to anyone, as she knows no one could ever like her cause of her eyes (no one ever did). She is really is quite kind maybe a little quiet but no one discovered that side of her cause no one other than Daniel was friendly to her. She knows that people could never accept her, and has pretty much told herself to get used to it, and she does get to seem kinda cold cause of that, but she's really not that tough, and does have a soft side. She very rarely smile, only when she's with Daniel. She likes to reflect on and analyse stuff and she’s pretty intelligent as well. She’s very serious and only rarely makes jokes. She's very observant and seem to notice almost everything that is going on around her. Very mysterious. On the outside, her never smiling face, and her piercing snake eyes make her a scary sight, and most people are also afraid of her.
Backstory: Silver's father was a scientist working for the Capitol. Before she was born, her mother and father orginally lived in District 3, but moved to 9 cause her father wanted more solitude. Her father was...out there, to say the least. Mentally ill to be more exact. He could never control his anger and terrible things happened when he was angry. When her mother had gotten pregmant, Silver's father was experinmenting with a new anti snake vennon for The Hunger Games. One day he lost his temper, very badly and he forced his wife to swallow it, cutting of her airways so taht she had to open her mouth to breath. The antivennon had not been done correctly and so, Silver's mother was made fatally ill. After Silver's father realized what he had caused, he quickly took her to a hospital. The doctors tried to cure her but failed and the mother died, however they did get Silver out of her stomach before the mother died. But the vennon that had spread in the mother's body had effected how Silver looked. She was born with yellow snake like eyes, piercing and scary. Of course this made everyone distanced from her. Her father became unreachable after the mother died, and he blamed Silver cause of it. Her father always had a bad temper but after her mother died he would lose his temper, every single day, and Silver was lucky if she could go through out the day without getting beaten by him. In school she was bullied both verbally and physically. People called her names. She tried her best to keep in the background, and not cause any attention to her, as that would trigger the bullying but her shiny yellow snake eyes, hindered that. Her life was hell...but it turned even worse. One day it had gotten dark and she was walking home when she was attacked by 5 boys from her school. The boys wanted to "have fun" and no one would miss Silver anyway. Not even her own father. They beat her up and broke many bones in her body and left her in the outskirts of the district. She barely managed to drag herself out in the woods before she fainted. She was found by a man, Evan, who had lived in the same city as her. His daughter had been murdered and he was falsely accused. He had had to flee into the forest, and make everyone believe he was dead. He carried Silver home. Evan had never forgiven himself that his daugther was murdered, and kinda felt that he somehow could have hindered it. He knew he could not leave Silver on the muddy forest floor, bleeding to death. He would never forgive himself. He nursed her to health and Silver got to live in a all cottage with him, and he became her new father. Evan taught her about the woods, and learned her how to throw knives so that she could hunt. After what had happened she always carried a knife with her in her belt. He was the only person who didn't take distance from her, because of her eyes. Silver finally felt happy and so did Evan. Silver had never had a real father and Evan had lost his daugther. But it did not last long. Silver's real father was inraged when he found out that Silver had fled from him. He swore to take revenge on her, and one day, after searching through the woods, he found Evan's cottage. Evan heard Silver's father, and quickly got Silver to hide in a closet. Silver's father entered and saw Evan. He murdered Evan brutally and Silver saw it all happen and could not control herself. She took a knife she always carried with her in her belt, jumped out of her hiding place and killed her real father with a quick stab in the heart. She felt a weird way that she finally had ended her past by killing her father. But Evan had died and her happy future along with it. Now she was alone, living in the forest by herself. She became cold. She swore to live in complete solitude as it seemed that her presence only brought death with her. She killed anyone who got too close to the center of the forest, fearing to be found. In her time of solitude she killed three people who had come to close to her cottage. But one day she found Daniel, a boy around her age, who had ran away from a life of abusement from his parents. Like Silver, he was very injured when Silver found him. Something made Silver hesitate. She was never a killer and felt that Daniiel was special, just like Evan. Silver took him to the cottage and let him stay with her. Daniel became her new Evan. Her new hope. She taught him what she had learned from Evan and they would hunt together. They bonded in weird way. They became the closest friends but they would always have difficulty crossing the border between friends and lovers. Everybody thought she was dead until she came back forest to attend the reaping.
Height: 5'5
Appearance: Silver looks creepy, even scary. She could probably have been pretty, but her snake eyes hinders that. Silver's hair is black and lengthed to her chest. When she lived in the city, she had let in all grow out so that she could hide her eyes with it. But since Daniel never minded her eyes, she cut it. She was not embarressed of her eyes in Daniel's presence. Her skin is quite pale, which she got from her father. He barely got out of hte house cause he would keep studying chemisty inside. Her body is thin but not skinny. When she lived with her father, she would not get enough food, however Daniel often let her eat more than him, cause he didn't like to her that skinny, so she got a it of her natrual body weight back. She doesn't have very many muscels. Cause of her creepy apparance, no one ever really seemed to care about her or try to get to know her. She looks like a monster, and was treated so, when she really deserved to much better. Daniel could see that.
Weapon: Silver had considered picking up a weapon skill many times throughout her life. She knew she was in danger from getting beaten up, however she had no one to teach her, and her being underfed was also kind of a thing that kept her from training. However when she got to live with Evan, he taught her the art of using knife and throwing knives. She used her throwing knives skills to hunt in the forest. She never thought she would have to use her skills with a knife, however she was proven wrong when she murdered her father.
Strengths: Silver has always been trying to seek away from attention. It was not the easiest when you are born with yellow piercing eyes. But she sometimes did succed at walking through the streets without being too noticed. All of this sneaking around has made her very stealthy and is now, even with her snake eyes, almost never discovered by anyone. She would often use this skill to sneak up on people who had ventured to far into the forest so taht she could kill them. Another one of her skills is climbing. Living in a forest, it's kinda important to know how to climb and Silver's ligth weight body could easily make her way through the branches to the top of the trees. Often, Daniel and her would essemble a team, if their game was hiding. Silver would climb a tree, and Daniel would scare the game out of the hiding place, so that it would run past Silver, where she could quickly shoot the game down from the top of her tree.
Weaknesses: Silver's body is quite weak, and she was never very strong. She was never really born to have all that great muscles, and her father underfeeding Silver would only add to that. Even with Daniel giving her his extra food, her body really just needed to focus on building itself back up again, rather than getting her stronger muscels. Daniel would therefor always be the one to help with the brute strength things. Because of her not very strong body, Silver doesn't have do well in hand-to-hand combat and is easily beaten. The only real reason why she managed to kill her father was her knife skills and the element surprise. However Silver does NOT have a problem with having people around her. It's usually the people that have problem with having her around. However she still does have some trust issues and will have a hard time getting attached to people in the arena.
Fears: Silver has a fear for being beaten. The haunting memories of the boys beating her body, breaking her bones, still make her wake up screaming from nightmares. She also fears that the contact she's gonna have with people will trigger bullying because of her eyes. She knew she had to attend the reaping, as it would have been noted that she wasn't dead, yet wasn't at the reaping. Being with people doesn't scare her, but their reactions to her eyes, their judgement of her, their hatred for her simply cause of the way she looks, does.
Interview Angle: Silver knows that she will already come across as quite threatning and intemidating just cause of her looks, so she will avoid comming across as even more intemidating. She will however keeps up an mysterious and elusive attitude. Her looks will only increase this. She will keep from revealing any strengths/weakneses, and will not explain anything about her past (if she is asked she will avoid the question, making it clear that she doesn't want to talk about it, making the audience quite annoyed), except that, if she's asked she may talk about a boy waiting for her to get home, a boy who pretty much saved her from a life of solitude. It will still maintain her mysterious apparenace BUT it will also make her seem more of a person. The Capitol audience will not know who this girl is, not know why she looks the way she does, not know her hidden past, but they will know her motivation to win.
Bloodbath strategy: She will first meet up with her allies (the few ones she got) and stay in the outskirts with them, trying to get water and knives if there are any close by. She will leave the bloodbath quite early with her allies, and will make an effort to not to cause attention or be targetted by the careers.
Token: Daniel had prepared a gift for Silver for her birthday. A necklace, not fancy or anything a simple string with a wooden charm which is shaped as a leaf, that he had carved. As Daniel could not give it to her at her birthday, he silently slipped it into her pocket when she walked past him on the way to the reaping stage.

It was dangerous to live on street but after awhile of saving and selling the furniture from her old house she bought a small house.

Backstory: Yuna lived with her mother in (insert district) She and her mother always travelled around on foot cause they could not effort transportation. Her mother and Yuna was healers treating wounds and illness in the district. They never took money for their healing but people would let them stay in their houses.

Yuna would always push herself to her limits to help others and blamed herself if they passed away. But her mother got sick from the infected patients, and passed away shortly after. Yuna was left all alone with no one to turn to. The people from her district liked her but had to take care of themself. It was kinda like a slap in the face for Yuna, realizing that even after everything her mother and herself had done for people, no one bothered to let her live at their house till she was older.

It was very streesfull for Paula but she never complained as she felt like Jeff deserved the best he could get, and that she didn't deserve the spare time. However on the reaping a year before, Jeff was reaped. Their parents went crazy and tried to stop Jeff from walking to the stage, and Paula and Jeff watched in horror as their parents were shot dead right in front of them, and right in front of the whole contry of Panem. Paula was placed in the worst orhanage in whole district 12. It was hard to live and the fact that she had to watch her brother compete in the hunger games. He was placed 9th. He was found by the careers and totured to death and of course Paula had to watch the whole thing. No one took care of Paula while she fell into a depression. But finally after a long time she got a job as a maid for the mayor of the city. The mayor liked Paula as she never complained and such. At her working place, she met the Mayor's son, 16-year-old, Ninten. They talked on a few occations, and Paula was so thankfull cause Ninten actually showed intrest for her which no one ever did. They began to be more than friends, and they would be very romantic together, and Paula was pretty much the happiest girl on planet earth. But something changed with Ninten. His mother died. And one day Paula found Ninten just standing looking out as his window. Paula wanted to help him and laid a hand on his should. Ninten turned around and slapped her so hard that Paula fell to the floor. He punched her, kicked her, slaped her. Paula never blamed him, but and tried her best to be a good girlfriend, but everytime she would encounter him alone, she would get beaten. It went worse the day before the reaping. As she was cleaning a room, Ninten came in and locked the door. And it began. It was the worst he had ever beaten her. She was lucky that she didn't break any bones but she was very close to break her own skull when he yanked her face into the wall. The next day while walking to the reaping, Paula whole body was covered in bruises and wounds that were still open. She was reaped. Paula is still not sure what worse...having to die in the hunger games, or having to stay with someone she loved who woould beat her dead.

Naisha Shadowrunner
Name: Naisha Shadowrunner
Gender: Female
District: 6
Age: 15
Backstory: Naisha was never set up for a good life. She lives in a small house with her mother. Her father is dead. What happened to her father still stand clear in Naisha's memories. Her father, was not really the greatest man, he made Naisha’s life a living hell to say the least, and to this day, Naisha is happy he is dead. She smiles when she thinks of his death. Her father, he would always drink and was almost never sober. He would always beat Naisha until she begged him to stop, even though she was only a child and sometimes, he would beat Naisha's mother too, and make Naisha watch, as her mother screamed for mercy. The haunting screams from her mother are still pierced in Naisha’s mind. When he wasn't beating his wife and daughter, he gambled to the sun would rise, and even to this day, Naisha's family is still in depth because of that. Anyway, her father gambled and one day the depth just got too great. The people he owed money threatened him that they would kill him if he did not get the money soon. Naisha father was in distraught. He had no idea how he could manage to raise so much so quickly. His lousy job did not give him much. He had to do something else… something illegal. And so, Naisha's father tried to steal from one of the richer couple that lived in the town. He snuck into their house at night. He did not mean to wake them, he would just steal something quickly and then get out. But he did make a noise, and the rich man woke up. The rich man walked to down to check the noise and saw Naisha’s father, just standing there with his hands on some jewellery he. Naisha father thought quickly and killed him, but the rich man’s wife had by then already called the peacekeepers and he was quickly caught and was sentenced to death by whipping him until he was bleeding and then keep on whipping him until he bleed out. In public, of course. The mayor of District 6 had a thing for that. The day he was going to be killed, a lot of people gathered at the town square to see him die. Naisha’s mother didn’t want to go and asked for Naisha to stay home with her. But something in Naisha could not resist going to watch it. IT was her father, the man who made her life a living hell. Watching him die… that would be fun for Naisha. Her own personal way of saying: “you brought this onto yourself”. When the executer saw that the death-sentence’s daughter herself had showed up, he forced her to stand out from the group of people and go closer so that she could easily see the whip hitting her father. So the entire crowd could see her. Naisha will never forget the moment she heard her father's last cry. In those haunting hours, and after all that loneliness with her dad beating her. That was when the first cracks in her sanity appeared, and she devolved a strong form mental disease. She did get a somewhat better life though, after her father went gone, well at least in some cases. Although he had treated her mother very bad she still loved him, and she became extremely distanced from everything. Naisha, on the other hand was glad he was dead, and she did not mind her mother’s distance either. She got to go to a new school, after what happened with her father, to avoid being bullied with her father, and there she met a girl called Amber. Amber was this popular girl who everyone would just dream of talking to. And yet, one day Amber just sat down beside Naisha while they were eating lunch and they talked. Naisha loved Amber, like a sister. Amber was Naisha’s only friend. Amber was in a weird way her new mother. And yet, it all seemed to good. Amber didn’t belong with Naisha, and Amber had had no reason to want to be her friend. Yet, Naisha didn’t get suspicious, she kept their relationship and one day told Amber her biggest secret. That she was suffering from mental diseases, and quite many of them. But the next day at school, when Naisha walked inside the hall, everyone began to whisper and point at her. Some people yelled: “Freak!” After her and some others laughed. Amber had told everyone. Let the rumor spread like fire on a dry field. To Amber, it had all been a game. Naisha’s instant friendship, was a way for Amber to show of her power over the other students. And now, when Amber didn’t need Naisha anymore, she thought that she could aswell use for one last thing, getting everyone’s attention with that “Juicy gossip” about Naisha. Naisha couldn’t believe it, and yet it was true. She walked up to Amber in the hall, in front of everyone. “Amber… I thought you were my friend.” Naisha whispered. “I may have been… But who would want to be friends with a freak like you? What if you had killed me because the little voices in your head told you to? You aren’t my friend, you’re a creep!” Amber yelled back at her, as Naisha ran out the school, back home. Back home, Naisha sat down quietly and just cried. But after a while she began to hear them. The voices that whispered in her head. If she hadn’t had a such a strong diagnosis she would probably wouldn’t have listened to them, but she was alone, afraid and sad. They told her to pick up her necklace, one of her few belongings. She took of her necklace, a black string, with a metal plate as a charm, nothing special, and began to swing it back and forth in front of her head, hypnotizing herself. And that was when she found out… She had a special talent. A deadly talent. She was skilled with hypnosis, easily hypnotizing herself in seconds, on her very first try. The days after Amber’s betrayal was horrible. No one wanted to be around Naisha, and yelled at her as she walked. Pointed. Laughed. And everyday when she came home, she hypnotized herself to get to escape, from her life, from herself, from the hell she lived in. She became better with hypnotism. She tried hypnotizing her mother, and she put her trance so quickly she didn’t even notice. Her talent was deadly at that point, yet people had no idea what threat walked beside them as they bullied Naisha with her insanity. All the hate, that Naisha receive, all for something she could not help. She couldn’t take it anymore. And then, an idea began to grew from Naisha’s mind. Naisha wanted revenge over Amber. Over everyone who had ever laughed at her. When night fell, she took a kitchen knife, and snuck out of her house, driven by the voices in her head, and the desire for revenge. She snuck all the way over to Amber’s house and found just what she needed. An open window. She easily crawled in and creept up there to Amber’s bedroom. Oh, how she longed after her revenge. A revenge she was finally going to get. She walked into her bedroom, so silently and then jumped on her bed. “Listen to me. Look at the plate.” She whispered to Amber as she swung her hypno-pendolym (her necklace). Amber never even reached to scream before she was bound by the trance. And so, Naisha guided Amber out of her bed and lead her towards the forest with Amber following behind her, still in trance. Finallly she reached a cave, and that was where Amber’s life ended. Naisha pounced and pinned Amber’s body to the ground, And took out her knife. And then she began to torture poor Amber. She first cut off her fingers, but was annoyed that Amber closed her eyes. So, she took the thin skin on her eyelits and cut it off too, so Amber couldn’t close her eyes anymore. She cut her ears, toes, fingers, and parts of her muscels of poor Amber. When the screaming became too loud for Naisha, she cut out of her tounge. Naisha enjoyed every second of it. Hearing her enemy scream in pain was like music for her. After she finally bled out, Naisha dragged her body into the cave and hang her from the thick ivy vines that grew in the ceiling of the cave. Standing there, in front of “her cave” with the body hanging from the ceiling. It made her happy. As if she had rid the world from another evil person. But Naisha was far from done. She gave this treatment to everyone who laughed at her. Starting with the guy who had walked up and pushed her, yelling “FREAK!” at her. She snuck into their houses at night, and uses hypnosis to take them away from their homes, and into the forest out to the cave where she first killed Amber. From the ceiling of the cave, more and more bodies hung, as Naisha rid out the city for all who ever lauged of her. The city experienced the loses of course. Rumors about a serial killer, murdering teenagers was spread quicker than Naisha’s own rumor. Naisha was old news. Yet, no one suspect Naisha. She was just a teenager herself, she couldn’t hurt anyone. That was what they thought, at least. But after Naisha was done with killing she actually… came back to herself… Atleast a bit. She became lonely. Something she hadn’t felt in long time. People weren’t showing her attention anymore after the murdering, cause everyone where too busy talking about new gossip. But in the time, a new boy began at Naisha’s school. His name was was Peter. He wasn’t really all liked. Not hated either, more just overlooked. He began to talk a little to Naisha. Just casually. They were the outcast, so they ate together, and took their school assignments together too. Naisha began to like him more and more. She was scared. After what had happened with Amber, trust was hard to feel. But she tried. And one day, they did kiss. He brought Naisha back. The old Naisha, who may have been sick, but also friendly. The Naisha who showed when she was friends with Amber. Peter was her life. She loved him but unlike Amber, he didn’t feel like he was good to be true. She felt alive with him. He was her reason for living. He got her into “rehab” from the whole killing-people-with-hypnosis-and-torture thing. She began to actually feel feelings again. Her voices in her head left her and she was finally healthy. She trusted him, but she trusted him too much. She told him about her father and even told him about her mental diease but all he did was feeling empathy. He understood her. And one day, she wanted to show him just how much she trusted. She brought him out in the forest, as the first person who weren’t hypnotized when he walked with her. She took him do the cave and let him look inside it, with the bodies hanging from it. She thought he would understand her. Why she killed them, why they needed to die. But like any sane human being he didn’t. He screamed at her and she got such a big shock that she was almost pulled backwards. He was not really angry at her, cause he didn’t understand. But he was in a state of panic and that scared Naisha. She had never seen him like that. She began to cry as he just screamed. He finally calmed himself and turned to Naisha. “What. Is. This?” He just said, and she could hear it. The hate in his voice. “I thought… I thought you would understand… I guess not…” They just stood there for a bit, both staring at the ground. “You will hang there.” She cried as she took up a knife and threw at Peter, hitting him in the calf. She pounced at him, but this time it was not like usually. Instead of keep her victim alive to torture them, she just quickly took the knive stuck in his calf and pierced it through his heart. Still crying, she hang his body from the ceiling of her cave. That was when the last piece of sanity cracked in her mind. She became so dead inside, and she never became the same after her loss of Peter. She never regretted that she killed him though. Peter learned her that she could not trust anyone… ever. She began killing again, but on a far bigger scale. Every single night, she was a lone hunter. The same routine, but never the same method. She would always only kill teenagers, “I stick to my roots” as she would tell herself when she found another teenage victim. She began to experiment, trying new ways of killing. Ripping out nails of people or teeth using pliers. Every time, for every kill losing herself more and more. It didn’t matter to her. She didn’t want to live anymore. Killing became a way to heal herself. Forget herself. The screams where like music in ears, and the voices became her only friends. Her mother never really noticed anything, still swallowed in sorrow over Naisha’s father. But then, the reaping day came along. She waked up one day, after a night killing a 13-year-old with long red hair and freckles. She got on her reaping dress and walked silently to the square. No one realized they had a killer among them. No one realized that someone who had killed over fifty people was right beside. When Naisha’s name was called out, she was not sure what she felt. Deep down she knew she shouldn’t kill, but it was the only way she could manage to keep herself together, instead of falling completely apart. Killing was a part of her. If she was not a killer, she was nothing. In a way, she kinda wanted to find an end to it. The Hunger Game would force that to happen. She told herself that if she were to win, she would try and stop herself from killing. She could kill in The Hunger Games but told herself that if she manage to won she would stop, or at least try. If she lived through this, she wanted to try and find herself again. The old Naisha could still be inside her, just hidden away. But before she could do that, she would have to be a killer for a little while longer. For long enough to win The Hunger Games.
Personality:
Strengths:
Weaknesses:
Weapon: Naisha main weapon is, of course, knives. Ever since Naisha killed Sophie using the knives to drag on her death for hours, the knives has been her main weapon. When she wields a knive against a target, pinning them down with her body weight, she goes into a state of mind, just like an sculpturist who carves in tree. But for Naisha, it's just flesh, not tree. She does know that if she's in the heat of battle, it's not a very good idea to sit down and begin a three-hour-long toturing session, so she can't kill fast if needed, but if she were to end up in a situtation where she made her target weak/hypnotised him/her, she may drag them away to a safe place and toture them for long, but cutting their tounge out first so that they can't scream. Another weapon she is good with the throwing knives. Naisha made a little game with some of her victims. When she had let them out in the forest, she would tie them to a tree, and then stand away from them and throw her knives at them, instead of doing it close combat. In the start, she was quite bad a thrower, and usually hit them in their calf, which would make them bleed out quickly, which she found boring. But after a while, she got good at it. Now she throw just right so that her victims nose is sliced off. She can throw a knife, purposely slicing only their ear off, so that their death can dragged out as long as she wants. She could easily have hit them in the heart, which could have made them die instantly, but Naisha asked herself: "Where would the fun be in that?" Naisha is also talented with some various torture instruments. Taisha liked to experiment after a while of killing with knives, and began to bring various stuff to her cave. Some of these include pliers, to rip other's fingernails out with, and pull out teeths. But although she did try other ways of torture, she always prefered the knives, slicing up tiny pieces of people, and watch them in pain.

MWAHAHAHA EVEN THOUGH UR A MOD I CAN STILL BAN YOU
WarningThe new Enron scandal? That's how the allegedly fraudulent activities by a group of high-powered New York lawyers at the now-defunct firm Dewey & LeBoeuf are now being characterized.
The firm's former executives are accused of massive financial fraud, stemming from the largest law firm bankruptcy in history. They face dozens of criminal and civil charges.
The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, said the men conspired for years to hide the dire financial condition of their firm.
"The defendants simply lied," he said. "They lied and masked the firm's financial shortfallings. The scheme deceived lenders, investors and others into believing the firm was in far better financial condition than it actually was."
The case is significant due to the company's prestige and global footprint, CBS News financial contributor Mellody Hobson said on "CBS This Morning."
"This was Enron, WorldCom kind of stuff," she said.
Among Dewey & LeBoeuf 's one-time clients were The Walt Disney Company and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.
At its peak, the firm had 3,000 people, including 1,300 lawyers in New York.
"You're talking about a firm that had half a billion dollars in debt," Hobson said. "... The four people running the firm were (allegedly) perpetrating this fraud. ... literally cooking the books, so it is a really big deal."
In addition to criminal charges, the Securities and Exchange Commission is also filing a civil suit because of the firm's 2010 private debt offering.
Hobson explained, "Thirteen insurance companies bought their bonds, which means they had a security. That means they were regulated by the SEC.
"Now the new SEC chair, Mary Jo White, has said when she finds that there's securities fraud she is going to be aggressive on crime, and ... when you read this indictment, 60 pages, 106 counts of fraud, the emails that they were writing to each other, shocking. ... This is, again, a story about email. Writing this down, you do not expect it from lawyers. They tell you [not to do that], which is the part that's crazy."Science Outside the Square: Veolia World Solar Challenge at Victoria Square

Answer by Zbob750 · Jan 23, 2013 at 12:37 AM
The real risk of rooting in your case (Nexus 7) will be what apps you grant root access to.
On your particular device in order to root it you will need to unlock your bootloader. While this is a fairly trivial task with all of the instructions available it does come with a trade off. On all Nexus devices (and most devices with an unlockable bootloader) you must do a factory reset on the device (It will prompt you as you unlock it) to unlock the bootloader, this will wipe all the data you have on your N7. This is why when most people decide to root their devices they do it right away, so they don't end up losing data.
To get back on topic, granting root access (commonly referred to as "SuperUser access") is no different than using the sudo command in linux or logging in as root. The app will have access to everything. It's an all or nothing situation with root, and while a lot of apps need this for legitimate purposes (backing up your data, accessing advanced hardware features, modifying system files) they also have the risk to, theoretically, take all of your call logs, your messages, emails, phone numbers, etc. and send them to a server. Or if it is particularly malicious wipe your phone into a potentially unusable state (I haven't seen this personally but I'm sure it exists somewhere).
Regardless, safe habits such as looking at reviews, asking questions, even looking at source code, are recommended. If it looks fishy, it probably is.

The 49-year-old may have been the big winner of the night – she took home four awards – but she faced stiff competition to be crowned ‘best dressed’ at the ceremony.
Her high-necked asymmetrical navy blue, green and white patterned Peter Pilotto ensemble was in stark contrast to fellow attendees Heidi Klum, 40, Malin Ackerman, 35, and Jessica Alba.
Klum decided on a glittering navy Armani gown that was slashed to the navel while Rock of Ages actress Ackerman showed off her post-baby body in a daring white Cushnie et Ochs dress rivalling Klum for best cleavage of the night.
Alba, 32, joined the stars that opted to show a little more flesh but left something to the imagination in her demure Jason Wu corset dress.
Along with Bullock, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, 32, – who won the second annual humanitarian award for her work with the Julian D. King Gift Foundation – decided on a more elegant look wearing a white long-sleeved Kaufman Franco number with matching high heels.
Meanwhile, Glee actress Naya Rivera, 26, showed off her newly-dyed blonder hair as she arrived at LA’s Nokia Theatre in a clinging white, black and tan Michael Kors dress.

“Race for Results provides a high-level but nuanced look at children in each racial demographic and some of the conditions that explain their circumstances,” said Laura Speer, associate director, Policy Advocacy and Reform, of the Casey Foundation. “We see that where a child lives matters and that in nearly every state, African-American, American Indian and Latino children have some of the steepest obstacles to overcome. Our analysis also clearly demonstrates that growing up in an immigrant family can have a significant impact on access to opportunity.” finds there are clear differences in the extent to which barriers to success exist for different subgroups of Asian children and for Latinos. Although Asian-American children scored the highest on the well-being indicators, children of Southeast Asian descent (Burmese, Hmong, Laotian, Cambodian and Vietnamese) face barriers on the pathway to economic stability. For Latinos, kids from Mexico and Central America face the biggest barriers to success..Track of the Month: Denmark Posted on September 16, 2019 by Fika Online Leave a comment September 2021: Viva la Vida by Vocal Line Hear the track here.

Four judges and one nervous unseen contestant singing his or her heart out is how the highly acclaimed TV show, The Voice, begins. One at a time they give it their best shot at turning one.. two…three…or preferably four chairs. The “judges” are not able to see the one who is singing…they can only hear their voices and judge accordingly. As the season progresses, they will be narrowed down to the “top ten”. Each one unique…each voice recognizable.
I’ve always found it fascinating that we all have distinct voices. Turn on your radio (or your mobile device) and listen to each modulation. I know that one because his tenor is clearly different from her alto. And that falsetto is not the same as this contralto or mezzo soprano. But, wow, no one can display a vibrato like so and so! This hollow, muscular organ containing vocal chords seems to be as varied as fingerprints, not to mention voices simply speaking words. We are undoubtedly surrounded by countless voices that fill our heads day to day. How do we filter out damaging ones, while honing in on the healing ones?
I admit I have read the Word for many years, but have not always heard the Voice of the Author. I have seen black print on white pages lacking power to tear down strongholds and set this prisoner free. I have listened to far too many voices leading me to places of fear and shame and condemnation, but have sadly tuned out the One Voice that offers grace and healing and life abundant.
Psalm 95:8, then later referenced in Hebrews 3:7-8 and 3:15, reminds us to listen. It says, “So, as the Holy Spirit says: ‘Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion…’”
His sheep hear His voice. But do we listen to what He’s speaking to us? Are we reading the Bible, but, like rebellious children sticking our fingers in our ears, yelling lalalalalalalala!! Are we blocking God out because we don’t really believe He’ll speak encouragement over us?
Listen to Him for just a moment: Even in adversity, God gave His children this promise, Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you saying, “This is the way; walk in it.” Isa. 30:21
And… The LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing. Zeph. 3:17
Now, THAT is the Voice I’m longing to hear. Desperately, I need His direction and guidance. I need to be led by the One who knows the path that is best for me. I need One who will quiet the noise in my head until all I perceive is my Lover’s song. I want His utterances to be planted in more than my auditory canal. My desire is for His words, His precious voice, to be planted in my very soul so that when I read His Word, I hear His Spirit speaking deeply into me and singing over me. I desire to be like those road-to-Emmaus strollers who inquired of one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while He talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?” OH, to have a fire burning within as the vibrations of His voice shatter lying and deceptive ones while imparting words of love and hope! May my ears be attentive to that sound above all others!
I could never be a judge on the Voice…I’d appreciate them ALL too much to ever vote any of them off. But in the day to day of life, I intend to eliminate distractive voices until my # 1 unseen Soloist takes center stage and the song He sings over me becomes my anthem.

She is due to have her knees done in Dec, but is now unsure as the surgeon has told her she will not be more mobile afterwards than she is now, just pain free, her pain is controlled with anti-inflammatory medication. Given her age etc, what is your opinion, alot of her pain is due to her bad posture, (stooping), I have suggested I get her a regular Physio who specialises in this field.
Without knowing your mother's entire history, I cannot advise you or her on what to do. In general, a good medical principle is to do the simplest and safest thing that solves the problem. If your mother is doing well on anti-inflammatory medication (no side effects), there would be no reason to rush into surgery.Wolfire Games’ Lawsuit Against Valve Dismissed
Wolfire Games' lawsuit against Valve Corporation's dominance of the PC market gets dismissed for a month.
In April, Wolfire Games, the developer of the 2017 action video game, Overgrowth, filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Valve Corporation, the proprietors of the renowned digital distribution service, Steam. According to Wolfire Games, Valve Corporation suppresses competition and charges “an extraordinarily high cut from nearly every sale that passes through its store.” However, after months, the case has now come to a conclusion and Wolfire Games isn’t the one that succeeded.
In July, Valve Corporation responded to Wolfire Games’ allegations, stating that they “fail to allege unlawful conduct, antitrust injury, market power, or facially sustainable antitrust markets for two separate products … Rather, they attack a popular integrated service consumers value in a competitive market.” Even Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, took his chance to call Valve Corporation out for its allegedly high cut from developers.
However, the company continued to defend its 30% cut from developers and even stated that “30% has become the ‘industry standard.'” Fortunately for Valve Corporation, it seems like this cut won’t be changing anytime soon. In its response to the allegations, the company asked the court to dismiss the case based on the unjustified accusations, saying that Wolfire Games failed to meet “the most basic requirements of an antitrust case,” and this is exactly what has happened now.
According to the verdict regarding the case, Wolfire Games’ allegations fail because of two reasons. Firstly, the accusation that Valve Corporation is illegally using Steam as a monopoly to force players to purchase games through its storefront only has been denied because the court stated that Steam as a storefront and platform are, in fact, “a single product within the integrated game platform and transaction market.”
Secondly, the accusation that Valve Corporation uses Steam as a monopoly to charge an exceptionally high cut of 30% from developers, which makes it unsustainable in a competitive market, was also denied because the court stated that, while other storefronts with lesser cuts have come and gone, Steam’s policies regarding the percentage of revenue that it charges its developers have remained the same all through the storefront’s history.
Furthermore, the verdict also states that a 30% cut is not unfair, as other storefronts with significantly more resources that have charged much less eventually failed, and that the high cut hasn’t reduced the number of games released on the storefront. In addition to this, the verdict also states that Wolfire Games failed to describe how it directly suffered from the alleged reduction in the output of its games as a result of the policies.
Lastly, the court concluded the verdict by saying that “Wolfire may file a second amended complaint, addressing the infirmities described above, as well as any other changes it elects to make, within thirty (30) days of this order,” which suggests that the case isn’t over and Wolfire Games can still bring more evidence for another lawsuit.

.
Now, it appears Sonisphere is ready to return at full strength in 2014, and the UK dates set for July 4 through 6 at Knebworth Park (the famous site of legendary concerts past by everyone from Queen to Led Zeppelin) will mark the first occasion in which Maiden and Metallica have appeared together at one festival.
In what is also presently expected to be both bands’ only UK appearances in 2014, Metallica has already announced that their setlist will be determined by their own fans on a “by request” basis, as they purchase their tickets.
As drummer Lars Ulrich told the UK’s Metal Hammer, “This just works on all fronts. Metallica and Knebworth, Metallica by Request, Metallica and Iron Maiden..”
Continued a never-short-of-breath Lars: .”
Meanwhile, Iron Maiden will mark the occasion to officially conclude their current, massively successful world trek. Said bassist Steve Harris in a statement: “Firstly it’s an honor to celebrate 40 years of rock at Knebworth, especially when you look at the list of great British bands who have appeared there over this period. Secondly, it’s the last show of our Maiden England tour, so it’s fantastic to be able to close this on home turf and in front of a lot of friends. You can be sure we will pull out all the stops!”
Added frontman Bruce Dickinson, “We all grew up in England well aware of the importance of the legendary concerts at Knebworth, and scarily it all seems quite recent! [So] it really is an honor and privilege to return to play there with the purpose of celebrating some of the finest moments in British rock history from inspirational bands like Pink Floyd, the Who, Zeppelin, the Stones and Genesis.
With a third headliner and many more bands still awaiting formal announcement, you can expect a steady stream of Sonisphere 2014 updates right here on UCR in coming months. Stay tuned.New York City Is Offering Prescriptions For Fruits And Vegetables [FBHW]

'That’s very nice,' Weiner said sarcastically. 'In front of children.' | AP Photo
Anthony Weiner’s shouting match with a voter, which went viral on Wednesday, appears to have been triggered by an incendiary comment made about the New York City mayoral candidate’s wife.
“Married to an Arab,” muttered a man in a lengthy video provided by the campaign, who also called Weiner a “scumbag.”Continue Reading
Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, is a Muslim of Indian and Pakistani descent.
“That’s very nice,” Weiner said sarcastically. “In front of children.”
(Also on POLITICO: Weiner has meltdown with Orthodox Jew)
As Weiner walked out the door of a Jewish bakery, where he had been purchasing honey cake, the heckler continued, saying, “We’ll have a discussion, come back in here. I’m not afraid of you.”
From there, the “discussion” escalated into a full-blown meltdown on Weiner’s part.
“You don’t get to judge me because you’ve shown no signs you’re superior to me and you are not my God,” Weiner said. “Ask your rabbi who gets to judge me.”
“I don’t mind people getting in my grill; that’s politics,” he told reporters later. “But when you start saying vile, racist things about my wife, when you start saying things using dirty words, curse words around children, shouting out after someone left. … I just thought it was inappropriate; he deserved to be put in his place.”
Weiner noted that in the spirit of the Jewish New Year, which starts at sundown, “I forgive him.”

The highest pressures are achieved only with significant and near unstable strain. Could multi-walled carbon nanotubes be loaded with silane up to a critical pressure to a make a superconducting wire ? What is the peak critical superconducting temperature for the silane class of material ? How can we load gases into fullerenes up to those pressures ?
Internal pressure in fullerene nanocage producing various average relative C-C bond elongations (1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%) vs radius of undeformed cage. Vertical dashed lines mark radii of some nearly spherical fullerenes.
This relates to the new class of superconductors made from supercompressing silane (silicon and hydrogen). Note: I had to amend that report on superconductors. The investigators did not get good readings in the critical range of 96-120GPa, where the readings that they did get showed an indication of a spike in critical temperature. So highly pressured silanes could be a route to room temperature superconductors but we do not know yet. Also, now if silane were superconducting under high pressure than those conditions might be achieved with buckyballs loaded with silane.
The research appears on the March 2008 cover of the American Chemical Society's journal Nano Letters. "Based on our calculations, it appears that some buckyballs are capable of holding volumes of hydrogen so dense as to be almost metallic," said lead researcher Boris Yakobson, professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Rice. "It appears they can hold about 8 percent of their weight in hydrogen at room temperature, which is considerably better than the federal target of 6 percent.".
If a feasible way to produce hydrogen-filled buckyballs is developed, Yakobson said, it might be possible to store them as a powder.
"They will likely assemble into weak molecular crystals or form a thin powder," he said. "They might find use in their whole form or be punctured under certain conditions to release pure hydrogen for fuel cells or other types of engines."

Fullerene Nanocage Capacity for Hydrogen Storage by Olga V. Pupysheva, Amir A. Farajian, and Boris I. Yakobson
We model fullerene nanocages filled with hydrogen, of the general formula Hn@Ck, and study the capacity of such endohedral fullerenes to store hydrogen. It is shown using density functional theory that for large numbers of encapsulated hydrogen atoms, some of them become chemisorbed on the inner surface of the cage. A maximum of 58 hydrogen atoms inside a C60 cage is found to still remain a metastable structure, and the mechanism of its breaking is studied by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Hydrogen pressure inside the fullerene nanocage is estimated for the first time and is shown to reach the values only a few times smaller than the pressure of hydrogen metallization. We provide a general relation between the hydrogen pressure and resulting C−C bond elongation for fullerene nanocages of arbitrary radii. This opens a way to assess possible hydrogen content inside larger carbon nanocages, such as giant fullerenes, where significant capacity can be reached at reasonable conditionsEagles didn't pull this kind of shit on us back when we had prayer in our schools:

The award is based on which company has the worst impacts globally and Barclays took the honours for its activities that fuel hunger and poverty worldwide.
Barclays is estimated to make up to £340 million a year from speculating in food ‘futures’ markets, making it the biggest UK player in the markets. Massive influxes of speculative money in food markets have been driving sharp price spikes, sending the cost of food soaring beyond the reach of the world’s poorest people.
‘Barclays is gambling with the price of food, and therefore with people’s lives,’ says Amy Horton of the World Development Movement (WDM) which nominated the bank. ‘Speculation benefits a tiny minority in the financial sector, and at the same time fuels food price spikes which force millions of people to go hungry. Governments must take urgent action to curb this reckless practice.’
Barclays won the Public Eye ‘global award’ selected by a panel of judges. After almost 90,000 people voted online, the ‘people’s award’ went to Brazilian company, Vale, for its involvement in the construction of the controversial Belo Monte dam in the Amazon. Forty thousand people are likely to be forced from their land if the dam goes ahead.
Somewhat ironically, Barclays CEO Bob Diamond responded to the Occupy movement in November by telling the BBC that banks must be ‘better citizens’. Rules to curb speculation are being discussed in the European Union, but the UK government is opposing effective legislation.
It is perhaps no coincidence that UK finance ministers met Barclays at least 15 times within the first year of the coalition government.

Tim teaches Brad to behave again while they work on his hot rod collectively, while Jill takes the remainder of the boys to the rally and comes house partially deaf. One other running gag involves Jill’s distaste for his perspective, in that she says “You’re pathetic” each time he goes too far. Sarcastically in a rare instance of performing earnest work, Benny once appeared on an episode of Device Time for “Tim and Al’s Fantasy Kitchen”, the place he was proven slicing meat inside a stroll-in freezer.
It usually is available in 3 or four foot vast rolls and you could measure off how many feet you have to based on layers and how far up the roof you might be applying it. On roofs which are flatter I like to make use of two rows of Ice barrier overlapping a minimum of 1 foot on the rows. On Software Time, “Judy’s Rat” pulls cable via hard to achieve spaces, and bites Tim’s nose.
A modernized cabana with a barbecue grill and bar top, decorated with hanging lanterns and topped with a pergola creates a recent poolside sight.

Maureen “Producer” Binford ( Vicki Lewis )Â – John Binford’s overeager and annoying daughter, she ran Device Time for a quick time during Season 2, continuously reminding Tim in a sing-music voice that she was the Producer of the present, which allowed her to cause many modifications to the show that Tim hated.

Come in, sit down. Let me show you around! Firstly, you may have noticed there was no admission fee. Pretty exciting huh! Also, there is no one selling you something, telling you to prescribe something, or wanting a piece of you in any way, shape or form.
Wander through our virtual stall you’ll see several education ‘maps’ and other articles. These are written by hard working Australian GPs (just like yourself) who see patients every day and get asked surprisingly the same questions that vex us all! Over there in the top right are some links to other supports such as our ‘guide to guidelines’ (a great place to lead our trainees looking for study material) and other links to great websites.
Hear that helicopter? That is Minh Le Cong (@ketaminh) going on a retrieval out to the bush. You may be able to catch up with him when he returns. He often helps out with.

Penny Wilson (@nomadicgp) has just finished a Caesarian with Marlene Pearce assisting (@drmarlenepearce) and I’ll introduce them to you when they have un-scrubbed. They will be giving some gynaecology/O&G talks later if you are interested from bits and bumps ().
I (@Robapark) will be doing some teaching later in a round circle Q&A format later in the ‘bullets’ free zone in the cafe. I think we are talking statins, vitamin D, dizziness and the meaning of life today – surprisingly all based on articles already here! How great does that sound?! That is Tim Leeuwenberg (@kangaroobeach) over there. He has been known to use shock and awe in his presentations – and is always entertaining ().

This dish was ok. The crab cakes had such a strong Old Bay flavor that they didn’t quite work in a benedict. It ultimately tasted like a crab cake on top of an English muffin with an egg and hollandaise sauce thrown in – not very harmonious.

How I Got Started
In the fall of 2011 my fiancé (now wife) and I purchased our first house. It was a fixer upper that needed some work, but my realtor at the time told me I still needed to get a home inspection. The only thing I knew about home inspectors was what I had seen from Mike Holmes on TV. I spent about 3 hours with him going over the house and that’s when the seed was planted.
It took me another couple of years to get into school and get started because working on my house, getting married, and working a full time job didn’t leave much time to study. In the winter of 2014 I laid the groundwork and then in the summer of 2015 I finished my classes for basic and advanced home inspections from the Professional Home Inspectors Institute. I started my business in the fall of 2015 and jumped right in.
I love being able to give someone buying or selling a house the peace of mind of knowing that the biggest investment that they are likely to ever make is a good one. I never leave an inspection without asking myself if I would be happy with how thorough the inspection was. This has truly become my dream job..

LIONEL Messi says Argentina have "one little step left" to climb against Germany in the World Cup final on Monday when he has a chance to emulate Diego Maradona.
If Messi can match Maradona and lead Argentina to World Cup glory this will be remembered as his tournament.
Success will be even sweeter with the title will come in arch-rival Brazil's backyard.
Thursday's 4-2 semi-final penalty shoot-out win over the Netherlands kept Messi on track to emulate the Maradona-inspired 1986 title win.
After the game the Barcelona legend was unable to celebrate with his team-mates in the dressing room as he was dragged away for a doping test by FIFA then marshalled out of the stadium without talking to the waiting media., captain of the Argentina teams that won the World Cup in Mexico in 1986 and were beaten by West Germany in the final four years later in Italy.
Messi won his 92nd cap for his country against the Dutch, passing Maradona's total number of appearances and moving into sixth place in his country's all-time list.
Maradona played in four World Cups and won one.
Now Messi, at the age of 27, is presented with the chance to equal his predecessor in what is his third World Cup.
The Barcelona player was pivotal in taking Alejandro Sabella's side to this stage with his efforts in their wins over Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria.
In the last 16, penalties loomed against Switzerland when his jinking run late in extra time set up the winning goal for Angel di Maria and helped to set up Gonzalo Higuain's quarter-final clincher against Belgium. - AFPBradley, D.

Journal of Low Temperature Physics, 135 (5-6). pp. 385-397. ISSN 0022-2291Full text not available from this repository.
Abstract
Superfluid He-3 has a hierarchy of properties, each manifest as a 'superfluid'. There is the mass superfluid, the spin superfluid and there should also be an orbital superfluid. These three 'super' fluids respond differently to the interpenetrating normal fluid and demand different temperature ranges to be studied fully. We discuss here the importance of work at very low temperatures, how we can cool to the lowest temperatures and finally present a selection of low temperature experiments which illustrate aspects of multiphase nature of the superfluid and of the three 'superfluids' mentioned above.A Texas appeals court ruled a state court action, which challenges a 2012 rule blocking Planned Parenthood from participating in the state-run Texas Women’s Health Program, can proceed.

As part of its semi-annual sale, Sarah Flint is offering its Duchess-approved Natalie Flat for 30% off, giving shoppers a savings of more than $100.
Made of Italian leather, the slip-on flats boast a pointed toe silhouette and delicate bow detail. While the exact colorway Meghan wore isn’t on sale, a rich merlot-colored version of the pair has been discounted, as well as a shimmering gold style.
Markle, who’s been a fan of the brand since 2014, has been wearing these chic flats since before she became a royal. The former “Suits” star wore the style in brown with skinny jeans and a white button-down shirt to a 2017 Invictus Games event in Toronto, Canada with Prince Harry. Fans liked the look so much that Sarah Flint had a 25,000-person waitlist for these shoes at one point — and they’ve sold out and been restocked many times in the past few years.
Given their history, these shoes are destined to sell out fast. Head to SarahFlint.com/sale to nab your pair before it’s too late, and check out some of the Duchess’ other go-to shoe styles from the brand, including the comfortable Jay Pump and strappy Grear sandals.

Sarah Flint Reveals What It Really Means When Meghan Markle Wears Her ShoesUnusually loud report from the City’s Ethics Commission condemns ethical vagueness and inadequate reporting measures regarding millions of dollars in tickets and other perks offered to city services and distributed to employees, politicians and their guests .
The report, which was quietly released on September 29, describes the problematic nature of the $ 1.2 million in tickets disseminated by city departments since 2009. In some cases, third-party vendors are in fact contractually binding. mandated providing the city with plenty of free tickets – a longstanding tradition in San Francisco, the Ethics Report bluntly described as “a culture of expectation that is the basis of a pay-to-play system.”
Similarly, the War Memorial Board of Trustees – which oversees the auditorium building and is populated by some of the city’s wealthiest elites – has received more than $ 516,000 in free performance tickets since 2012.
“Like Rec and Park, War Memorial has built the flow of free tickets into their rental agreements with tenants,” the report read. Its current pact with the San Francisco Opera Association “requires the Opera to provide 10 tickets for each performance to the department for the use of War Memorial administrators.” The agreement further specifies the exact seats that must be provided for the use of directors.
At the heart of this ethics report is an examination of ways to circumvent the city’s “narrow source rule”. This policy prevents city officials or employees from directly accepting gifts from an individual or group who has a contract with their department or who has recently sought to influence them. But this rule can be circumvented by presenting tickets or money for a party to a department, which is then broadcast to its recipients – and inducing much the same result.
Understandably, former Public Works boss and accused federal criminal Mohammed Nuru looked to this report as Banquo’s ghost. His arrest in January 2020 sparked a number of inward-looking city acts, including this most recent report.
Neither he nor his Public Works employees could legally have taken gifts and largesse from Recology. But, as municipal and federal legal affairs were revived, this rule was evaded by Recology by funneling money through the department and into nonprofits that Nuru used to fund lavish parties for employees, politicians and their guests.
Similarly, War Memorial administrators could not accept gifts – in this case valued at thousands of dollars – from the San Francisco Opera Association. But they can accept free tickets (contractually mandated), distributed by a third party. But the central problem remains: the report notes that the same trustee who initiated the 2015 rental agreement with the Opera received $ 5,360 in opera tickets in the following calendar year.
“This example illustrates the factors that can give rise to an appearance of undue influence and payment to play when restricted sources provide free event tickets to City officials through a City service.” , notes the report. “These concerns are what the narrow source rule was created to prevent.”
The supervisory board also oversees the rental rates for the war memorial. And former supervisor Norman Yee received $ 1,000 in free tickets, while current supervisor Catherine Stefani received four tickets valued at $ 762.
It’s clear, however, that the king of ticketing is the Parks and Recreation department, much of which comes from the Outside Lands festival. The ministry said it distributed 1,855 Outside Lands tickets between 2015 and 2019 alone – valued at $ 431,000.
It’s problematic: the promoter of Outside Lands, Another Planet Entertainment, would be considered a small donor. But another planet is in fact obligatory to provide these tickets as part of its agreement with Rec and Park. “If anything,” the report sums up, “requiring free tickets that are provided for the personal use of City officials in a City contract only reinforces the tickets and the benefits they offer are a cost to do business for City entrepreneurs. “
Of the 1,855 off-land tickets requested and received by Rec and Park, 1,442 (78%) were reported as intended for City officials, and 1,202 (65%) were reported for Rec and Park officials. .
Another Planet, incidentally, has a contract with the city’s real estate division for the exclusive use of the Bill Graham municipal auditorium. The report curtly notes that Real Estate has not put language in its contracts to extract free tickets to shows.
In addition to tickets, the report highlights the problematic use of outside funds for city parties. These include:
* A June 2019 planning department party funded in part by real estate developers Tishman Speyer, One Vassar and Associate Capital and law firms Rueben, Junius, & Rose, J. Abrams Law PC and Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher LLP. Ground Floor Public Affairs and the Residential Builders Association also participated. Lobbyists Rueben, Junius and Rose said they lobbied seven high-level planning staff on the day of the party – and it was not determined whether that lobbying took place at the party. himself.
* Four parties at San Francisco International Airport marking the opening of the new Harvey Milk International Terminal were funded with more than $ 1 million in private donations. “Most of this funding came from entities that would likely be restricted sources for airport officials,” the report notes. These included Hensel Phelps Construction, which donated $ 99,000 and has a $ 1.1 billion construction contract with SFO.
* In December 2019, the Entertainment Commission hosted a party where 86% of the event’s subscription funds were provided by entities with licenses granted by the Entertainment Commission.
* The mayor’s office in 2019 hosted a holiday party in which the source of $ 3,800 in funds could not be explained. The ethics report directly compares the behavior of the mayor’s office to Nuru: “This arrangement is similar to DPW parties in that a non-municipal organization funded a free vacation party for city officials using money collected from undisclosed private sources. In the case of DPW, the Justice Department found that the use of nonprofit intermediaries was a deliberate attempt to cover up the true source of the funds (which was Recology) and accused several people of money laundering. In the case of the Mayor’s Day and the nonprofit organization that paid for it, neither the Mayor’s office website nor the nonprofit revealed to the public who was the source of the funding or why the source has not been identified.
The Ethics Commission suggests, among many other remedies, that the rules be tightened and that the balkanized method of managing and tracking gifts be centralized.miniature clothing project
These are from the pajamas my grandfather was wearing when he died in 1993. They are among the first of the garments that I miniaturized. These were an ode to him. Some special way for me to thank him for teaching me to love art and to love myself. I kept these pajamas under my bed for a long time not knowing what to do with them but knowing I didn't want to discard them either. I decided I needed to do an art project of some sort with them. This project is the manifestation of this idea.

The Sedalia City Council met on Monday, July 15, for a regular pre-council and council meeting where they approved several bids and ordinances, including bids for the demolition of structures at four locations throughout the City of Sedalia.
The council awarded bids for demolition of structures at 175 Summer Avenue, 1220 S. Lamine, 415 S. Massachusetts and 411 S. New York, to Schultz Wrecking Service and Poort Excavating.
The city awarded the bids for the Summer, Lamine and Massachusetts locations to Schultz Wrecking Service. The council approved the bid for 175 Summer Avenue for $3,400, 1220 S. Lamine for a total of $3,200 and the 415 S. Massachusetts location came in at $4,200. The total of all bids awarded to Schultz came in at $10,800.
The council awarded the bid for the demolition of the 411 S. New York location to Poort Excavating in the amount of $3,800. The total amount for demolition of all structures came in at $14,600.
These property demolitions were anticipated by city staff, and are within the scope of the demolition budget for the year.
The council also approved a bid from Vulcan signs of Foley, Alabama in the amount of $7,866.70 for the City Garage sign materials. This was the second lowest bid and was recommended by staff, because the City of Sedalia has worked with them in the past. The lowest bid only came in at $147.39 lower.
In other council news, the Sedalia City Council passed an ordinance which accepted an agreement between the city and Olsson Associates for engineering services. Since approved, Olsson Associates will provide a comprehensive inspection of the Grand Avenue vehicular bridge for a sum fee of $7,500.
The inspection will attempt to verify the existing bridge weight limit rating of 15 tons. According to information from the city, this inspection is a follow-up to a less comprehensive inspection by the state.
The council attempted closing a portion of Clarendon Road temporarily during the Missouri State Fair.
The road would have been closed to through traffic from 8 a.m. until 9 p.m. daily during the Missouri State Fair. The proposed ordinance did not pass through the council vote.
The council did however approve and accept an agreement an Aviation Project Consultant Supplemental Agreement between the City of Sedalia and H.W. Lochner, Inc., for the final design and bidding services associated with rehabilitation of runway 18-36 at the Sedalia Regional Airport.
This is a supplemental agreement to a 2012 extension of the original agreement that the council approved back in 2010. The original agreement was for the utilization of Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission state block grant funds for the runway improvements.
The supplemental agreement is not to exceed $193,675. Ninety-five percent of that figure will be covered by grant dollars.Date: 18 Mar 1995 14:09:31 -0500

Hello there!
Here's one way to figure out how long the radius in
question is: let's say we have an equilateral triangle,
and each side has length s. Then find the center of the
triangle. You can do this by drawing the three altitudes,
or the three medians; in this case, they're all the same
lines. Then draw the segment that starts at the center
of the triangle and ends at the midpoint of one of the
sides. This is the radius of the inscribed circle.
To find out how long it is, notice the following: Let's
say our triangle has vertices X, Y, Z, and let's call the
center of the triangle C, and the midpoint of one of the
sides M. Then look at triangle XCM. Since each angle
in an equilateral triangle is 60 degrees, how big is angle
MXC? So, is this a special kind of triangle (Hint: yes!!)?
So, if it has its longer leg with length s/2, you can use
that information to find the length of its shorter leg.
Let us know if you're still stuck!

A woman (Melissa McCarthy) who lost her child struggles with her job, anger, sadness and an aggressive bird in her garden, as she also obsesses over her husband (Chris O’Dowd) who is confined to a psychiatric clinic. With unexpected help from a psychiatrist-turned-veterinarian (Kevin Kline) and the persistent bird, she searches for answers. Also with Timothy Olyphant, Rosalind Chao, Kimberly Quinn, Daveed Diggs and Loretta Devine. Directed by Theodore Melfi. [Running Time: 1:42]
The Starling SEX/NUDITY 1
– A man and a woman hug and another man and a woman embrace briefly. A man kisses the forehead of a woman and later the couple embrace and kiss for several seconds. In a flashback, a man lays his hand on a woman’s pregnant belly.
► A woman embroiders a light-switch cover with the outline of a nude man, where the light switch fills an opening in the abdomen and groin. A dog thrusts against the leg of a woman, startling her.
The Starling VIOLENCE/GORE 4
– A small bird dive-bombs a woman in several scenes, knocking her down and wounding her over the eye in one scene (we see blood flow), and over the other eye in another scene (we see some more blood) and a doctor says that she needs stitches in one scene (we see only the bandage being applied over the wound). A woman wears a football helmet in several scenes and is repeatedly knocked down by a bird. A woman climbs a ladder while wearing a helmet and a bird knocks her several feet to the ground, and she lands face up; she briefly hallucinates that her husband is standing over her and the scene cuts to the woman in a recliner with large bags of frozen food on both sides of her neck, thighs, and knees. A woman and her husband wear helmets as they run into a garden and a bird and its mate dive-bomb them both, without injury. A large crow chases a small bird in the sky for several seconds and does not catch it.
► A woman buys bird poison and puts it into a bird feeder; she comes home to find a large dead crow lying in the yard, she cries, bundles the bird in a towel and buries it. A woman and a man sit in lawn chairs near a garden and a small bird dive bombs them both, knocking them out of the chairs; the woman hits the bird with a thrown rock and the bird drops to the ground, unmoving and the woman shouts and sobs, and takes the bird to a veterinarian who does surgery off -screen and the bird recovers and is released. We hear that a woman’s baby died of SIDS and she walks into the nursery looking sad, moves all the furniture and baby clothing out to the side of the road, returns to the nursery and frantically rubs out the marks on the carpet where the crib had been. A woman has a flashback when her husband had insomnia and when she went to find him, he was in the garage with the car running; we hear that the man tried to commit suicide.
► A woman loses control of her car in the rain, skidding and spinning 360 degrees to stop in a lane, stalled; two other drivers honk at her and drive on.
► A man persuades other male patients to portray animals with him on family day, and frightens a little girl who runs away; a woman asks him to return inside the clinic and he yells, he punches a staff member, and two orderlies grab him, ending the scene. A woman in a group therapy discussion begins yelling loudly, stands up and is subdued by orderlies. A woman cries loudly in a psychiatric hospital. A woman in a pottery session smashes her clay pot on the pottery wheel and another woman makes a pile of feces like an emoji on her wheel. A woman argues loudly with a man in his office, curses at him, breaks a figurine, belittles him and leaves. A woman and her husband in a clinic argue and he stalks away. A woman is told that her husband has requested no visitors indefinitely and becomes angry, shouting at a staff member; she leaves for the parking lot, entering and exiting her car several times while yelling loudly at the building; her husband watches from a window and he looks sad. A man is very sarcastic and rude to a psychiatrist. A store manager argues with his assistant in a few scenes, belittling her and telling her to “get with it.” A woman working in a store absentmindedly marks two aisles of products at 5-cents each, causing men and women to shout and grab many items as the manager calls out that the pricing is an error; the manager suspends the woman for the rest of the day. A man calls his wife and says nothing, and his wife talks about daily life until he hangs up. A man calls his wife and says nothing, and she raises her voice and sobs as she berates him and hangs up, after which he laughs and sobs. A man says that he has been depressed for many years since his 20s, gave up on therapy and medication, and feeling guilty for the death of his baby, he is punishing himself. A man says that he both hates and loves his wife because she will not give up.
► A woman working in a store pulls chewing gum out of her mouth into a very long string and a man berates her. A man on a TV show says his wife died and religion helped him overcome sadness. A man says that Mozart had a funeral for his pet starling, but had refused to attend his own father’s funeral the week before. A man says that a woman has a glass eye because of a bird attack. A man in a vet clinic cries loudly over his sick cat that has indigestion. A young boy comes into a vet clinic with his small dog, and the vet says it may have to be euthanized; the boy says his mom cannot handle the event and he can be there as he kisses the animal goodbye, but we later see him and his mom smiling because the dog is fine. An angry woman chops up her dying garden, but stops and later replants it. A brief rainstorm includes thunder and lightning. A woman buys a large owl figurine to use as a scarecrow for her yard, but a small bird sits on it and defecates.
The Starling LANGUAGE 5

The Starling SUBSTANCE USE
– A man sucks on a vaping device without making smoke and a woman sarcastically asks if he will also use meth next week, a man pretends to swallow pills but hides them in his mouth and places them in a tissue later in several scenes, a woman receives medication for an injured bird and gives it a few drops frequently and tastes the medication herself and grimaces, and a man has two large tissues full of capsules and tablets hidden in two shoes. A man asks for vodka and gin from his assistant before doing surgery on a bird (we do not see the alcohol).

You and your family are could be forced to leave and your belongings damaged or destroyed. Preventing or reducing the risk of water damage in your home is part of being a responsible homeowner. As water damage restoration professionals, we see the results of water damage everyday from appliance failures, mechanical mishaps, and sometimes even human error. While there are some things out of your control, there are things you can do to prevent water damage from happening. We’ve put together some tips for you.
Learn How to Turn off the Water
Every adult in the household should know how to turn off the main water valve in your home. Should water damage happen in your home, this is your first step towards minimizing the damage and stopping the flow of water.
Be Vigilant with Plumbing and Mechanical System Maintenance
Burst water heaters and broken pipes cause quick, amounts of water that can flood your home in a matter of minutes.
Arrange to have a bi-annual plumbing and HVAC maintenance service plan with your plumbing and hvac contractor. During this appointment, the heating and cooling systems of your home will be inspected and serviced.
Keep your Appliances Well Maintained
Water damage from leaking dishwasher, refrigerator lines, and washing machines can be either slow or sudden and dramatic. The amount of water generated from these appliances can flood your entire home rapidly and water travels downward affecting the floors beneath them. During everyday use, make it a habit to look around and check connections, water lines, and pipes. Be aware of unusual noises and follow up on leaks asap. See something? Call your plumbing contractor right away.
Away on Vacation
Picture water flowing from a broken pipe, failed appliance, or overflowed toilet. Now imagine that water continuing to flood your home for many days like at the end of the classic movie Home Alone. Make it a habit to turn off the main water supply before leaving for vacation. You’ll be glad you did!
If your time away is during cold weather, be sure to leave the heat on low so you don’t have frozen pipes. Arrange for someone to check on your home regularly while you are away to make sure things are okay.
Is Your Sump Pump Working?
Water from heavy rains or snowmelt can flood your basement. Your basement sump pump’s job is to protect your basement and belongings from water coming into the home. Your sump pump is another mechanical system that is capable of malfunctioning and this is not typically covered by insurance without a sump pump failure rider on your policy. Check your sump pump’s operation annually to be certain it’s in good working order.

NBNK Investments, a listed “cash box" set up to buy bank assets, has been examining NAB’s Clydesdale and Yorkshire branch networks ahead of any offer.
Sources in the UK told The Australian Financial Review NBNK stood ready to move on the business if NAB agreed to sell.
NAB did not comment yesterday, but held talks with NBNK in relation to the same assets last year.
With economic conditions in Britain looking grim, NAB chief executive
The UK sources said NBNK wanted NAB to fast-track a sale.
“NBNK is certainly looking at the assets and is very interested in them," a source said. “If there was a possibility of buying them, they would be very interested in them."
NBNK is the brainchild of former Lloyds of London chairman Lord Peter Levene and Garry Hoffman, the former head of nationalised British bank Northern Rock. The group was set up with the goal of establishing a new retail bank in the UK by mopping up assets discarded by other institutions in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
It listed on the London Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market in August 2010, raising £50 million, which it vowed to return to shareholders if it could not find suitable acquisitions. With the company’s future hinging on a shareholder vote in a few months, NBNK is hungry for a deal after it lost out to The Co-operative Group in a bid for 632 branches put up for sale by Lloyds Banking Group in December. An attempt to buy 75 branches from Northern Rock was also gazumped by Virgin Money.
NAB held talks about selling its UK operations into a joint venture with NBNK last September, but the two could not agree on price. NBNK’s shares were halted from trading at the time and remain suspended.
NAB has been reluctant to sell out of the UK at the bottom of the market, but has come under growing pressure from investors to offload the underperforming business. In February, signalling a change in attitude, Mr Clyne said maintaining the status quo in Britain was no longer an option because the “UK economy is likely to experience a much longer period of subdued growth".
NAB’s strategic review, which is set to be completed by May, is focusing on a restructure of the UK business, but the bank has said it will consider all options and many analysts believe this could include selling out.
NAB’s woes in the UK continued this week when many Clydesdale and Yorkshire customers were unable to use their debit cards because of a computer glitch.
In January, NAB injected £400 million into the UK to shore up the business’s capital base and another £130 million to prop up the pension scheme for its British employees. The bank’s bad debts rose from $391 million at the end of September 2011 to $545 million at the end of December, largely because of problems in the UK.
Deustche Bank analyst James Freeman said a “clean sale" of its UK assets would be one of the best options for NAB. He said NAB would have to settle for a discounted sale price of around 0.8 times the value of its UK assets, which would net the bank about £2.6 billion.

David Paterson, Mike Bloomberg and Joe Biden are partying down with Al Sharpton this week at a three-day gala sponsored by the Rev's National Action Network -- the same organization that the Federal Election Commission found illegally subsidized his 2004 presidential campaign committee.
In addition to the federal and state tax liens on Sharpton, the FEC has imposed another half million dollars in penalties on him. His campaign was already forced by the FEC to repay another $100,000 in matching funds he improperly took from the commission.
The FEC found that campaign, NAN and funds from Sharpton companies like Rev-Als Production Inc. were so commingled that the Sharpton campaign "received $735,314 in possible prohibited contributions," almost $400,000 of it from NAN. Sharpton spent much of this at luxury hotels at up to $4000 a night, ostensible-mistress-in-tow, turning his presidential gambit into a whirlwind countrywide tour with the then executive director of NAN. The director, who has since departed and is quoted in the FEC report, wound up with a Mercedes, a Caddy, a $7000 Rolex, mink coats, David Yurman jewels and a Trump apartment. The largess of 2004 might be some indication of how Sharpton and the current NAN gang will spend the pot of gold he collects at this event.
You would think the press would be all over a scandal like the so-called conference taking place at the Sheraton New York. And they are: many of them are sitting on media panels and joining in the celebration of the so-called civil rights activist who's been living at the Helmsley Carlton on Madison Avenue for years.
Daily News owner Mort Zuckerman is moderating one panel, and media giants like ABC's Robin Roberts and Larry King are part of the hoopla. Even real journalists like the News' Errol Louis are lending legitimacy to this fraud.
Another News columnist, Juan Gonzalez, examined this week the peculiar alliance between Sharpton and NYC Schools Chancellor Joel Klein, revealing a half-million-dollar donation to NAN from a hedge fund tied to a former chancellor. The big check was funneled through a pro-Bloomberg nonprofit. Klein and a top aide will appear on Sharpton panels so skewed in favor of the Bloomberg school reforms that minority critics have just about been locked out.
The black mayoral candidate and longtime Sharpton friend, Comptroller Bill Thompson, doesn't even appear on the agenda. Bloomberg's apparent champion for the Independence Party line, old Sharpton ally Lenora Fulani, is also a panelist.
Sharpton screamed politics when the IRS and federal prosecutors went after him over years of tax dodges, invoking Martin Luther King, Jr. and claiming that "every major civil rights leader has had to face this kind of harassment." Of course, he tried to put it all on the Bush White House, citing the "clear political motivation of the Justice Department and the IRS under this administration." Maybe he'll also blame the $884,669 state tax lien against him on the political targeting of his longtime friend Paterson, who was governor when the state moved against him in 2008.

ReviewsTimothy Bloom: ‘Possibilities’ Video Brings Keys to Desert
The last time Timothy Bloom debuted a music video he was naked, bare backside and all. ‘Til the End of Time,’ which featured the lovely V. Bozeman sans clothing, was definitely a conversation starter earlier this year. Now, the crooner, who’s signed to a joint deal with famed producers Timbaland and Polow da Don on their respective labels Mosley Music and Zone 4, showcases a set of new visuals with ‘Possibilities,’ a track off his ‘The Budding Rose EP.’
In the clip, directed by Dove Shore, Bloom keeps himself covered and invites viewers to embrace his piano-playing abilities, which he displays in a barren desert. The Texas-born coos, “I had a conversation with myself/ Going back and forth, picking the pieces apart/ Lining them one by one/ Has made me realize that what’s inside me is breaking me down/ I’m not the man that I used to know.”
Watch Timothy Bloom’s ‘Possibilities’
Bloom, a songwriter with credits that include penning tracks for Ne-Yo and Chris Brown, explains that the track is a number about maturity. “‘Possibilities’ is about a boy becoming a man,” he shares. “Warning before destruction, working on me to become a better me.”
Eight months have passed since his nude video made the rounds and since then, the singer has been traveling the country, performing and making his brand known in the marketplace. As for what’s in store with future projects, don’t be surprised to see Bloom snag a red-haired collaborator on his wish list. “I would like to work with Florence and the Machine,” he admits. “Why? Because she’s hot!”
‘The Budding Rose EP,’ which features four tracks, is available now.We awoke at 0700 for breakfast, and were joined by Rao, who arrived at 0300. Rao has a very commanding, yet soft-spoken presence, quite unlike his son Mahdu, and I enjoyed briefly talking with him over a traditional South Indian breakfast, which was wonderful. We had to hurry off to meet the group of homestayers for a trip to a 1200-year old temple in Mahabalipuram (also referred to as Mamallapuram), but Rao promised to meet us back at the house after he worked for awhile.
The Shore Temple, the last remaining of seven temples located on the beach at Mahabalipuram, was now behind a fence to protect it. After walking past a row of sidewalk vendors to get to the beach we came out upon the sand, with a few ‘kiddie’ rides which Reade, Tate, and several college students took advantage of. Nearby was the biggest bas relief in the world, Arjuna’s Penance, which was carved into a large rock wall, adjacent to which is a large boulder perched on a downsloping slab of rock (lots of fun pics to be had there, a la the wonderful children’s book ‘Borreguita’). We were then taken to some additional vendors where Reade and Tate continued to hone their bartering skills, happy that they got some cheap stuff, but still left unsure of the quality of ‘the deal’. They are now getting pretty good at it; feigning disinterest when necessary, insisting that they ‘only have 200 rupees left’ when negotiating the price down, never looking to Dad to kick in the last 50 rupees necessary to close a deal on someone else’s terms. It’s really fun to watch them develop some ‘street sense’ borne of different cultures, of lands 10,000 miles from their home. I can’t wait for their first attempt at bartering for something back in Golden! ;)
As we continued back toward Chennai, we stopped at a crocodile preserve (they are weird animals), and saw some snake handlers collect venom from one poisonous snake, which is subsequently sold to for conversion into venom anti-serum. I’ll tell you, if you’ve never seen a real Cobra stand up to nearly 18” and hiss at you (or a handler, in this case), it’s truly frightening on a primal level. They are universally scary little creatures, right to the core.
Rao arrived home shortly after we did, and we chatted prior to leaving for a dinner hosted at one of the Rotarian’s homes, a short drive away. Every year Haji adorns his house with various culturally-inspired ‘scenes’. The first room had small dolls, porcelain figures and little ‘story’ figurines, all depicting gods and fables and stories important to the Hindu religion. In another room was a puppet show depicting different ‘now and then’ facets of Indian life, the small puppet-dolls of which were made entirely by Haji and his family, and being operated by a nameless man beneath a table to the recording explaining it all (not in English). Within another room was constructed a model of a holy place in the Himalayas, right up to the ceiling of the room, which had little stars, a sunset over the mountains, beneath which you could enter a tunnel and see 12 different facets of the Hindu religion. Amazing undertaking.
We were then led to the rooftop deck, where a huge buffet was laid out for the 50-ish people that attended. Wonderful food, great people to talk to, some of which ended up singing songs in a circle after eating. They tried to get the college students to sing some songs, but they collectively could come up with little, ending up singing some nursery rhyme-ish song I cannot now remember. As Mahdu had already taken Malathy home, I could tell it was getting late for Rao, and we departed. The boys immediately went to bed, and Rao and I retreated to the basement bar for a beer, the local Kingfisher lager I’d wanted to try. We talked for nearly two hours about many things; the western economic recession, the Indian economy which is increasing by a stunning 10% per year, home life, etc. Rao is an amazing man, very spiritual, getting up at 0400 every morning for an hour of yoga/meditation (not western yoga), followed by an hour walk in the park. Having moved to Chennai from a rural village, Rao started with virtually nothing, and contends that being non-native and ‘not privileged’ allowed (forced upon?) him the drive to excel in a way that many have not. India is a very large country with many different languages that are in few ways similar to one another, and his moving to Chennai was as uprooting as moving from the US to, say, Spain or Italy.
We talked about the obvious parallels of Americans getting complacent, with the obvious future effects on our economy if we fail to consider the ramifications of our refusal to embrace globalization. In my opinion, embracing globalization and responding to it would require solutions whose effects lie 10 or 20 years down the road, and said solutions require immediate action on our part, actions that the majority of politicians flatly refuse to consider, instead attending to the superfluous details of the next year or two down the road. Like India dealing with mounting population problems in the poorer northern sections of the country, we in the US are at a crossroads where something can still be done about our future economic growth, but if our government remains hampered by rich people bickering about the narcissistic woes of the upper class running the country, we stand to lose a lot. If you don’t believe this, you need to see what’s happening in what were once referred to as ‘third world countries’, a term now typically abandoned for more descriptive terms like ‘underdeveloped’ and ‘developing’.

Look at the evidence that <b>MEC has become an undemocratic organization controlled by its entrenched board:</b><br /><br /><a href="">In 2012</a>, the board persuaded unsuspecting MEC members to give it the power to disqualify any member from running in board elections. Supposedly this was to improve the quality of candidates, but that excuse can easily be used to eliminate candidates that challenge the board.<br /><br /><a href="">In 2013</a>, the board used that power to prevent former MEC board member Anders Ourom from running. Anders has often spoken up in past MEC AGMs. It's notable that in 2015, when Anders did <i>not</i> put his name forward to run, board experience is now considered <a href="" target="_blank">sufficient to qualify</a>: "...the minimum qualifications (experience sitting on a board or ...)".<br /><br /><a href="">In 2014</a>, 27 MEC members wanted to run in the board election. <a href="">The board blocked 2 of them</a>, and the board chair claimed that this power <i>increased</i> the board's accountability to members (on page 2 of <a href="">the minutes</a>).<br /><br /><i><b>This year, 23 MEC members wanted to run, and <a href="">the board blocked 7 of them</a>.</b></i><br /><br />As the notoriously corrupt <a href="">Boss Tweed</a> used to say: <b>“I don't care who does the electing, so long as I get to do the nominating.”</b><br /><br />With such a sanitized ballot, it's no wonder that MEC's voter turnout remains below 1/10 of 1%. Russell Brand was right on target in <a href="" target="_blank">this video</a>: “It's not that I'm not voting out of apathy. I'm not voting out of absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies, treachery, deceit of the political class”.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="" /></a></div><br />Of course, Russell was talking about UK national politics. But don't look to MEC for democratic governance.<br /><br />Mark Latham credit union members could set Board pay by median voteIn April 2013, Coast Capital Savings Credit Union members <a href="">approved by 79.7% majority a special resolution</a> that “...the members of Coast Capital establish the remuneration for the directors of the credit union...” The resolution, put forward by a group of members called <a href="">Compensation Watch</a>, did not specify a process for members to do that.<br /><br />In April 2014, Compensation Watch and the Coast Capital Board put forward two duelling resolutions to specify how Board pay would be determined. However, neither resolution got the 2/3 member voting approval required for implementation. Details are in my previous blog post and in this <i>Victoria Times-Colonist</i> article: "<b><a href="">Credit union votes fail to resolve board pay dispute</a></b>".<br /><br />So I am proposing another way that we Coast Capital members could determine our Board's pay: Vote using a menu of possible total Board pay pay levels, and set pay at the median voted amount. For example, we could submit it to member vote like this:<br /><blockquote><i>How much should we Coast Capital members pay our Board, as annual total compensation?</i><br /><blockquote>□ $200,000<br />□ $300,000<br />□ $400,000<br />□ $500,000<br />□ $600,000<br />□ $700,000<br />□ $800,000</blockquote></blockquote>I've fleshed out the proposal, with an example, in <a href="">this 3-page pdf</a>.<br /><br /.<br /><br />Mark Latham vote results: Board oligarchy maintains its powerAt the Coast Capital Savings Credit Union Annual General Meeting on Wednesday April 30, results were announced for the member votes in the director election and on the 8 special resolutions. Unfortunately, none of the democratic reform candidates were elected, and the 4 member resolutions did not get the 2/3 vote required. The Board used its control of information sent to members, to maintain its grip on power for a while longer. On the plus side, the Board's 4 undemocratic resolutions also failed to get 2/3 voting approval.

You can see what it's all about in <a href="">my March 16 blog post</a>.<br /><br /><b>See you there!</b><br /><br />Mark Latham pretends to be a #democracy -- AGM report<b><a href="">Mountain Equipment Cooperative</a></b> announced its director election results at the 2014 Annual General Meeting yesterday (April 24). While claiming to be improving the election process, the incumbent board now exercises great control over who gets elected. Not only do they put their candidate recommendations on the ballot, but they also <i>prevent some candidates from being on the ballot at all</i>.<br /><br />For this year's election to fill 4 director seats, the board <b>recommended these 8 candidates</b>:<br /><blockquote>Ellen Pekeles<br />Dale Mills<br />Gord Howe<br />Doug Brownridge<br />Daniel Blanche<br />Tamara Paton<br />Jonathan Gallo<br />Bill Gibson</blockquote>They also allowed onto the ballot these 6 candidates, whom they <b>did not recommend</b>:<br /><blockquote>Jake Burlet<br />Pat Maher<br />Stephanie Bird<br />Bob Brent<br />Alex Beaskow<br />Tom Webb</blockquote>These 4 were announced at the AGM as having been <b>elected</b>:<br /><blockquote>Ellen Pekeles<br />Tamara Paton<br />Jonathan Gallo<br />Daniel Blanche</blockquote>As you can see, only "recommended" candidates were elected. I've <a href="">documented elsewhere</a> how boards can and do use on-ballot recommendations to ensure that the only candidates who get elected are those that do not challenge the incumbent board. This reduces the board's accountability to members, which opens the door to corruption.<br /><br />The board chair claimed at the AGM that these recent election rule changes are "good governance" recommended by "experts". The "expert" he cited is often hired and paid by boards, and often gives advice to increase boards' power. I emphasized the obvious self-serving bias in a <a href="">letter to FICOM</a>, the regulator for B.C. credit unions: It is natural for directors and their payees to say: "To improve governance, we should give more power to directors."<br /><br />But the MEC board has gone much further than the credit unions I wrote to FICOM about. <a href="">As we saw last year</a>, they used their new power to prevent a highly qualified candidate from even getting onto the ballot. So we only get to choose among candidates who don't rock their boat.<br /><br />I thank Melissa Fong for sharing this quote from <a href="">Noam Chomsky</a> in a <a href="">recent tweet</a>:<br /><blockquote><b>"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum."</b></blockquote>One of the <a href="">fundamental principles of co-ops</a> is: "Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members". Which raises the question:<br /><blockquote><b>Is MEC a co-op?</b></blockquote><br />Mark Latham for Member #Democracy @Coast_Capital Credit Union<b>SUMMARY: [<a href="">中文</a></b>]<br /><br />To control excess director pay and restore member democracy at Coast Capital Savings Credit Union, I recommend voting:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b><span style="color: #990000;">AGAINST the Board's resolutions (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4)</span></b><br />and<br /><span style="color: #38761d;"><b>FOR the member resolutions (numbered 5, 6, 7, 8)</b></span></blockquote>(<a href="">Resolutions booklet here</a>.) In the director election I recommend voting for three candidates <i>not</i> recommended by the Board. I'm voting for <b><a href="">Lisa Barrett</a>, <a href="">Bruce Batchelor</a> and <a href="">John Fryer</a></b>.<br /><br /><b>Vote now through April 8:</b> You can fill in the paper ballot and submit it at any branch. Or vote online at <a href="">coastcapitalsavings.com</a>: log in, then click <b>Online Voting</b> tab at lower left. (Joint account members and business members can't vote online, so must use the paper ballots.)<br /><br /><b>Please spread the word</b> to your friends who may be among Coast Capital's 500,000 members in southwestern British Columbia.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="" /></a></div><b>REASONS:</b><br /><br />In 2007, the Board persuaded members to let the Board set its own pay based on a pay "philosophy" document. By 2011, the Board had raised its pay to more than double that of Vancity Credit Union's Board -- <a href="">details here</a>. (Vancity is similar to Coast Capital in size and location. Both have about 500,000 members.)<br /><br />Members were unaware of this dramatic rise in director pay, until in 2013 two members created the <a href="">Coast Capital Compensation Watch</a> website, and gathered over 400 member signatures to put this resolution on the ballot:<br /><blockquote>"Be it resolved that, the members of Coast Capital Savings Credit Union establish the remuneration for the Directors of the credit union and that the amount paid to each Director is published in the Annual Report."</blockquote>The Board put the member resolution and its supporting statement on pages 10 and 11 of <a href="">this 12-page booklet</a>, most of which was designed to persuade members to vote against the resolution. Examples of the Board's spin:<br /><blockquote><b>Page 5:</b> <i><span style="color: #990000;">"...you are being asked to vote on a special resolution brought forward by a member named Phil Embley..."</span></i><br />-- No mention of the over 400 members who signed petitions in support of bringing the resolution to members' vote.<br /><br /><b>Page 5:</b> <span style="color: #990000;"><i>"...every three years the Board Governance Committee works with an independent external compensation consultant who reviews director compensation..."</i></span><br />-- Of course, the "independent" consultant is selected by the Board.<br /><br /><b>Page 8:</b> <i><span style="color: #990000;">"Coast Capital advises our members that some of the facts alleged in the [resolution's supporting] statement are inaccurate and misleading."</span></i><br />-- They gave no specific backup to this accusation, in spite of the many pages of their arguments in the booklet where they could have done so.<br /><br /><b>Page 9:</b> <span style="color: #990000;"><i>"Vote “Against” if you agree with the 2007 member-approved approach to establishing director compensation"</i></span></blockquote>Fortunately, members were able to see through the Board's spin, and <b><a href="">voted 79.7% in favour of the member resolution</a></b>! Voter turnout in 2013 set a new record of over 23,000 compared with less than 14,000 in 2012 and less than 20,000 in 2011.<br /><br />Recognizing that excess pay indicated a <b>lack of Board accountability</b> <b>prohibit campaigning</b>. Candidates are not allowed to mention their candidacy on the web or by email or in the media, else they will be disqualified -- see <a href="">2014 Campaign Regulations</a> (especially rules 4, 5, 6, 7). For data and analysis of how recommendations on a ballot affect elections, see my <a href="">letter to the B.C. Financial Institutions Commission</a>.<br /><br />So we drafted four resolutions to help re-establish member democracy:<br /><ul><li><b>12-year director term limit.</b></li><b> </b><li><b>Disclose pay of top 3 executives.</b></li><b> </b><li><b>Allow director election campaigning.</b></li><b> </b><li><b>Set specific pay for directors, at Vancity's pay levels.</b></li></ul>Several of us also offered to run for election to the Board, even though in 2014 we would still be subject to the ban on campaigning.<br /><br />As in 2013, we had to gather signatures from at least 300 members to get these resolutions on the ballot. We got over 400 signatures on each. Here's a photo of me helping deliver them on January 24:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="" height="265" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />This year, the Board realized it would take more than spin to sway member votes their way, so they drafted <b>four resolutions with the same headings as our four</b>, and placed them ahead of ours on the ballot. Again, they drafted the member voting information booklet with many pages of their spin. Here's a <a href="">link to the booklet</a> and some rebuttal to their arguments:<br /><br /><b>Page 3:</b> <span style="color: #990000;"><i>"Four individuals are bringing forward disruptive Special Resolutions ... which will threaten our great products and services."</i></span><br />-- All four of <b>our resolutions are already in effect</b> <a href="">the booklet</a>. On the contrary, a <b>lack of accountability</b> can threaten the success of a financial institution, as the 2008 financial crisis showed us, so we should strengthen accountability of Coast Capital's Board to us, the members. Similarly, a <a href="">"<b>democratic deficit</b>" in the UK Co-operative Group</a> was a causal factor in their <a href="">2013 scandal</a>.<br /><br /><b>Page 3:</b> <span style="color: #990000;"><i>"These individuals are aligned with a small special interest group known as Coast Capital Compensation Watch. Their name is misleading. This group is not the voice of your credit union. It represents the views of only a few supporters – not Coast Capital’s 512,000 members."</i></span><br />-- <b><a href="">79.7% of voting members</a></b>.<br /><br /><b>Page 5:</b> <span style="color: #990000;"><i>"The Individual Resolutions are unnecessary and costly."</i></span><br />-- These resolutions were made necessary by the Board's unreasonable pay increases and unfair election rules. Compare 2011 Vancity Board pay of $366,000 to <b>Coast Capital Board pay of $750,000</b> and other comparisons <a href="">here</a>. Also, the resolution proponents have taken care to time their submissions to coincide with director elections, so as not to require a costly extra mailing to all members.<br /><br /><b>Page 7:</b> <span style="color: #990000;"><i>"We're already implementing term limits this year."</i></span><br />-- The Board's Term Limit resolution was drafted <b><i>after</i></b> the members' Term Limit resolution, in response to it, so there's no <i>"already"</i>: <i><span style="color: #990000;">"... only an individual’s years of service as a Director of the Credit Union beginning on or after April 30, 2014 will be counted..."</span> (page 16)</i> So those two directors would have served at least <b>32 years each</b> before their "12 year limit" resolution would term them out!<br /><br /><b>Page 9:</b> <span style="color: #990000;"><i>"We already do this."</i></span><br />-- The members' resolution calls for disclosing the top three executives' pay individually, to the extent permissible by law. Coast Capital is only disclosing the <b>sum</b> of the top <b>nine</b> executives' pay, which <b>hides information</b> by lumping it together, as explained in the supporting statement on page 8 of <a href="">the booklet</a>.<br /><br /><b>Page 11:</b> <span style="color: #990000;"><i>"Keep our elections democratic."</i></span><br />-- It amazes me that anyone could consider it democratic to <b>silence election candidates</b> and control voter information as tightly as this Board now does -- see <a href="">2014 Campaign Regulations</a> (especially rules 4, 5, 6, 7). Even the organizations I criticized in the paper <a href="">We Want Our Co-ops Back</a> do not silence candidates as Coast Capital does.<br /><br /><b>Page 13:</b> <span style="color: #990000;"><i>"Your Board also commissioned an independent member task force to review the credit union’s philosophy that sets Director pay."</i></span><br />-- The Compensation Task Force process was orchestrated by another "independent" consultant chosen by the Board and Board-overseen staff. It concluded by proposing another pay "philosophy" that would <b>continue to give the Board leeway in setting its own pay</b> -- more on that at <a href="">this Comp Watch page</a>.<br /><br /><i>[About the author of this post: Mark Latham is a Vancouver-based financial economist (cv: <a href="">linkedin.com/in/marklatham</a>) specializing in governance reform of co-ops, democracies and corporations.

The outcome can affect the future of not only Coast Capital, but also other credit unions, co-ops, democracies and corporations.<br /><br />From March 14 through April 8, Coast Capital members will be voting to <b>elect three directors</b>, and to approve or disapprove these <b>four member-proposed resolutions:</b><br /><blockquote><b>5. <a href="">Set 12 Year Term Limit for Directors</a></b><br /><b>6. <a href="">Disclose Pay of Top 3 Executives</a></b><br /><b>7. <a href="">Reform Director Election Processes</a></b><br /><b>8. <a href="">Set Specific Pay for Directors</a></b></blockquote>(The links above lead to explanations and full text of resolutions on the <a href="">Coast Capital Compensation Watch</a> website. I renumbered them on March 14 to match the ballot now published.)<br /><br />The proponents consulted with many Coast Capital members (including me) when drafting these resolutions. Each proposal is already supported by more than 400 member signatures, which exceeds the 300 legally required to get on the ballot.<br /><br />I recommend voting <b>for</b> the above four resolutions, and for three director candidates <i>other than those recommended by the current Board</i>. (I plan to vote for Lisa Barrett, Bruce Batchelor and John Fryer.) Here’s why:<br /><br />I’m a financial economist (cv: <a href="">linkedin.com/in/marklatham</a>).<br /><br />From a <a href="">recent essay</a> in <b><i>The Economist</i></b>...”<br /><br /.<br /><br / <b>restore member control of director pay</b>. Against Board opposition, this was approved by an impressive 79.7% majority. The full story is on the <a href="">Coast Capital Compensation Watch</a> website.<br /><br />Since then, the Board has tried to direct the process by which members can determine their pay -- see <a href="">Task Force Magic</a>. That is why more specific reforms are needed this year: the four member resolutions, and electing new directors to the Board who are independent of the incumbents.<br /><br />I raised most of these issues with the B.C. Financial Institutions Commission (FICOM) in a <a href="">comment letter</a> last year, but we credit union members need not wait for them. We can start democratic reform at Coast Capital, then spread it to other credit unions, co-ops, democracies and corporations as outlined in two articles entitled “<b>We Want Our Co-ops Back</b>”, at <a href="">votermedia.org/publications</a>.<br /><br / <a href="">votermedia.blogspot.ca</a>.

We swing voters keep politicians on their toes, competing with each other to serve the public interest (or at least to present themselves that way). No party can take our votes for granted.<br /><br />So I had never joined a political party in my life. Until this year. <b>Why the change?</b><br /><br />Democratic competition is essential for making elected leaders accountable to voters. But even though our political systems feature electoral competition, that doesn't seem effective enough to keep our leaders and governments loyal to the public interest. <b>Corruption</b> of varying degrees seems pervasive and persistent, from the Liberals' <a href="">sponsorship scandal</a> ten years ago to the Conservatives' <a href="">senate expenses scandal</a> now.<br /><br />Solving this problem has been my main occupation for the past 17 years, focusing first on corporations (where shareowners elect directors), then broadening to include democracies. As a <a href="">financial economist</a>, my main contribution is to design a system for voters to pay information providers (such as journalists), creating stronger incentives for journalists to serve the interests of a voter community. Successful tests of this system are reported in the paper <a href="">Experiments in Voter Funded Media</a>.<br /><br /><b>Designing a solution is one thing. Getting it implemented is quite another.</b> Those in power are naturally reluctant to shift power from themselves to voters (which is what happens when voters become better informed). So it is difficult to change the system from the outside.<br /><br /.<br /><br />To regain Canadian voters' trust after the sponsorship scandal, the LPC needs to show they (we) are serious about reducing corruption and strengthening accountability. We also need to propose some innovative policy ideas to distinguish ourselves from the other parties (e.g. see <a href="">this perspective in the <i>Globe & Mail</i></a>). A new internet-based voter information and engagement strategy could help fulfill these needs.<br /><br />There are other reasons why the <a href="">centrist LPC</a> may fit my political orientation better than other parties. I was fortunate to grow up in a home where both my parents cared about politics and public policy. Best of all was their wide range of views, since <b>Mom was NDP while Dad was Conservative</b>. (And they stayed married for life!) I learned to appreciate that there are intelligent people in all our major political parties who are sincerely trying to serve the public interest. I see them all as colleagues in that endeavour.<br /><br />The issue of democratic accountability can appeal to voters across the political spectrum. A centrist party may be in the best position to attract swing voters from other parties by taking the lead on such an issue.<br /><br />Of course, voters and party members must try to ensure that an elected party actually delivers on its campaign platform. Backsliding has long been the norm:<br /><blockquote>." (<a href="">Michels</a> [1911] p. 114)</blockquote>When I quoted the above passage last year in a paper <a href="">We Want Our Co-ops Back</a> (p. 11), I added:<br /><blockquote>."</blockquote>As <a href="">Lawrence Lessig</a> said eloquently in his <a href="">February 2013 TED talk</a> (about 11 minutes in): <b>It's not that democratic reform is the most important issue.

We voted on eight resolutions proposed by the Modo Board, for changing the co-op's rules:<br /><ul><li>Resolution 1: Correction of oversights or typographical errors; clarification; and removal of obsolete or redundant items</li><li>Resolution 2: Create a Nominations Committee and define its accountabilities</li><li>Resolution 3: Create alternatives to in-person voting at annual meetings for elections</li><li>Resolution 4: Create an option to use alternative voting systems in elections</li>><b>Brief Summary of Meeting:</b><br /><ul><li>We passed each of the 8 resolutions by more than the required 2/3 super-majority vote.</li><li>On Resolution 7, I proposed <a href="">an amendment</a> to require a member approval vote on future changes to the Investment Policy. Amendments are decided by simple majority vote. With 14 in favour and 15 opposed, we did not adopt my amendment. We then unanimously approved the Board's original Resolution 7.</li><li>There was significant opposition to Resolution 6 (letting businesses that use Modo become voting members of Modo), but it passed by a vote of 25 in favour, 7 opposed.</li></ul><b>Discussion of Resolutions 3 and 7:</b><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />(I wrote in support of Resolutions 2 and 3 in <a href="">this previous post</a>.)<br /><br />To maintain democratic member control as a co-op grows large, it's important to let members vote without attending a meeting in person. Internet voting is ideal, especially for organizations that have a website login for each member, as Modo does. Many people are too busy to attend a meeting, but could choose a convenient time to log in, become informed, and vote. <b>Resolution 3</b> would enable internet voting, so I'm glad the Board proposed it.<br /><br />Hopefully this Special General Meeting is the last time Modo members will have to show up in person to vote. Sure enough, attendance was thin! I asked for a show of hands from members there who were not on the Modo Board or staff. About half the attendees raised their hands. Based on that, plus the highest vote count I noted (32 votes), the number of directors introduced (7), and total membership of about 6,000, I estimated <a href="">this attendance table</a>:<br /><br /><table cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr> <td align="LEFT" height="23" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">Group</span></b></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">Members</span></b></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">Proportion</span></b></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">Attendees</span></b></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">Proportion</span></b></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">Voter</span></b></td> </tr><tr> <td align="LEFT" height="23" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;"> </span></b></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">in group</span></b></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">of members</span></b></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">from group</span></b></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">of attendees</span></b></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><b><span style="color: maroon;">Turnout</span></b></td> </tr><tr> <td align="LEFT" height="23" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">Modo Board</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><a href="">8</a></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">0.13%</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">7</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">21.88%</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">87.50%</td> </tr><tr> <td align="LEFT" height="23" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">Modo Staff</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;"><a href="">24</a></td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">0.40%</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">9</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">28.13%</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">37.50%</td> </tr><tr> <td align="LEFT" height="23" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">Other Members</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">5,968</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">99.47%</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">16</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">50.00%</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">0.27%</td> </tr><tr> <td align="RIGHT" height="23" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">Totals:</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">6,000</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">100.00%</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">32</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">100.00%</td> <td align="RIGHT" style="border-color: black; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;">0.53%</td> </tr></tbody> </table><br />If anyone has more accurate counts, I'd be happy to update this table (email to mark[at]votermedia.org). It's natural that directors and staff have much higher voter turnout at a meeting, so are disproportionately represented. Electronic voting will increase turnout from other members, helping to correct this bias.<br /><br /><b>Resolution 7</b> would let the Board change Modo's Investment Policy at any time. I proposed an amendment -- to require that any change in the Investment Policy be ratified by member vote -- giving the reasons I had outlined in <a href="">this previous post</a>.<br /><br />We had a broad discussion, then voted on the proposed amendment, which narrowly missed receiving the required majority support -- the vote was 14 in favour and 15 opposed. I was impressed that at least one director and some staff seemed quite comfortable with speaking and voting in support of my amendment, even though the Board's Governance Committee preferred to stay with their original resolution.<br /><br />We then returned to discussion of the original Resolution 7, which as a special resolution to change the rules, required a 2/3 super-majority to pass. The 14 of us who preferred my amended version, nonetheless chose to support the original version (as I did) rather than to reject it and stay with the fixed investment policy that had been defined in Rule 10.02. So Resolution 7 passed unanimously (with perhaps a couple of abstentions).<br /><br />It was a fascinating exercise in democracy, and let the Board know that we members are quite interested in our policy for investing Modo's accumulated surplus. During the discussion, one member asked whether the Board would let the members know what the new Investment Policy is, each time they change it in future. Director David Lach replied that he saw no reason why not (or words to that effect).<br /><br />So I will conclude this report with the following suggestions.<br /><br /><b>Transparency:</b><br /><br />Currently, a Modo member who wants to know what our co-op's rules are, has to contact Modo staff and request them. It took me two email requests to info@modo.coop, and then I received a copy of the rules by email from the Executive Director (CEO).<br /><br />The rule changes proposed above were only viewable by logged-in members, and now that we have adopted them they no longer available for us to review.<br /><br />We should disclose more of Modo's governance documents publicly at <a href=""></a>, including:<br /><ul><li>Modo's Rules;</li><li>our Investment Policy, whenever the Board adopts a new one;</li><li>past and proposed future rule changes;</li></ul>Since Modo has 6,000 members and almost anyone in the Vancouver area can join, there is little or no reason to keep these documents from the public. Benefits from publishing them include:<br /><ul><li>making it easier for members to find them without having to log in or make a special request;</li><li>saving staff time in responding to special requests;</li><li>helping prospective members understand the organization they are considering joining;</li><li>facilitating public discussion of Modo governance, in the media and by people anywhere interested in co-ops;</li><li>increasing member engagement and membership growth.</li></ul><i><b>Sharing information is cooperative.</b></i><br /><br />Mark Latham election: Why I'm voting for @KevinSMcArthur, Jim Grey, Ryan Merkley, Ruth CorbinThe Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA) is holding its annual board election. I'm voting for these candidates:<br /><blockquote><b>Members' Slate:<br />- <a href="">Kevin McArthur</a><br /><br />Nomination Committee Slate:<br />- <a href="">Jim Grey</a><br />- <a href="">Ryan Merkley</a><br />- <a href="">Ruth Corbin</a></b></blockquote>If you're a CIRA member, you can <b><a href="">vote Sept 16 - 23</a></b> (deadline: 11am Pacific time Sept 23). If you have a .ca domain, you can join CIRA for free at <a href="">cira.ca/membership</a> (and vote next year).<br /><br /><b>How I chose who to vote for:</b><br /><br />I based my decision mainly on how the candidates participated in the <a href="">election forum</a>.<br /><br />I especially like <a href="">Kevin McArthur's advocacy of board transparency</a>, which I strongly support as a way of increasing accountability of CIRA to its members and to the Canadian public. I voted for Kevin in <a href="">2012</a> and <a href="">2011</a> for similar reasons.<br /><br />As for the Nomination Committee's candidates, my preference tipped toward Grey and Merkley for their replies to the <a href="">forum question on what to do with CIRA's financial surplus</a>, and toward Corbin for participating in the forum and not giving responses that I found disappointing.<br /><br /><b>How to improve CIRA's election process:</b><br /><br />There is not enough voter engagement, nor enough sources of insightful assessments of the candidates. (There should be much more insight available than my blog post above, but if it's out there I can't find it.)<br /><br />I have been recommending various improvements to CIRA, so instead of repeating them I'll link to them:<br /><br />1. The latter half of <a href="">this blog post last year</a>.<br /><br />2. The paper <a href="">We Want Our Co-ops Back</a>.<br /><br />Mark Latham Investment Policy should be approved by Members #coop #democracyTwo weeks ago <a href="">I blogged</a> about the upcoming (Sept 23) <a href="">Special General Meeting</a> of <a href="">Modo the Car Co-op</a>, to vote on the Modo Board's proposed rule changes. I supported Resolution 2 (to create a nominations committee) and Resolution 3 (to enable voting via internet) as changes that would strengthen member democracy.<br /><br />Recently I studied Resolution 7, which would authorize the Board to invest Modo funds with reference to an investment policy. It would change the existing <b>Rule 10.02</b>:<br /><blockquote>"Without the approval of the Members by special resolution, the Directors shall not invest a total of more than $25,000 of the funds of the Association in securities or classes of securities other than those in which trustees are permitted to invest trust funds under the <i>Trustee Act</i>."</blockquote>To become:<br /><blockquote>"The funds of the Association shall be invested in accordance with an Investment Policy approved by the <b><i>Directors</i></b> that defines permitted investments and sets investment limits for permitted investments." [emphasis added]</blockquote>To maintain democratic accountability to us Modo members on how our accumulated funds are invested, I recommend changing the word <b>"Directors"</b> to <b>"Members"</b> in the above proposed new rule. <i>[Update 2013-09-20: amended wording in second comment below]</i> So the Board could propose future changes to the investment policy, but those changes would need to be approved by a vote of the members.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />To give members an idea of the kind of investment policy changes the Board is considering, they included a draft policy in the rule change proposal document. That draft would allow Modo to put up to half of our accumulated surplus into "special investments" in other Canadian co-operatives: "Membership shares, investment equity shares, or other forms of investment debt/equity issued by co-operative associations".<br /><br />I like the idea of supporting the development of other co-ops. But there are risks involved, especially if the Board could further change the investment policy without member approval at any time in the future, as their proposed rule change would allow. Such risks can be better controlled if we maintain a clear link of accountability to Modo members.<br /><br />Most members may be too busy to pay attention to future changes in the investment policy. But as long as at least a few members pay attention and communicate with others, we can provide a helpful check and balance. Modo's current Board seems loyal to the best interests of members and the co-op, but our governance system should not assume that all future directors will be as loyal.<br /><br />I'm contacting the Board about this issue, by phone and by email to rules[at]modo.coop. I invite feedback from them, from other members, and from anyone interested. You can comment below and/or email me (mark[at]votermedia.org). I encourage Modo members to attend the <a href="">Sept 23 SGM</a> to discuss, perhaps amend, and then vote on all the proposed changes. See you there!<br /><br />Mark Latham meeting Sept 23 to vote on rule changes #coop #democracyVancouver-based <a href="">Modo the Car Co-op</a> is having a <a href="">Special General Meeting of members on Monday September 23</a>, to vote on eight resolutions proposed by the Modo board, for changing the co-op's rules:<br /><br /><b>A. “HOUSEKEEPING” CHANGES</b><br /><ul><li>Resolution 1: Correction of oversights or typographical errors; clarification; and removal of obsolete or redundant items</li></ul><b>B. NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS PROCESS</b><br /><ul><li>Resolution 2: Create a Nominations Committee and define its accountabilities</li><li>Resolution 3: Create alternatives to in-person voting at annual meetings for elections</li><li>Resolution 4: Create an option to use alternative voting systems in elections</li></ul><b>C. OTHER SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES</b><br /><ul>>Full details (text of new rules, reasons etc) are accessible only to Modo members (like me) logged in at <a href="">bookit.modo.coop</a>.<br /><br / <a href="">Co-operative Principle</a> #2 -- democratic member control -- and open the door to corrupt abuse of power by boards. <a href="">Mountain Equipment Co-op (MEC) is a prime example</a>.<br /><br />So I'm happy to report that, as far as I can tell, the rule changes proposed by Modo's board would strengthen, not weaken, member democracy.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />When I first saw Modo's list of resolutions, my biggest worry was Resolution 2 -- creating a board-appointed Nominations Committee. If a Nom-Com has the power to block members from running for election, for example based on the nom-com's subjective assessments of candidates' skills (<a href="">like at MEC</a>), then that would seriously disempower members, letting the board undercut democratic competition and thus accountability.<br /><br />Fortunately, Modo's board is not proposing to give the Nom-Com such veto power:<br /><br /><b><i>Wording of new Rule 9.05A</i></b><br /><blockquote>The Directors must appoint a Nominations Committee. The Nominations Committee shall:<br />(a) Invite Members to submit nominations;<br />(b) communicate to Members the Directors’ views on the desired skills, experience and other attributes needed at this time by Directors of the Association;<br />(c) identify and recruit candidates so that the number standing for election exceeds the number of vacancies;<br />(d) receive nominations and verify that nomination papers are in order and that the candidate is eligible to serve as a Director;<br />(e) hold a meeting of all candidates to review the election process and timing;<br />(f) approve for publication to Members the list of candidates and the candidate statements they have provided.</blockquote>It seems to me that the above wording serves the legitimate goal of encouraging the selection of candidates that will bring valuable skills to the board, without giving the board a way of eliminating competition and entrenching itself.<br /><br /.<br /><br /.<br /><br / <a href="">this letter to the B.C. Financial Institutions Commission</a>.<br /><br / <a href="">Experiments in Voter Funded Media</a>.<br /><br />I welcome discussion on any of the eight resolutions, via comments below or email to mark[at]votermedia.org. Some discussion has also begun on <a href="">Modo's Facebook page</a>.<br /><br />See you (well, maybe 70 of you) at the <a href="">SGM</a>!<br /><br />Mark Latham #FICOMBC support @Vancity Credit Union board entrenchment? #democracyToday I submitted <b><a href="">this letter</a></b> to the B.C. Financial Institutions Commission (<a href="">FICOM</a>), with my comments on their draft Governance Guideline for Credit Unions. Main points:<br /><br /><b>Accountability requires competition in board elections.</b><br />=> So boards should not be able to disqualify competitors based on subjective assessments.<br /><br /><b>Lack of accountability opens the door to corruption.</b><br />=> Only competitive elections can prevent favouritism in the use of members' funds.<br /><br /><b>Board control of information can bias elections.</b><br />=> Boards should not be allowed to put their recommendations on board election ballots.<br />=> Without that, Vancity members would have elected Lisa Barrett instead of Allen Garr.<br /><br /><b>Please don't let the foxes design the hen house.</b><br />=> The public interest should take precedence over lobbying by credit union insiders.<br /><br />Will next week's B.C. election have any effect on FICOM's final Governance Guideline?

Unfortunately, the outreach efforts of us 600 <a href="">MEC Members for a Democratic Co-op</a> were not enough to counter the MEC board's control of information flowing to members. The board's resolution on rule changes passed by a vote of 91% to 9%. For an overview of how the vote was biased, see my article in the <i>Vancouver Observer</i>: "<b><a href="">We want our co-ops back</a></b>"<br /><br / <a href="">my March 14 blog post</a>.<br /><br /><a href="">Many members were shocked</a> to see how quickly the board took advantage of its new power by rejecting 2013 director election nominee <b>Anders Ourom</b>. His qualifications include:<br /><ul><li>MEC Director (1981-1986, 1988-1992)</li><li>MEC Board Chair (1989-1991)</li><li>President, Climbers' Access Society of B.C. (1995-2004)</li><li>Lawyer, Advising Societies and Co-operatives (1995 - present)</li><li>Legal Advisor, MEC Rules Revision Projects (1997-1998, 2001-2002)</li></ul>Apparently the board decided that MEC members needed to be benevolently protected from having the option to vote for Anders this year. In the AGM's Reports Q&A section, I stepped up to the mike and asked this question:<br /><a name='more'></a><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Do you think that the MEC members who voted for the board's rule change resolution last year, understood that you could and would use that power to prevent someone as well qualified as Anders Ourom from running in the board election this year?"<br /><br />=> Board Chair Bill Gibson replied that yes, he thinks they understood. [I don't have a full transcript of Bill's reply -- MEC does not allow recording by attendees.]</blockquote><b>MEC voter turnout dropped 30%</b> in the past year alone, from 30,673 in 2012 to just 21,514 in 2013. Only 0.55% of members voted this year. Among the possible factors causing this decline, we can include:<br /><ul><li>lack of open competition in the election -- members can only choose among candidates screened by board and its appointed committee;</li><li>lack of an election candidate forum -- only a constrained one-to-one email process;</li><li>lack of convenient access to independent voter information sources -- a permanent online member forum would help with this.</li></ul>So in the AGM's last Q&A section, I asked:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I'd like to ask the board if you have any response to us 600 MEC members who signed this open letter on the website democraticcoop.ca. We are asking for member democracy, including a year-round online member forum. It's good that you created an online forum on this year's resolutions. But the forum only started when voting started, which is too late for adequate discussion."<br /><br />=> Chief Governance Officer Shona McGlashan replied something like they are reviewing how the resolution forum went, and will consider whether and what kind(s) of online forum(s) to have in future.</blockquote>We members concerned about MEC's lack of democratic member control (<a href="">Co-op Principle #2</a>) will continue to reach out to our fellow members who may be unaware of this problem and its consequences.<br /><br />Mark Latham up for member #democracy: attend AGMs @MEC @Coast_Capital @VancityYou can help reclaim member democracy by attending these upcoming Annual General Meetings:<br /><br /><b><a href="">Mountain Equipment Co-op</a> (MEC):</b><br /><blockquote>Thursday, April 25, 2013<br />Doors open at 5:30pm<br />Meeting at 6:00pm<br />Roundhouse Community Arts & Recreation Centre<br />181 Roundhouse Mews, Vancouver<br />Please bring your MEC membership card or 2 pieces of ID</blockquote><br /><b><a href="">Coast Capital Savings Credit Union</a>:</b><br /><blockquote>Tuesday, April 30, 2013<br />Registration and light refreshments from 4:30pm to 5pm<br />Meeting begins at 5pm<br />Executive Airport Plaza Hotel & Conference Centre<br />7311 Westminster Highway, Richmond, BC</blockquote><br /><b><a href="">Vancity Credit Union</a>:</b><br /><blockquote>Tuesday, May 7, 2013<br />Registration at 6pm<br />Meeting at 7pm<br />Italian Cultural Centre, 3075 Slocan Street, Vancouver</blockquote><br />(Vancity director election voting ends April 26. <a href="">Here's why</a> I'm voting for Williams, Barrett & Yaron.)<br /><br />Reclaiming member democracy in co-ops and credit unions can be a first step toward making our elected leaders accountable to voters in corporations and democracies too -- see recent <i>Vancouver Observer</i> article "<a href="">We want out co-ops back</a>."<br /><br>Mark Latham biased election ballot @Vancity - vote for Williams, Barrett, YaronA dominant majority of the Vancity board are using their control of information flowing to Vancity members, to tighten their grip on power over the credit union. Taking advantage of voters who are too busy to search for other info sources, the controlling group ensures that their recommendations are the only info conveniently available to members. I have documented this in a series of posts since April 2012 -- see <a href="">votermedia.blogspot.ca/search/label/Vancity</a><br /><br />Notably this year, one of the board's "recommended" candidates -- Bob Williams -- is not a member of the controlling majority (details in <a href="">this report</a>, from page 8). So I plan to vote for him. Challengers to the dominant group can help improve democratic competition and thus accountability to members.<br /><br />I also plan to vote for Lisa Barrett and Gil Yaron, for the same <a href="">pro-democracy reasons why I voted for them last year</a>.<br /><br />Vancity members can vote by Friday April 26, via mail or <a href="">online</a>.<br /><br>Mark Latham #democracy reform movement growing @MEC @Coast_Capital @VancityCo-op members are waking up to reclaim their democratic rights.<br /><br /><b>Mountain Equipment Co-op:</b><br /><br />Over <strike>400</strike> 500 members of MEC have now signed an open letter "<a href="">The C is for Cooperative, Not Corporation</a>", protesting the MEC board's misleading labelling of a resolution that would transfer control of director nominations and member resolutions to the board. Members can vote on it until March 28, at <a href="">mec.ca/election</a>. I recently posted <a href="">this analysis with voting recommendations</a> -- please vote NO on the board's Resolution #1.<br /><br /><b>Coast Capital:</b><br /><br />In a similar push-back, 438 members of Coast Capital Savings Credit Union (a <a href="">financial co-op</a>) have signed a petition demanding a vote to reverse a 2007 rule change that allowed their directors to decide their own pay, which has grown rapidly since then -- see the member-organized website <a href="">Coast Capital Compensation Watch</a>. Members can vote on the resolution from now through April 16, on paper ballots by mail or online at <a href=""></a> > Log in > Account Services > Online Voting. (Please vote YES.)<br /><br /><b>Technology Credit Union:</b><br /><br />Last year, the board of California's Tech CU proposed converting it into a mutual savings bank, a move that has been criticized (e.g. <a href="">here</a>) as enriching directors at members' expense. Fortunately, a <a href="">campaign to alert members to the downside</a> resulted in their defeating the proposal by a 77% vote.<br /><br /><b>Vancity Credit Union:</b><br /><br />In April 2012, the <a href="">Vancity board of directors elections were criticized for being undemocratic</a> -- see especially the article's <a href="">comments</a>. Although other candidates can run for election, the board's recommended candidates are listed first on the ballot, in bold, with the word "recommended" -- <a href="">my analysis here</a>.<br /><br />Vancity's 2013 board election is next month.<br /><br /><b>We Want Our Co-ops Back!:</b><br /><br />Last year I wrote <a href="">a report</a> proposing reforms for these democratic deficits, and emailed it to the boards of MEC and Vancity. But judging from <a href="">our resulting correspondence</a>, they seem unwilling to restore accountability to members.<br /><br />So more members are getting concerned about the trend, and seeking to reverse it. Last week I published <a href="">an article in the Vancouver Observer</a>, citing the decline in accountability of elected leaders as a major cause of the 2008 financial crisis. Co-ops can become the starting point for a democratic reform movement that can eventually empower us to also reclaim our corporations and our governments.<br /><br />We are organizing -- please email me (mark[at]votermedia.org) to join us in re-establishing <a href="">Co-op Principle #2</a> -- Democratic Member Control:<br /><br /><b>"Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions.

Here's how I plan to vote and why:<br /><br /><span style="color: #38761d;"><b>Board of Directors (vote for up to 3):</b></span><br /><span style="color: #38761d;"><br /></span> <span style="color: #38761d;"><b>1. David Goldsmith<br />2. David Wartman<br />3. David Wexler</b></span><br /><br />Reasons:<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />MEC member Dru Oja Jay emailed 5 questions to all candidates, and compiled responses in a handy colour-coded chart <a href="">here</a>. My top priority is his question #1:<br /><blockquote>1. In an open letter (available <a href="">here</a>)?</blockquote>My second priority is his question #4:<br /><blockquote>4. Another cooperative principle MEC has committed to is "Member democratic control," which states that "Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions." Currently, the board does not consult the membership about any decisions outside of board elections and special resolutions, and contact information for board members is not available on the web site. Do you think that MEC's current behaviour is consistent with this principle? If not, what should be done?</blockquote>My candidate ranking 1-2-3 above is based on Dru's colour-coded assessments of candidate responses to those two questions.<br /><br />If you care (as I do) about gender diversity (not to mention first-name diversity), you may want to vote for my fourth pick, <b>Judy Martin</b>, instead of one of those three Davids.<br /><br />(MEC should facilitate member sharing of this info by simply having an online candidate forum instead of continuing their clumsy email Q&A system, which I <a href="">critiqued last year</a>.)<br /><br /><span style="color: #38761d;"><b>Special Resolutions:</b></span><br /><span style="color: #38761d;"><br /></span> <span style="color: #38761d;"><b>#1: NO<br /><br />#2: YES<br /><br />#3: YES</b></span><br /><br />Reasons:<br /><br />#1 is proposed by the MEC Board, and would transfer too much power from members to the Board, by rule changes including:<br /><ul><li>Increase the number of members required for submitting a resolution, from 5 to 500.</li><li>Let the Board unilaterally reject any member resolution for any reason, without submitting it to member vote.</li><li>Transfer the power to screen director candidates, from the nominations committee to the Board itself.</li><li>Place the nominations committee explicitly "under the guidance of the directors."</li></ul>This is the most important vote on the ballot, in my view. I explain why in <a href="">this article published today in the Vancouver Observer</a>.<br /><br />#2 and #3 are proposed by two groups of MEC members. I don't feel strongly about either of these resolutions, but I do feel strongly about member democracy so I will vote for them. I thank these MEC members for stepping up and doing the work to draft and propose these resolutions. It will be much harder for members to do this in future if resolution #1 passes.<br /><br />Mark Latham today in Vancouver Observer: We want our co-ops back @MEC @Coast_CapitalToday (2013-03-18) the Vancouver Observer news website published my opinion piece "<a href="">We want our co-ops back</a>".<br /><br />It describes how the boards of Mountain Equipment Co-op and Coast Capital Savings have been changing the rules in ways that shift power from members to boards. This undermines the accountability of elected leaders to voters -- the same trend that caused our 2008 financial crisis.<br /><br />But we can reverse the trend -- see how in <a href="">the Vancouver Observer article</a>.<br /><br />[BTW the above linked article is a 2-page overview, partly based on my 24-page in-depth report with the same title but capitalized: "<a href="">We Want Our Co-ops Back</a>".

Video on Youtube:Local media said Francisco Ortiz Franco, of the weekly Zeta, was gunned down by masked men in Tijuana.
There have been several attacks on the paper's staff, including the murder of its founder 16 years ago.
The Mexican attorney general said if Mr Ortiz's death proved to be linked to organised crime, the federal authorities would take over the case.
Hit three times
Officials in the Mexican state of Baja California said Mr Ortiz had just left a clinic with his two children, when men in a pick-up truck opened fire.
He was hit by three bullets, they said. His children, aged eight and 10, were unharmed.
Mr Ortiz was one of three editors at the newspaper. He had trained as a lawyer and had a column specialising in legal affairs.
Zeta is renowned for reporting on the influence of drug traffickers in Tijuana, a city on the US border where several drug gangs are thought to be based.
A co-founder of the paper, Hector Felix Miranda, was ambushed and killed in 1988.
Running for mayor
One of those convicted of the murder was a bodyguard at a race track owned by businessman Jorge Hank Rhon, who comes from one of Mexico's most powerful
political families and who is currently running to be mayor of the city.
Every week since Felix Miranda's death, Zeta has published a full-page notice under his name, asking: "Jorge Hank Rhon: why did your bodyguard Antonio Vera Palestina kill me?"
In 1997, the newspaper's publisher, Jesus Blancornelas, was badly wounded in a gangland attack.
One of the men who attacked him - and who was killed in the crossfire - had been accused in a recent Blancornelas column of being involved in the murder of two federal agents outside a Tijuana courthouse.Aaron gets some hands-on time with the Kyocera Hydro Edge, a new smartphone that's coming soon to Boost Mobile.

Given that he is concerned with page views, so should we who love this community.
So, as noted about, this diary will give the community an opportunity to offer Jones a service and alert him to things he really should be worried about. He should be worried about everything we concern ourselves with but there are plenty of "insightful" things not covered in serious diaries.
So, let's have it, keep things tasteful but gut wrenchingly funny. I have all the faith in the world we can do it. Or not. There is no penalty for writing useless diaries, I do it all the time!
Please follow me through the orange looking glass to a world where Alex is in surrounded by truly ridiculous things more real than his world.
I will make a meager first attempt.
Alex, just because you are paranoid doesn't mean someone isn't watching you. We are.
And, when you realize that we are watching you and start to feel a little heat on that big round neck of yours and break into a sheen of sweat, you might worry that the world isn't getting cooler any time soon.
UFOs, Alex? Ok, I'm with you on that there is something funny going on. In fact, last time I had some greys over for beers they told me that they are not amused with being lumped in with HAARP, Chemtrails and the illuminati. So, they will be visiting soon and "probe" just how much other "crap" you plan to send out to the world.
I am sure y'all can do better.Hotel Real Intercontinental Costa Rica(4 stars)Prospero Fernandez Hwy View on map

It's just the end of September in Rochester, Minnesota, but people are already asking, "When do the winter parking rules start?" This is usually said along with many grumbles and complaints.
- The Good News? Rochester's winter parking season is shorter than it used to be.
- The Bad News? It's still coming, which means so is winter and snow.
What Are The Dates, Rules, etc for Rochester's Winter Parking?
I put together this handy-dandy gallery for you. Peruse slowly, take it all in, and after the gallery, I'll be more specific about why the rules were created.
20 of Rochester, Minnesota's Winter Parking Rules - The Biggies
Are These Winter Parking Rules In Effect Because There Was A Problem Before?
The City of Rochester doesn't directly answer this question on their FAQ, We do have a lot of narrow streets that become even more narrow when the plows can't clear curb-to-curb. That becomes dangerous for the average citizen, but even more so for citizens in need of emergency help, fire, police, etc.
I've lived here a long time and I've heard citizens complain and counsel members talk about citizens calling them to complain about the horrible winter clearing on our older streets. The rules will never satisfy everyone, but it's an honest to goodness best shhot at making sure everyone can get thru.
As always, if you have a comment, complaint, or concern about something I wrote here, please let me know: james.rabe@townsquaremedia.com
Winter's not here yet, though, so here's something fun to look thru that'll help you forget about the snow and cold.President, environmentalist, big game hunter, war hero, trust buster, father of the modern American navy, builder of the Panama Canal, Nobel Peace Prize winner‚ Teddy Roosevelt remains a commanding and intriguing figure of American history.

Top Texas Stories of 2012: The War Over Women’s Health.
In February, then-Texas Health and Human Services commissioner Tom Suehs endorsed a ruling prohibiting "affiliates of abortion providers" – i.e., Planned Parenthood – from participating in the Texas Women’s Health Program. The move was widely expected: despite sweeping public health care cuts passed by the Texas Legislature in 2011, the women’s health care program remained, but with the provision providers like Planned Parenthood would be excluded.
The Texas Tribune wrote that:
Republican lawmakers worked overtime last legislative session to design language that would keep any Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics from receiving state family planning and women’s health dollars, despite the fact that taxpayer-funded clinics may not perform abortions.
But the federal government had balked at Texas’ exclusion of Planned Parenthood, arguing it violated a provision in the Social Security Act stipulating that Medicaid patients can receive care from any qualified agency.
Moreover, Planned Parenthood provides nearly half of the services in the health program, including prenatal care, contraception, cancer screenings, and well-woman exams – while the health program overall leverages $9 in federal funding for every $1 in state funding spent.
With neither side backing down, Texas vowed it would make a go of it without federal assistance – a vow that requires the state to find some $30 million to fill the funding gap.
In April, the state asked for more time (and federal funds) in transitioning to a new, state-run program. Then later that month, a district judge ordered the state to temporarily cease plans to remove Planned Parenthood from the program. That finding was bolstered by another decision a few days later upholding the same ruling, before a circuit court overturned the injunction in the summer.
The state-funded health program was slated to launch Nov. 1; just prior to then, Texas moved to “immediately” cut off funding to Planned Parenthood, which launched another round of litigation; the state announced the health program wouldn’t launch until the cases had been resolved.
Planned Parenthood had sought an injunction to stay in the program. On Nov. 8, it received a temporary injunction, which the state is appealing.
The new year should bring some clarity to the program – and whether Planned Parenthood will continue to play a role in it. But the upcoming legislative session will also crate a new battleground over abortion and women’s health: Gov. Rick Perry has signaled his support for legislation banning abortions after 20 weeks.

Komen and Relay for Life.
The Pink Zone Student Group -- founded by Eric Bodnar, a senior finance major in the Penn State Smeal College of Business -- also recently won the Pink Zone Foundation Penn State Lady Lion Basketball Pink Zone Champion Award for its involvement in raising money for the Pennsylvania Pink Zone.
“The idea of building an organization was enticing to me, and I wanted it to have a lasting impact... I’d love to come back in 10 years and see Pink Zone at Penn State still growing.”
-- Eric Bodnar, Pink Zone student group founder
Bodnar’s involvement with the Pennsylvania Pink Zone began several years ago as a first-year Sapphire Leadership Program student. Sapphire is a program designed for high-achieving students who want to enhance their business school experience through networking, community service and leadership development. All Sapphire students take on multi-year leadership projects as part of their specialized curriculum. The first two years of the Pink Zone Student Group was limited to Sapphire students, but it became an official, University-wide organization for the 2012-13 academic year.
“The idea of building an organization was enticing to me, and I wanted it to have a lasting impact,” said Bodnar.
The student organization raises money through Pink Zone merchandise sales, personal solicitations, corporate donations and events like the recent Mr. Think Pink pageant.
“The business skills I’ve learned through working with this organization have been second to none,” said Bodnar, who served as last year’s president and this year sits on the Pennsylvania Pink Zone board of directors. “I’ve helped to decide how to allocate hundreds of thousands of dollars.”
Current Pink Zone student president Danny Ford, a junior finance major and Sapphire student, agrees that his involvement in Pink Zone has been a valuable complement to lessons he’s learned in the classroom.
“This has given me the opportunity to learn business lessons, personal lessons and about the importance of building relationships,” Ford said.
Fundraising for 2012-13 is still ongoing, but the organization is on track to contribute approximately $20,000 to the Pennsylvania Pink Zone this year, according to Ford.
A new president for the Pink Zone Student Group will be selected soon, and Ford will help the group transition to its new leadership. Bodnar, who graduates in May, has accepted a position doing strategy consulting with IBM in Boston, Mass.
“I’d love to come back in 10 years and see Pink Zone at Penn State still growing,” Bodnar said.
The Pennsylvania Pink Zone promotes cancer awareness and empowers survivors through year-round efforts to raise funds to support breast cancer organizations, charities and facilities.Message-ID: <003601c1a2ad$7a7340a0$19df79c3@default>

In May, NXT also lost some stars including former NXT North American Champion, Velveteen Dream.
One man who knows how it feels to be let go by WWE is the former Erick Rowan. Rowan was released from his WWE contract on the 15th of April, 2020 in that year’s roster clearout. Now speaking to SK Wrestling, Rowan has given his thoughts on Strowman’s release and alluded to the fact it could have been to do with ‘The Monster Among Men’s’ monster contract.
Rowan said:

Rowan last appeared on a televised wrestling show on AEW’s Celebration of Life for Rowan’s former tag team partner Brodie Lee. Rowan has since paid a permanent tribute to the late Lee in the form of a tattoo symbolising their time together as a team.
WWE Hall Of Famer Kevin Nash recently sent some words of encouragement Braun Strowman’s way. Nash told Strowman the only motivation that he should need is to “look in the f*cking mirror.”* Please): This bike has only 6 miles on it and runs great.

I have only discovered Target's awesome toy clearance this past July. I have researched it a little bit and have found some avid Target shoppers say that this toy clearance happens 3 times a year (January, July, and October). I was wondering if any of you have any experience with the October clearance, when in October does it usually happen? I know that in July it was the last Thursday of the month. I got some awesome deals...tons of toys at 75% off. I got most of my Christmas/birthday shopping done for my daughter. In total I got $200 worth of toys for $50. I really want to be able to catch it in October if it does happen. Thanks for any info.

There is a LOT of toy chatter on the Target thread when they do the big toy clearances in January and July. I don't know of any major toy clearance in October. However, those are just the times when there is a larger selection of items being marked down about the same time. Target, like most stores, clearances items throughout the store all year long. I just picked up a couple games - and a whole bunch of Dollar Spot goodies - from Target at 75% off last week. Go check your local store's endcaps and look for some surprises!

I like the idea of sticking to the stock ROM as much as possible. There are plenty of adventurous ROMs around, many which introduce hard to trace or fix bugs, and are fine if you want to be more experimental. That being said, things like CFQ and the Interactive scheduler are useful to have as an option.

, industrial-looking 2in-wide gunmetal grey frame and slab of a pedestal for a stand.The plasticky remote control doesn’t help matters either, but at least the TV is solid enough to withstand knocks and sticky paws.
The connections roster is well up to snuff, though, with just about every analogue connection you could want, plus a digital optical output and four HDMIs (one side-facing).
Multimedia duties are handled by two HDD/Flash memory compatible USB sockets and an SD card slot. Extra mural entertainment is also provided by means of VieraConnect, In keeping with its budget status the P42ST30B’s picture adjustments are on the basic side. But it does offer some higher-end features such as 600Hz sub-field drive IFC (Intelligent Field Creation) CATS (Contrast Automatic Tracking System) and P-NR (picture noise reduction).
Panasonic just won’t change its entirely clunky GuidePlus-powered Freeview EPG. We’ve given it short shrift for several years, but our complaints fall on deaf ears.
Nor will the brand win any prizes for the dated look of its onscreen menus or the inaccessible placing of the IFC off/mid/max button and Clear Cinema on/off controls.
The P42ST30B is capable of serving up some superbly detailed HD images, but it’s one of those screens that requires work to get the most out of it. Human Planet on BBC HD Freeview shows that colour fidelity is accurate, contrast levels and shadow detail are strong and problems such as banding and colour flashes are negligible.
Bored To Death (Sky Atlantic HD) features some rapid camera pans that are eradicated by engaging IFC’s lowest setting without introducing detrimental artefacts in the process.
The Blu-ray of No Country For Old Men provides a great test for IFC and it’s good to find that this panel shows significant improvements over previous generations. With 24p Smooth Film set to Off, there’s slight judder and no image artefacts, set it to mid or max and there’s no judder with just a very slight halo trail.Turn it down
Panel noise is clearly an issue, but it’s more or less solvable. The noise of the vast skies in No Country For Old Men can be reduced by engaging P-NR at the cost of some minor softening. But ditch PNR if you want to extract maximum clarity.
You’ll need to source your own 3D specs, and at around £100 a go, they aren’t cheap, but at least the brand’s designs are now more comfortable.
The other bit of good news is that the screen is a strong 3D performer. With the Monsters vs Aliens 3D Blu-ray disc, the scenes with strong vertical objects such as the Golden Gate Bridge show very little crosstalk so that you aren’t aware of any image lag. In terms of perspective and depth you can’t really go wrong with CGI for 3D, but Sky’s 3D channel suffers through resolution loss.
Aesthetic failings aside, the P42ST30B can reward you with an impressive viewing experience – but with similar-sized 3D models from LG and Samsung coming in a few hundred pounds cheaper, it might struggle to find buyersHCC VERDICT

Ah, the “ding dongs” of American culture are panicking to stock up, and truly test the shelf life of Twinkies, once and for all. Ebay has them selling for a crazy $200,000 a box BUT that includes shipping and handling!

What Is Measles?
Measles is a viral respiratory disease that mainly affects children but also strikes adults. Although it was officially declared eliminated in 2000 – meaning it no longer regularly passes through the U.S. population – in recent years it has re-emerged, including a measles outbreak last year in Tarrant and Denton counties.
“Even with heightened awareness in the medical community, measles can be difficult to track and diagnose as there is a long incubation period, and many physicians and nurses in the United States have never even seen a patient with measles,” says Dr. Kahn. “However, when we notice an uptick in cases, we have to be vigilant and fully prepared for the possibility that we will see measles in the emergency room.”
Who Is Most at Risk for Catching Measles?
According to Dr. Kahn, babies less than a year old – prior to their first measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination – are particularly vulnerable for catching measles, along with unvaccinated children and adults, whether by choice or because they have an underlying condition such as immunodeficiency does not allow them to be vaccinated.
Young children who have not had a second inoculation also are more susceptible to the disease. Even fully vaccinated older children and adults may not be entirely protected if the potency of the original vaccine has worn off.
Measles also is dangerous for unvaccinated pregnant women due to high risks for spontaneous abortion, premature labor and low birth weight babies.
How Do You Treat Measles?
There is no specific medical treatment for measles other than supportive care at home, although many children who develop complications require hospitalization.
Children with symptoms, particularly if they have recently traveled internationally, should be evaluated for measles. Parents should contact their child’s primary care physician if they suspect measles.
Symptoms of measles:
- Fever
- Fatigue
- Cough
- Conjunctivitis
- Runny nose
- Red rash, which usually appears four to five days after the fever begins
According to Dr. Kahn, if a child at Children’s is diagnosed with measles, the area must be evacuated, cleaned and quarantined for several hours.
He says measles can spread like wildfire in non-immunized populations and create a nightmare for public health officials who must track each sick person’s movements and alert those who may have been exposed.These machines were in service for just a little over a year.

Are you considering homeschooling your kindergarten age child or are you already homeschooling and are looking for ideas? I have graduated 3 of my children from "Kindergarten Homeschool" and am currently homeschooling kindergarten with my 4th child. Below you will find my practical tips for your first year of homeschooling kindergarten.
Should It Be School?
Picture in your mind what homeschooling Kindergarten should look like. Is this what you are picturing?
You have to have school desks, right? It is school after all. You’ll need a chalk board or white board because that’s what schools have. Your children will need to wear school uniforms every day because that’s what you do at school. The kids can bring their backpacks into the school room each day because every child is supposed to have a backpack. Then there are the books. You’ll need to buy that complete $250 homeschool curriculum with every subject, every teacher key, and every test. Oh, and don’t forget about the bathroom hall pass!
When a lot of new-to-homeschooling families think about what homeschooling should look like, they try to bring the school to their home. Is that really the way it should be?
My main tips for homeschooling Kindergarten are:
1) Read, read, read.
2) Follow the lead of your child.
3) Spend lots of time outside.
4) Use games to teach subjects.
5) Provide lots of time for children to play.
6) Intersperse sit down activities with movement activities.
7) Make learning a life-long process.
Read, Read, Read
I’d like to start by telling you about my family and our homeschooling experience. After that I will draw out some points from my experiences. I had no intention to homeschool whatsoever, but God had different plans. I grew up going to a public school and I had a good experience with it. After I graduated from college I was an 8th grade history teacher. I stayed at home after I had my oldest son, "Owl." My husband and I discussed me going back into teaching in 5 years after Owl was old enough to go to Kindergarten. God gave me a very curious first child. He gave me a child who wanted to read all the time and wanted to learn about everything. What was I supposed to do? I just followed Owl’s lead. We checked out tons of books from the library every week and read them all. I just kept reading to him.
Follow the Lead of Your Child
(Teaching Phonics)
Owl knew his letters and their sounds. What should I do next? I was blessed to have families in my church and two sisters who were homeschooling who provided me with guidance. A veteran homeschooling mom from my church told me to try “Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons.” Owl loved it. I loved it. And then about halfway through it got a lot more difficult. He hated it. We both cried through the last quarter of the book, but we finished it around the time that my second son, "Tigger," was born. After that Owl begged for me to read him a series of books called, “Henry and Mudge” about a young boy and his dog. I agreed, but he had to read one page and I’d read the next. No, he didn’t read perfectly, and I didn’t know all the phonics rules to teach him how to read. I did figure out some in the process of teaching him how to read. For example: “When two vowels are next to each other, the first one swallows up the second one (“Gulp”) and it makes a long vowel sound.”
Spend lots of time outside.
(Teaching Science)
We didn’t only read. We spent a lot of time in nature. I strongly believe that the best science textbook for young children is the great outdoors. We took a lot of walks outside. I wanted something to talk about as we walked but I didn’t really know too much about the types of trees and flowers we were passing, how birds made their nests, or why the sky is blue. That’s when children’s books came in really handy. I’d read them with Owl and then we’d discuss them as we walked.
As other children have come along, I’ve added field guides to my nature book collection. At various points each summer we have fun drawing and identifying a wild flower, a spider, an insect, or a cloud every morning.
Use games to teach subjects.
(Teaching Math)
As far as math goes, from the picture books we read, Owl quickly learned how to identify numbers and how to count. Cooking created lots of opportunities for math lessons when we talked about fractions using measuring cups. Owl could count to 100 by 1’s, 5’s and 10’s because we’d practice counting while he’d stir cake mix batter or while we’d walk to the park. What should I do next? One of my sisters recommended A Beka, so I bought an A Beka grade 1 math workbook. Owl wasn’t really getting addition, so I came across a fun board game called Sum Swamp that has two die with numbers and one die with plus and minus signs. You move across the board by adding and subtracting the numbers you roll. Owl wanted to play the game 20 times a day. After 2 days of this he was adding and subtracting easily.
Follow the Lead of Your Child
(Teaching Handwriting.)
Owl couldn’t write though. He was my first child, so there weren’t markers, crayons, pens, & pencils laying across the floors like there are now that I have multiple children. I thought it was pointless to simply color a picture. Since he had no desire to color, I didn’t force the issue. Oops. Coloring actually helps children be able to hold a pen or pencil correctly so that they can start writing letters. Hmm...I would need to work on that, but what about his math workbook? Should I stop having him do math so that we could work on writing? No. I just wrote in the answers for him. About a year later Owl was able to write well enough.
Knowing that Owl hated to write, I didn't push it. We did not do handwriting in Kindergarten. I waited an entire year and then the next year we began handwriting. The photo to your right is what he did then. With my other children, pencils, crayons, and sharpie markers have been left out so that the children have an opportunity to use them...on books, walls, etc. They were ready to begin handwriting in Kindergarten. Again, follow the lead of your child.
Provide lots of time for children to play.
(Teaching Everything Else.)
Then there was play time. We spent a lot of time playing with friends at the park and having friends over to play. I eventually decided we could have educational play dates. I invited friends over a couple times a week and we did art, history, science, and social studies unit studies together. The kids didn’t know they were learning. They thought they were playing. We studied seeds and planted a garden. We read about the medieval period. The kids created armor out of cardboard and newspaper and then had a jousting tournament. We learned about meteorology and watched baby powder swirl up over a lamp and made snowball cookies. We learned about the parts of a flower, studied the flowers in our back yard, and then drew them Georgia O’Keeffe style. We visited museums and the zoo. It was laid back and fun.
A Beka
Was this really homeschooling, though? Owl was 4. He wasn’t 5 yet. He wasn’t school age yet. I wasn’t homeschooling because he wasn’t school age, right? I still didn’t want to homeschool. There were so many curriculum choices. What would we do when all his friends went off to school? How would I be able to teach one child while I had a new baby? What would I do for high school? I was so overwhelmed by the idea of homeschooling...even though that is what I had been doing all along.
I just continued doing what we had been doing. Lots of curricula came in and out of my house. I spent lots of money on many neat books, but they didn’t really fit with my family. Some required too much time and attention from me, some were really neat but we just never had time for them, and some of them didn’t make sense to me or to my child. After talking with many homeschooling families and one of my sisters, I eventually settled on using A Beka for language arts, math, spelling, & some of phonics. A Beka is really easy to implement. It covers all the bases. You don’t have to worry that you missed something. I don’t have to spend lots of time planning. I don’t even need to buy the teacher’s manual. All I have to do is pull out a worksheet and hand it to my child. Instead of spending lots of money trying out neat books that I won’t use, I’ve decided to stick with books that I can use and have found to be effective in teaching my family. Don’t be a slave to the curriculum. Let it work for you, and if it's not working, try something else. A Beka might not be right for your family, but it you have no idea what to use, I’d recommend starting with A Beka for the core subjects.
Unit Studies
As I mentioned before, I want my children to be lifelong learners. We do not only use workbooks. We use unit studies for the other subjects. We study something in depth and incorporate as many subjects as we can. When we studied simple machines, we read about Archimedes, designed marshmallow catapults, baked edible screws, calculated mechanical advantage, drew up plans for a confetti launcher, sang a song about simple machines, and more. That’s phonics, engineering, science, home economics, math, art, and music all in just a few lessons. I invited over friends and we had weekly co-ops meetings, which were the highlight of our week.
Imagination
As Einstein said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.” The early years you have with your kindergartner are the perfect time to provide an atmosphere in which your child can freely explore, dream, and grow in both their book knowledge and their imagination.
Now, with all that said, don’t forget to make sure your children wear their school uniforms!
To Summarize:
1) Read, read, read.
2) Follow the lead of your child.
3) Spend lots of time outside.
4) Use games to teach subjects.
5) Provide lots of time for children to play.
6) Intersperse sit down activities with movement activities.
7) Make learning a life-long process.

Categories: LGBTQ, LesbianI’m probably going to Hell for that headline, but I’ll see Laci’s Mom, who does not have it going on, there. On last night’s “Toddlers & Tiaras,” the only show brave enough to let parents live vicariously through their underage daughters, eight-year-old Laci was forced to dress up as Lady Gaga by her mother; she even arrived on stage in an egg. Honestly, when she “spilled” out if it, you could say I got a little yolked up. *Dodges unripe tomatoes*
She was also supposed to wear a meat dress, until tragedy struck:
“[When] we realized we were already late and realized we weren’t going to have enough time for the meat bikini, it was really devestating [sic],”!” (Huffington Post)
In five years, when Buzzfeed has become more powerful than Google, they’re going to run an article titled “Where Are They Now? Toddlers & Tiaras Edition,” and I really don’t want to read that Laci was killed in a drug deal gone wrong after needing a pick-me-up because her mother forced her to sing “Polka Face” for 17 straight hours outside of the local Arby’s. Won’t somebody think of the children, indeed.
Ugh, this show. If I wanted to see an overbearing, unhinged stage mom whose daughter is destined to become a stripper, I’d watch “Gypsy.”
Only the Rosalind Russell version.
I still do not understand why child pageants are legal and these mothers aren’t locked up for abuse. I don’t have a joke here, I’m serious. Its fucked.
Ditto. These women need to be beaten with shovels.
Right after we change those assault laws to have a loophole for beating people we think are lower life forms
I’d pay good cash to see polka renditions of my favorite hits outside an Arby’s any day.
Weird Al agrees.
Call me old fashion, but I plan on exploiting my children by forcing them to get really good at a sport.
Warning, more T&T videos will automatically play after the first one if you don’t stop them. Do not watch the second one. Not too be mean, but the girl in the video after the first one is not cute. Just being honest.
Also, I know I’ve gone on this rant before here, but this show is the absolute fucking worse. Every time I watch one of these videos I want to scream “fuck fucking fuckers.” I hate these parents so much. I hate them more than the Kardashians and Hitler combined.
I thought it was an episode of Horders, until I saw “me honey boo-boo child”.
Must.read.comments.first
Agreed. I saw the name of of the clip “A Dolla Make Me Holla” and it just was one long train wreck after that.
*worst, not worse.
Wow, not one person said it yet? I guess I’ll step up to the plate….
8 year olds dude.
Aren’t we missing the real story? There’s a show called I Cloned My Pet.
The only pets that should be cloned are Penthouse Pets, so that way we can each have one of our own. I’d probably go with the Sunny Leone (in Bespin fatigues).
Ayyy wait a minute. It’s “Stacy’s Mom”
It’s not often I get to paraphrase Fountains of Wayne songs. Let me have this.KL Report
Srinagar
“Jammu Kashmir is actually a police state where there is a blanket ban on speaking, getting up, sitting down, peaceful processions and public rallies. Stopping us from reaching to our brothers in Doda with relief is also a part of this imperialist approach”, Chairman of Jammu Kashmir liberation front Mohammad Yasin Malik said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
“On 29th May 2013 we were stopped from distributing relief among the victims of earthquake and we after arrest were pushed back to Srinagar. Besides the whole world, the leaders of many pro India parties including National Conference leader Mustafa Kamal, Pradesh Congress President professor Saif ud Din Soz, Congress leader Mohammad Sharief Niyaz, PDP leader Nayeem Akhtar and communist leader Yousuf Tarigami condemned this police act and some of these parties and leaders even demanded a probe into the matter. But it is ironical that when we again tried to reach the earthquake victims of Doda we were again arrested and stopped”, the statement said adding “Now a question arises that if these pro-India parties and leaders who are actually representing the whole assembly and two of whom are from the ruling coalition are against stopping us from reaching Doda. Who is actually issuing orders to do so. A common kashmiri fails to understand that if rulers want to allow the caravan of relief to reach Doda which hidden force and hands are actually issuing orders against it. This dual act has once again proved that the state of Jammu Kashmir is not run by these puppets but it is actually directly being governed by their masters in Delhi and these so called rulers of the state are so weak that they even cannot open their lips”.
“Today these so called rulers show concern over the young educated person joining militancy. They are actually having many hidden agendas while speaking on this issue and one of these agendas is that they want to tell the whole world that the resistance movement so far is being run by uneducated people and hence lacks popular support”.
Yasin Malik said that this is factually incorrect as the resistance movement right from 1928 was launched by highly educated people and intellectuals. He said that father of Kashmiri nation Mohammad Maqbool Butt who pioneered this movement in 1960’s was having a masters degree in English and Urdu literature. “He worked as a journalist for many years. So was JKLF PatronAmman ullah khan who has authored many books, Dr Farooq Haider, Abdul Khaliq Ansari Advocate, and many more”.
Yasin Malik said that Alfeteh was another chapter in our resistance and the people who were a part and parcel of that were also highly qualified youth of their time. “And when this present struggle started the youth like Shaheed Ashfaq Majeed Wani, Ajaz Ahmad Dar, Sheikh Abdul Hamid left their colleges and started it. this movement soon became the romance of people like doctor Abdul Ahad Guru, doctor Abdul Ahad Wani, advocate Jalil Indrabi, pilot Nadeem khateeb, scholar shams ul Haq, scientist doctor Turabi, Mohammed Azam Inqilabi, Syed Salah ud Din, mufti Jamal ud din and many more highly educated people”.
Yasin alleged that this new phenomenon of young men joining militant ranks is the direct consequence of Indian state choking every kind of peaceful political space to Kashmiri’s. “Kashimiri’s on world’s persuasion made a historical transition from violent to non violent mode of resistance. These young and budding boys participated in peaceful resistance in years 2008, 2009, and 2010 but instead of being given a space where met with a brutal force by India. These young men saw Indian forces butchering hundreds of peaceful protesters in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Theses people saw torture, beatings and killings, they saw prisons and police repression and lost every hope in peaceful way of resistance.”, he added.
While reiterating his appeal for complete shut down on the arrival of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Kashmir ,Yasin Malik said : “Prime minister is the same man who did nothing in 9 years and 3 months rule. What will he deliver now in remaining 6 months”
He said that Manmohan Singh Jee when assumed the office of prime minister announced to solve Kashmir issue. “It was he who initiated a dialogue process with Pakistan. It was he who announced zero tolerance on human rights .but actually he has done the otherwise. It is during his era when martyr Mohammad Afzal Guru has been hanged and even denied a proper burial. It is his regime that has crushed our peaceful people’s revolution in 2008 and 2010. It is his rule when we are being denied our basic human rights. It is his rule when 35 kashmiris have been sentenced to life. It is his regime when our teen aged kids are arrested and sent to jail under PSA”.
Yasin claimed that no Kashmiri can be happy welcoming the Prime Minster who has done all this.
“In fact every Kashmiri will shut down his office, transport , business and daily activities as a mark of protest on 25th June 2013, Tuesday and convey to him that Kashmiris don’t approve his tyrant and oppressive acts and deeds”, he said
Yasin Malik appealed to every Kashmiri to join this peaceful protest and observe a total shut down on 25th June 2013.
Yasin Malik also paid rich tributes to Mirwaiz south Kashmir Moulana Qazi Nisar on his anniversary. Terming him as a great Kashmiri scholar and famous leader, Yasin Malik said that his struggle and sacrifices cannot be ignored by any one and today we all express our gratitude and love for this noble soul.William H.

Some ports remain open but with reduced workforce, exacerbating the cargo congestion. This has now caused a disruption in the supply chain, particularly the movement of essential goods and foodstuffs. Uncollected cargoes at ports create congestion and take up space, reducing their capacity to accommodate incoming cargoes and containers.
Consumer demands have changed dramatically throughout the pandemic. Essential commodities have seen a staggering increase in demand, especially disinfectant products, medical supplies, groceries and paper goods has . (Related: Covid supply chain woes worsen as prices soar, shelves run bare.)
Air cargo has also seen an overall increase in use during the pandemic, with essential goods being transported across the world. Some passenger planes have even been retrofitted to carry more cargo inside the cabin.
But manufacturers – largely due to labor shortages – have had difficulty trying to keep up with the demand, slowing down the entire freight industry. While planes are ready to fly and truck drivers are ready to haul freight across the country, the goods, unfortunately, are not there to make the journey.
Bloomberg published an article last month that predicted global food prices will continue to go up as the “world runs short of workers.”
In Vietnam, the army is assisting with the rice harvest; in the U.K., farmers are dumping milk because there are no truckers to collect it. In Brazil, robusta coffee beans took 120 days to reap this year, rather than the usual 90. In the U.S., meatpackers are trying to lure new employees with incentives while fast-food chains are raising the prices of burgers and burritos.
Labor shortages have flustered the global food ecosystem. Some employers are now forced to raise wages despite financial difficulties. Workers are also demanding greater protection from COVID-19. Meanwhile, restaurant workers in cities with vaccine mandates like New York are opting to resign rather than get experimental COVID-19 vaccines or are serving as vaccine police at work.
Lockdowns have contributed to the labor shortage in the shipping industry. (Related: ‘System collapse’: Supply chain workers warn of impending breakdown because COVID shutdowns have drained the workforce and worsened product shortages.)
The Philippines, China, India and Indonesia are among the biggest suppliers of crew members. But lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions have caused thousands of crew members to be stranded worldwide..
Many of those crew members have decided to look for other jobs, creating a massive hole in the shipping industry workforce.
The pandemic has exposed the fragility of the global supply chains. But some say supply chains are already headed south regardless of the pandemic and the resulting restrictions.
Looking back at 2019, spot rates were basically flat-lining as the freight market was experiencing a cycle of oversupply and stagnant demand. Many feared a recession was imminent.
A sluggish industrial sector in which industrial production growth was negative for nearly a year indicated stagnant business and infrastructure investment – a sign that the economy was entering a phase of risk aversion and consolidation.
The U.S. government was able to quickly pass a stimulus package that spurred consumer demand to new heights. Consumers took the reins of the economic recovery by using the stimulus money and savings from not driving to work, buying new clothes and dining out to remodel their houses and purchase electronics.
The onslaught of unexpected demand caught most shippers and transportation providers off guard as they were expecting the next depression. They quickly found their once overstocked inventories depleted and needed to order more goods – all at once.
Shippers began to order not just for replenishment but for the future to avoid missing revenue.
Most durable goods like electronics and furniture come from Asia, while most consumers of these products live in the eastern half of the United States. It takes several weeks from the initial order date to get goods from China to New York City. To prevent inventory shortfalls, shippers need to order months in advance.
Shippers learned to increase their order sizes as production became strained; but by then, transportation providers were reducing capacity. This meant that demand quickly outstripped supply on multiple levels. These were happening prior to the pandemic.
But without question, the pandemic and resulting lockdowns and other restrictions have magnified the strain in the global supply chain.

The speech showed that the “ball is in Azerbaijan’s court”, Director of the Noravank foundation Gagik Harutyunyan told Armenian News-NEWS.am.
“In his speech President Sargsyan said that if a document is signed at Kazan meeting, it will give an opportunity to begin work on a basic agreement. I think that if an agreement is reached, the document will be signed,” Harutyunyan noted, adding the OSCE Minsk Group pressures both Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The expert stressed that since 1994 the international community has been exerting pressure but Armenia never ceded an inch of land within the recent 17 years. In this respect, it should not be noted that only the Armenian side is under pressure and is going to make concessions.
Referring to concessions, Harutyunyan said if Nagorno-Karabakh becomes part of Azerbaijan, the existence of Karabakh and Karabakh people will be endangered, as it poses threat to genocide and displacement of Karabakhi people from the historical lands. According to him, this option is ruled out. He stressed if some of the liberated territories are ceded to Azerbaijan, Karabakh will appear in deplorable state in terms of military strategy.
“Today we have good defensive positions. We will lose them and become vulnerable if Azerbaijan carries out its war-mongering rhetoric,” he noted.
The expert added that Nagorno-Karabakh issue will not be resolved without Karabakh’s involvement. Prerequisites for Karabakh to join the negotiating table have been since 1994Athlete Profile

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal court filing in Minneapolis sheds new light on the way prosecutors believe Somali men living in Minnesota were recruited to fight with a terror group in their homeland.
At least 21 men are believed to have left the Minneapolis area since 2007 to join the militant Islamic group al-Shabab in Somalia. It’s classified as a terror group by the U.S. government.
Prosecutors said in a Friday court filing that recruiters held secret meetings, tested recruits on their knowledge of religion and events in Somalia, and rejected recruits who were too young out of fear their operation would be discovered.
The document comes as one defendant is scheduled to go to trial Tuesday on charges he played a role in the recruiting operation.

The designated gate leads to the 3rd Cavalry Regiment area where Guillén served before she was murdered earlier this year.
"One of the reasons we invited the Guillén family [Tuesday] was to discuss and review design concepts and survey a proposed site of a gate we plan to name in Vanessa’s honor," Fort Hood commander Lt. Gen. Pat White said in a statement. "Their input is important for our final design that will come to fruition over the next few months."
Fort Hood officials also recently launched a year-long effort to identify and eradicate three leading issues from the ranks of the post's soldiers: sexual assault and harassment, extremism and racism, and suicide.
"Vanessa’s life was a catalyst for us to implement action to improve trust, discipline, and teamwork across our formations," White said. "All of our 38,000 soldiers at Fort Hood are important, and — like Specialist Guillén — each volunteered to serve our nation. They deserve our best leadership."
Guillén was last seen working on Fort Hood in late April. After a months-long search, her remains were found near a river 20 miles outside of Killeen, where the Army base is located.
When police confronted another Fort Hood soldier believed to have been involved in her disappearance, authorities say the soldier fatally shot himself before they could detain him for questioning.

Pink for October
As some of you may already have noticed, Alter Ego and Bolts of Silk have gone Pink for October to raise awareness of breast cancer. Crafty Green Poet has to remain green as far as I'm concerned, but as Nia pointed out in a comment on Alter Ego, there are environmental factors in breast cancer so I thought I'd experiment with ways of incorporating pink into the overall green decor of this blog. I'll post on the topic sometime this month too.

Perhaps campaigns to promote non-underwire bras and the use of aluminium-free deodorant might do more to help banish breast cancer, since both have been linked to the disease
Mind you it's hard to find a non-aluminimun deodorant that actually works, having said that!
Hi Laura - I use a non-aluminium deoderant and it works pretty well. Lasts for ages too.
Which one, Juliet? I use Toms of Maine and am just trying out a new Aussie tea tree one which I can't remember the name of. Both are okay except on really roasting days LOL
And sometimes the cancer is just in you like a time bomb waiting to explode and it has nothing to do with deoderant or bras.
I just lost a 30-year-old friend (PhD student, mother of two, instructor at the local university). And when it's someone you love, you really don't care about the bras or the deoderant. (Although, I personally would never wear an underwire bra because they're beastly uncomfortable and I think you should all use whatever deoderant you wish....)
But yes, research needs to be done -- good, solid research to weed out old wives' tales and find out what's really going on. Hey, when my parents were kids, everyone still worried about polio. When my grandparents were young, whooping cough and smallpox still took lives.
Someday, someone's going to figure this one out, too. In the meantime, support your local scientists and look towards the answers.
(Oh yeah, and get your yearly check ups; Aubrey lived 3 extra years because they caught hers early. I just had my yearly check up done -- right after her funeral.)
So many people are promoting breast cancer month...even the Mexican soccer league is playing with pink balls to show their support. Isn't that awesome?!?
Thanks for the sprinkles of pink on your blog. My mom has been a breast cancer survivor now for ten years. All the women in our family believe in early detection and do our mammograms each year.
...must go pink right now! thanks, i didn't know about this intelligent initiative...
Jo - I use the Neals Yard Remedies crystal deoderant
Paperback writer - i agree, sometimes it does come out of nowhere. Research is essential, but there are also ways you can minimise risk, aluminium free deoderant os a good idea anyway, as it has also been linked to Alzheimers.
Mamachita - its great to see support from so many people, you're right!
Inland Empire Girl - yes, early detection, mammograms
na - I'll pop over and see you in your pink blog then!
I lost a very dear friend to breast cancer last month. It is a good thing there is so much awareness out there. I pray that one day we will find a cure.
Swelma - so sorry you lost your friend. I hope that all the awareness raising means we find a cure quicker.
I’m so sorry to hear that it is cancer. Praying for healing, and for peace for your family.
Kelly - I don't have cancer, no, I'm joining in awareness raising.This building is listed under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended for its special architectural or historic interest.

We’ve all heard that line from hunting aficionados. We’ve certainly seen groups like American Hunters and Shooters Association claim that we can have “reasonable” gun laws, and it won’t threaten hunting. In the past few weeks we’ve seen examples in the State of California and the State of New Jersey, that show hunters have a lot to fear when their gun rights are infringed.
The State of New Jersey has been eroding gun rights and slowly strangling its shooting culture since 1968. There are still a lot of shooters over in The Garden State, but they have been in the political wilderness since the early 1990s.
The State of New Jersey, under Governor Corzine, has canceled the bear hunt for the past several years, despite serious problems in the Garden State with overpopulation of bears, and increasing bear/human encounters. Now the animal rights groups, such as the Humane Society of the United States, and PETA, want to get the legislature to put animal rights activists on the Fish and Game Council:
Under current law, the council is made up of 11 members appointed by the governor, with stipulations that three of the members must be farmers and six must be nominated by the New Jersey Federation of Sportsmen.
The legislation proposes to reduce the council to seven members, with two appointments reserved for farmers and no appointments reserved for sportsmen. The bill also alters language defining the council’s mission — deleting the goal of “development of fish and game for public recreation and food supply” and instead defining the mission as investigating the use of “non-lethal alternatives for dealing with wildlife conflicts” and exploring “ecotourism” opportunities.
Hunters need to let that sink in real good. Activists in New Jersey destroyed gun rights first. Now they are coming after hunting. Fortunately, hunters staged a successful rally, with about 500 sportsmen, to protest A3275 and S2041.
It’s important to note that the entire New Jersey Assembly is up for election next Tuesday. If you’re in the Garden State, make sure to vote the bozos who are supporting this crap out of office, and vote for the people who are behind sportsmen.
But New Jersey hunters aren’t alone in their struggle. Everyone knows that Arnold signed the lead ammo ban in California Condor habitat, which effectively ends hunting in large swaths of California. Now it turns out they are trying to push that in Arizona as well. I doubt they will find so hearty a reception to that idea in the Grand Canyon State as in California, but it’s important to note that they eroded gun rights in California before the foundation was set for going after hunters.
I’m hoping this presents a good case for the reason that hunters and shooters need to stick together. Our fates are inexorably intertwined. Let’s hang together… I think everyone is aware of the alternative at this point.

Let us not forget that California banned single-shot rifles based entirely on their chambering, .50BMG, being too powerful.
In the early days of the passage of the Assault Weapons Ban, all semi-automatic rifles were to be banned. Not just AK 47s and ugly black rifles, but Remington 7400s and Browning semi-autos too. And they were talking confiscation.
The Assault Weapons Ban is trying to make a comeback, and semi-auto deer rifles are still on their minds as phase II.
Stage III will be classifying all scoped rifles as eevil sniper rifles, followed by their confiscation, or ammo bans.

Nine ships and boats carrying aid supplies to the residents of Gaza Strip will try to break the Israeli siege later this week, a Turkish organization said Monday. “If everything goes as planned, the ships will reach the shores of Gaza on Wednesday evening,” Serkan Nergis, a spokesman for the Foundation of Humanitarian Relief (IHH), was quoted as saying by AFP.
Organizers of the campaign were warned by Israel that the fleet would be stopped, but they are planning to continue, he said. Israeli press reports said a special detention facility for the 750 peace activists was set up in the south of the country by the Israeli army. “Under international law, Israel has no say over Palestinian waters. If they intervene, their action will amount to that of the pirates in Somalia,” he said.
According to Nergis, three ships left Istanbul port Saturday for Antalya from where they will sail again Tuesday. They are scheduled to be joined near Cyprus by six other vessels embarking from Ireland, Britain and Greece and sail on together to Gaza, he explained.
The fleet — dubbed the Freedom Flotilla — will carry a total of 10,000 tons of cargo, including medical supplies, hospital equipment and building materials, he said.DOTHAN, Alabama -- Dothan Police have arrested a suspect accused of using a broken kitchen knife to cut a victim’s throat.

The treatment devices that are another foremost category of GERD devices market, address fundoplication GERD devices, ultrasonic surgical endostapler, radiofrequency ablation GERD devices, and sphincter augmentation GERD devices.
In the US, gastroesophageal reflux disease is the most prevailing gastrointestinal disease since the pace of obesity is very higher. The higher pace of obesity is one of the foremost aspects adding to the expansion of the GERD devices market inside North America. The APAC market accounts for higher expansion prospects for the GERD devices market. Rising healthcare awareness, as well as growing establishments of hospitals and diagnostic centers outstandingly, boost the expansion of the GERD devices market inside APAC.
Foremost Aspects Determining the GERD Devices Market
The increasing dominance of abdominal obesity goes forward to fuel need for GERD devices market
The rising dominance of GERD is correlated with the expanding preponderance of obesity in several nations as well as the existence of different lifestyles and poor diet aspects. This boosts the need for GERD devices. The distinction in the existence of gastroesophageal reflux does not rely on the gender, however, males are projected to encounter a higher pace of complications, related to the ailments. The existence or gastroesophageal in general enhances with age, in particular after age 40.
Growing Geriatric Populace Stays Amid Foremost Boosters for Development of GERD Devices Market
Esophagus misfunctioning in the geriatric populace is related to the disruptions affiliated with esophageal motility as well as a diminished introduction of saliva. Expanding the geriatric populace is likely to as a result stay an imperative aspect fueling the GERD devices market. A few of the regularly consumed medications, for instance, potassium tablets, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and bisphosphonates often impact the esophageal movement as well as the lower esophageal sphincter’s practicality that successively is accountable for requirement development of GERD devices.
Inactive Way of life Shift Carries on to Boost need for GERD Devices
A number of environmental aspects as well as the outstanding lifestyle development to inactive habit, for instance, a higher dietary obese intake, scanter dinner-to-bed time, in addition to recurrent alcohol and smoking consumption are proven as the higher hazard aspects related with the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux diseases. Absence of ample physical exercise, together with growing BMI (body mass index) as well as obesity, are anticipated to carry on expanding the cases of gastroesophageal reflux diseases, in this manner bringing forth need for GERD devices.

Thierry Henry (also known as Terry Henry, Leonard Nemoy, Gunther from Friends) is a French magician who has upset a lot of Irish people recently, who have been found pinning their hate upon Henry, rather than the referee or linesmen who have blindly missed the incident. Terence Heinrich, to friends, came clean after the match because he's such a great guy.[citation needed] He has also shot to superstardom worldwide not only for his handball prowess, but also for his part in showcasing The Worlds Strangest Looking Heads.
edit Early Life
He was born in a very Lakeland,fl neighborhood of Lrance, called Les Willies, renowned for its gay gangs. Though the presence of the gang complicated Henry's choice of clothing, there was no violence apart from The Handbags Massacre of 1984,which killed the Les Willies Westide Leader .Henry disproved Einstein's Theory of Relativity when he ran faster than the speed of light, however, it was later thought that he may have cheated by using his hands. This curvature of spacetime contorted his lips into a 5 dimensional wormlike being with a mind of its own. He was pushed into football by his father, O. Henry, who foresaw his ability to score hundreds of goals by hand against teams who no one have heard of (due to their inability to use proper grammar, let alone hear of teams).

Henry met Stefano, than became AWESOME!!!! scoring outrageously extraordinary goals after hypnotizing defenders with his psychedelic lip movements, for a club called Arsenal. His most famous goal is the one scored against a club called Manchester United, when he volleyed over goalkeepers' head with his back turned towards goal, while his eyes were closed and his hands were tied behind his back. The goalkeeper, Foolian Barthez, watched frozen as he thought Henry was blowing him a kiss. Henry has gained a reputation of being a cheeky cunt, as he once convinced a referee to allow a goal he scored before kick off. Instant replays confirmed that indeed, the match was yet to begin.
However, his real claim to fame is noted in the 100 women night. Because he is such a pimp, one night after another Arsenal anal-rapage of Tottensuck, he went to the local bar. While there he reportedly impregnanted 100 women. And then, after those children were born, he created a country for them and called it Andorra.
Henry now plays for FC Barcelona along with superstars such as Ronaldinho, Diego Messi, Samuel L. Eto'o, Funk Rijykaard, and Alfredo Di Stefano De Iniesta. He lists his influences as Marradona, Leonid Stadnyk, Lothar and the Hand People and Michael Jordan.
edit Betrayal
Henry left Arsenal for FC Barcelona in the summer of 2007, one year after he swore on David Beckham that he will never ever leave Arsenal, even if he is offered the post of God of the Universe. Since his betrayal, his lips have lost their magical powers and thus he only scores shitty goals that no one favorites on youTube, not even Ruud van Nistelrooy. Henry found out that la liga, despite its reputation, is shit compared to the premier league, there for he was raped by messi's tiny penis at Barcelona, because messi has 99 dribbling on fifa 11, much superior to Thierry henry's, which barely reaches a respectable level. Furthermore, messi tied him to a bed and wiped the semen of arsenal fans all over his chest, because messi discourages disloyalty. This will also happen to Cesc fabregas if he chooses the same path.
Henry lost the 2006 Champions League Final with Arsenal to FC Barcelona as the referees were offered 27 cathelico teenage virgins if FC Barracuda wins the match. Henry lips got very agitated due to this and spewed out abuse to its future teammates while simultaneously swelling to unimaginable proportions in the post match interview. It holds the Sky Sports record for The Biggest Whine After Playing Like Total Absolute Pure Piss (Trademark).
There are reams more to tell, but The Lips are watching... Its usually impossible for lips to watch, but Henry's Lips are metaphysical entities.
I am watching you...
edit The Match Against Ireland
The Irish played football like that for ages.
Ireland should have qualified for the 2010 world cup, but France (Thierry Henry) wrecked their chances by beating the Irish at their own game and throwing it to William Gallas who busted the net with a Over 9000 mph hour header from 0.000000001 meters away. There was a hint of offside in the build-up but from certain angles, he was level.
“I zid not doo eet oun pearpuss”
“Bollocks! The French would have won on penalties anyway.”
“Who cares? I'd rather watch Luxembourg in the World Cup than watch those Irish cloggers”
“Ha-ha,ha-ha,ha-ha,ha-ha...ha!”
“I am a cheeeeting cunt”
Henry tried to save his dignity by saying that it would be only fair for France to have extra special treatment during the world cup, and a rematch with Ireland, on condition that the referee would be bribed by FIFA beforehand and Henry would have both his hands tied behind his back with a frog scrotum so the Irish could not blame him.
“This just proves that if you put enough black guys on a football pitch, they will start playing basketball”
edit Basketball/Handball Career
Henry recently embarked on a lucrative career combining handball and basketball. This was paid for by FIFA, the world authority on Football. Or Soccerball if you are a Yankee Doodle. Henry was fully backed by FIFA's president Michelle Platini, to incorporate these hand sports into Football. International referees were told to completely ignore these tactics. As a result of this strange and controversial sport combination, Henry has now been listed as Ireland's most wanted man. The UN, under extreme pressure from the worldwide Irish community, has declared the period up until the the 2010 World Cup in South Africa "Frog Hunting Season". The severed head of any member of the French national "football" team is worth 1 billion old Irish Punts, with Henry being worth 10 billion. There is also an online petition, pleading with Interpol to have Henry beaten to death with his own arm by a blind Irish nun over a period of 6 months.As a result of this, france invaded Ireland, but was quickly defeated by an army of hungry leprechauns.
edit Filmography
Thierry Henry will be starring in a film about his injustice,cheating and outright selfishness towards the Irish football team and screwing there chance to go on and retain the World Cup they had won againts Soviet Russia in 1845. How ever Va Va Frog ruled out speculation of production for the film insisting he wants to consontrate on his handball career. Luckily Samuel L. Jackson spilled the snails by mentioning the film in a recent interview. Samuel went on to say he would playing William Gallas in the blockbuster tipped movie say William will not be available as he will be more then likely crying. The movie is titled The Hand That Rocks The Orish and is set be under production in 2076.

Every now and then, you have a moment where the only possible response is to stare blankly and say, “oh, shite.” I point this out because no sooner had I scaled the ladder into the hay loft than I was faced with just such a moment.
My head had just popped over the edge of the floor to see a ragged-looking dwarf, what little of him was visible behind the matted clumps of his grey beard. He looked almost as surprised to see me as I was to see that things were not exactly as I expected. I have to say, he recovered more quickly than I did.
“Ye’re no’ one o’ th’ Defias, lad, so if’n ye’d help meh git oot o’ here, Ah’d greatly ‘preciate it.”
I stared blankly for several seconds and then said, “Oh, shite.” There was a filthy pallet, a tin plate and not much else, save for the dwarf himself, in the hay loft. As for the dwarf, he wasn’t going anywhere due to the giant iron ball shackled to his ankle on a very short chain.
I got all the way up the ladder and moved for the lock on the shackle, already taking my lock picks from my belt, “Yeah, sure, just give me a minute to get this open.”
The dwarf moved around to block me from getting at the lock, “Ah wouldn’ advise ‘at, lad. If’n ‘twere ‘at simple Ah’d o’ freed mehself ‘afore noo. Th’ lock’s warded so it kin only be opened wit’ th’ key.”
I glared and put my picks away, “And where will I find this key?”
“Th’eadman ‘ere’s got it. Ye’ll wanna be careful, though. Tha’ bugger’s a demon-lover, sure.”
Great. A warlock. Here. In the middle of nowhere. It figured. I swear, if my inherent good-nature has gotten me nearly killed once, it’s gotten me nearly killed a hundred times. In this case, it didn’t matter if the dwarf was even Zoltan Brass or not, he was obviously a prisoner of the Defias, which meant he deserved to be set free. From a warlock. Note to self: never leave my gun behind again.
During the war, the SAS had gotten plenty of experience dealing with warlocks, both living and undead. We’d found that the easiest way to deal with a warlock was to have one guy hide with a gun and another bunch of guys to hide nearby. When the warlock was near the ambuscade, the gunman would fire, hopefully scoring a hit, which would usually throw the warlock off his game enough that the guys waiting in ambush would jump out and proceed to butcher the living, or unliving, crap out of the warlock until all that was left was a few twitching pieces.
Facing a warlock alone, your best plan was to run as fast as your legs could carry you until you joined up with a group of mates who had a gun.
“Anything else I should know?” I asked, more than a little peevishly. I was perfectly willing to rescue the guy, but facing down with a warlock wasn’t my idea of a good time, especially since I wasn’t getting paid.
“Watch oot fer ‘is wee imp. Tha’ li’l bastard’s twice as mean as ‘e is ugly.”
“And the good news just keeps on coming,” I grumbled, “All right, I’ll be back as soon as I can, just keep your head down.”
“Good luck,” I heard him say as I climbed back down the ladder. Honestly, I was amazed none of the bodies had been discovered yet. That spoke volumes about how long the Defias had been out here and how firmly entrenched they were. They had been here long enough that they were lax enough for occasional disappearances to not be investigated.
I drew one of my swords and moved to the door of the stables to examine my options. I needed to get to the main farmhouse, but to do so I would have to cover a good thirty yards of open ground. With the whole encampment slowly coming awake, that was low on my list of good ideas. The farmhouse itself was a two-story design commonly built by moderately successful farmers. All the common areas were on the ground floor and the bedrooms on the first floor. There was one entrance, which was guarded and walled off by barricades to further limit access and all the ground floor windows had been boarded up. The upper level windows had been boarded up only halfway, I imagine so they could be used to fire crossbows from. I might have been able to climb up and into one of the windows, but it would be slow and difficult. The boarding didn’t leave a whole lot of space to crawl in through, which really only left the front door as a viable entrance. Oh, boy.
Trying to look casual when you know that at any second crap is going to start flying at you from all directions is a practiced skill. I am proud to say that I have damn near refined it into an art form. Nothing draws attention faster than breaking into a dead run for no discernable reason. Even when you don’t belong somewhere and everyone knows you don’t belong there, sometimes, if you just stroll along looking for all the world like you couldn’t possibly belong anywhere else you confuse people for just long enough for you to get where you’re going and no one is the wiser. Sometimes, it actually works.
One of these days, I really hope it works for me.
I hadn’t taken two steps from the stable when three things happened at the same time. One, someone found one or more corpses and started shouting about it. Two, I was spotted by no less than four separate Defias footmen, who started shouting about it. Three, I started to run and started shouting about it. Everyone else was shouting, I saw no reason not to join in.
Breaking into a dead run, I crossed the distance from the stable to the house in a little more than a dozen strides. My long, half-crazy yell drew the attention of the guard at the door and he turned to see what was going on just in time to see me vault the barricade and launch myself feet-first at his chest. We both went down in a tangle of limbs, but, since I was ready, I was up first. I flicked my sword and opened his tunic from one hip to his opposite shoulder to convince him that following or putting up a fight wasn’t a good idea. The deep gash that opened up his chest probably also helped.
Two crossbow bolts whistled by me and a third thunked into the doorframe, just missing my shoulder. Time was wasting and I couldn’t count on the Defias being poor shots and me being lucky forever. It took three solid applications of boot to door to finally get the latch to give way. In those precious few seconds, another half dozen bolts had very firmly embedded themselves in the barricade and door.
As the door crashed in, I rolled forward, disappointing the Defias and his crossbow who’d been eagerly waiting for me to outline myself in the doorway for him. His bolt whizzed by over my head and out the door. I heard a yelp from outside and hoped someone else had been hit. I sprang forward from my crouch and buried my sword in his gut in the same movement. Kicking him away, I slammed the door shut and jammed a chair under the ruined latch. That should work to keep the bulk of the Defias off my back while I looked for this warlock.
I had just taken the third step on the stairs when another Defias decided to take a shot at me. He used the more traditional large axe, however, taking a chunk out of the wooden stair as I leapt forward to avoid his blow. Standing on the fourth step, I expected to have a significant advantage over the Defias on the floor. Instead, the near giant facing me was fairly staring me in the chest. I tried to plant the heel of my boot into his nose, but he managed to step back in time to avoid it. That at least gave me the room I needed to get off the stairs and square off on even footing. Normally, it’s good to have the high ground, but when that high ground is very narrow and limits your movement significantly, it’s better to have space to move around, even if it does put you almost a foot lower than your foe.
The saying about things being bigger falling harder is partially true; larger foes do tend to be heavier and thus fall harder. Of course, the reason they fall is usually because they came up against a smaller, sneakier and just plain meaner fighter. I hoped that would be the case here. The room we were fighting in didn’t leave the Defias much room to really make good use of his giant axe. His sheer size, coupled with the small size of the room meant he couldn’t really unleash the wide, powerful swings that would have probably split me cleanly in half, should one land. Still, the large chunks he was taking out of the floor, walls and furniture as I dodged around showed that even without his full strength behind it, one blow would be more than enough to take care of me.
I didn’t have too many options, but I knew what I wanted to do, provided an opening presented itself. Jumbo wasn’t looking too keen on giving me any opportunity to get close enough to put my deadly flashing blade to use, so I was going to have to make the opening myself. I leapt back just as the massive axe crashed down where I had so recently been standing. Back in the mud room, even smaller than the living room, it was time to make my move. Jumbo was winding up to take another swing when I did the last thing he expected.
I leapt at him.
Well, not exactly at him, but toward him. I kicked off the wall and used my free hand to use the Defias’ shoulder to swing around behind him. The precious seconds it took him to realize what I had just done were seconds he didn’t have. The tip of my sword easily cut through his trousers and the tendons at the back of his knees. He fell hard and screaming, though even that was cut short when I pulled his head back and opened his neck. He crashed to the floor and died quietly in the expanding pool of his own blood.
Grimacing, I turned back for the stairs. I still had more bloody work to do.
There was no doubt that the warlock upstairs knew something was going on. From the crashing of the door, to the fighting and screaming, there was no way he couldn’t know something was up. Further, I was all but certain I would be walking into a deathtrap at the top of the stairs. Unfortunately, if I wanted to know what the Twilight’s Hammer cult was up to and get more information on Atalanta, I needed to free the dwarf. To free the dwarf, I had to kill the warlock. So much easier said than done.
Everything I had learned about fighting warlocks during the Third War told me that the worst possible thing I could do would be to try to fight him on his home turf. If I had any other option, I would have been delighted to have taken it. Bad enough I didn’t have the necessary hardware, but to go waltzing in to where I was surely going to be expected was damn near as close to suicidal as I could think.
You can understand that suicide has never been very high on my list of things to do.
I crept as near to the top of the stairs as I had to in order to get a peek and what might be waiting for me. Surprisingly, no eldritch horror from the depths of the Twisting Nether waited to peel my face off and wear it as a mask. What was there was a sitting area of the sort that young couples could use to spend time together without being in private, yet not be bothered by the rest of the family. Sitting at the small table was a man who had to be the warlock, though he didn’t quite fit the image of warlocks that I carried in my head.
In the war, warlocks came in three flavours: orc, undead and cultist. The cultists tended to be human, but because of their chosen lifestyle also tended to be pale, malnourished things hiding in voluminous robes. Orc and undead warlocks tended to decorate themselves in the bones of their enemies, as well as being varying shades of green or grey, respectively. The man sitting at the table met none of these criteria.
He was probably my age, putting him somewhere around thirty or so, and wore his dark blonde hair in the shaggy style popular among the well-to-do of the young and wealthy of Stormwind. He had a well-trimmed mustache and beard, cut in the Booty Bay style that just outlined his jaw, probably in an attempt to look either more sinister or more mature. There was a roundness to his face that, without the beard, would make him look much younger than he was. He wore a stylish jacket, shirt, trousers and boots of varying shades of dark blue and white, though the style was of the sort that was popular in Stormwind high society a few years past. In all, he looked more the part of a down-on-his-luck noble than a half-crazed demon-lover. Maybe I could even convince him to be reasonable.
“You might as well show yourself,” he said loudly enough to be heard over the banging on the door down below while mopping up the last traces of yolk from his plate with the edge of his toast, “I know you’re lurking down there.” He didn’t sound at all asthmatic like most of the warlocks I’d encountered in the past. In fact, he sounded more like he could be shouting strident orders across the battlefield just as well as summoning up abominations from the deepest nether. He wore his Lordaeron accent like a badge of honour.
He was right in that there was no point in hiding. It’s not like I could have come from any other direction or make the noise downstairs suddenly cease. I stepped to the top of the stairs, my sword held loose and casually in my hand to appear to be less threatening to use it and more stating that yes, I do have a sword.
The warlock made a big show of wiping his mouth in his napkin and setting it aside before very obviously looking me up and down. With the copious helpings of attitude he was dishing out, he had either been a noble in Lordaeron or had desperately wanted to be one.
“So you’re the one responsible for all the shouting, then,” he sniffed dismissively and stood from the table, “You certainly don’t look like much, but you obviously have some measure to skill to have bested Sigurd.” He moved from behind the table and rested his hand on the latch to the door that lead further back into the living quarters, “I don’t suppose you’d like to tell me what this is all about before you die, hm?”
Finally able to get a word in edgewise, I said, “Actually, I was thinking that no one had to die, well, no one else, anyway,” I put on my most winning smile and spread my hand in a picture of innocence, though I suspect the sword in my right hand spoiled the effect somewhat, “I’m just here for the dwarf. Give me the key to his shackles and I’ll be on my way.”
“Ah, a rescue mission, then. Well, I’m sorry to disappoint you, but Brass is property of the Defias now and I’d have to do an awful lot of explaining I’d rather not do if I were to give him up,” the warlock sighed heavily, almost as if it really did pain him that he couldn’t give up the key, “However, since you had the decency to speak before charging to your inevitable demise, I’ll give you this chance to escape. Provided you can get by the guards downstairs, of course, but I won’t kill you.”
Either he was that sure of his abilities or very unsure, it was hard to tell which. Of course, it really could be that he just fancied himself as that much of a gentleman. Whatever the case, as much as I didn’t want to have to fight a warlock, I needed to know what Brass did and I wasn’t going to get that without freeing him. Damned if I do…
I smiled, calm and easy once more and made half a turn toward the stairs, “Your offer is very tempting,” a pair of throwing knives were already leaving my left hand, “but I’ll have to pass this time!”
I was lunging after the knives, my other sword in my hand before I’d even taken a full step. The warlock, to his credit, first spoke an ugly, guttural word and then started swearing. The way my knives bounced off the sudden sickly green sheen covering his body, I’d have to guess he cast some sort of shield on himself. My sword was barely two handbreadths from landing when my legs just weren’t underneath me any longer and I was being introduced to the wall in a very forceful way.
I heard another guttural grunt from the warlock, followed by a voice like a tomb’s breath saying, “I obey.”
I didn’t have time to drag myself to my feet, though the same ice-cold hand that had gripped my leg a moment before now clasped around the back of my neck. That same icy grip cleared up the stars I was seeing rather quickly as well. I didn’t even bother to fight against the grip. I had a good idea what I was up against already, which was immediately confirmed when the voidwalker held me before the baleful glow of its golden eyes. Brass had warned me about the warlock’s imp, he could have mentioned the voidwalker, too.
“It livesss,” the demon groaned, turning to face the warlock and proffering me forward.
The problem with voidwalkers is that they’re almost impossible to fight in the traditional way. They’re pretty much nothing more than shadows and mist bound into a vaguely humanoid form and have the ability to make themselves solid or incorporeal at will. Magic is the best way to deal with them, or, failing that, a serious magical weapon. Plain old steel, like I carried, was about as useful as a toothpick against a dragon. There was a way to fight them without magical assistance, it was just very difficult.
The warlock chuckled and took a few moments to gloat, though he was tragically smart enough to stay well outside the reach of my sword, “I’ll give you credit, noob, you were almost fast enough. Fortunately, Juk’Thang here is just a bit faster. The Defias could certainly use a man of your talents; you could go far with us. Unlike your current predicament.”
I made a show of thinking about the offer, if for no other reason than to buy time. The voidwalker still held me like an oversize ragdoll in one fist, one of its binding bracers directly behind my head. Interestingly, the voidwalker had done nothing to incapacitate me in any way, simply holding me up by the scruff of my neck. Painful though that was, it wasn’t quite enough to immobilize me.
“You make a very convincing argument,” I said, just before grabbing hold of the bracer behind my head and using it to get enough leverage to kick both heels at the bracer’s mate on the demon’s other arm, “But I’m afraid I’m not available at the moment!” The voidwalker reacted in what I figured was its instinctive way, becoming significantly less corporeal in response to the attack. The bracer went flying, I, quite literally, slipped through its fingers and the demon’s cohesion seemed to loosen significantly. I gave a hard yank on the other bracer, pulling it free of the voidwalker’s form. The demon roared in triumph and quickly dissipated, fading away back to wherever it is that voidwalkers come from.
Feeling proud of my cunning, I rose to face the warlock, giving him my best smug face. He gave me two ugly grunts and a smug smirk of his own while I howled in agony and fell to the floor, twitching and writhing. I’ve since learned that the modern warlock isn’t very much like his cousins from the war. For one thing, they have a lot more tricks up their sleeves. Tricks like curses they can cast with a single demonic word. As a note, just in case you were wondering, they hurt a lot.
Through the haze of pain wrapping around me, I could see the warlock moving toward me with glacial slowness. I’m not sure if that was because of the pain or if he was actually moving that slowly. I’m pretty sure it was the pain, though I could be wrong. The warlock had a wickedly curved dagger in his hand as he approached and I was certain I knew what he planned to do with it. I was equally certain that I wasn’t going to like it one bit.

WOO HOOO!!!! Worth the wait! God I love these stories!
The return of Saturday morning serials?
@Dradis
Glad you like it and you think it was worth the wait. I'll try to get the next chapter up in less than three months...
@Morane
Perhaps...if I could manage a post every week on Saturday...
Hmm...maybe I could make that a goal...
I'm so glad to see you've posted another chapter. Can't wait for the next one. Great stuff.
MisneachHoke was top notch at this aspect of his job.
Roll Tide - War Eagle
Moving forward (and upside down) even when you don't want to.
What is this... Rotten.com? Faces of death? Foff for posting this crap...
-------------
Ok, so my comment trying to point out that a video of 15 or so people flying out of bed of a truck possibly to their death is off topic but the video itself is? Oh wait, I get it. In Alabama they ride around in the bed of trucks... real creative there.
Can we get a link or a story or something?
bullshit they have had one competitive game last year out of all the years and I can't listen to so many southern people talk at once.
This movie is great.
Love how Cam claims he cant' talk due to ongoing investigation (It was filmed in July 2011)...then he gives this sly smile
Very suspicious ;)
I was thinking the same thing. That smile he gave was really weird, considering the circumstances.
Not really sure how a rivalry between a national power and a regional also-ran is the top rivalry in sports, especially with all the cheating they do.
That's not fair to Ohio State. They played some pretty good games* recently.
Who Auburn? Oh wait...yes. The 2 national titles ever thing.
It's just so funny how loaded with shit this documentary is. Cam Newton's smirk says it all. "I can't really talk about it because like they say, it's an ongoing ivestigation."
"I saw that they put a scam newton jersey on the bear bryant statue, so I poisoned the toomers trees." "Is that...illegal?" "You think I care?"
"Alabama accusing Auburn of cheating is like Snookie telling Halle Berry she's ugly." - Charles Barkley
Most of the movie consists of hilarious Southern trash talking on the radio about the opposing fanbase, as well as various highlights.
The ending was pretty touching too, the two tragedies which briefly unified the fanbases.
Won't say it's the best rivalry in college football, but this was a pretty damn good movie.
Thank god I am not from that state...wow
I can not believe Harvey Updike (the guy who poisoned toomer's trees) named his kids: bear bryant, crimson tide, and ally bama. you just can't make this stuff up.
pretty good documentary. definitely glad i don't belong to either of those fan bases
I like the part where everybody was ripping on him. Good television.
Not even close to as good as the Michigan-Ohio docmentary on HBO.
This makes me Proud to be a Michigan fan. I wear my Go Blue gear all around tuscaloosa knowing i am better than these fools!
I have it recorded. I was born and raised in Birmingham Alabama. For some reason though I was born to be a Michigan Man. Ive seen the rilvary first hand being that for the longest it was played at Legion Field in B'ham. Without watching I already know if ESPN gave an accurate account of how crazy people are, I will be greatly embarrassed at work tomorrow
Having gone to high school in Alabama (thankfully Alabama was in the middle of a long streak of getting dominated by Auburn, so they weren't as insufferable as they are now), I can attest to a lot of what was in the documentary...it truly is crazy down there when it comes to this game. I'm definitely not saying it's better than Michigan-Ohio State, but you're truly missing out if you haven't been to an Iron Bowl. I went in 2009 when a mediocre Auburn almost upset the eventual national champs...pretty awesome experience. But yeah, the overall derpiness of the fanbases, the history of rampant cheating, and Auburn's second-tier status as a program put this rivalry below Michigan-Ohio State for sure (although on a pure hatred level, the two are easily comparable).
That said, the people that call into the Finebaum show (i.e. all the of people yelling and cussing throughout the documentary haha) represent the craziest of the crazies in the state, which is saying something. A lot of people are pretty insane but those folks are the absolute worst by a country mile.
Didn't think it was that good. You can sense the dislike between Mich-OSU, but this doc just sounded like a bunch of hicks screeching at each other.
and she was insufferable during the program. arggghhh
to parents from Michigan. Within a few days of being born my parents were asked to 'declare' their loyalty. Of course my parents had no clue, but Auburn was pretty good then and they lived closer to Auburn than Bama and had a couple good friends who were Auburn fans. So I and my parents were declared Auburn fans.
Their Alabama friends immediately quit talking to them, some they never saw again.
I honestly think Michigan/MSU is as big or bigger, we just don't get carried away with it like they do down there. Its their own world and you better not intrude on it.
Because the teams aren't bigger. There may be more hate, because 100% of their fans are unhinged. It'd be like if Ohio State could play Ohio State in a rivalry game.
our rivalry with osu barely gets any media attention anymore, fuck espn and their hard on for bama and SEC
they have won the NC the last two years.
ESPN was calling OSU/Um the greatest rivalry in sports right before the 2006 game.
I feel compelled and somewhat qualified to weigh in.
First, I live in Birmingham, 1 hour from Tuscaloosa and a little under two from Auburn, and I have lived year a total of twelve years.
Second, I lived in Columbus for 14 years - a diehard Michigan fan. I also graduated from Alabama in '04.
Here are my observations...when comparing the two rivalries, based on what I have seen over the years.
On the hatred scale, I would say AU/UA. The UM/OSU rivalry plays for a lot of pride and the rivalry goes back a LONG time. For the most part, it has been pretty even since WW2. AU/UA hate each other because Auburn is Alabama's little brother. Auburn has been generaly inferior over the last several decades and Alabama is arrogant about it. So the hatred is very obvious. Add the redneck factor and its pretty bad.
On how good the teams are and tradition, UM/OSU definitely. I don't have to tell anyone about Michigan's records on NCs, but OSU has a lot too. 7 or 8 I think? Alabama has a lot too, but Auburn does not. They do not have near the history of the other teams. In fact, as long as I have lived here, there has been very few times the two teams have played at the end of the year where both teams were even ranked in the top 25.
Also, UM and OSU fans generally route for the other teams in the conference. UA/AU dont care, and even want other SEC teams to lose every game. I personally would like to see OSU and UM win every game and then UM beat the shit out of OSU in The Game every year.
On hype, tie. You may not hear as much up there about this game, but this whole state shuts down when these teams play. For both rivalries, it is the last game of the year and if any of the teams lose a game, the season turns into "All that matters is if we beat..."
National Perception - UM/OSU. Easy one.
When I get into this argument with friends, the most consistant argument I hear is, "how can they be that big of rivals when they aren't in the same state?" and they liken it to OU/Texas, although we all know its a way better rivalry than the shootout.
I am a Michigan fan, so I am biased, but based on the above, I would give the nod to UM/OSU. Legendary coaches, tradition, national power houses, national perception. I would put Alabama in this catagory with UM and OSU, but not Auburn - except for 2004 and 2010, Auburn is a perennial 9-4 team.Choose.
In a recent lecture, Prof. Arnd Krüger of the University of Göttingen, who covered the Munich Olympics as a journalist and claimed to have known some of the murdered Israeli athletes, compared the decision made by the sportsmen to stay in the Olympic village despite the known threat to their safety to the decision made by the Jews to stay in Hebron during the 1929 Palestine riots.
Speaking to Yedioth Ahronoth on Saturday, Krüger denied ever saying he believed the Israeli mission to the Munich Olympics knew that it would be targeted, but added that "one has to assume that the sportsmen who stayed in the village knew it had poor security.

The Shenendehowa Board of Education appointed Wood principal of the 650-student school by unanimous vote Tuesday, Nov. 14. Wood has been principal of Shaker Road Elementary School for five years and has been with the South Colonie School district for 12 years. She was also an associate principal at Lisha Kill Middle School for two years.
Wood went through an interview process that involved three rounds of interviews and a site visit to Shaker Road Elementary School.
Kelly DeFeciani, Shenendehowa district spokesperson, said that Wood was among five well-qualified finalists.
What set Elizabeth apart was that she had been principal of an elementary school and opened a library, said DeFeciani.
South Colonie School District Superintendent Michael Marcelle said that
Wood was notable for the relationships that she developed with parents and the Shaker Road PTA.
"She made a definite impact," Marcelle said. "Whenever I talked to PTA officers, the feedback was positive."
Shatekon Elementary School will open in September 2007, and Wood has plenty to do before opening day. The new school will bring changes, and the Shenendehowa School District is in the process of re-drawing elementary school boundaries.
Wood said she expects to work closely with the Shenendehowa administrative team and redistricting committee to provide a smooth transition for new students.
"Every school will be affected by redistricting, and it will be important to create a warm, welcoming environment to help ease the transition to a new school," she said.
The 34-year-old mother of two said she is ready graduate to a larger school district.
She will be responsible for 250 more students at Shatekon Elementary School. She said that the Shenendehowa Central School District is supportive.

OpenIDStill bruised from a weak sharemarket, small investors have been in no mood to approve big fee increases for chairmen of small industrial companies. But this has not stopped some board members receiving hefty raises.
He will do much better this financial year, with a board fee review increasing his base fees from $47,500 to $220,000 in April.
Southern Cross’s average annual total shareholder return over three years is minus 6 per cent. The television and radio operator posted an 11 per cent increase in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to $129.8 million in its latest full-year result.
Clothing manufacturer
MacKenzie’s current board fees are $425,000, after shareholders approved an annual $500,000 increase in the maximum aggregate amount paid to non-executive directors.
As directors were paid more, the Pacific Brands board adopted a recommendation to freeze pay for all salaried employees, apart from in exceptional circumstances. Pacific Brands’ three-year average annual shareholder return is minus 23 per cent.
Fashion retailer
Some chairmen’s pay packets look modest compared with company performance.
As chairman, he will receive $160,000 after a small lift in director fees last financial year. Shares in the fast-growing discount retailer have performed strongly this year: the one-year total shareholder return is 39 per cent.
The Australian Financial ReviewMy sister-in-law, Bev, who was with Heidi most of the day on Thursday before Daniel could get to the hospital, took this picture right before Heidi went into surgery.
(Goodness, if you could see pictures of me whenever I have been in the hospital you'd know I NEVER LOOKED THAT GOOD. (Face it, my hair never looks that good. Heidi has always been GREAT with her hair--actually, she was forced to learn to do something, after all she had a mother that did a horrible job with her hair when she was young ; )
On Saturday, one of my friends who along with her husband is serving a mission at the Family History Center, went up to the hospital to visit her. She sent me an e-mail and wrote:
"We were able to see Heidi this evening and were expecting to see her lying there looking pale and ill but instead we walked in and she looked like she was going to a prom! She was sitting up in bed and had her hair all cute in an updo and earrings and was reading her scriptures! How is that for a picture."
Thanks, Elder and Sister W., for going up there and visiting her. Thanks also to my sister-in-law, Bev, who has been right there. It's wonderful to have family and friends who are willing to be your hands when you can't be there.
Thanks, Elder and Sister W., for going up there and visiting her. Thanks also to my sister-in-law, Bev, who has been right there. It's wonderful to have family and friends who are willing to be your hands when you can't be there.
I love this girl so much. While she has been in the hospital, she has had to embrace several words and phrases: patience, hopefully, give it time, etc. I know it has been difficult but she and Daniel have maintained such a positive attitude. (I am so grateful he is right there with her)
SIDENOTE: I received a photo CD from Elder Rob. Love this picture of he and his Zone on P Day when they went to play Laser Tag. (He's in the back in the yellow shirt ; )
Also, just to assure me that he is getting plenty to eat, he sent this one:

A good attitude helps a lot in my opinion! Good for Heidi!
Time is going by fast! Your Little Elder is past the halfway mark now right?
I am so glad that Heidi is being well taken care of... even though you cannot be there. Family and friends scattered all around is a good thing.
That was one comfort I had when Celestial announced that she was moving to Indiana... that my baby sister is just 3 1/2 hours away.
Love the photos of your Elder. *Ü*
Yesterday a young Mother passed away... she grew up in the same town as me... was my sister's age... 45 years young. Her son is on a mission in Puerto Rico. I am glad that he is not alone there. What a tough time for this sweet family.
ToOdLeS.
I am so happy to hear that Heidi is doing well and that she is being looked after by many loving family and friends - not to mention her sweet husband (You can just see in his face how he adores her!). I never looked that good in a hospital picture either.
Love the picture of the Elders - boys will be boys right? So cute.
She is such a beauty! I was going to email today to check her status. I hope she can leave the hospital soon.
It's good Elder Robb is getting plenty to eat!
I hope she can leave soon! I think she is very much like you in her attitude!! Elder Rob looks great!! Lov ethe missionary pictures!! God Bless your family.
You can tell by Heidi's countenance that she is a peaceful person. She radiates something special... even through photographs. I will continue praying for her and your family.
Elder Rob looks good! Still wishing I could help fatten him up! When will he get transferred here?!?!
Oh mom--you are WAY TOO SWEET as always!!! YOU ARE TRULY AMAZING!!! I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUCH!!! Thank you to everyone for your prayers and kindness--I have definitely felt it! Thank you mom for always being there for me and reminding me I am never alone--I love you TONS:)
So glad that Heidi is doing OK. Her attitude will be the best thing she can do to heal.
Family and friends are wonderful and it sounds like yours are the best.
Elder Rob looks like he is surviving in our cold frozen tundra!
Yvonne, I am so sorry to hear that Heidi has been having health issues and is requiring so much surgery. I hope and pray that she will be blessed in all of this to do well through it all, and to heal and recover well afterward. She looks a lot more cheerful than I've ever been a hospital! :-S
Cheers and hugs to all of you.
It's good to see your Elder doing so well, too. ;-)
I'm so glad that Heidi is doing well, and has people there to look after her. I hope everything is okay...
Hi, I came across your blog while perusing my BBFF, Tauna's blog. going down and looking at your stories I looked at Heidi and said "I know her!" I will only give you hints as to how (due to HIPPA) she and her Daniel made my day during the holiday season with the lights that hung at her bedside.
I sure did enjoy getting know her and hear about her brother serving his mission. I too have a son a mission that will be coming home soon 63 days.
Your daughter is beautiful. Tell Heidi and Daniel "hi" from Kim.
Have a great day. :)
Heidi is so darling! I hope she is doing better this week.
Love the pictures of your cute Elder Rob!Best Online Pokies & Real Money Casino Bonuses

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is self-destructive and uncontrollable inflammatory response of the whole body triggered by infection, trauma, or a variety of severe injuries. Although reactive oxygen species play a pivotal role in the development of SIRS, the trials with conventional antioxidants have failed to improve patient outcome. Ceria nanoparticles (CeNPs) have potent, autocatalytic reactive oxygen species scavenging activities, which may have sufficient therapeutic effects for SIRS. Herein, 3 nm CeNPs are fabricated totally in aqueous phase by using 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA) and their Ce3+ to Ce4+ ratio is increased to enhance antioxidative properties. The obtained 6-AHA-CeNPs demonstrate strong antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects in various biofluids and inflammatory cells. In SIRS animal models, 6-AHA-CeNPs are demonstrated to reduce multiple organ injuries and inflammation. Moreover, 6-AHA-CeNPs decrease mortality and improve clinical scores of SIRS models. These findings suggest that 6-AHA-CeNPs have potential as a therapeutic nanomedicine for SIRS.

2 Answers | Add Yours
All Quiet on the Western Front is a coming of age story of the youth of the 1910's. The students, Paul and his classmates, Muller, Kropp and Leer joined the army at the urging of their schoolmaster, Kantorek. The schoolmaster is among those of the older generation who encouraged the boys to sign up for the army. Many adults, parents included, encouraged enlistment, even going so far as to call the boys cowards if they did not. As the young men learn what it is to be forced to grow up, so quickly, in the face of war, another irony comes forth. That is the wisdom of the soldiers compared to the foolish ideas of Kantorek and the generation before them, who portray a festive like attitude towards war.
It is clear that the boys joined up at the intense urging of their schoolmaster, Kantorek; as well, the adults in their lives, such as their parents, all stressed the glory of joining up and the duty that the boys had to their country. It is telling that the first one to die, Joseph Behm, was the one who held out the longest from being convinced to join. The fact that Remarque makes this point is evidence that he believes the youths were falsely mislead into believing that the war was about defending the "Fatherland" and all of propaganda that the German government promoted. Instead, the boys led gruesome existences, followed by death, one by one. I would argue that this novel is not a coming of age novel in the classic sense of the term; instead, based on the fact that Paul Baumer repeatedly stresses that he and his friends had "no chance" at their lives, no chance to have a family, no chance to be in love, no chance at life, period, the novel's central message is that was strips young men of everything. They all die.

The product is designed to address the most common digestive problems that people face today. Over time, one’s gut health begins to deteriorate for several reasons. To remedy this, one must ensure that their diet comprises a variety of natural sources capable of naturally removing any internal pollutants. Most modern diets, on the other hand, are lacking of the nutrients required to improve intestinal health.
To notice considerable improvement, people are now recommended to use natural supplements like this one. SynoGut, like other supplements on the market, contains a wide range of natural components. The developers have concentrated on the creation of a unique formula that has previously produced great effects for its users. Users can receive therapy for any ailment as part of this recipe. These are all natural compounds that have been utilised for therapeutic purposes for thousands of years. They are now widely used in Western medicine as well. SynoGut is a supplement that can help people with gut difficulties, particularly digestive symptoms. The developers have indicated that they are the target demographic for the SynoGut supplement, and that when they use it, they would most likely see a good difference.
What Is SynoGut?
SynoGut is a nutritional supplement that assists the digestive system by aiding healthy digestion and metabolism. It comes in the shape of easy-to-swallow capsules. The SynoGut’s natural chemicals have been scientifically confirmed to be safe, and no harm has been done to anyone. Natural laxatives and probiotics are also included in the SynoGut mix to keep digestion in check.Constipation, bloating, gallstones, and stomach discomfort are just a few of the typical factors that impede many individuals from living a happy and comfortable life.
SynoGut has proven to be a successful remedy for a variety of digestive issues, including constipation, bloating, gallstones, and stomach soreness.There are various strategies to boost your gut health, fortunately. You can either attempt natural therapies like increasing your intake of yoghurt.
How Does SynoGut Work?
SynoGut’s natural recipe, which has been thoroughly tested and researched, lies at the heart of the product. According to the creator’s website, digestive disturbances can cause problems with blood flow, which causes nutritional absorption to decrease as many regions of the body fail to acquire the nutrients. To solve this problem, one must not only ensure that nutrients are absorbed, but also that these nutrients are delivered to the organs. This has an effect on one’s immune system as well as their digestive capacities.
SynoGut is a health supplement that focuses on delivering relief from these issues. The pill claims to promote gut health by addressing some of the most common problems that affect that area of the body. This results in: Improved nutritional absorption. As individuals are able to acquire more nutrients, their blood flow improves as well. As a result, a variety of additional digestive disorders are eased. While they may appear to be little adjustments, they are nothing short of a lifesaver for those suffering from digestive issues. As a result, customers may get the most out of SynoGut supplement by using it to its maximum potential.

Protest and democracy in West Germany : extra-parliamentary opposition and the democratic agenda
Burns, Rob, 1949- and Will, Wilfried van der, 1935- (1988) Protest and democracy in West Germany : extra-parliamentary opposition and the democratic agenda. Basingstoke: Macmillan Press. ISBN 0333464842Full text not available from this repository.

Abstract
The Federal Republic of Germany has long been held up as a 'model society' on account of its economic and social policy achievements. Largely ignored, however, has been the crucial part played by extra-parliamentary protest in the maturing of democracy in that society. In this, the first comprehensive study of the subject in English, the authors trace the rich history of political protest in West Germany and examine the political role of critical intellectuals. The book will give the reader a good understanding of the crucial changes that have taken place in the political culture of the Federal Republic since the mid 1960s.

As a result, not all hearing instruments are designed for the same user group. Although cosmetics have always been a strong driver for successful solutions, it is not enough for hearing instruments today just to be small; they must also have an appealing design. Moreover, this must be accomplished without sacrificing the high-end processing features available in other products.
Recent research from MarkeTrak VII1 reveals that about 50% of people who admit to having a hearing loss choose not to use hearing instruments because of stigma issues. The primary reasons given are that hearing instruments are a noticeable admission of hearing loss and an embarrassment. Importantly, respondents also believe that the use of hearing instruments have the societal connotation of “disability” and “aging.”
For younger baby boomer individuals with hearing loss, stigma probably has an even greater effect than indicated in these data. Kochkin1 reports that, when an older person (~75 years old) and a younger person have the same degree of hearing loss, the older person is 3 to 4 times more likely to use hearing instruments, reinforcing the finding that people believe “hearing instruments make you look old.” Yet, it is estimated that 65% of people with hearing loss are under retirement age. Until younger people start wearing hearing instruments, the stigma will remain.
There are two forms of stigma associated with using hearing instruments: an external stigma (what other people see) and an internal stigma (how you feel about yourself).1 In other words, people not only want to look cool, they want to feel cool!
Siemens Vibe is cool; it was designed to attract individuals with mild-to-moderate hearing loss who are finally motivated to seek help, but are not necessarily convinced to accept amplification with traditional devices. Vibe offers a unique design and wearing concept in addition to advanced signal processing.
A New Form Factor for Hearing Instruments
In addition to increasing miniaturization, intelligent hearing instrument design requires engineers to develop products that are appealing in novel ways. Vibe was developed to appeal to individuals with hearing loss who are searching for solutions that don’t necessarily appear to be hearing instruments. To these potential wearers, the device should be viewed as something unrelated to hearing loss, unrelated to disability, unrelated to looking old, and all the associated stigma.
Vibe is a hearing instrument that is worn in the crest of the cymba, using receiver-in-canal (RIC) technology (Figure 1). Although this has proven to be an attractive and efficient placement, this location also provides some benefits unrelated to cosmetic appeal that will be discussed later.
Benefits of Physical Attributes
Fit and comfort. Because Vibe has a unique design, it was important to conduct background research regarding fit and comfort. The cymba, or helix, of the external ear sometimes has been reported to be a sensitive region. Therefore, care was taken in the design of Vibe to ensure a high rate of usability and long-term wearing comfort. In an extensive at-home wearing and comfort field study lasting 2-4 weeks, potential wearers were evaluated at several different sites by a group of hearing instrument professionals (audiologists and hearing instrument specialists) to predict and analyze eventual success in terms of wearing comfort.2 Prior to fitting the instruments, the participating professionals were asked to assess the patient’s ear in terms of firmness of the cartilage, as well as size and depth of the cymba.
The results of the field trial revealed that wearers with softer ear cartilage reported higher initial success with Vibe in terms of physical comfort. For wearers with harder cartilage, higher levels of discomfort were initially reported with Vibe. In addition, subjects with narrow and/or shallow cymba areas did not experience as much comfort initially with Vibe.
Our field study results revealed that approximately 75% of the patients were initially comfortable enough with Vibe to wear it for extended periods of time, as desired. Of the individuals who did not initially rate the wearing of Vibe as “comfortable,” a graduated wearing schedule was proposed (Figure 2). These subjects were given a wearing schedule that dictated no more than 2 hours of wear on the first day, followed by increased wearing time in increments of 15 to 30 minutes per day. At the end of this 2-week acclimatization period, the majority of wearers who initially reported discomfort were able to wear Vibe successfully. In total, fewer than 10% of the prospective wearers were not able to graduate to a full wearing schedule without discomfort, proving that Vibe has widespread application to this population of individuals with mild-to-moderate hearing loss.
An additional component of this field study addressed the security of the fit. There were no reported incidences of the instruments becoming loose or falling out of the ears while used in everyday activities. Vibe’s design allows it to fit in the ear in a way that supports patients’ active lifestyles, without interference from hats, glasses, or other head-worn devices.
Usability. The new instrument was designed for ease of use for patients who have “average” dexterity. A 10A battery is incorporated to maintain the miniaturized form. An easily accessible push button allows patients to access up to four memories. This feature can be used by the patient for different listening conditions, or for individuals who require different amounts of gain during their day, or as a method to control volume adjustments.
There is no on-off switch or battery compartment to open. To turn the device off, the user simply removes the top cover and disengages the battery. If desired, this process can be avoided by using the push button, which also allows the wearer to put the instrument into a “standby” mode by pressing and holding the button for several seconds. Pressing and holding again for several seconds reactivates the device.
Vibe is designed to optimize gain without feedback while providing a smooth and high fidelity frequency response. There are four receiver lengths to fit a wide range of patients. The receiver is coupled with easily replaceable domes, which are also available in four sizes. The professional is able to select various open and closed domes, as appropriate for each patient, with different types of wax protection, including some with C-Guard® barrier technology for effective protection against cerumen, moisture, and debris.
Unique form. With its design, colors, and placement in the ear, Vibe does not appear to be a hearing instrument. This factor greatly reduces the stigma of “looking old” for many prospective wearers. In fact, Vibe is commonly mistaken for earphones used with MP3 players, a Bluetooth® wireless technology headset for mobile phones, or other high-tech devices.
The physical design supports the unique exchangeable cover concept that allows the patient to select from up to 19 different colors and patterns to suit their personality, wardrobe, or style (Figure 3). Additional colors and patterns are planned in the future to enhance the palette of offerings. Each Vibe package is equipped with a special handling tool that makes it easy to remove and exchange the covers as desired (Figure 4).
Acoustic Benefits of New Form Factor
So far, we have mostly discussed the unique physical attributes of Vibe. But there is another type of stigma that also is associated with hearing instruments: that they don’t work very well, or at the least do not work very well when background noise is present. Vibe’s design and function, therefore, not only support superior cosmetic appeal, ease of use, and acceptance, but also acoustic advantages not possible with some other forms. In addition, the known signal processing advantages of other Siemens products have been included.
Natural ear acoustics. Pinna and concha effects are helpful for localization, and to some extent in improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when noise is located behind the listener. These beneficial effects are often compromised with more traditional hearing instruments since the ear canal is plugged with a custom earmold. The physical location of Vibe in the ear allows for the restoration of this natural directivity. Because the microphone opening of Vibe is located in the crest of the cymba, natural pinna and concha effects are evident.
Figure 5 illustrates the directivity index (DI) of Vibe (omnidirectional microphone) compared to the open ear. The pattern of directivity is very similar, and averages around 2 dB for the higher frequencies. (Note: because it is an open fitting, there is little or no gain in the lower frequencies, and therefore a positive DI would not be expected.) The significance of the 2 dB of directivity becomes more pronounced when this finding is compared with the DI of an open BTE product. Notice that, because of the microphone placement of the BTE instrument, the DI is around -2 dB in the high frequencies—4 dB poorer than Vibe.
Open-canal fitting. As mentioned earlier, Vibe is designed for individuals with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Many of these patients have normal or near-normal hearing in the lower frequencies, and an open-canal (OC) fitting may be appropriate. The advanced feedback cancellation algorithm of the device makes it an excellent choice for this type of application. The advantages of an OC fitting are numerous. These include, but are not limited to, improved comfort, use of residual ear canal resonance, elimination of the occlusion effect, more natural sounding own voice, and improved speech quality.3,4
Using flexible tubing and soft domes in various sizes, patients can experience a higher degree of comfort with OC devices, such as Vibe. Our research has shown a fitting range in the OC configuration similar to that of other OC instruments. As with any style of OC fitting, there are cases where more gain is needed, and the advantages of open fitting must be compromised due to acoustic feedback issues. In these cases, a more closed dome can be easily applied.
Advanced signal processing. Advanced signal processing in eight independent channels is offered. In the programming software, access is available to all eight channels for adjustment of gain and frequency response. There are four handles available for the different frequency regions to adjust compression for optimizing loudness perceptions. In addition, a multi-channel compression system provides an expanded dynamic range using multi-channel output compression. This allows the optimization of the residual auditory area, increasing headroom and maximizing the wearer’s dynamic range, while still preventing loud sounds from becoming uncomfortably loud.
The Siemens Speech and Noise Management systems are standard for Vibe instruments and are proven to provide more comfortable listening in noise without any detrimental effect on speech understanding.5 The device offers an effective noise management system that combines three DNR algorithms, all working independently and simultaneously: modulation-based noise reduction, Wiener filter, and SoundSmoothing.6
The modulation-based noise reduction is most effective when only steady-state or stationary noise is present. The Wiener filter (speech enhancement) is designed to optimize speech when speech and noise are simultaneously present, and to attenuate noise in the small gaps within the speech signal itself. The SoundSmoothing algorithm, standard for Vibe, was designed to attenuate annoying non-stationary transient sounds for greater comfort in certain environments.6
According to a study by Hernandez et al,7 33% of background noises were of a transient duration. These sounds are not attenuated by traditional compression or digital noise reduction (DNR) strategies, as these algorithms were not designed to operate quickly enough to address these sounds.
The SoundSmoothing algorithm has been evaluated in several research studies, which have been reviewed by Chalupper and Powers8 and Chalupper and Branda.6 For example, these authors report on a study conducted at the National Acoustics Laboratories (NAL) in Australia in which 21 individuals with hearing loss participated in a paired-comparison task, listening to six different noise or speech signals. Using a forced-choice paradigm, the participants had to select SoundSmoothing “On” or “Off” as the “winner,” while listening to experimental noise or speech signals. The results of this study indicated a strong preference for SoundSmoothing for transient signals. For all noises with a relatively short duration, SoundSmoothing “On” was preferred by the majority of listeners—in most cases by a very large margin (Figure 6).
Other findings have also been encouraging. In benchmark testing comparing SoundSmoothing to other transient noise reduction systems, SoundSmoothing was found to be more effective at reducing these sounds, with the added benefit of introducing fewer artifacts.6 For some sounds, the difference in effectiveness was dramatic, in some cases as much as 15-20 dB.
Third-generation feedback cancellation. As with any other OC fitting, feedback cancellation systems must be employed to deal with potential feedback occurrence. In fact, the success of an open product largely depends on the quality of the feedback reduction system.
The Siemens FeedbackBlocker® is the company’s third generation of adaptive phase cancellation systems. The new patented Acoustic Fingerprint Technology enables FeedbackBlocker to better detect the feedback portion within the microphone signal. The hearing instrument signal is modulated (ie, “fingerprinted”) at the output stage, thus allowing the detector to recognize true acoustic feedback versus external tonal signals (eg, car or microwave tones, music, etc).
FeedbackBlocker is an automatic system, not requiring an initialization procedure. Although a critical gain measurement process can be performed, it is only desirable to optimize the gain provided by the First Fit algorithms, and not necessary for setting of any static feedback filters, as many other systems require. Feedback is suppressed faster and more reliably, with fewer artifacts.
Datalogging. Improved fine-tuning and counseling benefits are presented with the use of datalogging. This is a standard feature for the device, logging critical wearing data, such as wearing time, program usage, acoustical analysis of environments, noise reduction implementation, and number of program changes per day. All information is logged independently for each memory, so the professional can use this information for future counseling or fitting modifications, as needed.
Summary
The majority of people with mild to moderate hearing loss do not use hearing instruments. This is mostly due to stigma that hearing instruments make the individual appear old or handicapped, or that hearing instruments simply don’t perform well in a multitude of environments. With Vibe, Siemens has achieved the development of a unique concept that addresses not only cosmetic, but advanced performance, objectives. It offers an effective alternate solution for patients with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Vibe is more than just “another pretty face”; its unique combination of cosmetic, acoustical, and physical advantages makes it an optimal blend of form and function.

You know when I saw these fabulous Raspberry M&M’s from Target that I was going to create another fun cookie right? Well, that I did! I thought it would be so fun to start with a raspberry butter that brings a perfectly hint of raspberry to each cookie with those delicious Raspberry M&Ms on top! Wait until you try these M&Ms, they are incredible right out of the bag, so try to leave some for the cookies
Hope you enjoy!!
Here’s your line up!
You’ll need just about 1/2 cup of red raspberries to puree.
There are a number of ways you can puree your raspberries. I chose to just place them in my blender with 1 tablespoon water and mix until well combined. I placed the blended berries over my fine strainer to drain the juice. Make sense?
You get this beautiful berry puree. Makes the cookies smell and taste fabulous!
Drizzle 3 tablespoons of your puree into your softened butter.
Pretty!
Raspberry butter in the works!
Ahhhhh, pink raspberry butter!
Add your sugars and mix, mix, mix!
Add 2 beautiful eggs to the mix.
A little splash of vanilla.
Time for the dry ingredients!
I took a moment to capture the flour on the beater. I’m a nerd.
Add your chips.
Give a little taste then press into your muffin top pan! Do you have a muffin top pan yet?! You need one! In all seriousness, they really make awesome cookies.
Oh how fabulous are these Raspberry M&M’s? They really are delicious.
Press the M&M’s into your cookies.
I love how nice and round the cookies turn out. They are perfect for packaging up too!
Serve with milk
Enjoy!, great idea! Now, I’m curious… why raspberry “scented”? I read through the whole post but do they not taste like rasp?
Hi Liz, the smell that came from the oven was so beautiful I had to call them raspberry scented, however you do get a hint of raspberry with each bite too
I love the idea of using some of that raspberry puree in with the butter, it sounds so good!
Such a great idea to add some raspberry puree!
Mmm this sounds so yummy!
What beautiful cookies! And, given that I have some raspberry lovers in the house, I know that these cookies will be a huge hit!
So glad to hear it Natalie!
You are killing me PP! Shit, I love raspberry. Must.Make.These!!!!
I need to get some of those M&Ms. I’m scared I would eat the whole bag!
Shelly, Chances are, you’ll eat most of the bag first, so get a couple bags!!
These look fantastic. Love that you made a raspberry butter first!!
Thanks Aimee!!
Love this idea…never thought of using flavored butter in cookies!! Can’t wait to try it myself
I know! Now, I wanna try all kinds of fun butters
I’m not even kidding when I say this…my hubby just asked me last night if you had a recipe yet for these M&M’s that he picked up for me and I said no. And here you have one today!! I can not wait to make these!!!!
So glad I could be of some help! Hope you enjoy
You know I love these cookies:) Great recipe Jenny! xo
Perfect timing! I’ve been holding onto a bag of these M&M’s for months (Oops, should I have made that confession?), and I expect to receive a muffin top pan for my birthday next week. These cookies are going straight to the top of my must-bake list!
Oooh, the raspberry butter is such a great idea!!
I need some raspberry puree in my life! RecipeBoy is obsessed w/ raspberries- gotta show him these!
So cool! What a great idea to flavor the butter…these cookies sound (and must have smelled!) scrumptious.
These look fantastic!! My mom would love these! Mother’s Day present, here I come!!!
oooh yummm
Jenny they look awesome, as usual. I know you love your muffin top pan and I have one (you were the person who gave me the nudge to buy it, okay I bought two) and this reminds me to dust it off!
Looks so good! But if we don’t have a muffin top pan, how much and how long??
Sure do love the print option and I believe I am going to go and buy a Kitchen Aid.
I am a older woman and should have had one of those years ago.
I love this M&M flavor, looks perfect with that raspberry butter!
I would probably accidentally use all the raspberry butter on some homemade bread and have nothing to show for myself. Except a smile. Those pans seem to be everywhere right now! Yummy!
I can’t believe M & M’s have a raspberry flavor! I love the idea of making a raspberry butter. I bet that really enhances the flavor. Great recipe.
Ok, I bought a whoopie pie pan last week (Bed, Bath & Beyond didn’t have a muffin top pan in stock and I had a coupon)…looks about the same. It should work, right? I can’t wait to make some cookies in it! These sound so yummy.
I would think they would be pretty close to the same. I have been using a whoopie pie pan to make all my cookies in lately. My kids love the “deep dish” size and the crisp sides, gooey centers I get with the pan.
i wish raspberries were in season right now! and where in the world did you find the raspberry m&m’s? if i can track those down i am so making this recipe!!!!!
raspberry coulis is my all time favorite!!!
i make so much of it in the summer!
These are absolutely gorgeous cookies. I must bookmark these and try them out. I do tend to be scared of sieves for some reason. I never have any luck getting things to strain properly. But for you I will give it a whirl again.
Amazing! And they have real fruit in them, so they are healthy, right?!
Saw these at the shop the other day and though ewww… but then again I was only thinking about having the whole bag to myself
But for baking YES
oOoo, excellent idea! 😀
What a yummy idea adding the raspberry purée in! A special little touch
Because of your amazing blog and cookie recipes, I asked for (and received!!) my very own whoopie pie/muffin top pan for my birthday last week!! I can’t wait to start making your delicious recipes
I just added muffin top pans and raspberry M&M’s to my target list. I could eat about 8 of these, right now.
I love the idea of using raspberry butter. I am totally going to try that!!
these look fabulous! i love that you made raspberry butter!! so creative
i don’t have a muffin top pan — ahhh i know! i totally need one!!
I was wondering if any company is making mini-muffin top pans. I think that would be a great way to make them for an office party or large get-together with families or at church dinners. I hope some one will take the hint and make them. I’ll buy a couple for sure!!
Love this recipe! Raspberries and chocolate!
I love those dark chocolate raspberry M&M’s!! So tasty!
[…] looking food and recipe site called Picky Palette. Do check out their Raspberry Cookies at Keep scrolling down to view the photos. Such a good […]
Beautiful! You could have stopped with just the raspberry butter and I would have been in love. We used to buy this raspberry honey butter for our scones, but haven’t for a while now. Now I have a couple reasons to buy some raspberries!
Hi, Jenny
As if the cookies and the butter weren’t beautiful enough, where did you get that darling mini cake stand?!
Hi Marily, I found the cake stand at Harry and David believe it or not. I think it was only $10!
Ok, I did not know there were raspberry M&Ms!!! These sound wonderful! Love the fresh raspberry puree!
These look so great! Where did you find the raspberry M&Ms? I have not seen them in stores yet but would love to try this recipe.
I got a Wilton muffin top pan(12 cup) for Mothers Day and tried your cookies today. Mine overflowed the pan and are kind of green in color. Any ideas?
Found out I have a whoopie pie pan, not a muffin top but still can’t firgure out why they are green!

Once who are impossible. They have ignored all evidence of innocence, overlooked clear instances of jury taint, and cast a dead eye on defense attorneys' ineffectiveness. What they have done in my case is par for the course. This is a political decision, paid for by the FOP on the eve of the election. It is a Mischief Night gift from a court that has a talent for the macabre.
I am sorry that this court did not rule on the right side of history. legerdemain [sleight of hand] I remain innocent. A court cannot make an innocent man guilty. Any ruling founded on injustice is not justice. The righteous fight for life, liberty, and for justice can only continue.

November 18 Electric Factory, Philadelphia PA”Detroit's Ndamukong Suh may get the suspension for his actions in last Thursday's Thanksgiving Day game against Green Bay, but the Lions organization should share the blame, according to Tony Dungy.
The former Indianapolis and Tampa Bay head coach – a Jackson native – made the statement on The Dan Patrick Show.
"I really have to fault the Detroit ogranization," Dungy said. "I think they really could have stopped this."
Suh has been targeted for his aggressive play since his first preseason game, against Cleveland, in 2010.
Michael David Smith, of Pro Football Talk, calls out head coach Jim Schwartz, specifically, for choosing to look the other way, rather than punishing the young defensive lineman when his play crossed the line between "tough" and "dirty."
"The Lions could have nipped it in the bud by putting the hammer down on Suh and telling him that he'd get benched if he hurt his team by incurring 15-yard penalties," Smith said.
Now the punishment will be decided by the NFL.You are here: irt.org | RFCs | RFC6075 [ previous next ]

© 2021 Mixcloud LtdWhat if more than 150 people built a network from the ground up in a couple of days, ran it for less than a week, and then tore it down? What if each of those people was a volunteer? And what if that network was, for its brief lifespan, the fastest in the world?
That’s how SCinet, the network backbone of the annual Supercomputing (SC) conference and so much more, happens.
“It’s like a gift. A fantastic opportunity that not many people get to do,” said Caroline Weilhamer, manager of operations for I-Light and Indiana GigaPOP. She’s been a SCinet volunteer many times over the years, and at SC16 she co-chaired the Network Research Exhibition (NRE) team, one of the many volunteer-powered groups that make sure SCinet performs its many functions flawlessly.
What may seem like an unenviable undertaking—setting up a network and making sure it performs as advertised, only to take it down a few days later—is actually an incredible opportunity in disguise, said Weilhamer.
“Instead of viewing it as a hardship because it’s a volunteer base, people should grasp how invaluable all the knowledge is that each of the volunteers is exposed to,” she said.
“It’s like a crash course in everything,” she added. “All the things that we get exposed to there—there’s no other conference, no other training class that you can go to and walk away with as much knowledge as you do when you participate in SCinet.”
Even as a temporary, volunteer-powered network, SCinet does practically everything. “SCinet lays down the fiber at the convention center, it builds all the booth drops for each of the SC members—people like IU, Purdue,” Weilhamer explained. “All the members that participate in the conference, their networking activity, it’s all provided by SCinet.”
The people behind the network form more than a dozen specialized teams each year, managing everything from network security to power infrastructure, routing, logistics and equipment, student coordination, and communications support. The week-long-lived network even has its own HelpDesk and NOC.
Sometimes the volunteers come together from these disparate teams to troubleshoot a problem. The human network behind SCinet is what’s really special, Weilhamer said.
“It’s just tremendous, because it looks like a house on fire and all of a sudden, you can get it back on the rails,” she said.
As part of the Supercomputing conference, SCinet isn’t just a backbone connection for SC members. It also acts as a test lab for pioneering network hardware and applications: It’s the stage for a six-day preview of the future. That’s where Weilhamer and the Network Research Exhibition team enters the picture.
NRE helps computer scientists, researchers, and hardware vendors demonstrate their latest innovations—experiments that could transform anything that uses networks, from the Large Hadron Collider to trans-Atlantic international networks to virtual reality.
Weilhamer also helps researchers network, in the other sense of the word. As a member of the Innovating the Network for Data Intensive Science (INDIS) group, she helps researchers publish their whitepapers and get noticed by the right SC members to take their ideas to the next level.
But it’s not just the research and demos that bring network and computing to new heights at SC. The network itself continually breaks new ground, year after year. And SC16 was no different for SCinet, Weilhamer said.
“One huge thing is the fact that we had the largest push of traffic on the network this year,” she said. “There were 1.2 terabytes pushed from the showroom floor out. That’s the most, ever.”
That’s pretty impressive for a volunteer-powered network with a physical lifespan shorter than a housefly.
“We do plan for a whole year,” Weilhamer pointed out. “Then we stage and set up the network in a few weeks, and everything is normally up and running for four days.” After the conference, SCinet volunteers tear down the world’s perennially fastest network, in less than 24 hours.Play gameWhat If's itch.io page

Thanks goodness you put that checkpoint in there. This is very hard. I like the music, I like the story element. That makes me want to keep playing. I did find it annoying that touching the spikes when I was on that platform killed me. I think they should only kill you if you land on them. Then you had that one with like 6 spike traps on one platform to jump between :p Also, you really have to maximize your jump distance to get onto some platforms. I saw how you rewind, but not sure that's much different then a start over. This has potential on it's own in general, I'd like to play it again to learn the story but think it needs to be a little bit easier.
I like this challenging platformer! The music was relaxing to listen to, as well as reading the story of David! It might be good to scale the difficulty a bit more, or to make the distance between checkpoints a little closer.
Otherwise, great job! I actually submitted a challenging platformer too (according to others), so if you want you could check it out!
the look of the game is so nice
but i was unable to get past the childhood.
pity me:/
can you check my game too?
Exactly what I wanted to write! Its really hard, but looks good!
Overall nice submission!
A little too difficult for a game that is trying to tell a story but I really like the design. Great work! I'd really appreciate if you could also rate my game!
Nice game, but I think it is too frustrating and the jumps are too big. However, great character movement! Feels really on point.
Great game, I almost quit because I found it a bit to hard. But I'm glad I kept playing.
I like the graphics and music but the game itself was too hard for me, couldn't get past the row of spikes. But I haven't really played many platformers so maybe that's just me. The game looks very good though :)
This a very frustrating game. I know it's supposed to be hard, but is it frustrating. I like the movement and the music in the background, but it really needs patience. Overall, it was a decent game. Great job and I hope you learned some new things along the way!Fri, Jun 4, 2010 | 6:39 AM COMMENTS: 0 SHARES: POLL: Who Should Win the MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss?

I bought a new gas-fired boiler and stayed in that house a few months longer. In the evening I used to stroll in the street with Giuseppe and Umberto. ‘Have you ever heard about near-death experiences when one comes back to life after a deep coma?’ I asked Umberto. ‘Yes, Carl Gustav Jung told of his own near-death experience.’ ‘Some people have reported that they were in the light and felt bliss while they were dying. It is evidence of life after death.’ ‘No, it isn’t. The experience of a near-death happens inside, not in the external world. In other words, you can’t declare the existence of life after death on the basis of your dreams, reasoning, and thoughts which are confined inside yourself. I’ll give you an example. If you imagine or dream a hippogriff, a mythological creature that is half horse and half griffin, it doesn’t mean that hippogriffs really exist. The whole process of imagining or dreaming a hippogriff happens inside yourself. But that creature doesn’t exist in reality. The same goes for near-death experiences. The whole experience happens inside the dying man, not outside him. The paradise he thinks he sees outside him may not exist in reality,’ Umberto answered coldly.
“I was not convinced about his words and retorted that Descartes, a philosopher, proved the existence of God. But Umberto knew the topic well and answered without getting flustered. ‘Yes, you are right, but another philosopher, Emmanuel Kant, confuted Descartes’s theory. In Descartes’s reasoning, as well as in the reasoning of anyone who wants to prove the existence of God and life after death, there is an inexplicable gap between the logical and the ontological field.’ ‘Could you speak more plainly so that I can understand?’ ‘Yes. You can’t extrapolate the reality from an idea or reasoning. It is not correct to reason that as there is a creature, then there must be a creator. In fact, reasoning can never give existence to a being in reality. If you dream of being a rich and powerful man, you will discover that you don’t have those attributes when you wake up. In your dreams your mind creates objects that will disappear when you awake.’

I was able to find a job programming visual basic for a company that developed hotel accounting software. I quickly realized that programming was not for me. I didn't like the long hours, alone with my computer trying to build something to fit someone else's idea. There are people out there that love this kind of work, but it wasn't for me. I wasn't sure what I was going to do and I was depressed.
I thought I had wasted my education on something I hated doing in the real world. I decided I really did like information technology and I would continue to pursue other avenues, hoping to find a fit and someone that would hire me for having a general degree in information technology, rather than for my specialty. After leaving the programming job, I accepted a position as a network technician for Graham County in Arizona. I didn't last long doing this work either, but fell into an opportunity with a company that specialized in selling and configuring electronic document management systems.
An inside edge
Electronic document management systems allow users to scan or upload electronic documents into software for processing and storage. In my studies I had learned the importance of process modeling and design. This knowledge gave me an advantage when it came to adding work flow and processes to documents. The knowledge of how software works is also extremely valuable in that I am able to explain to customers the inner workings of the software, thus increasing their comfort with the product. Any information technology degree would give one an advantage in securing a position working with document management systems.
I am currently working for the City of Charlotte as an account manager in the information technology division. The team I work with handles all the electronic document management needs across all city divisions. I meet with the divisions throughout the city and assist them in determining their document and records management needs. A document management project usually consists of some type of legacy paper files that are scanned into an electronic document management system and a day forward scanning process that allows the city personnel to scan new paper documents directly into the system. Scanners must be evaluated for through put and duty cycle to insure they are robust enough to handle the job. Capture software must be configured to get the documents from the scanner into the system along with indexed information or metadata associated with the documents. The electronic document management system must also be configured for proper security, adequate storage space, processes built and retention schedules set.
Building on your knowledge
I have worked with many types of electronic document management systems. One good thing about the industry is that all of the different software solutions available for document management are trying to solve the same problems, which forces them to operate in similar ways. Therefore, once you have the basic knowledge, all you have to do is learn the feature sets for the different software suites as needed.
The most challenging part of working with document management systems is gathering customer requirements. Having a fundamental knowledge of project management, business analysis and resource planning will greatly increase your chances for success. As the expert, one must listen to customers and guide them to a solution that works for them. Customers usually need help documenting their document flows, finding bottlenecks, applying security, designing a document management structure, finding state and or regulatory agency record retention schedules and calculating the return on the investment.
Achieving a degree in information technology was a career accelerator for me. I would encourage those who have similar aspirations to look beyond the usual when searching for employment, especially in today's down economy. A new graduate armed with a degree and an open mind will find opportunities. A great place to start looking are those industries that produce large volumes of paper documents such as the legal, medical and government sectors. As with many technology jobs, furthering one's education and specialty training will ensure continued success. An information technology degree is a tool that can jump-start a career in several industries.Make huge savings on this quality, refurbished KitchenAid product! New product RRP $379.00.

Sandwich rack and removable crumb tray. 1 out of 5 by Piaf from Terrible- as a toaster it fails! I bought this product over 6 months ago - within 2 months it stopped working properly. It either only toasts in full so it burns your bread or on setting 1 so it takes multiple times making it very frustrating. I have also contacted kitchen Aid and had no help after a month and it’s several emails sent. Poor customer service!!
Date published: 2020-07-12
Rated 3 out of 5 by ISRZ from Look over performance Solid attractive toaster but disappointing that this very expensive toaster only browns on the highest setting. We mainly use wholemeal sourdough so not supermarket bread with sugar. And this setting is the only one that browns and it takes the longest time to toast! Would expect to have more choice with how toasted I would like my bread! The beep isn't loud at all so given it takes a long time we appreciate the beep which means we know when it's done. Depth of slots is good if a bit short in length. Toast warmer is a good function. I chose "cast iron black" because I thought it would be the most hard wearing but within 2 weeks this has chipped at the bottom. I should contact warranty which is such a pain!

Rated 5 out of 5 by Rosearee from Fabulous features & looks fabulous in my kitchen Love this machine. Pop the bread in & it automatically takes the bread down, the lights on the toaster show jar far it has to go in the toasting process, gives a nice little ‘bing’ sound when finished and if you’re not ready for your toast, it will pop it back down automatically to warm. Easy to clean. It also has a sandwich roasting rack which I haven’t used yet. Like every other Kitchenaid item I have, it looks beautiful and works beautifully and Customer Support are lovely, helpful people.

I’ll admit it: I don’t have a lot of indie cred. I’d rather listen to All Time Low than Arcade Fire, and I get visibly nervous while perusing the CD racks at my local independent music store, as if the hipper-than-thou clerk is secretly judging me from behind his thick-rimmed glasses. Heck, my favorite Weezer record is the Green Album, a distinction that probably makes Scott Heisel want to disown me as a writer. I’m a sucker for huge choruses and polished hooks, and I believe perfectly placed handclaps make any song better. I’m also a firm believer that a good song is a good song, no matter who wrote it; I won’t give any names, but there’s some seriously embarrassing stuff in my iTunes library. Just ask my friends, whose reactions range from slightly embarrassed to sympathetic, but all is seemingly forgiven when I’ve got an extra guestlist spot for an upcoming show. It’s funny how that works.
I’ve been writing for AP for more than a year now, and I’ve been fortunate enough to write a cover story (AP 262: Manchester Orchestra) as well as interview some of the musicians most responsible for my current musical preferences: Blink-182’s Tom DeLonge, Third Eye Blind’s Stephan Jenkins and Glassjaw’s Daryl Palumbo. I even had another frontman once tell me, “If you give [my new album] three stars, I’ll kill you.” I love my job.
Most surreal journalistic moment: Being mobbed by hundreds of concertgoers (Beatlemania-style) while walking with Tom DeLonge from the center of a parking lot to a backstage area at Warped Tour 2008. I’ll never forget his words to me as we stepped out into the crowd: “Hold on, dude. This shit is gonna get gnarly.” And it did. My tape recorder sounds like audio of a deleted scene from Alien.

1. Blink-182 - Enema Of The State

3. Jimmy Eat World - Futures
4. The Receiving End Of Sirens – The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi
5. Marvelous 3 - ReadySexGo
6. Will Hoge - Blackbird On A Lonely Wire

 bein’ strung out around the house. She tries to keep em out of the way by puttin’ em in the corner out of the way, but one by one they sneak out into the room again. Don’t ask me how it happens WOOF! Well, the other day she discovered a fun place called PrideBites™ that has personalized pet products. She found a super cute custom toy basket for storin’ our toys in to help keep em organized! But then the word came down! She said we have to learn to pick up our toys and put em in that basket! Say what??? On top of hearin’ that bit of news, I was a bit put out and jealous cause she put Maggie’s picture on the toy basket instead of mine WOOF! But as things usually do, it all righted itself. Check out what fun personalized thing I’m a gettin’ and the fun news about PrideBites!
Right after Maggie got her custom toy basket, we were excited to see PrideBites on Shark Tank! Now even for this country girl that’s just purdy darn cool ain’t it?! Anyway, I forgive my Lady for pickin’ Maggie for the toy basket cause after we watched Shark Tank, she promised me a cool custom frisbee with my name and picture on it! So if ya see me come a flyin’ by then ya know I got it WOOF!
Let me get my Lady to tell ya about PrideBites Personalized Pet Products and their fun segment on Shark Tank!
Who doesn’t love spoiling their pets? They give us so much love and, as for me, there is nothing I love more than spoiling and pampering them. I am also partial to personalized items for myself and what pampered pooch wouldn’t like his name and picture on their things?! Well, PrideBites is the next big thing in everything dog, and I’m loving it! PrideBites lets me spoil and pamper away, while getting them useful things at the same time! This company is all about everything dog, from toys to apparel, and it’s all fully customizable. Now that’s what I’m talking about, as Miss Molly would say!
Here’s the thing that I think is so cool about this company. It’s more than just toys and clothing, and what not. Dog owners can get that stuff anywhere, honestly. I can go down the road to my local big box store and pick up a leash. What I can’t do is pick up a leash with my dog’s name on it! I can’t get a dog coat or bed that is personalized with their name and picture. I am telling you – PrideBites has taken dog swag to the next level!

And, I’m not the only one who has taken notice! If you watch Shark Tank, the name PrideBites probably rings a bell. That’s because they secured a financing deal on the show. It was so exciting because as pet people we know we love personalized pet products and we were anxious to see the sharks bite! Well, they did! Everyone knows us pet parents spoil our pups and PrideBites secured a deal because the savvy business people saw the potential in what the company was doing! Now the rest of us can reap the rewards! WOOT! WOOT!
We’ve had a chance to get up close and personal with PrideBites!
Before I go any further, let me tell you the story behind PrideBites. Then, I will show you our fun personalized toy basket for Maggie!
About PrideBites™:
When PrideBites started, they were just a group of dog loving college friends. They were unhappy with the look, feel, and versatility of dog toys on the market, so they decided to create one themselves. In their first year, they found out that dogs everywhere loved Custom PrideBites as much as their own, so they began to work on bringing customization to all the other essential pet products. Now they can help you, and I, design all of them fast and easy! The top priority while building out the PrideBites custom catalog was to create it with us in mind!
They put a lot of work into selecting a variety of soft, durable, safe and easy to clean materials for our dog’s everyday use. They’ll continue to use more options with the best products and experience around! At PrideBites, their motto is “Your Pet, Your Choice™” and they wouldn’t have it any other way.
Controlling the Dog Toy War with a Personalized Toy Basket from PrideBites!
With the growing number of dog toys in our home, it gets a little crazy and a whole lot messy! I am not joking at all! We have no babies or kids, other than our 7 furkids, but our living room looks like romper room gone wild! Dog toys are scattered everywhere! Our main issue is that we have no where to store them. They end up piled in a corner and, well let’s face it – laying where they land. Navigating the toy obstacle course in the middle of the night takes skill! We may not step on legos in the dark, but stepping on a squeaker toy is just as bad! One awkward accidental step and there is the dreaded squeak! This, in turn, unleashes a riot of barking, running and jumping from pups that think it is again playtime! It upsets the whole household.
We have known we needed a solution for the growing dog toy population, but I couldn’t find what I was looking for until I found the fun customized toy basket from PrideBites! Oh my gosh they are so cute! And, they can be personalized exactly how you want them! We get to choose colors, piping, add their name, and even their photo! For our toy box, we chose Maggie to be the recipient. She is the leader of our pack, so she got the honor! Maggie is a sweet girl that shares all the toys, but she gets to call dibs on the personalized toy basket being hers! There is no denying it, since her name and picture is right there for the others to see!
Personalizing our CustomToy Basket from PrideBites
PrideBites has a large variety of fun colors and options available for toy baskets. We chose to go with a custom toy basket.
We had several customizing options available so that we could get the exact personalized toy basket we wanted for Maggie! These were the super easy steps:
1. Choose the size. We chose regular for our large dogs and toys.
2. Choose a Main color. We chose a bright fun red.
3. Choose a Piping color. We chose black as a nice contrasting color.
4. Add their name and choose a banner for it to appear in. Of the choices of oval, vintage, hardware, or bone – we chose the oval shape.
•You also get to choose the font, and the color of the font, that the name will be done in. We chose the “Big Dog” font in black, so that it would match the piping.
5. Upload your pet’s photo. This was super easy and simple to do.
That’s it. Add it to the cart and follow the checkout procedure.
This is the photo of Maggie that we uploaded for them to use. PrideBites takes the picture and then hand draws the image to customize it to go on the product.
After a few weeks, our toy basket arrived and I was beyond blown away with the way it turned out! The picture of Maggie on the personalized toy basket is the spitting image of her! They even captured the look, and expression, on her face! I am in love!
I loved how it turned out and I also love the size! It is larger in real life than I expected it to be. I am not to swift in reading measurements and picturing it my head.
The PrideBites Personalized Toy Basket will fold flat for storage if need be. It comes with a bottom reinforcement that makes the bottom sturdier and keeps the side panels open. As you can see, there is quite a bit of room in there. The final step, was filling it with the toys from my cluttered floor! And, Maggie quickly claimed it as her own!
Now, there is that small thing about training them to pick up their toys and put them all back in their personalized toy basket! We are still working on that one 🙂
I have my eye on the personalized blankets, beds, collars and leashes. And they even have clothes that my little chihuahua will go gaga over! Oh my gosh – it is all so cute! I can see now I am going to be doing a lot of spoiling! I simply cannot resist a chance to spoil any of my pups, so I can definitely see a big shopping spree coming on. Would you love to gift your 4-legged friend a custom toy basket? Or, maybe you would like to check out their other products. Visit them for yourself on the PrideBites website and prepare to fall in love! Don’t say I didn’t warn you!

That’s cute! We keep a box of toys for our dogs, too.
Love the toy box. I could sure use one for my dog
That was an awesome idea! So happy they made a deal – I can see myself getting a bunch of stuff from them
Wow the picture looks just like her. I remember seeing them on Shark Tales and thinking “What a great idea”!
Maggie is one happy doggie! 🙂
We watched them on Shark Tank
I bet my dogs are more annoying than your dogs.
We watch Shark Tank as a family, and I did see this. I think it’s great. From a wonderful name to idea…love that they are about pampering pets. It’s great to see more companies in pet products.
Lots of cute stuff.
A custom toy basket would be great! I love it. 🙂
What a great idea. All our pets have little toy baskets, but I love these personalized boxes more.
Great idea for all the dog owners. I love that it’s personalized.
What an awesome idea! Too bad I don’t have any pets. My daughter is allergic.
I used to have a dog that looked just like that. I sure miss her. She was a great dog.
I don’t watch Shark Tank so this company is new to me but it sounds great! I was raised to support local and small-owned businesses so I’ll be sure to check Pride Bites out! My dog LOVES toys, especially squeaky ones!
What a cute idea. We keep ours in a basket.
I’ve never seen Shark Tank, but I have to say that my favorite breed of dog has always been German Shepherds!
I would need to order one for my pug and one for my shepherd mix.
What a cool idea!! Thanks for sharing :]
These are ingenious and cute. My dog usually eats his toys when he is done. lol.
I love the personalize toy crate. How cool is that! I’d need three! LOL
This is so cute! I know my mom would love some of these personalized pet items for her pups.
I just love Pride Bites products. I have a couple of their toys, but what I really want to do is to have a personalized frisbee of each of my furbabies – starting with the ones I lost this past year (two dogs and one cat). Unfortunately, I missed them on the Shark Tank episode. I’ll have to check on-line and see if I can find a video of it.
That is such a cute toybox. Thanks for sharing!
Wow, this a very complete and cute pet toy box. My dog didn’t have so many toys, she was happy with tennis balls.
i absolutely love that toy box. it is so nice looking.thanks for sharing
It must of have been so exciting being on Shark Tank, I watch every episode!!
These are so unique! I love how dog toys can be personalized!
Pretty cool

Cute toy bins!
Love the toy box
My pup needs to be more organized, I love it! Thank you so much!
Such a great idea! I know our dog would love this. By the way, Maggie is adorable!
This is so cute! I love how dogs can get their own personal toys!
What a cute pet toy box. That is what my dog needed before he passed. He had so many toys!
My dog would love this.
Great idea!
This is a great thing. I am glad you shared this and are making others aware of it as well.
What an adorable idea! It definitely looks like Maggie! 🙂
What a great idea. I like that you can personalize it and customize the size too.
My pup may like it, but it is hard to introduce anything but a rawhide, he loves them so much. I appreciate the review, and love that photo of the German Shepherd.
How cool that you made it to Shark Tank!
very cute! nice gift idea for pet parents
That toy box is so cute. I need one for my Toby Tangles.
I think these are so cute, and look like quality made
Sounds like a wonderful company with everything you need for your pets. I know my two grandpuppies would love to have one of their own toy boxes for themselves.
Love the idea of a custom toy box!
So good for dogs.
Great delicious dog treats are not easy to nor is it easy to get them to eat them,I’d love to try these!
I watched them on Shark Tank
Love the custom toy box, oh so cute
I really enjoyed reading the entire post, thank you!
Wow, this sounds great! I did not see Pride Bites on Shark Tank, but I’m glad they got a deal!
How cute! I’m not a doggy mommy but I want one. I have all of my girl’s toys sorted into two big bowls and she hope in and digs around for her favorites. I wonder if they’d be willing to do one with my cat’s face.
They are so cute
i love this toy box. I could use it for all of my doggy toys
I don’t have a pet but the box looks nice and if your dog is happy with it, then it’s a good thing 🙂
Nifty idea for fun storage!
This is a very cute idea. Kids have their own toy baskets so why not pets.
I love personalized dog stuff!
so cute my dog ladie bugg would love her own personalized toys:)
I could use a few of these around the house for our pups. They have so many toys! 🙂
The toy box is cute great way to tidy up.
This is a very cute idea. My pets have just as many toys as my children always did!!
I like the toy box for dog toys. This is so cute and it would contain the toys instead of having them spread all over the house. Very cute and stylish.
I love customised stuff for people or pets
That is really cool how they made the image from your photo! Looks really user friendly.
What a cute idea and Maggie is a beauty!
When the kids were younger it was always their toys scattered on the floor, now it’s the dog toys. The bskets would come in handy in our house.
good to know more
That is an awesome toy box. They have a great web site, I’ve bookmarked to check it out better later.

Hope is one of the things that sets Christians apart. It’s completely based on trust and putting our lives in God’s hands with absolute confidence that He will care for us. Yes, we still get sick and our cars break down and we have times of sadness and suffering, just like everyone else, but Catholics know that suffering has a purpose and we can trust in God’s plan with joy!
I Thessalonians 5:8 teaches that hope is the helmet of our armor. A helmet protects us and the virtue of hope acts in much the same way, protecting our trust in Jesus even when we have no idea where He’s taking us. If you have younger kids, they’ll probably like the helmet-making activity on page 4.
And, as always this year, we’re asking, “Where is Jesus found in this topic?”
For that, let’s turn to the Catechism.
- Jesus is the hope that does not disappoint.
- Hope is the sure and steadfast anchor of the soul that enters where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf.
- Jesus is our only hope, giving meaning to death.
- Jesus is the fulfillment of the hope of Israel.
- Because of His resurrection, Jesus is our living hope.Get Social — Media

"It's true," a diplomat with knowledge of the exchanges told Reuters when asked whether the report was correct.
Dawn said the Nov. 28 caller threatened military action unless Pakistan acted immediately against the perpetrators of the slaughter in Mumbai, launched two days earlier.
For the next 24 hours nuclear-armed Pakistan's air force was put on "highest alert" as the military watched anxiously for any sign of Indian aggression, the report said.
Tensions have been running high since India blamed Islamist militants based in Pakistan for the three-day rampage in its financial capital, which killed 171 people.
"War may not have been imminent, but it was not possible to take any chances," Dawn quoted a Pakistani official as saying.
WAR BY ACCIDENT?
The episode triggered intense international diplomacy, with some world leaders fearing India and Pakistan could slip into an accidental war, the newspaper said.
Dawn said the caller, posing as Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee, also tried to telephone U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, but due to specific checks by U.S. officials the call was not put through.
According to Dawn, Rice called Mukherjee in the middle of the night to ask why he had adopted such a threatening tone, but he assured her that he had not spoken to Zardari.
Pakistan's senior envoy to Britain confirmed that Pakistan had feared an attack.
"I got a call from some friend here in the government and he said the situation is pretty serious, Indians are threatening to go to war," High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hassan told the BBC in comments broadcast on World Service radio.
"I again talked to the president and the president also confirmed that he had received a call, a threatening call, from India," he added.
Pakistan and India, which both became nuclear-armed states in 1998, went to the brink of war in 2002 following a militant attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001.
Mukherjee said his discussions with Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who was in New Delhi that day, had been cordial.
There were frantic phone calls between Washington, Islamabad and New Delhi to cool the temperature and by the evening of Nov. 29, calm had been restored.
Dawn said Zardari's staff had bypassed usual verification checks for a call for the president, but the government said Zardari received the call after it was properly verified that it originated from India's Ministry of External Affairs.
"It is not possible for any call to come through to the president without multiple caller identity verifications," Information Minister Sherry Rehman said in a statement.
"In fact the identity of this particular call, as evident from the CLI (caller's line identification) device, showed that the call was placed from a verified official Phone Number of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs".
The newspaper said Indian officials had denied to U.S. counterparts that the call came from its ministry and said the number could have been manipulated.
HOURS OF UNCERTAINTY
It was during the hours of uncertainty that Pakistan rescinded its offer to send its Inter-Services Intelligence agency chief to India to help investigate the Mumbai attacks.
Senior Pakistani security officers referred to the aggressive tone taken by the Indian foreign minister in a briefing to journalists on Nov. 29.
They warned, in a clear message to the United States, that if Pakistan felt threatened it would move troops from the Afghan border, where they are fighting Taliban and al Qaeda, to the Indian border and abandon the war on terrorism.
Indian and U.S. officials suspect the Lashkar-e-Taiba group was behind the Mumbai attack.
The jihadi organisation, which fights Indian rule in Kashmir, has had ties with Pakistani intelligence in the past and members have forged links with al Qaeda, according to security analysts.> If you could use a lower CPU intensive crypt like blowfish, it would be easier. > > Are all these trading partners in different locations or are there semi large > groups in the same locations? > all these are end users. they connect software from home / offices. > Maybe a hundred or so share an office, you could set up IPSec tunnels to each > remote office and pass all 100 through that tunnel.

The company recently carried out a survey of some 300 UK and Canadian businesses, and found that 25 percent were looking to dump US cloud companies due to the NSA’s spying. The companies stated that they were concerned that US laws compel American companies to hand over customer’s data to US intelligence agencies any time they ask for it.
That’s not exactly surprising, when you consider that four out of five businesses cite privacy as the number one consideration when it comes to storing their data in the cloud. Peer1 found that almost 70 percent of its survey respondents would be willing to sacrifice some latency if it meant ensuring their data sovereignty. Even so, the majority of companies admitted to not knowing enough about data protection laws.
Peer1 operates facilities in Canada, the US and the UK, which explains why the survey was focused on those countries.
The survey supports the findings of Wikibon’s Scott Lowe last year, when he warned that the NSA’s spying allegations could cripple US-based cloud companies. In his report, Lowe warned that U.S.-based customers might be tempted to move their business to potentially more secure foreign cloud providers, such as those in Switzerland, in an effort to protect their businesses. He advocated that US-based technology companies push for concrete answers and actions from the government to ensure to the world that the United States is open for business in a way that is transparent and trustworthy.
Sadly, this hasn’t yet happened, and what Peer1’s survey seems to confirm is a slow erosion of trust in American tech companies, as the Ed Snowden leaks continue to trickle out, never far from the headlines..Acid, Marble, Metallic Stains & Stain Dye Concrete Contractor

after years of working in Final Cut Pro. To read more about why we made the switch, check out this post.
Today’s post is the first of two posts on navigating the <Adobe Premiere Pro
timeline, written by MediaStorm producer Eric Maierson.
Most of your time editing is spent in the timeline. Mastering just a few shortcut keys will enable you to work faster and focus instead on creating meaningful stories.
Here are some of the shortcuts that I use most regularly.
Transport Controls
J – plays timeline forward
K – stops playback
L – plays timeline forward
Spacebar – toggles between stopping and starting playback
In and Out Points
Use the familiar I and O key to create in or out points.
Option-X will remove in and out points.
Viewing the Timeline
/ – shows the entire timeline \ – shows the entire timeline (similar to FCP’s Shift-Z). Pressing it a second time will return you to your original, closer view.
+ and - keys – zoom the timeline in and out, respectively. Use the + and – from the main keyboard. The numeric keypad equivalents are associated with other shortcuts.
Select All
To select everything on your timeline use Command-A. To deselect, use Command-Shift-A.
Snapping
The S key turns snapping on and off. Check the magnet icon on the right of the timeline to see if it’s on. If snapping is on, the magnet will display a bounding box.
If you are in the act of dragging a selection, holding down the S will temporarily turn snapping on/off. When you let go of the S key, snapping will revert to its original mode.
Track Selection Tools
Perhaps the most challenging shortcut to remember is the selection tool. Adobe uses V, not FCP’s–and the more Mac-like–A key.
Use the V key to lasso clips on the timeline.
To select an entire track, use the A key then select a clip. All clips forward on that track, will be selected.
If your audio is linked to a video track, using the single track selection tool with select both.
(To unlink tracks, right-click either the audio or video and select Unlink. A forthcoming tutorial will show how to set up a custom keyboard shortcut.)
To select all tracks forward, use Shift-A. You’ll see two arrows.
Unfortunately, this does not lock your selection. If you take your hand off the Shift key, the selection resorts to just one track (or linked tracks). One way around this is to select all tracks using Shift-A then immediately press the selection tool (V). Your selection will then remain.
Arrow Keys
The Forward and Back Arrow keys move your playhead one frame forward or back, respectively. Shift-Forward or Shift-Back will move your playhead five frames forward or back.
As with FCP 7, the Up and Down Arrows move your playhead forward and back to the next edit. There are a couple of differences, however. The most obvious is that Premiere Pro will only jump to highlighted tracks.
In the example above, note that video tracks 2 and 3 are not selected. Pressing the Up Arrow (jump to previous edit) will skip the video on track 3 and jump straight to the end of the first clip on track 1.
Unlike FCP, Premiere Pro does not count an in or out marker as an edit (unless they happen to align with an actual clip).
To jump to in and out points you’ll need to use Shift-I and Shift-O, accordingly.
Moving Clips with the Keypad
To move clips using the keypad, first laso them with either the Selection Tool (V) or use the Track Selection Tool (T).
Make sure your clips(s) have room to move, that they’re not butt against a clip that is unselected.
Next, press the numeric keypad’s + or - key depending on which way you want to move in the timeline. Then, enter the amount you’d like to move.
You’ll see your numbers appear on the right side of the timeline.
Premiere Pro handles time code in this regard the same way as Final Cut. There’s no need to enter the entire time code.
+5 will move your selection 5 frames.
+1.05 will move your selection one second and five frames.
If you do not have clips selected, using this technique will just move your playhead.
Deleting Clips
There are two ways to delete clips depending on how they are selected.
If you have selected your clip with the Selection Tool (V)—it will be a darker color—use the Delete key to lift delete. Doing this will leave a gap in your timeline. The length of your sequence remains the same.
To ripple delete a selected clip, use Option-Delete. Your timeline will collapse to absorb the space where the clip once resided. The length of your sequence will shorten.
If you’ve made a selection using an in (I) and out (O) mark, use the Semi-colon key to lift delete and the Single Quote key (‘) to ripple delete..5 hours earlier than President Joe Biden was set to talk on the existential risk to American voting rights, Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) made the stakes of Biden’s handle crystal clear.
“If he’s severe about saving our ailing democracy, he’ll voice his assist for, on the very least, reforming the filibuster to cross the For the Folks Act on a easy majority vote within the Senate,” Jones mentioned in a press release, referring to Democrats’ bill to expand voter access and reform elections. “Something much less at this level,” Jones mentioned, “is an insult to the voters, organizers, and activists who perceive the dire stakes of this second and are relying on him to behave.”
Contemplate the voters, organizers and activists insulted.
Biden on Tuesday didn’t downplay the hazard that nationwide efforts by Republicans to restrict entry to the poll field pose, calling attempts to suppress and subvert the right to vote in honest elections “an unfolding assault going down in America at the moment.” However past a featureless, albeit impassioned, name for the Senate to cross voting-rights laws presently caught in a procedural quagmire, Biden’s handle largely amounted to a pep rally for the proper to vote.
“We now have the means,” Biden mentioned, apparently unironically. “We simply want the need.”
Biden’s handle on the Nationwide Structure Heart in Philadelphia, a venue chosen to emphasise the basic function that free and honest elections play in American authorities, comes as Republicans throughout the nation transfer to cross laws proscribing entry to the poll field.
Whereas Biden geared as much as converse, 140 miles away, the scene exterior the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning appeared to precisely characterize that two-pronged downside for Democrats. A bunch of Texas Democratic lawmakers assembled for a press convention hours after fleeing the state as a part of a Hail Mary effort to dam the state’s GOP majority from passing a invoice to limit voting entry.
That play will doubtless fail, and GOP Gov. Greg Abbott can muscle the laws into legislation at some point. Within the meantime, the lawmakers used their newfound platform to level to the constructing behind them—the Democratic-run Capitol—as emblematic of unacceptable inaction from the governing social gathering.
“I hope the speech goes effectively, I’m certain the phrases are pretty,” mentioned James Talarico, a Democratic state legislator from the Austin space. “However what we have to see is motion, and we would have liked to see it yesterday.”
Having tried and failed to achieve majorities in Austin for twenty years, Texas Democrats are baffled why Washington Democrats seemingly gained’t use theirs—by ending the filibuster, Talarico instructed The Each day Beast.
“Our Democratic counterparts on the federal degree have majorities, they’ve the Home, the Senate, and the White Home,” he mentioned, “and so they can not seem to get their act collectively.”
If that unified message from Texas Democrats was heard by Biden, he apparently wasn’t swayed. In his speech, the president did word concrete steps that his administration has taken to develop voting rights and entry, from a Department of Justice lawsuit over “discriminatory” laws in Georgia to Vice President Kamala Harris’ work to extend voter registration, the first obstacles to passing nationwide voting-rights laws—the Senate filibuster and a Supreme Courtroom that has proven growing hostility to the Voting Rights Act of 1965—went unmentioned.
The president’s sidestepping of the filibuster as a difficulty didn’t come as a shock. On Monday, White Home press secretary Jen Psaki instructed reporters that whereas Biden would “redouble his dedication to utilizing each device at his disposal to proceed to battle to guard the basic proper of Individuals to vote,” that dedication didn’t embrace twisting arms within the U.S. Senate so as to create a filibuster exemption for voting rights—regardless of calls to take action by Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), the third-ranking House Democrat and a close Biden ally.
“The filibuster is a legislative course of device—an vital one—that warrants debate, however willpower about making modifications can be made by members of the Senate, not by this president or any president, frankly, shifting ahead,” Psaki mentioned, noting that Biden doesn’t assist eliminating the filibuster, regardless of the risk to his domestic agenda.
Certainly, the filibuster has already stymied the For The Folks Act as soon as—it was blocked by all 50 GOP senators in June—and it looms threateningly over laws to revive the Voting Rights Act, which Democrats have recognized as a extra focused and extra doable different, regardless that it solely has one Republican supporter for the time being.
Although Biden’s continued refusal to entertain assist for ending the legislative filibuster has continued to frustrate progressive Democrats, the handle does mark a brand new step in his evolving relationship with the difficulty of voter entry. Throughout the 2020 presidential marketing campaign, when the coronavirus pandemic necessitated an unlimited growth of absentee poll packages in states throughout the nation, Biden remained largely silent about increasing “vote-by-mail” initiatives. On the time, the choice was made to keep away from politicizing the difficulty and drawing hearth from Republicans that would sink the success of these packages.
However six months into his administration, with Republicans taking intention at voter rolls and polling areas and early voting no matter Biden’s participation within the dialog—and former President Trump persevering with to gas the conspiracy principle that he gained the election—the president has taken on a extra muscular function, even when some Democrats nonetheless assume it’s fairly weak or borderline nonexistent.
Requested by a reporter on July 8 whether or not the White Home was fearful that elevating voting rights as a platform problem would “give Republicans extra fodder to make partisan assaults in opposition to voting rights,” Psaki responded merely: “No.”
Past the White Home’s function—at this level largely restricted to messaging—exterior efforts to guard voting entry are more and more sharp-elbowed, and higher funded. . Harris’ initiative, which Biden highlighted on Tuesday, contains $25 million for the Democratic Nationwide Committee’s voter schooling, safety, registration and outreach packages.
“The Democrats are investing within the instruments and know-how to register voters, to coach voters, to prove voters, to guard voters,” Harris mentioned final week in an handle at Howard College, the distinguished traditionally Black college she as soon as attended. “Folks say, ‘What’s the technique?’ Properly, I simply outlined it.”
Harris is ready to satisfy with the Texas Democratic delegation on Tuesday, granting them extra face time to press their case to finish the filibuster and cross voting laws with the administration’s official level individual on voting rights.
However their issues don’t finish with the White Home. Democrats additionally need to enhance the strain on the Democratic caucus’ important filibuster holdouts, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), to rethink. Manchin will reportedly meet with the Texas legislators quickly for a personal dialogue, however each he and Sinema have constantly affirmed their intent to uphold the 60-vote rule for all laws.
Some legislators supplied a preview of their case to this robust viewers: compromise.
“If we won’t take the entire apple, let’s take a chew of the apple,” mentioned Texas state Rep. Celia Israel. “Let’s work with Sinema and Manchin on… the one or two issues which you could work with, and let’s discover some victory right here and stop being deadlocked.” way of=rssSD - Casual Dining for 4 or 6.

If you have a car and willing to spend perhaps $20-26 for entrees you should look at Terra in Hillcrest
Here is a recent review
- re: bereccca
Bay Park Fish Co., next to Seisel's/KFC on Morena.
Blue Water, on India just south of Shakespeare Pub, but it's a bit casual, order at the counter, styrofoam plate place, and parking is a major PIA, but the food is good.
Brazil by the Bay, on Hancock, behind the Sports Arena, but it's a bit casual too.
Baci on Morena.
I'd pass on El Agave.
How about Cafe Pacifica in Old Town? Entrees are in the mid twenties, Outside of Terra which is clearly not "meeting in the middle," I have not seen places I would want to take people for a nice dinner out suggested in this thread. Cafe Pacifica is worth a couple of extra bucks in my opinion.
The between Hillcrest & PB thing is tough...nothing really is "between them" in any good sense. That being said I do like Bay Park Fish Co and it is in the right price range and is fairly casual with super fresh seafood. Cafe Pacifica is a good suggestion as well.
Not sure if you are drinkers but perhaps The Vine or 3rd Corner in OB? What about not in the middle but easily accessible to both like Bully's East off of Texas at the 8?Elder says scalping reports exaggerated
Updated
Locals in the troubled Northern Territory Aboriginal community of Yuendumu say the alleged riot and descriptions of a scalping that followed are exaggerated.
The tiny Northern Territory community plunged into violence again over the weekend, with a young man receiving injuries described by police as similar to a scalping.
It was early Saturday morning when a brawl broke out amongst several young men in the town, which lies hundreds of kilometres north-west of Alice Springs.
Family groups in Yuendumu have been fighting on and off for years.
The community was quiet on Monday afternoon, but the weekend violence has local residents and authorities wondering what will come next.
He wasn't scalped at all. He was hit by really nasty weapons like sickle, iron bars or something like that. Wasn't a scalping.Yuendumu elder Harry Nelson
Local elder Harry Nelson's nephew is recovering in the Alice Springs Hospital, having suffered brutal head injuries.
But he says police descriptions of his injuries as "similar to a scalping" are grossly inaccurate.
"He wasn't scalped at all. He was hit by really nasty weapons like sickle, iron bars or something like that. Wasn't a scalping," Mr Nelson said.
"When the Aboriginal people fight, they don't scalp their hairs off, or scalps off. That's nothing. That's a lot of untrue story and people have been misled.
"Mind you, people will be charged. I know exactly what's going to happen to the person who's now being held in the Alice Springs Hospital. [People] will, no doubt, be looking for revenge."
The weekend violence is the latest in a series of assaults and brawls that have flared up and died down in waves for nearly two years.
It is unclear what sparked Saturday's conflict, but tensions have grown after several recent deaths, including a 16-year-old boy who died of meningitis.
Extra police flew to the community from Alice Springs on Saturday, but most were gone by Monday afternoon due to the public holiday.
After that, local residents said the community was again quiet. Some people have left for one of the area's wildly popular football carnivals, taking place this week a few hours drive away.
The ABC has been told senior elders met with police recently, asking for a less gung-ho approach and a more respectful attitude.
Mr Nelson says people from both sides of the conflict want police to do more to expel a handful of trouble-makers, which includes men and women aged between 15 and 25.
"There are members from the other group that is probably saying the same thing to the police. Get rid of all the trouble-makers," he said.
He says he is not sure what can end the family conflict in Yuendumu or when a solution will be found.

#bookbucketchallenge: The Geek Shall Inherit the Earth
“List 10 books that have stayed with you in some way. Don't take more than a few minutes, and don't think too hard. They do not have to be the 'right' books or great works of literature, just ones that have affected you in some way."
I'm pleased to report that based on the results of the survey that researchers Lada Adamic and Pinkesh Patel have compiled (and that you can find some helpful infographics of here) we can officially declare the ascendancy of geek culture.
That's right: the war is over. We won.
How can I say this? Well, of the Top 10 books that "stayed" with people, six of them are sci-fi or fantasy:
If we look at the Top 20 that number grows to eleven. Out of the 100 books listed, thirty-five or thirty-six of them would be considered SF & F--nearly a quarter of them

Graham Joyce, 1954 - 2014
Graham Joyce died earlier this week.
I only met him the once, at World Fantasy 2012 here in Toronto. I was at the bar, chatting with a couple of Australian writers I know when Graham came over. He knew them both quite well, and they introduced me.
I liked Graham right away; he reminded me of a beloved professor from my undergrad days. He had a kind face, dominated by a big nose, and a great working-class accent. I seem to recall him lugging around a box of books for some reason.
He struck me as quintessentially British.
We talked a bit about writing, and a great deal about Toronto. I remember a good sense of humor, and a wonderful squinty-eyed laugh. And then he was on his way.
I'd never read anything he wrote, but I decided that I should pick up some of his work simply because he seemed like such an all-around nice bloke who'd taken the time to have a nice conversation with a nobody author 20-years his junior who happened to be sitting with a couple of guys far more successful who were his contemporaries.
Later at the annual "what we liked this year" panel that some of the major editors always do at WFC, Graham's book Some Kind of Fairy Tale kept being mentioned (indeed, it was a finalist for the World Fantasy Award the very next year) and I took it as a sign that I really did need to read it.
And there it sits still on my shelf. I bought it at the dealer's room that same day four years ago…and haven't cracked it open.
And I feel a strange guilt about that.
I'm a notoriously slow reader and I have a HUGE pile of books in my "to read" pile. But now that Graham Joyce is dead-- I dunno. I'm feeling some kind of regret that I didn't read it sooner. Maybe I would have sent him a fan letter? I dunno.
I don't pretend to have known him, and there's zero reason he would have had to recall me from our brief conversation. But I feel deeply saddened by his passing.
Having read a bit more about him this week perhaps there are reasons.
He died too young, first off. Not even sixty--in this day and age!
He began writing around the same age I am now, and published more than 20 books before he died, being awarded the British Fantasy Award an extraordinary seven times.
He died of lymphoma, leaving behind a wife and two children. With the recent birth of my second child, I confess to more than a passing fear of dying suddenly and leaving my wife all alone to raise the kids. And as someone whose family has been touched by lymphoma (though a much slower form) his diagnosis hits more than a little close to home.
It could be anyone of those reasons, I suppose, thought they all came after the fact.
Truthfully, when I heard the news I was sad because a guy I'd met once and shared a pleasant half-hour or so with passed away too young, and that doesn't seem fair.
As it happens, I'm between books right now in my alternating fiction/nonfiction/fiction cycle. So tonight, I'm going to settle into bed with Some Kind of Fairy Tale at last and remember with fondness my passing acquaintance with the talent that wrote it.
Rest peacefully, Graham. I for one will miss you.

Greenville, Mich.
Dear Son Willie:
We received a letter from you and also from Brother Maynard soon after our letter was mailed to you. Today we came to this place from Norridgewock. One hour since Rebekah brought us quite a pile of letters. We were really glad to find a letter from Sister Maynard, Sister Betsey, and yourself. You were quite liberal this time. Thank you all for your favors. If you knew how we prize a letter or letters from you, you would be prompt in writing. I have no fault to find with you; you have all done well. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 1
Last Thursday morning we rode eighteen miles to Athens. We found the people needed help very much. I spoke Sunday morning, then we had a meeting with the church especially, then a praying season with the family we had tarried with, for the object of helping some cases in great darkness to whom I had in the name of the Lord borne a straight testimony. It was a most solemn occasion—parting, perhaps never again to meet the same persons until the judgment. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 2
We started at five o’clock for Norridgew. My fingers suffered terribly, but they were not frozen. The last five miles was from Skowhegan to Norridgewock, alongside the river. A keen breeze blew directly in our faces. I was so unfortunate as to freeze my face pretty severely. It is very sore. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 3 you. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 4
I am entirely relieved in regard to you, but I have been not a little troubled about you. I am thankful you are in so good a home. I have perfect confidence in Brother and Sister Maynard and I am more attached to those dear children you associate with than to any other children among all my acquaintance. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 5
We commence meetings here in Topsham this week, to hold over Sabbath and first day. We hope to see the work of God progress. We have labored earnestly in public and from house to house since we came to this state and we trust a good work has been done. We leave the results with God. It has been hard toiling—hard, hard, hard. Now we leave this field of labor. We have seen the work of God, but everything has moved so slowly. But we will thank God that they have moved at all. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 6
Your father and Brother Andrews are talking as fast as they can talk. Addie Chamberlain is crocheting by my stand. Sister Howland is doing the same by another corner of my stand. Brother Howland is putting on a large log in order to throw out the heat. Beckie is standing behind me untangling a snarl of worsted. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par.. Temptations may be all around you, yet you are safe as long as you do not enter into them. Many of us are overcome by Satan because we walk right into temptation. Now dear son, watch and pray lest you be inclined to enter into temptation. It is your business to keep aloof from everyone and everything which will have a tendency to lead you away from duty and divert your mind from God. Your will must be in submission to the will of God. If there are boys or girls whom you know are evil, you should remain away from them—not place yourself in their society. If compelled to be in the society of those who are evil, you are not compelled to enter into or engage in their evil. You can, by prayer and watching, remain unsullied by the evil manifested about you. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 8. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 9
Now, dear child, be not led astray by any one.. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 10
I hope that George and you will strengthen one another in doing right, in loving. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 11
In love, from your Mother. 1LtMs, Lt 16, 1867, par. 12Installation Welding Assembler

A major improvement of the original model was achieved through the modification of the fire probability function reflecting fuel moisture. This modification allowed for a dramatic increase in accuracy in modeled burned areas for a range of European countries. A pixel-level parametrization of firefighting efficiency also enhanced the model, along with corrections to the biomass map. Advances in modeling regional burned areas and assessment of corresponding CO2 emissions could help to adequately represent the risks of wildland fires in REDD+ programs, as well as in the wider mitigation and risk management context.

I am a full-time healthy-living blogger and fitness coach at SoreyFitness.com so I am constantly talking to brides about the best habits and little weight loss secrets to looking the best we possibly can come the big day.
You would be surprised at how the stress and the anxiety behind making everything “perfect” can lead brides (including myself) to overthink the basics, so I’ve put together a few tips to help you get focused!
1. Plan the wedding you and your fiancé want.
Remember the big day, is first and foremost, something for the two of you. Yes, your family and friends will want to see you both, but they are also there to support you and your future beloved husband. Deciding what you want in a wedding ceremony and reception will help cut down on anxiety and stress, and it will make your job of planning a perfect event much easier. Not only will you be happier, your skin will thank you. When we put ourselves under stress about decisions, our skin will look haggard and even start to produce breakouts.
2. Figure out how you want to look early.
About a month after getting engaged and setting the date, I wanted to cut my hair all off. I was tired of the prep work of long hair and went in with a picture of a bob. My hair stylist just laughed. You do not want to make any drastic changes to your appearance right before the wedding, in my case that meant holding onto about 5 inches of hair I had worked so hard to grow out.
This also goes for the dress and makeup as well. While it is totally okay to have a theme in mind, you should stick to something that really represents you. If you aren’t a vintage gal any other time of year, don’t try to be one on your wedding day. Focus on your best features and what you would love for you– not what looks great on someone else.
3. Stick to products and procedures you know.
One of the most common messages I get from brides is when a procedure or product causes a negative effect. I’m not talking nose jobs or anything major either. Something as small as incorporating a microderm abrasion product or facial can cause a breakout or lagging skin irritation. If you want to have a spa day before the big day, focus on gentle treatments and have them done by a professional. No cheap-o deals for your wedding!
If you plan on buying a few new skin products or having your make up done, I suggest sticking to brands you know and reading the label. Many high-end products still have sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or parabens in them. Both are known toxins that can irritate the skin for a prolonged period of time.
Getting waxed for your wedding is no different than having a new product on your face. I highly suggest doing a test run a month or two before the wedding and also seeing a professional. I’m sure you will not mind having silky legs or a great bikini line leading up to the wedding anyways.
If you do have a bad reaction to a new product or procedure, seek out a dermatologist’s help and let him or her know when the wedding date is so you can get it under control ASAP.
4. Decide your health goals and commit to a realistic routine.
Whether you have 3 weeks or 3 months until your wedding, you can look and feel healthier with small changes in your diet and workout. The main thing is to decide what your goal is. I don’t really suggest going extreme for your wedding; I mean, what’s the point if you lose 50lbs for the wedding and gain it right back because you were starved??
I believe setting a goal and breaking it down into weekly and daily goals. For example, if I want to lose 10lbs in 3 months, I may say that I need to lose 1-2lbs a week by working out and eating right daily. This way I know what I have to do to reach my goal.
Small, consistent changes are your friend. You don’t need to spend a ton of money or spend hours in the gym. My clients workout at home for no more than a hour a day 5 or 6 days a week. They eat a balanced diet and even get either a couple of treats each week or a weekly cheat meal. I help each client figure out what workout is right for their goals, offer daily accountability, and 30 day challenges to help them reach their goals.
Leading up to your wedding is a great time to create and practice a healthy lifestyle that you can continue into your marriage. People that workout are healthier, happier, and more productive; who doesn’t want that for herself or in her spouse?
5. Get enough sleep.
Sounds easy right? Between planning, showers, coordinating with relatives and friends, and the other 200 things on your wedding to-do list, sleep may fall to the bottom of the list. Don’t let it.
Sleep is the bride’s ultimate beauty trick. Getting 7 to 8 hours a night will help you feel and looked rested for your workouts and everything you have planned. Plus, when our bodies get enough sleep, our cortisol, the hormone responsible for belly fat, lowers and our human growth hormone production, the hormone responsible for keeping us young looking, increases. If that wasn’t enough, the Sleep Journal found that people that do not get enough sleep or experience sleep with interruptions, are found to be less happy and even experience feelings of loneliness. Being a bride is one of the happiest times in a woman’s life, and we shouldn’t forget to take care of ourselves during the time leading up to the big day.
An extra little tip for being an even happier and beautiful bride? Take time to pamper yourself. Pampering may be different for every bride. For me, it’s a tough strength workout or reading a book outside on a pretty day. Take time for you and remember your wedding will be perfect because you are marrying the love of your life.
What are your tips for being a happier and healthier bride?

Total Time
Prep 30 mins
Cook 30 mins
This!
Ingredients Nutrition
- 16 ounces crescent roll dough
- 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 2 medium bell peppers (one red and one yellow or orange)
- 1 cup chopped broccoli
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 1⁄2 cups Miracle Whip
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- 1⁄2 teaspoon red pepper
- 1⁄2 teaspoon celery salt
- 1⁄2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1⁄2 teaspoon parsley
- 1⁄2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1⁄2 teaspoon onion powder
Directions
- Cook and shred chicken breast. You can boil it in water with a tablespoon of garlic, pepper and salt or cook it in a skillet with garlic and butter. However it gets cooked, I generally season mine during the process. Place shredded chicken in fridge to cool.
- Preheat oven to degree indicated on prepackaged rolls.
- In a large bowl mix all the spices into mayonnaise and chill in fridge.
- Chop bell peppers and broccoli into small pieces.
- Mix cool chicken, bell peppers, broccoli and cheese into the mayo mixture.
- On a cookie sheet, roll out dough. It comes out of the can as a rectangle; do not separate the rolls from each other. I use my fingers to gently push the perforated lines back together.
- Use both cans together to make one large rectangle, a single sheet of dough.
- Using a knife or scissors, cut 1 inch wide strips in towards the center, starting on the long sides. There should be a solid strip of uncut dough down the center, with the cut strips forming a fringe down each side. Make sure to keep an even number.
- Spread the chicken mixture along the center strip.
- Fold the short ends of the dough up over the edge of the mound.
- Now bring each strip, and its partner on the other side, up to meet on top of the chicken mixture mound.
- Pinch the ends together and fold down.
- Continue until you have a pretty loaf.
- Brush dough with the egg white and bake in the preheated oven 25-30 minutes.
- Don’t undercook or its soggy, its pretty wet bread.

This was so easy and a hit at our party. Everyone loved it. I will be doing this one again. Thank you for sharing.
This is, indeed, a pampered chef recipe and a great one. I used about 2 cups of chopped chicken, 1/2 cup peppers, and 1 cup chopped broccoli and 3/4 cup of mayo. Seasonings were fresh rosemary and dill and salt & pepper, which I had grilled the chicken with too. I also used 1/2 cup sharp cheddar and really it didn't need it. The braid was simple to do and I turned it into a wreath and garnished with fresh rosemary, holly branches, and sprinkled with dill. The candle was not my original idea, but lovely! This was simple, delicious and a stunning presentation.

Wearable Technologies, Tracking and Digital Health
Back in 2008, in the early days of the movement, the only devices available on the “Quantified” market were produced by Nike within Nike+ platform, which was designed by the brilliant mind of the Italian-born Roberto Tagliabue.
Over time, QS continued to grow (see Google Trends) in close relation with the development of new wearable “quantifying” technologies such as the famous FitBit, whose first version dates back to 2008, or the first Jawbone UP of 2011, followed in 2012 by the third activity tracker, the famous, now discontinued Nike Fuelband.

CRANSTOUN, DAVID (fl. 1509–1526), Scotch professor in Paris, was educated at the college of Montacute, Paris, among the poor scholars under John Major. He subsequently became regent and professor of belles-lettres in the college, and by his will, made in 1512, left to it the whole of his property, which amounted to 450 livres. He became bachelor of theology in 1519, and afterwards doctor. Along with Gavin Douglas he made the ‘Tabula’ for John Major's ‘Commentarius in quartum Sententiarum,’ which was published at Paris in 1509 and again in 1516. He is said to have written ‘Orationes,’ ‘Votum ad D. Kentigernum,’ and ‘Epistolæ.’ He also edited Martin's ‘Questiones Morales,’ Paris, 1510, another ed. 1511, and wrote additions to the ‘Moralia’ of Almain, Paris, 1526, and to the ‘Parva Logicalia’ of Ramirez de Villascusa, Paris, 1520.

Quantum Dots Market
SHERIDAN, ALABAMA, UNITED STATES, Nov. 17, 2021 /EINPresswire.com / – According to IMARC Group’s latest research report, entitled “Quantum Dots Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2021-2026, “The global quantum dots market saw strong growth over the 2015-2020 period. Looking ahead, IMARC Group expects the global quantum dot market to grow at a CAGR of 27% in the period 2021-2026.
Quantum dots (QDs), also known as fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals, are man-made nanoscale crystals that, due to their shape and size, emit light in only one color. Compared to organic luminescent materials, QD-based materials have purer colors, longer lifespans, and lower manufacturing costs. As a result, they are widely used in the manufacture of fluorescence and FRET-based biosensors for the ultra-sensitive detection of biomolecules such as acids, sugars, enzymes, antibodies and antigens. Accordingly, they find biosensory applications due to the narrow emission band, which enables a multiplex detection of DNA strands or antibodies or toxins in the detection of pathogens or gene sharing in DNA fingerprinting.
As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis hits the world, we are continuously tracking changes in the markets and consumer buying behavior worldwide – our estimates of the latest market trends and forecast values after taking into account the effects of this pandemic.

Global Quantum Dots Market Trends:
Currently, there is a growing demand for optimized devices that offer better performance and quality of resolution. Since the brightness of quantum dots is usually 10 to 20 times higher than that of organic dyes, their sales are increasing worldwide. In addition, QDs have recently gained importance due to their integration with various nanomaterials such as metal oxides, carbon allotropes, noble metal nanoparticles, organometallic frameworks (MOFs), and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). This has opened up new opportunities and possibilities in the fields of nanosciences and nanotechnology. In addition, quantum dot solar cells (QDSC) are widely used to convert solar energy into electricity. This helps increase the amount of electricity produced by solar cells and provide solar energy in a cost-effective manner while minimizing the amount of wasteful heat that is generated.

(7 more authors) (2020) Impact on air quality and health due to the Saddleworth Moor Fire in Northern England. Environmental Research Letters. ISSN 1748-9326
Abstract
On June 24th 2018 one of the largest UK wildfires in recent history broke out on Saddleworth Moor, close to Manchester, in north-west England. Since wildfires close to large populations in the UK have been relatively small and rare in the past, there is little knowledge about the impacts. This has prevented the development of effective strategies to reduce them. This paper uses a high-resolution coupled atmospheric-chemistry model to assess the impact of the fires on particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) across the region and the impact on health from short-term exposure. We find that the fires substantially degraded air quality. PM2.5 concentrations increased by more than 300% in Oldham and Manchester and up to 50% in areas up to 80 km away such as Liverpool and Wigan. This led to one quarter of the population (2.9 million people) in the simulation domain (-4.9-0.7°E and 53.0-54.4°N) being exposed to moderate PM2.5 concentrations on at least one day, according to the Daily Air Quality Index (36-53 µg m-3), between June 23rd and 30th 2018. This equates to 4.5 million people being exposed to PM2.5 above the WHO 24-hour guideline of 25 µg m-3 on at least one day. Using a concentration-response function we calculate the short-term health impact, which indicates that in total over the 7-day period 28 (95% CI: 14.1-42.1) deaths were brought forward, with a mean daily excess mortality of 3.5 deaths per day (95% CI: 1.8-5.3). The excess mortalities from PM2.5 from the fires represented up to 60% of the total excess mortality (5.7 of 9.5 excess deaths), representing an increase of 3.8 excess mortalities (165% increase) compared to if there were no fires. We find the impact of mortality due to PM2.5 from the fires on the economy was also substantial (£21.1m).Backed by a strong reputation, nowadays it is the leading reference for bestofbreed, breakthrough electronic music.

By Adriane Smith, Race Founder’s Circle and Eastman Young Professionals Steering Board
When I visit George Eastman House, I love to look at Mr. Eastman’s oak box full of index cards recording all of his charitable contributions. George Eastman was a great philanthropist and wanted to make Rochester, N.Y. the best place to live and work.
During his life he supported organizations concerned with health and wellness, culture, education, and more. Today, the charitable investments he made are still at the foundation of many organizations in Rochester and beyond.
It is George Eastman’s generous spirit of philanthropy that inspires the George Eastman House PhotoFinish 5K. In the PhotoFinish 5K, everybody can be a philanthropist. Everybody can invest themselves in the cause they feel most passionate about. And everybody can make a meaningful difference. The PhotoFinish 5K is a community wide event with participants donating and raising money for over 40 nonprofits—with concerns from education to health to culture to animals to music and anything in between.
You can join an existing team or start a new one for your own favorite nonprofit; fundraising is open through October. So many people coming together to support so many amazing causes truly exemplifies the vision George Eastman had for our community. This Saturday, runners and walkers will gather to celebrate George Eastman’s legacy of philanthropy. Come celebrate with us and together let’s make Rochester the best place to live and work.

The band has stated that the sound is similar to Kezia but with a "less poppy and more technical metal" influence. Fortress does not revolve around a single concept, unlike their previous album.
Fortress was met with generally favorable reviews, receiving a comprehensive score of 86 on Metacritic. Tyler Patrick Munro of SputnikMusic states: "The album improves on everything established on Kezia (right down to the much more natural sounding piano codas), and it does so without the sometimes blatant repetition of its predecessor." He cites the track "Bone Marrow", stating: "While 'Bone Marrow' places more emphasis on the underpinning sythns of the first two tracks, its heavy orchestration still takes a backseat to its varying structure, which fluidly transits from hyper-melodic up-tempo to ball-crushing gutturals and chugged syncopation, all of which are made twice as effective by the interwoven bass slapping", and compares the style of the opener "Bloodmeat" to the dissonance of The Dillinger Escape Plan and Converge.While you can go to ASOS, Bloomingdales, or Orivis to get a Barbour International, you can now get one at Amé Amé.

Complyfile was born out of a desire to kill the pain involved in volunteer administrators struggling to manage the overwhelming paperwork required to comply with organizational volunteer recruitment requirements.
So we constantly strive to learn about what works in Complyfile for our customers, and what needs tweaking, and what features customers think might be superfluous to their requirements. Complyfile is a continuous conversation between our customers and the Complyfile team, as we endeavour to align what you need with what we can provide.
Let us know about a feature you're interested in seeing in your Complyfile.
But we're going to be completely honest with you from the outset. We rarely say yes to new feature requests. If we did, we'd be overwhelmed with new features, creating a cumbersome complex piece of software that becomes very tricky to use. Ultimately we check all feature requests against our Mission and Vision.
We look at all feature requests taking these factors into consideration:
We want the Complyfile software to be as powerful as it can be while retaining a simplicity of design and experience. So for every new feature request we have to assess the benefits of the new feature with the downside of potentially having more complex software. Implementing a new feature involves not only developing the feature but also:Getting the latest model for the kitchen is interesting and exciting, but it is also considered stressful. A person should notice that it is not so easy to get modern kitchens in the house. You would have to undertake several things that will help in providing you a better result.
A collection of great tips can only help you in the situation as you will get an outcome in which the kitchen belongs to your dreams. We have illustrated below some tips that you can use while building a kitchen in modern style.
- Get A Model
The thing that you should perform is getting a blueprint of the entire kitchen. A person must model the type of kitchen that he will be making in the house. In this way, you will stick to a plan and get out an outcome in the result.
- Make Use Of Cabinets
Cabinets must be accessed in the kitchen to keep things properly. Whenever you need any item, cabinets will help in getting the things to the proper place. You can also place the cups, dishes, and other items in these things without any Hustle.
- Keep Proper Spacing
If you desire to make a modern kitchen, you must keep proper spacing in the entire place. As a result, you will keep the electronic things properly in the kitchen without any problem. If you want to install a refrigerator or other items like a microwave, then in those areas, you can easily store them.
- Decorate The Belongings
When you are done with the design, another thing that should be considered is the decoration. You must be able to design your kitchen uniquely. For this process, you can use a variety of colors and other things that will provide a unique outcome for your kitchen.

I generally like time warp movies. To give this one credit, it is ingenious, but entirely too cold-bloodedly violent. Written and directed by Rian Johnson it is set inKansasLooprun). of a strange son who lives.
Pitch Perfect
Run time 113 minutes.
Not for children.
This is a musical that is more annoying than entertaining. Starring Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow, it’s the story of a bunch of freshmen in college, misfits who attend college but devote every waking moment to an a cappella singing contest.
Like Glee, the film encourages sexual promiscuity by making light of it. Since the film is obviously aimed at teenaged girls (it’s unlikely anybody older than 15 could be entertained by this), it is irresponsible to show young people having sex willy-nilly without consequences. The way Glee and movies like this wink their collective eyes at teenaged sexual promiscuity is deplorable.
The setup scenes are ludicrous, featuring a campus where the various singing teams hang around the campus as groups, breaking out into song with the least possible provocation. Some of the characters are equally ludicrous. One, in particular, is an Asian girl who speaks with such a low voice that basically all she does is move her lips. I guess this is intended to be funny when it is only irritating. There are a couple of vomiting scenes that are more disgusting than funny.
The movie is supposed to be about singing and music but there are only a couple of production numbers that are worth watching. In fact, the most entertaining song was a short rendition of the Miley Cyrus 2009 hit, “Party in theUSA” (written by Jessie J, Dr. Luke, and Claude Kelley). Alas, it was not only far too short, the way it was presented, the girls singing it on a bus on the way to a performance competition, made no sense.
Brittany Snow’s character as the group leader was so over-the-top, it led the list of annoyances, although Kendrick’s character and performance weren’t far behind. Those deficiencies should properly be laid at the feet of director Jason Moore, though, than blaming the two actresses. It’s hard to believe, at least it is for me, but this is based on a book by Mickey Rapkin. A whole book on this? There isn’t enough story here to make a half hour sitcom. How could somebody write a whole book on this? Can you spell “flimsy premise?”

The most glaring goose egg on the box score came from Pacers starting center Roy Hibbert: 12 minutes, zero points and zero rebounds.

SINGAPORE, May 23 (Reuters) - Free-to-air TV coverage is essential if Super Rugby wants to build its profile in Asia sufficiently for the continent to host a team over the next five to 10 years, the head of the ARFU has told Reuters.
With Super Rugby set to expand from 15 to 18 teams in 2016, an Asian franchise was tipped to join Argentina and a sixth team from South Africa in the competition, which also features five Australian and five New Zealand sides.
Asian Rugby Union president Trevor Gregory thinks this is unrealistic while even the biggest stars of southern hemisphere rugby, such as All Blacks captain Richie McCaw, are virtually unknown in most of Asia.
Gregory, who also serves as chairman of the Hong Kong Rugby Union, believes that 2021 might be a better target date for an Asian team to join the SANZAR competition and truly reap the benefits.
"You have to prepare the ground so that people are chomping at the bit to see their heroes of Super 15, which anybody in the street in Asia right now probably can't name any of them," he told Reuters in an interview this week.
"At the moment who can watch Super Rugby for free? Only the elite of our Asian community can watch that kind of level of rugby because you have to pay and the majority of Asia are not in the elite category sadly.
"If ever there was going to be an opportunity for Asia, it is going to be in five years time ... the 2019 World Cup done and out the way and ride on the back of that interest."
The rugby World Cup will be held in Asia for the first time when Japan hosts in 2019 and Gregory said the event, the third biggest sporting tournament in the world, could provide the springboard to success.
However, the huge global numbers that watch the quadrennial World Cup simply glossed over the lack of viewing figures for the sport's other events, with most fans in Asia's booming population unable to afford pay-to-watch subscriptions.
That scenario has left rugby trailing behind the likes of soccer, American football and basketball in being commercially viable for sponsors, with fans unable to form heroes and relate to the sport without regular access.
"Asia has got two thirds of the world's population, 80 percent of the world's youth, but only 5.6 percent of the (world's) rugby playing population and of that 5.6 percent - or the whole population of Asia - there is almost no free to air rugby coverage," he said.
"So your normal person in India - who sees cricket on every screen every minute of every day and therefore there is a huge commercial value in cricket in India - has never seen a Super 15 rugby match on TV."
Gregory said that world governing body, the International Rugby Board, were trying to rectify that to ensure more rugby was accessible for free for fans around the world.
However, the Englishman, who has lived in Hong Kong for over 30 years, said rugby was playing catch up in the region.
"The IRB (International Rugby Board) are working, trying to get more stuff free to air, like Super 15 and the Six Nations, out into Asia in the next five years as part of the impact program," he said
"The last World Cup was the first time rugby coverage was ever free to air in China. The NBA, the NFL and all these kinds of franchises have been pumping this stuff into China for years which is why they have so many teams there.
"All those kind of things are not in place yet. It is no good just putting it on TV in 2019 because all the people watching won't know who anyone is, they need some heroes to look up to."
Despite his concerns, Gregory said it was still possible for an Asian side to join the Super Rugby competition in 2016 - but only if a wealthy benefactor came forward to bankroll what he predicted would be a $100 million in costs for five years.
Gregory warned, though, that a new franchise in Asia could not simply succeed by recruiting foreign talent.
"I hope it happens one day, having one in Asia at some stage would be brilliant, but it really depends on the mix of players," he said.
"You don't want to have an Asian franchise that has no Asian players. If you want to tap the local market in Japan, Singapore or Hong Kong or anywhere in Asia you are going to need a local hero.
"I don't think too many Asians are going to be interested in going along and pay for a ticket unless there are going to be some Asian players."
HKRFU chief executive Vern Reid, formally with Super Rugby side Western Force, ruled out Hong Kong from bidding this time around and questioned the attractiveness of the proposal.
Reid said he was in the dark about the chances of a wealthy backer stepping in but warned potential suitors that they were only like to see returns in the sport's strong holds of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Britain and France.
"Investing in rugby outside those main markets is almost a contradiction in terms, it is almost how much you pay and what warm feeling you get yourself for running this sort of play," the experienced Australian sports administrator told Reuters.
"Unless you get the benefit of the two home finals, and you get full house of spectators in a stadium of 25, 30,000, then the notion of a return on investment (of an Asian side in Super Rugby) is almost a misnomer." (Editing by Greg Stutchbury)

- Republican Sen. John Cornyn said Thursday that he'll file a bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.
Juneteenth, celebrated every June 19, commemorates the day that news of the end of slavery reached Texas.
“As we do every year, tomorrow Texans will celebrate Juneteenth and the 155th anniversary of the end of slavery in our state,” Cornyn said during a floor speech Thursday.
Cornyn, who's up for reelection, isn't the only Texas lawmaker calling for Juneteenth to be a national holiday. U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Houston Democrat, introduced a similar measure on Monday.
Where Cornyn differs from Lee, though — and there's no way to put this delicately — is that he doesn't exactly have a rep as an enlightened guy when it comes to matters of race.
The three-term incumbent made national headlines earlier this week for dismissing the idea that systemic racism is real during a Senate Judicial Committee hearing on police brutality.
His prickly exchange with former Justice Department official Vanita Gupta during that hearing prompted her to point out on Twitter that Cornyn — when he was Texas AG — gave a Lawman of the Year award to a corrupt Panhandle cop who ran a drug sting focused on putting away Black people.
What's more, Cornyn faced allegations of racism in March for claiming "Chinese culture" was to blame for the coronavirus pandemic. He appeared to base his theory on a debunked rumor that the outbreak began when someone ate bat soup.
Last month, State Sen. Royce West, who's in a Democratic runoff to challenge Cornyn, accused the incumbent's campaign of engaging in “dog whistle racism” by mocking him as “Restful Royce.” West, who's African American, said the nickname plays on stereotypes of Black people being lazy.
Cliff Walker, deputy executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, called Cornyn's proposed bill a "symbolic gesture."
"Juneteenth should be a national holiday, but if John Cornyn really wanted to address racial injustices, he would have to begin by acknowledging the existence of systemic racism in America's criminal justice system — something he refuses to do time and time again."

However that meeting by no means occurred as a consequence of schedule conflicts.
Sure, both have been on the conference and briefly shook arms when launched, but they never had a “meeting” due to scheduling conflicts. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman mentioned Tuesday that Pruitt was ‘briefly introduced’ to Liveris at the conference.

Electric Utilities MACT Project Stakeholders Meeting
Monday, March 12, 2001
12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.
Ariel Rios Building, Washington, DC
Industry
ATTENDEES: new source review activity. This approach was looked upon favorably by some with others indicating that they would have to think about it. It was suggested that if the approach were to be followed, then two work groups may be needed: one technically-oriented to address the data concerns and one policy-oriented to address the broader implications of the MACT rule. The output of the technical work group would inform the policy work group. Outcomes from both groups could be used to inform both the regulatory process as well as the legislative process (i.e., various multi-pollutant bills). Membership should also be balanced among the respective stakeholders. A formal "regulatory negotiation" process is not desired.
The EPA agreed to explore the formation of two work groups under the CAAAC umbrella. The industry representatives indicated that representatives of the Environmental Council of the States (ECOS) could be a voice, along with the State Air Directors. In addition, separate meetings, both face-to-face and by teleconference, between EPA and the stakeholders would also continue. The EPA would encourage continuing direct dialog among all stakeholders. Further, continued use of the Internet, including the possible addition of a list server, for information dissemination was felt desirable by all.
OUTCOME:
The industry believes that it is a rebuttable presumption that there is no trading allowed under the MACT provisions and would like to see trading included in any resulting standards.
The industry representatives indicated that they currently had no preference at this time between a percent reduction vs. an emission limit format for a MACT standard but that they had not really looked that far yet.
OTHER:
There was also discussion on a variety of other topics as summarized below.
The industry representatives present felt that the Agency, by moving away from section 112(n)(1)(A) to section 112(d), had lost a great deal of regulatory flexibility. They would like to follow-up on the level of flexibility available for the MACT regulations.
There was also discussion about the impacts of the recent court decision on the National Lime Association vs. EPA case. One of the findings of the Court was that the Agency must consider emission limits for each hazardous air pollutant on the list applicable to a given source category. The utility industry is interested in following how the Agency is going to apply that decision to this MACT (e.g., what other pollutants beyond mercury, including dioxin, will be specifically addressed).
The issue of the topics subject to discussion (i.e., technical only vs. including health effects) was briefly addressed.
It was indicated by the industry representatives that economic and cost considerations are critical to the decision-making process.. It was also indicated that the Agency needs more information on what goes into the State case-by-case permits (e.g., what pollutants) before it can provide informed assistance.
The industry representatives indicated that a time line for the regulatory development is needed that includes "drop dead" dates for inclusion of the new research results into the process.

Soon over 200 exhibition websites for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), going back to its first web experiments in 1995, will be totally archived, from their images to their code. The project, started in 2014, is a collaboration with the New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC), which includes the Brooklyn Museum and Frick Collection and is concentrated on preserving the digital art history of museums.
Screenshot of the site for the 1995 MoMA exhibition ‘Mutant Materials’ (click to enlarge)
Seth Persons, a NYARC web archiving intern, wrote about the initiative in a post last month marking the 20th anniversary of the first MoMA website, which was made for the Mutant Materials exhibition, launched on May 25, 1995. The site was created by curator Paola Antonelli with a budget of $315 and required teaching herself code. It even preceded MoMA’s general museum site.
As Jess Joho pointed out at Kill Screen, many of these sites are already cached at the Internet Archive, which has been diligently saving the web since 1996 with its Wayback Machine and captures about a billion pages each week. The NYARC project goes deeper, though, enlisting a web archivist who examines each link, image, and cumbersome Shockwave plugin. For example, Persons cited the website for 2003’s Kiki Smith: Prints, Books, & Things as being too complicated for basic web-crawl archiving; sorting through its Flash components required weeks of hands-on work. Others are more basic, like a moody black website accented with blue text for the 1999 Jackson Pollock exhibition, while Wunderkammer: A Century of Curiosities in 2008 has a full-screen Flash experience. Now, when you go to MoMA’s exhibition archives and click through to past shows, you’ll be taken to interactive online sites that appear just as they did for users when the exhibitions were open. Just 14 are still pending in the project.

Antonelli (still at MoMA) takes a similar approach to the acquisition of video games, wherein getting the source code in its original language is an essential part of the process. MoMA is far from the only institution concerned with internet preservation — the Library of Congress is archiving all of our tweets — yet much of social media and online content in general remains surprisingly ephemeral. Jill Lepore surmised in January for The New Yorker that the “average life of a Web page is about a hundred days,” citing BuzzFeed deleting old posts, the demise of MySpace and GeoCities, and the expiration of hosting domains. There’s a whole slew of early museum websites out there that may already be riddled with dead links and broken images, a potential void in our art history.

VACCINATION CAMPAIGN
Of Quebecers aged 12 and up, 86 per cent are fully vaccinated, and 90 per cent have received at least one dose.
Most of Saturday's cases were reported among people who had either received their first dose less than two weeks prior, or never got a shot at all.
That group accounted for 266 of the 429 infections, and 10 of the 17 new hospitalizations.
Public health says unvaccinated people are 19.7 times more likely to be hospitalized after catching COVID-19.

My Neighbor
I love to share real-life stories when I give talks. I usually start out my sessions with a story on how I got interested in Big Data Clusters. It all starts with my neighbor Tom (not his real name) last year (2018). I was at the bus stop with my 5 yr old son on his first day of Kindergarten. As I am waiting patiently for the bus to arrive I hear a voice say,
“Are you in IT?”
I ignore it as I thought it wasn’t meant for me then I heard the question again. This time I turn around and notice my neighbor, Tom. He saw one of my SQLSaturday shirts I was wearing and that sparked the question. So we talk a little and I reply,
“yes I am, how about you? What do you do?”
He replies, “I work for a pharmaceutical company as a data scientist.”
Immediately I thought he’s too smart for me! So I start asking questions about his day-to-day activities. (Mind you, as a SQL DBA, I never worked with (or needed to know) big data, data scientists, etc.) He told me that he’s currently working on speeding up the first phase of FDA drug approval by utilizing ML (and algorithms). Tom continued to elaborate on what the FDA drug approval phases are. I’m not going to go into details (you can read the link if you want) but the first phase (or the beginning phases) require studies. A lot of this can be sped up with ML sifting and analyzing huge amounts of data. So instead of it taking (for example) 2-3 years for the first phase to complete, now you can do it in 8 months (or even less). Around the same time I started hearing about SQL Server 2019 and a new thing they are calling “Big Data Clusters.”
As I started doing research on what exactly is big data, big data clusters, ML and AI, Hadoop / HDFS, etc. I came across some jaw dropping statistics that I’d like to share with you.
Dr Evil
I came across a study that estimated, 90% of all data today was generated in the last two years. (like whoa!) For example, Walmart collects 2.5 Petabytes of data from 1 million customers every hour. Billions of Facebook messages, tweets, YouTube videos, etc.
Here’s a quote from Walmart’s CEO back in 2013,
We want to know what every product in the world is. We
want to know who every person in the world is. And we want
to have the ability to connect them together in a transaction.
Kind of like Dr Evil eh? (Now, I’m not saying Walmart’s CEO is evil, but that quote is quite eerie?)
If you want to read more chilling facts on how much data Walmart collects on its customers, feel free to read this.
Industry Use Cases for SQL Server Big Data Clusters
Healthcare and retail are not the only industries that provide perfect use cases for Big Data Clusters. A couple more industries are finance, manufacturing, agriculture and public sector. There are tons of scenarios in which BDCs would be a perfect fit to analyze the organization’s big data.
For example, imagine the agriculture industry. Data can now be collected from soil sensors, GPS-equipped tractors, and external sources such as local weather channels, farmers who implement these precision agriculture technologies are gaining greater visibility into their operations.

A. Before the hepatitis B vaccine became a routine recommendation in 1991, every year about 18,000 children in the United States were infected with hepatitis B before they reached 10 years of age. Half of those 18,000 early-life infections were not contracted during birth from an infected mother. Instead, they were caused by exposure to someone who, knowingly or not, was infected with hepatitis B virus. Because the hepatitis B virus is present in such large quantities in the blood of someone who is infected, it can be transmitted through quantities of blood not able to be seen with the naked eye, such as from shared toothbrushes or washcloths. Because a large number of people infected with hepatitis B are unaware they have the disease, it is extremely difficult to be confident we can avoid the infection through our own actions.
Q. How can a “one-size-fits-all” approach to vaccines be OK for all children?
A. While a quick glance at many published schedules might suggest a “one-size-fits-all” approach, the reality is that the schedule is actually multiple pages in length and is supported by a 60-page “General Recommendations on Immunization” document and 25 to 40 page documents specific for each vaccine. These guidelines take into account many factors including individual differences in current and long-term health, allergies and age. So the truth is that the schedule isn’t “one-size-fits-all”; it’s what should be done for each patient depending on their medical history.
Q. How can I find out if children in my child’s class are vaccinated?
A. Parents have the right to question safety and health procedures at their children’s schools. How are children dismissed at the end of the day? How is the school prepared to handle a fire or an unwanted intruder? What type of supervision occurs on the bus or playground? Those questions have answers that schools are typically able to easily share as matters of policy. Unfortunately, when it comes to vaccination rates, the same is not often true.
However, in California the state health department has created a novel tool for parents that allows them to see immunization and exemption rates in schools throughout the state. As a part of Shots for School, the tool lets parents enter an address, zip code or school name and view that institution’s immunization rates for uptake of different mandated vaccines, the exemption rate and the percent of students with all required vaccines doses. The data is collected from child care facilities as well as kindergarten and seventh grade vaccination records.
Parents interested in the immunization rates in their children’s schools can check directly with the school or their local health department to see if this information is available. It may also be worth checking if your state would consider offering a similar program to the one in California.
Editor’s note: A reader subsequently shared with us the following resources for people in states other than California: About Pediatrics: School vaccination and exemption rates; USA Today immunization report.
Q. We have a newborn, and he is too young to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine as well as the first does of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Given all the reports about measles, what can we do to protect him from vaccine-preventable diseases?
A. Unfortunately, when our babies are too young to be vaccinated, our best recourse is to keep them away from situations in which they may be exposed to infectious diseases — and even our best attempts are not always sufficient. When we go to work or have young children in school, diseases may come home. However, here are few tips to help avoid spreading illness to your newborn:
Q. Where can I find the game online?
A. Vaccine Trivia: Just the Vax is on the Vaccine Education Center’s website and can be easily found by going to vaccine.chop.edu/trivia. We hope you will remember the URL, play the game, and challenge your family and friends!
Q. Is it too late to get a seasonal influenza vaccine?
A. No, it’s not too late to get an influenza vaccine. Influenza season tends to peak between December and February, but may last throughout the spring. However, because it takes about two weeks to develop immunity after immunization, it is important to get immunized as soon as possible.
Q. We’re the proud parents of a newborn boy. He is too young to receive a flu shot and has just begun the recommended vaccine schedule. With the holidays coming up and many extended family members and visitors excited to meet him for the first time, how can we protect him from getting sick?
A. While your newborn is likely to be exposed to viruses and bacteria regardless of your efforts this holiday and winter season, you can take several steps to protect him while meeting relatives and friends:
Q. I never get the flu, so why do I need the vaccine?
A. Influenza can put a healthy person in bed for several days very quickly. Indeed, people who had influenza can often remember the exact hour they became ill. In addition to being severe for some, the virus can spread to others through coughs and sneezes. While measures like proper hand-washing, covering coughs, and avoiding others who are ill can help decrease the chance of getting influenza, the best protection comes from immunization because it provides specific immunity to the virus.

Q. Why does my son need a specific HPV vaccine, while my daughter can receive one or the other?
A. There are two HPV vaccines available:
Because Gardasil offers protection from genital warts and Cervarix does not, Gardasil is the only one given to boys. Because this vaccine also affords more protection for girls, girls or their parents may want to ask which vaccine they are being offered as well. Although the CDC does not express a preference for girls, the truth of the matter is, if given the choice, most girls and their parents would likely also choose the vaccine that affords broader protection..
Q. I have heard that measles is occurring in the U.S. If my child cannot get the MMR vaccine until he is 1 year of age, are there any other precautions I can take to protect him in the meantime?
A. Infants generally have protection from measles for several months after birth as a result of immunity passed on from their mothers. This is the main reason the measles vaccine is typically not given to infants younger than 12 months of age. However, if the child will be traveling outside the United States or if the risk is elevated in a particular geographic region because of an outbreak, the vaccine can be given as early as 6 months of age. If you are concerned, talk with your child’s doctor about whether this would be appropriate for your situation. You can also take precautions like avoiding contact with susceptible children, such as those whose parents have chosen not to vaccinate, and by keeping your child out of large groups if measles is circulating in your community.
Q. My child has peanut allergies. Are there any vaccines that he should not get?
A. None of the routinely recommended vaccines contain peanut oils, so your child does not need to forego any immunizations for this reason. Similarly, we have been asked about corn allergies, and the same is true.
However, gelatin, eggs and latex are allergies that should be considered prior to getting vaccines. Latex is not in vaccines, but it is contained in some of the packaging.

Q. My 2-year-old child recently moved to the U.S. from China where she had one dose of the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine as recommended, does she need the second dose now that she is here?
A. In the U.S., the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine is only recommended for people who are likely to be exposed to JE during travel. If your daughter will be making a trip back to China or to somewhere else that would increase her risk, then she would need to get the second dose. However, you should consult a travel clinic as the determination of need is based on trip-specific information, such as exactly where she is going, how long she will be there and what she will be doing.

Q. Is there a vaccine to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?
A. No, although researchers have been working to design a vaccine for many years, vaccine development has been difficult. HIV changes rapidly as it replicates in even a single individual. This makes HIV difficult to prevent because immunity provided by a vaccine against a previous version of the virus may be ineffective against a newer version of the virus.

Q. I heard some seasonal influenza vaccines have four strains of influenza virus and some have only three strains. Should I wait to get the four-strain version?
A. Although the four-strain version protects against an additional strain of influenza virus, it is more important to be vaccinated early enough in the season to have immunity when influenza arrives in your community. So, you should get whichever vaccine is available at your earliest convenience, keeping in mind that it takes about two weeks to develop immunity after vaccination.

There is some debate as to whether or not Scott's numbers are as bad as the latest poll from Quinnipiac University showed. Some newer GOP-leaning polls have suggested that the 29 percent number given to Scott by Quinnipiac may be too low.
Still Scott's poll numbers have triggered some debate and speculation on whether his unpopularity could aid President Barack Obama and the Democrats in Florida come next year.
There are some who obviously think mentioning Scott could help them.
U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch on Tuesday, for example, sent out a fundraising pitch for this quarter that asked his supporters to "send Rick Scott" a message as state lawmakers get ready to redraw districts.
But others say that the fate of Obama is tied to the national economy, not anything that Scott does.
"Rick Scott could be at zero percent approval, and if unemployment is at 10.5 percent or 11 percent, then Barack Obama is not getting re-elected,” Rick Wilson, a Republican strategist working for Adam Hasner in the United States Senate race in Florida, was quoted in a story that ran Tuesday in the New York Times.

Yet many of the more trained musicians know their part, and can play it to a proper tempo regardless of surrounding.
It's not just a matter of tempo; that's easy to fix (though I really do think it'd be hopeless without either a standardized click track or, later on, using recordings from previous iterations). Similar with raw dynamics; you can change the volume of a recording pretty well.
What I'm... concerned?... about is stuff like phrasing, articulations ("how staccatto is this stacatto?"), breaths/bowings, swells, string fingerings, etc. There's a [i]lot[/i] of interpretation possible even within the confines of a written score, especially in some kinds of classical music. (Broadly speaking, the older a work is the less spelled out is the score. Nowadays you'll see specific tempo markings ("quarter note = 90"), but in Beethoven's time you'd just see "moderato" or whatever.)
I feel like even if you took the score and wrote pretty detailed instructions (e.g. notated most of the bowings explicitly) throughout, gave out a click track, etc. but didn't go through the iteration process I mentioned before, the result you'd get would be technically good but musically mediocre.

Yes. Composers like Maurice Durufle are considered 20th century classical, which is often characterized by the tasteful use of discord, not so commonly found in early classical. Check out Durufle's Requiem, an extremely difficult choral piece. A 21st century classical style has not formed yet to my knowledge, but there are many classical composers still at it, many working on film and stage soundtracks, John Williams among the more notable.

Music requires instrumentation. Be it as simple and free as a human voice, or as complex and closed as a Stradivarius. Complaining about the cost of a specific piece of equipment seems disingenuous.

There is no such thing as an "upright-grand" piano, baby or otherwise. The action (i.e., key/lever mechanism) hammer directions and string orientations are completely different on an upright and a grand. These differences create a distinct experience when playing and pedaling them. They're both good, although IMHO a grand is better. Of course, the "best" piano is the one that is available when you need it.

Yes, I know about such pianos, but they're still uprights. My guess is that the term "upright-grand" was invented by a piano manufacturer for marketing purposes. It's still an oxymoron, albeit perhaps a useful one in this context.

It's modifiable in that you have access to all the individual channels as they were recorded. This makes it much easier to extract individual instruments, put together your own mix, add or even replace parts with your own recordings (this recording of Eroica needs more cowbell...)

You can find this product here & make sure to use my coupon code HEL91 to get 10% off all orders. I decided to do a design to match this new blue lipstick that I purchased from Born Pretty Store a few weeks ago. I started with two coats of Essie "Strut Your Stuff" and Sally Hansen "Pumping Iron" I did the lips in Strut Your Stuff and used the silver Houndstooth Print. The first one I removed with tweezers and placed on my index finger. It felt like the material was nail polish because its very thin & flexible. It was pretty hard to remove from the plastic sheet I had to scrape it off with the tweezers to get it started. I thought it would be simple clean up around the cuticles so I made sure it fit all the way to cuticle area with a little over lapping on the skin, I eventually just cut it with scissors because I couldnt get the acetone to dissolve it. I smoothed it down as best as I could and it still wrinkled a little bit & then I trimmed the end and filed the rest off. I sealed it in with Seche Vite but topcoat only made it wrinkle even more and made little bubbles underneath it as well and the edges started to curl. The second sticker I placed on my middle finger after cutting it to fit my nail, that helped with the clean up around the cuticle. So I do not really recommend this product. Maybe it was something I did wrong but Im not sure what that could have been. I wish the product would have been a better quality, they come with at least 10 for each color & there are 6 colors so the ideas and possibilities would have been great ! I hope yall enjoyed this in depth review, there is a close up of the decals below so you can see them after topcoat was applied.

F.Finding stocks that are rapidly growing but still undervalued is not an easy task. When you find one, it can be a great company to add to your portfolio.
So what would you do if I told you there was one stock that was down 65% from its 52-week high in February, but that was also currently posting revenue growth of 116% year over year in the third quarter and has a value of only 8.9 times sales?
Describe these metrics Magnite (NASDAQ: MGNI), an online advertising technology company that is growing massively yet relatively cheap, especially when compared to many of today’s soaring growth stocks.
Let’s talk about why this under-the-radar stock could be a great buy in November.
Image source: Getty Images.
Leader in a fast growing industry
Magnite competes on the seller side of the ad technology (adtech) industry, which means it represents publishers who want to sell ad space. Magnite works with buy-side advertisers or adtech companies – companies that represent advertisers – to sell its publishers’ ad space to the highest bidder. Magnite’s priority is the publisher – making sure they make the most money on their ad space – but the company also helps advertisers find the most effective way to reach their target audience.
Magnite is a leader among sell-side adtech companies, but its market cap is only $ 3.6 billion – which shows how under-penetrated the adtech space is. Global digital advertising spending is expected to grow from $ 325 billion in 2019 to $ 526 billion by 2024, an average annual growth rate of 10%. That suggests there is a lot of growth going on for the industry as a whole – with Magnite possibly the biggest beneficiary.
The company became the market leader in April 2020 through a merger of equals – The Rubicon Project and Telaria. The company then acquired other companies, including SpotX and SpringServe, to drive growth in connected TV (CTV). .
Because of its size and leadership, Magnite has drawn impressive clients, including Disney, Roku, and the NBA. Magnite focuses on CTV – advertising on streaming services to increase revenue per user while controlling the user experience for publishers – and the company sees this as its most important growth opportunity for the future.
Prove your worth
So far, the company’s growth strategy has paid off. Magnite announced third quarter results on November 3, reporting revenue growth of 116% to $ 132 million. CTV’s revenue reached $ 43 million, up 290% – or 51% excluding SpotX or SpringServe earnings. The Company’s acquisition of SpringServe was completed on July 1.
The company’s net loss increased significantly – faster than sales. The net loss for the third quarter of 2021 was $ 24.3 million, an increase of 131% from the net loss of $ 10.5 million for the third quarter of 2020. This resulted in the company’s net loss margin increasing from 17% of sales to 18.4% of sales.
While that loss is small, it should be moving in the opposite direction for an industry leader. This was due to sales and marketing expenses, which more than doubled year-over-year from $ 22 million to $ 52 million.
The company has been consistently near profitability for the past two quarters, bringing the company’s total net loss this year to $ 0.4 million. His free cash flow that year was $ 34 million, which more than made up for his net loss for the year. For a company that 100% plus sales growth, strong free cash flow generation and profits close to breakeven, a valuation of 8.9 times sales is very attractive.
What could go wrong
The main problem investors have with Magnite is that much of the growth comes from acquisitions rather than organic growth. This was evident in the third quarter when the company only increased its CTV sales by 50%, excluding its acquisitions. If you are not concerned about growth through acquisitions, you can brush this under the rug, but there are many investors (myself included) who pause when they see a company that is growing primarily through acquisitions.
The other major risk is that Magnite could be affected by privacy changes made to operating systems by alphabet‘s google and Apple. Both companies have announced that they will limit access to cookies. Cookies are an important source of data for advertisers advertising online and on mobile phones, so removing cookies would make Magnite’s mobile and web ads less effective and less valuable.
However, CTV advertising is not exposed to this risk. Given where Magnite’s focus is, this risk is less important than it is for other adtech companies like The trading desk.
The bottom line is that Magnite’s growth as a market leader is incredible, and when you consider how high the ad spend could get, the future growth potential is enormous. Buying a market leader which is growing fast at just 8.9x is a steal which is why I think Magnite might be a top stock to buy this month.

I agree. After spending a weekend with the Surface Tablet, it's clear that Windows 8 is a disaster that will make Vista look like a huge success. It is totally confusing to use, uglier than sin, and Metro is really just a shell over the OS. On Surface, the icons to change network preferences are tiny. The "Start" menu launches the horrible Metro UI. Metro shows your emails including junk emails where anyone can see them. I used a dummy Hotmail account & it shows links to p0rn websites and Viagra ads. It's really shocking how bad this OS looks, acts and works. No JAVA or Flash support either. For HLS streaming to the iPad, that's fine. The "tube" adult websites have been modified to support the iPad / iOS. I really doubt they will create and re-encode their entire libraries for Surface. M$FT copied things on iOS without understanding _why_ Apple removed Flash and JAVA support outside of compiled apps. F-
I hear you "Sil"...I fear I've ruined an old computer of mine that had XP on it !

you bashers and shorts think Java is a big deal- who do you work for Oracle?? Java is a curse that has wasted more computing power than the world will ever be able to recover. As far as the Surface machine its about 10 times better and prettier than any Iturd or droid turd. You can tell everybody I said so. As far as using the Microsoft stuff you are lying thru your teeth and Im betting you have never seen any of it. I wouldnt be surprised to find out that you are too stooopid to learn how to use the Microsoft button on W-8 and switch back and fort from W-7 mode to mobile. I know you are too stooopid to learn how to use the mobile features and would have to have someone help you with it. Give it up- stick close to the attendants - especially if they give you access to the computers in the library
Java is a curse, but many sites use it, and those sites are OFF LIMITS to W8 users.
Is Oracle and Java so small that MSFT just opted to overlook it?
What else have they overlooked? The OS is dreadfull.

You're obviously too STUPID to use w8.
OK, here is an experiment: try to get to the Paint application from desktop mode in less than 3 clicks. Under Metro, look at the labels for where drive formatting are located, etc. It's a mess that turns basic UI rules from the last 30-years on their head. Metro is, basically, Zune on your phone, tablet and desktop computer. Or, try this: Hand a four-year old an iPad and a Surface. See which one is playing Angry Birds before the other. iOS is, IMO, 100X more intuitive and consistent as a UI. I'm telling you - Windows 8 will not be widely accepted in the enterprise. Windows 7 will be just like XP with a 5-10 year extended shelf-life.
You all are not telling the truth thats Clear enough for me.Above ground pools are just that, pool that sits in a frame on top of the ground. An above ground pool consists of a heavy plastic liner surrounded by a metal or wooden support. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes (round, elliptical, or rectangular) and there are even "do it yourself" kits for the adventurous pool lover.
Above ground pools can be portable, coming down and storing away in the garage over the winter or even packing in the van with your other belongings when you move. If the liner springs a leak, there are any number of inexpensive products to play little Dutch Boy. Relatively cheap, you don't even have to pay taxes as an above ground pool is not seen as a property improvement.KIMBERLEY GIRLS’ HIGH SCHOOL, Kimberley

Contact: A/Prof Wayne ReidAndy Harrin will never forget the words spoken by a staff member during one of his many visits to see his mother at Masonic Village at Warminster.
“Your mother is a gift to us.”
“When that was said to me … that’s a powerful thing to say to someone,” he said. “What I’ve witnessed over the past three years is just that. They will love your family member like you do.”
Andy’s mother, resident Eli (Elinor) Harrin, celebrated her third anniversary at Masonic Village in early March. Andy had explored other continuing care facilities, but when he visited Masonic Village, he knew it was the right place for his mother.
“In the first five minutes, I said ‘These people do things very differently than anywhere else I’ve been,’” he said. “I didn’t see people with passion [at the other places]. I saw people doing their jobs. There’s a big difference. When I strolled the facility [at Masonic], I was blown away by how they cared for people, from the ladies at the front desk to the nurses. Over the last couple years, I saw people love my mother.”
Elinor Harrin was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease nine years ago. Although her memory is limited, she is “always happy,” Andy said. At Masonic Village, she enjoys playing bingo and other games, watching movies and socializing with residents in small groups. Andy and his two sisters, Patti and Terri, live nearby. At the height of the pandemic, they had outdoor visits with their mother every Sunday through the window in the multi-purpose room. Last Sunday was the first time in months they were all able to sit at an actual table with their mother.
“She was great,” Andy said. “She wanted to hug and high-five us. We had to explain why we couldn’t do that yet [because of COVID].”
Elinor grew up in Ashland, Pennsylvania. She had nine siblings, including two who passed away, one being a fraternal twin. She attended St. Joseph’s Catholic School in Ashland. After completing her education, she started her career at Bell Telephone as a board operator. She also waitressed for many years while raising her family. Later in her life, she worked for First Pennsylvania Bank, which was acquired by Philadelphia National Bank and later became Wells Fargo Bank. There, she worked her way up to become supervisor of the tellers.
Before moving to Masonic Village, Elinor lived with her late husband, Tom, in the same house in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, for 50 years.
“It’s the only home she had in her adult life,” Andy said. “She stopped eating, did not have the best hygiene and became confused. I thought, ‘She’s going to fall down the steps one night.’ I could see things were changing, and I was no longer comfortable. That’s the reason I started looking at facilities. Masonic Village was the right fit.”The General Services Administration had so much response to its request for information on a possible cloud brokerage services that it has extended the deadline for responses.
Officials initially planned to close the window for responses on Aug. 17. The new deadline is Sept. 7.
GSA had more than 160 industry participants at the Cloud Brokerage Industry Day Aug. 2, and the wait list was large enough that officials could not accommodate everyone who wanted to take part, said Stan Kaczmarczyk, director of cloud computing service at the Federal Acquisition Services’ Information Technology Services Office.
“When we spoke to our industry partners and saw the great questions, interest, and knowledge we could potentially tap, we decided it was in the best interest of both the government and industry to extend the RFI,” he said.
A cloud brokerage is one concept that GSA is exploring to manage the acquisition of cloud services. A cloud broker is an entity that manages the performance and delivery of cloud services, and negotiates relationships between cloud providers and cloud consumers.
The RFI contains questions specific to cloud brokerage. Officials want to know if the cloud brokerage concept will bring the government more benefits from cloud computing and if industry is ready to deliver the service today.
Officials want to know how agencies and industry have used cloud brokerage already and what experience has taught them.
On a larger scale, GSA is seeking innovative industry approaches for acquiring, securing, and managing advanced IT services, according to the RFI.
“We want to be amiable to the requests of our industry partners to ensure sure we are making decisions based on the best information available,” Kaczmarczyk said.
Officials estimate that $20 billion of the government’s $80 billion in IT spending is a potential target for migration to cloud computing solutions.
This year, GSA has worked with six agencies to evaluate the cloud brokerage concept, as well as discuss high-level requirements. Officials are wondering whether there’s a demand for a next generation cloud acquisition model potentially based on the cloud brokerage concept.
GSA officials said they plan to pursue an approach in fiscal 2013 to meet agencies’ growing interest. The main drivers are the increasing use of cloud IT services and the government’s efforts to minimize the cost of capital IT investments. Officials are also exploring new ways to make adopting cloud computing easier and more effective for agencies.
GSA wants to learn more about how the government can leverage the key characteristics and advantages of cloud computing. They want to use it to save money and make IT work more efficiently—two emphases of agencies in these tough economic times.:Don't forget to stop buying records from Amazon and start buying from your local record store either in-store or online–but not Amazon.

Ergotron Workfit-T Sit-Stand desktop workstation is a table raising platform that allows users to quickly regulate the height of their table or workstation enough so that they can stand while working. This platform’s unique design makes it suitable even in the tightest of spaces as it only uses the area it is placed on and moves only vertically up or down from that position. With dimensions of 36” by 24”, the platform offers enough space for most desktop equipment and accessories, including laptops and computer monitors. Its load-bearing capacity covers most user’s needs at over 35 pounds. Ergotron, the manufacturers of Ergotron Workfit-T are headquartered in the USA in St. Paul, Minnesota and they have sales offices in the Netherlands and Japan. Their trade name is a mash-up between ergonomics and electronics which encapsulates their niche for ergonomic electronics accessories. Their first sit-stand product came out in 1994.
Using the Ergotron Workfit T
The Ergotron Workfit T Sit Stand is very simple to use. Out of the box, it only needs a sturdy flat surface to be placed on and can be used immediately. The table riser’s mechanism works like a scissor lift and moves only vertically upwards or downwards, ensuring that it does not take up more space than the base it’s sitting on. The height adjustments are made with very little effort by pulling two levers by the sides to disengage the braking system and then pulling up or pushing downwards. The levers are released to engage the brakes and set the Workfit T Ergotron into position. There are no preset positions so the height can be set exactly as desired. The main platform can support a weight of up to 35 pounds and the keyboard platform can support not more than 5 pounds. All cables should be installed while the platform is at its highest position to ensure that plugged items are not yanked off when the table riser is raised. TheErgotron Workfit table converter can be raised to a maximum of an extra 15 inches beyond its fully collapsed height of 5 inches to make a total of 20 inches above the table surface.
Build Quality
The Ergotron Workfit-T is sturdy even at its highest position and doesn’t buckle under a heavy load or wobble when placed on a flat surface. The steel components have a smooth finish but aren’t frictionless which could have left room for accidental slips of items placed on it. The edges are very safe as they are not sharp and have a curved bezel. The model has been subjected to many rigorous tests to assure users of its safety and sturdiness in operation. A few of these tests are:
Cycle test: ensures the workstation does not fail in its operation after being extended and collapsed a minimum of 10 thousand times at maximum load capacity.
Sharp edge test: ensures there are no sharp edges or points on the workstation.
Rigidity test: makes sure the unit remains stable and does not tilt or tip over at its maximum weight capacity.
Unique Features of the Ergotron Workfit
The Ergotron Workfit T reviews are excellent and this may be because there are some features present in the product that set it apart from other manufacturers. Some of these are:
- Additional accessories that may be purchased and used to make more space on the platform and provide independent screen adjustment, for example.
- The design ensures there is no horizontal extension so the user never has to make adjustments to chairs or tables before using it.
- The 15 inches of vertical height adjustment is one of the highest in the market.
- The product can operate perfectly in tight spaces, in corners or against the wall.
- The unit remains stable even if the whole of its base is not completely resting on a surface. It can operate with surfaces as little as 18 inches deep.
The Bottom Line
The Ergotron Workfit reviews are generally good and that is because it is a very good product with a lot of improvements over other similar offers on the market. There are a lot of positives about the product with only the keyboard shelf and the decision to make a cut out of the main platform to accommodate it the only shortcomings. It would have been better if the keyboard platform could be pulled out from the table converter’s body and independently adjusted. Although this table converter is expensive, it is still within the range of other similar products and the fact that it ships free to almost all US locations makes it an attractive proposition especially for an item that weighs more than 20 kilograms.
Ergotron also has a lot of other accessorial products that can make the use of the Ergotron Workfit even more enjoyable and efficient. The terms of the 30 day trial period are not exactly risk-free as you will have to pay for shipping and handling charges if you choose to return the product, but it is better than a no refunds policy. The lengthy warranty is very good considering the $400 spent on this product. It amounts to less than 25 cents per day to use it and get it replaced or repaired if there is a manufacturing or material failure over the period of 5 years. The Ergotron Workfit T Sit Stand desktop workstation is available for purchase on the company’s website and also through more than a dozen of their reselling partners.

Seriously. This will be a breakthrough in approaching Scheme to children, and I would like to participate in such a project. The best. Jerzy Karczmarczuk(.
The generic ballot question asks respondents if they would vote for a Democrat or Republican in their congressional district, without naming any specific candidates. It's used by many polling organizations, including CNN/Opinion Research Corporation surveys.
The latest CNN Poll of Polls is an average of four national polls conducted from late September to October 3: CNN (September 21-23), Newsweek (September 29-30), Gallup tracking (September 23-26, September 30-October 3), and ABC News/Washington Post (September 30-October 3). The Poll of Polls does not have a sampling error.
The GOP's single digit lead in the CNN Poll of Polls is similar to the three-point advantage that the party held in mid-October polls in 1994. By late October of that year, the GOP margin had grown to ten points, and in November the Republicans grabbed 54 seats back from the Democrats, winning control of the House of Representatives. They also captured the Senate.
In the battle for control of Congress, the generic ballot is arguably the most watched polling indicator. But it should not be considered one-stop shopping.
"The problem with interpreting the generic ballot is that a national poll cannot produce the same results that 435 separate polls in 435 House districts would produce," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "That's why analysts tend to look at other measures as well."
Among the other indicators to consider are the favorable ratings of the two parties, questions about which party should control Congress, ratings of the parties on major issues, and the president's approval rating.
"Some academic experts have done a good job forecasting the results of midterm elections with statistical models that pay little or no attention to the generic ballot," Holland says. "But if you're looking for just one number that tries to forecast what will happen in 435 different House races, the generic ballot is usually the one most analysts focus on."

And last week Democrats were up 5-10 points, and some other polls still have Dems up, then Reps down... polls are very erratic and unreliable..
American voters are so damned stupid it's nauseating. Uninformed, easily swayed by idiotic ads and rhetoric. Democracy is doomed in this country.
Proof that a majority of Americans have the memory of a mouse with a human brain.
How could anyone want to go backward and put the same people/party in power when we haven't even recovered from their last "huge" pile of fecal matter they dumped on us?? It might take a generation or two just to get back to where we were before the Republicans had total control and drove us into this fiscal, social, and bureaucratic swamp they are apparently so proud of.
Possibly we are not as great a species as we'd like to think we are.
as long as the democratic party runs people like alan grayson then they will loose every seat ...ck out anderson cooper interview.. i have never seen a more of a slim ball ever....this guy... what a pathedic little man ...what a looser grayson is...
Who conducts these polls of LIKELY VOTERS and what part of the country do they poll?
I am a sure voter and they have never called me.
Is this selective polling?
What's different about now and 1994 is that cell phones were rare then, now everyone's got one and those numbers don't get called. Also, telemarking is so out of hand now that I don't know anyone – that is those that still have a land line – that answers their phone unless the know who is calling. You can't get rid of the survery people, credit card offers, fundraisers so most folks don't even bother. What you have to watch is which party is raising money and from whom. The Democrats' fundraising efforts are either toe-to-toe or better than the GOP, who is raking in funds from special interest thanks to the SCOTUS. With the Dems' raising as much or more than the GOP, and it's money coming from regular folks, that spells WIN WIN WIN for Dems in November. When you can develope some reliable polls, let me know. Until then this is just BS.
Dumb, forgetful americans
Right..................so what makes this the "Poll of Polls"?
Short-term memory is a horrible thing to lose. This country has forgotten who got us into this mess. The GOP clearly wants to take back power so they can get us back into another downward spiral while lining their constituents pockets. This would be a success for big oil and Wall St.; a loss for middle Americans and our environment. Sadly, it's the middle Americans who aren't getting it. If anyone thinks any Admin. could have turned this mess around in 2 or even 3 yrs. is fooling themselves. No on the intolerant, obstructionist GOP who've been hijacked by right-wing religious fanatics. Seriously, voting for someone like Angle or O'Donnell, are you serious?
Ironic. These working class whites are flocking to the very Party which has ignored their please, sent their work overseas, is insinuating that they should work for the world level labor rate (i.e. 80-cents an hour US) and has turned a deaf ear to everything that would make their existance better. So when thier red-neck world falls in around their ears they wil only have themselves to blame.
Bring on November!!! Dems have stated their case! Their control of congress has been a waste!! Lets be sure they leave with great haste!!!! This message approved by someone with common sense!!!
By only six points. With all the damage that Obama and Pelosi have done, I was sure it would be closer to ten. Well, it probably would if the media did its job on reporting the massive short falls of Obamacare, the financial 'reform' joke, the joke that is Holder and the Justice Department, no offshore drilling for the US (while we give money to Mexico and Brazil to do it), the purpose of the Energy and Education departments (and their failings), the deficit, the vast expansion of the liberal hated Patriot Act, wars.... and the list goes on.Household holidays are about more than the vacation spot they are also concerning the reminiscences you can make together and part of that comes from staying in vacation rentals that encourage family bonding.

The Arthur C Clarke award was originally established through a grant from Clarke, and goes to the best science fiction novel of the year. Previous winners include some of the biggest names in the genre, from China Miéville to Christopher Priest, but this year, six debut writers were shortlisted. Australian novelist McKay won for The Animals in That Country, a depiction of a world where a “zooflu” epidemic allows “enhanced communication between humans and nonhuman animals”, sending many people mad. When wildlife park guide Jean’s son loses his mind and sets out with his daughter Kimberly to find out what whale song really means, she follows him, along with Sue the dingo.
“In many ways Laura’s book could be considered as a first contact novel, only the multiple alien species that humanity encounters have been sharing the Earth with us all along,” said the award’s director, Tom Hunter. “In this way the novel speaks for the silent victims of our real-world climate crises, but while the environmental and social themes are deeply serious, our judges also praised the book’s dark humour, sense of character and place, and its active opposition to easy genre tropes.”
McKay said it was a “momentous honour” to win the Clarke award alongside former winner Atwood, after borrowing her poem title.
“This is an award for readers and writers who share a love of literature that dares to imagine sideways, backwards and future worlds to try to make sense of the world that we live in now. Speculative fiction – the sort of sci fi that I adore – is particularly reflective of our times because it’s often set realistically, with extraordinary events (pandemics! extinction! talking animals!),” she said.
“That the Arthur C Clarke judges would recognise a novel that depicts how we as humans relate to other animals and environments is such an exciting outcome – for me (of course) but also for the many people who care about the state of the planet. And to win on such an extraordinary shortlist this year is gobsmacking.”
McKay, who previously won Australia’s richest literary prize, the $100,000 Victorian prize for literature, for her novel, said when she started writing, she was looking to recreate the “moment of wonder” that can come in the wilderness.
“When I’m off on a bush walk in New Zealand or Australia, I’m always looking out for that moment of wild encounter – where you see a kererū bird or an echidna and just gape in wonder,” she said. “But that moment changes a lot if the animals start communicating. As well as curiosity, our contact with other animals is often fraught, violent and deeply unequal. In The Animals in That Country I wanted the humans characters to step aside and let the animals do the talking. What would they have to say? I bet it isn’t what we want to hear ... I thought maybe if I could write a book that did that, I (and other readers) might stop and listen to the animals in our lives, too.”
McKay was chosen as winner by a judging panel headed by Dr Andrew Butler from a shortlist that also included Patience Agbabi’s The Infinite and Hao Jingfang’s Vagabonds, translated by Ken Liu.
“For 35 years the Clarke award has promoted not only the best of science fiction but also new ways of defining and exploring it,” said Hunter. “Laura’s win repositions the boundaries of science fiction once again, and we’re delighted to welcome her to the genre.”
McKay wins prize money of £2021, as part of a tradition that sees the annual award money rise incrementally by year from the year 2001 in memory of Clarke, whose 2001: A Space Odyssey was published in 1968.By Matt Van Hoven of Mediabistro
A study from Arizona State University, University of Cologne in Germany and Erasmus University in the Netherlands found that campaigns utilizing real sized women, which includes ‘plus-sized’ models, “are unlikely to work on their intended customers”.

An interesting finding that came from the study was that the size of the reader relative to the size of the model is a factor in self-esteem.
The takeaway here: women can’t be fat and they won’t ever make more money than men.

The list is so long when giving back to others. It can be as simple as smiling more at strangers or making an appointment to give blood.
If you baking is your thing, how about some sweet treats for your favorite business or person?
Recently on social media, I've seen groups being created like gift-a-gal or even surprise booze drop-offs!
It doesn't have to cost you anything but making a point to look for ways to give back and outside of your circle is so important to your mental health and the mental health of others.
Food is my love language so I will share my favorite burrito recipe. Chorizo con papas :)
Ingredients:
The biggest tortillas you can find
Your choice of beans (refried or black beans are great)
Your choice of cheese (Mexican Blend or Mozzarella are favorites)
Butter
Eggs
Pork Chorizo
The Papas (potato) you can peel and chop up and pan-fry, oven bake or grab your favorite frozen mix for convenience.
1) Your potatoes take the longest, drop a touch of water in the pan before adding your chorizo, cheese added to beans is divine, at least 50 whisks at least while fixing your scrambled eggs and right before they are done hit em with that cheese and Tapatio for the finish is perfection.
2) If you are planning on making a lot of them, wrapping them in tinfoil and setting them in a warm oven is great.
This is very filling comfort food that can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. #HappyEatingThe Modern Art Notes Podcast is a weekly, roughly. The program has published new episodes each Thursday since 2011.

F.No. 113-02/2015-SB

Subject:- Mandatory use/ opening of Savings Account in CBS Post Offices for maintaining/ development of relationship of customers with Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) – further clarifications to SB Order No.12/2015 regarding
Sir / Madam,
In continuation of SB Order No.12/2015 issued vide this office letter of even number dated 05.10.2015 on the subject, the undersigned is directed to convey that a number of references form Public by mails, letters and phone calls have been received, mentioning that Opening of new Saving Account at CBS Post Office is taking too much time/ even days due to which maturity payments are getting delayed. Post Offices are not issuing cheques to the customers. The competent authority has reviewed the matter particulary in the backdrop of issues being reported in CIF Creation and Modification menus of Finacle CBS Application and has decided to issue following clarifications:-
1. The objective of the letter dated 05.10.2015 was to educate the customers for availing various benefits of Post Office Savings Account in CBS Post Office and to develop / maintain relationship with the POSB customers through Savings Account. With this, a customer can also have a holistic view of all transactions happening in various accounts/ certificates standing at different post offices in his/her name. Looking to the benefits of Savings Bank Account, field units may be asked to continue to persue the customers to open savings account for better and sustainable relationship with POSB. However, in case of extreme exegencies like a Bank or any Institution presenting Certificates after forgeiting security, any depoistor becomes NRI after investment and now wants to take maturity value only, the claim case where there are multiple nominees/legal heirs or any other case where Postmaster/ Sub Postmaster is satified that depositor is genuinely not in a position to open savings account immediataly may issue cheque for the maturity / prematurity value. Depositors may be made aware that facility of transfer of funds through NEFT/RTGS and use of Post Office Savings Bank ATM cum Debit Card in other Bank’s ATMs will also be provided shortly.
2. In case a depositor of RD or PPF is also genuinely unable to open Savings Account immediately, then may present cheque of other bank for deposit but for future deposits he/she may be requested to open savings account.
3. For all new investments in any scheme including through agents, customer should open Savings Account mandatorily with proper KYC documents to start relationship with POSB and then invest in any of Small Savings Scheme through the same Savings Account. In such cases, if customer wants to invest through cheque of other Bank, his/her cheque should be lodged only through his/her savings account and then new account/certificate should be funded from that savings account by putting cheque credit date as Value Date.
4. For subsequent deposits by RD, PPF and SSA Accounts, Customers/MPKBY Agents should be suitably informed that from 1st Jan. 2016, all such customers should be asked to submit POSB Cheque only for their subsequent deposit and if they donot have savings account in any CBS Post Office, they may have to open Savings Account with cheque Books.
5. All MIS/SCSS/TD Account Holders who open further new account or extend the existing accounts, should also be requested to open savings account mandatorily and give standing instruction for credit of interest so that they need not visit post office frequently and stand in queue, instead they can be issued ATM/Debit Card to withdraw from ATMs. Existing account holders should also be convinced to open Savings Account for getting monthly/quarterly/yearly interest.
6. It is further reiterated that for all the entries made in Clearing Inward / Outward, ECS Inward/ Outward, BO Settlement and Postmaster Repayment Office Account (0340) by the User are to be verified by Supervisor. For these entries, it will be the personal responsibility of that User and Supervisor.
7. It is requested to circulate this order to all CBS Post Offices and non CBS Post Offices may start requesting customers to open Savings Accounts to avail all the benefits once office is migrated to CBS.
Yours faithfully,
(Kawal Jit Singh)
Assistant Director (SB-II)(Written by Rachael Menn) A children’s room is probably the most important room in a family’s home. It is where the baby or the young ones sleep, play and rest. The room must be kept as clean and neat as possible. It must be free from dust, germs and clutter.
The room must also be filled with toys and furniture that will satisfy the needs of the children. There is a lot of choice of children’s bedroom furniture sets that parents can buy to make their kids’ room convenient, creative and comfortable.
Some of the more important furniture is the bed and the children’s wardrobe, where favourite clothes are hung to avoid them from getting wrinkled and dirty! The bed must be made of durable and high quality materials to ensure the kids’ safety and comfort. The mattress needs to be just the right softness to protect delicate little backs.
The room must have either plenty of room for storage, such as a toy box, shelves, or chest of drawers with different compartments and drawers to accommodate the children’s clothes, socks, uniform and underwear. There must also be room to display or store a child’s collections and other valuable stuff.
- Boy’s Room
Bedroom furniture for kids varies depending on the child’s age, gender and preference. A boy’s room could have a bed and table that comes in blue, red, green or grey. Boys may also have a theme for their room. Some of the popular themes for boys ages 3 to 9 are Ben 10, Batman, Avengers, Superman and Sponge Bob. Posters and pictures of their favorite actors, singers, wrestler and celebrities may also be posted on the walls.
A good idea is for your boy’s room to have a chest of drawers and a wardrobe that match the bed frame. A shoe rack is also a good idea for keeping shoes and slippers tidy. A boy between five to ten years old usually loves buying magazines so parents must make sure that there is a magazine rack to keep all his magazines tidy. A study table where he can do his homework and place his favourite books is also a great idea.
- Girl’s Room
Girls’ rooms may also have a special theme. Princesses, famous actresses and singers could be the key theme. Just like boys’ rooms, a girl’s room could have a table where they can study, a magazine rack for their magazines and a comfortable couch or bean bag.
Girls will also most likely want a place, such as a dresser or shelf, where perfume, nail varnish, lotion and jewellery can live. The dresser must have a full view mirror because girls like to dress up and fix their hair, hence a dresser with a full mirror is a great idea.
It’s all too tempting to buy furniture in bright colours, but by choosing neutral colours such as white or natural wood, bright splashes of colour can be added in the form of bedding or decorations, for example rainbow striped bedding for boys, or pretty pink bedding with heart or flower design for girls.

Speak Your MindAre you thinking of filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7? While this can be a quick way to do it and as a filer, you won’t be required to pay back your debts, it is best to use a professional bankruptcy lawyer for the same.
You should know a few things about filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7:
- Who Can File For Bankruptcy?’
If you are thinking of doing this, you need to know whether you are eligible to actually file for it. Not everyone will qualify. For instance, if your gross income is less than the state’s median income, you are going to be able to qualify for it.
You may still be able to qualify for it even if your gross income is higher, but after paying the allowed monthly debts, you will still not be able to make the Chapter 13 repayments required. Vohwinkellaw.com Is the best firm to ask for help in this matter.
- Time And Money Required
If you are thinking of filing for bankruptcy, it is obvious that your financial situation is not too rosy. That is why knowing how much time and money will be required is a good thing. The process is going to take anything between 4 to 6 months after you file it. You will be required to go to the courthouse along with your lawyer once to file the claim.
- Automatic Stay
Another point of consideration you must make about filing for Chapter 7 is that you will be getting an ‘’automatic stay’’. This is something that is going to stop the creditors from trying to collect the money that you owe them. This can be great because it is going to give you a lot of relief.
Basically, with this automatic stay, your creditors will not be able to take away your wages or your property, your house, or your car.
- Control Of Your Financial Affairs
The most important thing you need to know about filing for Chapter 7 in bankruptcy court is that you will be giving control of your financial affairs to the authorities this way. You will be placing your properties technically with the courts to do with it as they deem fit.
You will not be able to sell anything or dispose of or give away any of your properties after filing. However, whatever you earn in wages or acquire after filing the bankruptcy will be yours to do with.
- Your Property
It is normal to worry about what is going to happen to your property after you file for Chapter 7. Usually, most of such property that belongs to the debtors get exempted or is in such condition that they are virtually useless for the purpose of raising money to pay off creditors.
Filing for Chapter 7 in bankruptcy court is a huge decision. It must be taken after a visit to a professional lawyer with experience of the same.Supportability

The United States on Monday crossed the staggering milestone of 500,000 COVID-19 deaths just over a 12 months because the coronavirus pandemic claimed its first recognized victim in Santa Clara County, California. Before this incident, it was not clear whether or not the virus could be transmitted via stable organ transplants, although it’s nicely documented with other respiratory viruses. Donor transmission of H1N pandemic influenza has been detected almost completely in lung transplant recipients, Kaul noted. While the Michigan case marks the primary confirmed incident in the U.S. of transmission by way of a transplant, others have been suspected. The transplant recipient deteriorated rapidly, creating multisystem organ failure.

When i try to either set up the RSS Feed in ESS GRAFFITT or even just click on the RSS icon at the top of the page, I get a feed validation error. I am on the newest version of the theme.
Anyone have an idea why this is?
Syahir Hakim
Topic moved to support. Please post in the correct section. And if you haven’t, please read the forum rules. Repeated breach of rules is ground for deactivation of your account.
Your RSS feed works just.So you’re going to start a blog!
First off, let me say congratulations.
This is your first step to being able to work from home and have the freedom to do what you choose.
The happiness I get from working at home is something I’ll be eternally grateful for.
I wouldn’t change it for the world.
Having a blog has allowed me to be able to make money each month like these.
As you can see this is recent earnings as of writing this Bluehost WordPress setup guide.
Here’s another screenshot of the commission from another offer I promote. You can see daily sales coming in.
This is something that I linked to from one post and it still makes me money. It’s only small but it all adds up.
This one is again from just one piece of content. This is only a very small commission but it’s stacking and growing each month.
Won’t be long till it’s closer to $200 a month.
This is another offer that I’ve created pieces of content for.
As you can see, it’s not millionaire money but it’s enough to work at home and have more freedom in my life.
To be able to take my son to school and pick him up each day is priceless and it’s all down to having a blog and working from home.
This is not all the offers I promote either.
The possibilities are endless.
You can do the same.
Whatever it is you want to blog about, you can with a WordPress blog.
So anyway, I’m sure you want to just get stuck in and start your own blog.
What you’re about to do will take about 15 mins and your first blog will be up and running.
In this step by step guide, we will be using Bluehost to host your domain and set up your WordPress.
Bluehost is one of the most affordable and trusted hosting companies.
WordPress recommend Bluehost as the number one choice for hosting.
You also get your Domain for free with Bluehost.
And hosting is cheap, being as low as $3.95 a month.
It’s super easy to set up as well because they offer one-click WordPress install.
No installing WordPress through some complicated cPanel backend.
It’s all super easy with Bluehost as you’re about to find out.
So anyway, let’s do this!
How To Start A WordPress Blog With Blue Host.
The first thing to do is…
You’ll then see a page like this.
Then click the green get started now button.
That will take you to a page to select your plan.
It’s up to you what you want to go for. The basic plan should be perfect for you as you are just setting up your first blog.
You can always change or upgrade later if you need to.
Choose Your Domain.
Once you’ve selected your plan it’s time to choose your domain.
I presume you don’t already own a domain, so put your domain name in the new domain box and click next.
Note: .Com domains are the most trusted and I would recommend you going for a .com if possible.
Also, make sure your name is congruent with what you talking about on your blog.
Don’t call it makemoneymom.com if your site is going to be about chicken recipes.
Also if the domain you want isn’t there then try a prefix or suffix.
Here are some suffix examples you can put on the end of a domain.
So say you wanted topgaming.com but it wasn’t available you could try topgamingspot.com.
Here are some prefix examples to put at the start of a domain.
You can check now to see if the domain you want is available.
Once you’ve put your domain in the left box you’ll get taken the account information page like this.
Fill out those details then choose your package information.
If you want to get a better deal then choose 24 or 36 month option.
12 months is fine though, and that’s you covered for the whole year then.
Also,
Uncheck the package extras as it will make it cheaper for you.
They aren’t necessary.
You can always add them later if you want them.
Then it’s time to put your payment info in.
Note: If you want to use PayPal then click the see more payment options button.
Now you’ve done that you’ll be prompted to create a password.
Do that step. And write down your password so you don’t forget it.
Once you created your password you’ll get the congratulations message.
Simply click the login button.
I’m not sure if it makes a difference on this next step but it might worth verifying your Whois domain records quickly before you forget.
Keep your Bluehost tab open and open another tab and check your email.
You should have an email now that says something like…WHOIS Verification for yourdomainname.com
Just open that email and click the green Verify Your Email button.
That’s it and your domain will be verified.
Next, carry on where you were.
Pick a Theme
You should now be on the pick a theme page after logging in.
Choose a theme that Bluehost provides for free.
And don’t worry if you don’t like any that much as you can always choose a different theme later on.
I’ll go more into themes after the basic set up.
Once you’ve done that you’ll see a screen with a blue button that says start building.
Click that button.
You should now see the welcome to WordPress page.
It asks you to choose business or personal.
Choose which one you want or choose I don’t need help.
Once you’ve done that, you should now see the Bluehost WordPress dashboard.
More WordPress Theme Options
So, as I said before there’s plenty of options when it comes to WordPress themes.
The Bluehost’s ones are good but there’s plenty more available which might be more suited for what you want.
Firstly you’ve got the free themes that you can access via the WordPress backend.
To find them you need to click the appearance tab, then themes tab.
Once you’ve done that, click the add new button.
You’ll then come to a theme search page
This is where you’ll be able to look through all the free themes that WordPress has available.
Some are good and some not so good but there’s’ plenty to choose from and they’re free which is perfect if you’re on a budget.
Simply search through using the features, popular, latest and favorites tab or you can search manually.
There’s so many so you should be able to find something you like.
Any you like the look of simply hover your mouse over it then click preview.
If you like it then click the install button and activate it.
You must remember to activate the theme once you’ve install it as it won’t be live otherwise.
Premium Themes
If you want something more special then you may want to buy a premium theme.
This theme, for example, is a premium theme I bought from Theme Forest.
This theme is called Soledad and it’s my favorite theme as it’s got soooo many customizable elements and features.
It also has dozens of amazing pre-built themes you can install.
Call it the theme with dozens of themes built in.
It really is powerful.
Theme forest is the place to go when looking for a WordPress theme as they have so many to choose from.
Feel free to check them out if you want something a little nicer.
Uploading a theme manually
If you invest in a premium theme then it’s pretty straight forward to install.
SImply head the themes page that you were just on then click upload theme.
Once you’ve clicked that you’ll be prompted to choose a file for the theme you want to upload.
Simply click the choose file button and add the themes .ZIP folder.
Once the theme is uploaded make sure you click activate and then your theme will be installed and active.
Next, we have plugins.
Installing WordPress Plugins
So, if you don’t know what plugins are then let me explain.
So say you have your blog, and you wanted to add something like a social sharing bar.
Something like this social sharing plugin which is at the top and bottom of this post.
Then you would install a plugin which would do that.
For example,
The social sharing bar is called Social Warfare and to add it, you would get the plugin by downloading it form Social Warfare.
You would then upload it to your plugins area on your WordPress backend.
I would advise not to install too many plugins as it will slow down your site.
It’s best to use only necessary plugins.
Here’s a list of recommended free plugins (that I use).
- Contact Form 7 – For adding a contact form to your Contact page
- Easy Table of Contents – For adding a table of contents to your posts (good for SEO but not essential)
- EWWW Image Optimizer – Increases your page speeds by way of image optimization
- Google Analytics – Shows you all your website traffic stats
- Lazy Load by WP Rocket – Helps speed up page loading times
- Limit Login Attempts – A security plugins to stop multiple login attempts
- Social Warfare (free or pro version) – Great for Pinterest users!
- TinyMCE Advanced – Adds more font options when creating blog posts.
- Wordfence Security – WordPress Firewall developed specifically for WordPress and blocks attackers
- WP Fastest Cache – Helps speed up your site
- Yoast SEO – Love this plugin, it’s great for on page SEO
NOTE: Some themes require a few extra free plugins to be able to get the maximum functionality.
This is completely normal if the theme requires it.
Just don’t go crazy adding loads of plugins that you don’t really need.
The ones I mentioned above are all free (except the pro version of Social Warfare) and they can be found by searching the WordPress plugin database.
I’ll show you how to do now.
To add a plugin simply click the Plugins tab then Add New on the sidebar on the WordPress backend.
You’ll then get taken to the plugins area which you can then search for the plugins you want.
Like the plugins in the recommendation list I gave you.
then once you find the plugin you want, click install and then activate it.
If you have a plugin you’ve downloaded from somewhere else,
Like a premium plugin like Social Warfare for example, then you can add it manually by clicking upload plugin.
Then once you click Upload plugin you’ll see the option to choose a file to upload.
This is where you upload the .ZIP file of the plugin you want to upload.
All plugins come in a .ZIP file so don’t worry you don’t need to convert any files.
Simply click choose file then select the plugin you want to install from your computer.
Then click install.
NOTE: Make sure you activate your plugins once you’ve installed them.
If you want to activate or deactivate any plugins just head to the “Installed Plugins” area.
That’s where you can access all your plugins.
So now you’ve done that, you’re good to go!
Congratulations! Give yourself a big pat on the back.
You now have your own piece of internet real estate.
Hosted with Bluehost and WordPress installed.
I suggest you have a look around and click all the side tabs on the left and see all the options and get to know your way around the WordPress backend.
At the minute your site will look pretty basic as it has no content.
So this is where the real work begins.
It’s time to get working and creating some awesome blog content!

Very inspiring , I remember it’s a great feeling to wake up and look at your email to find a new sales coming from your affiliate link
Thanks! It’s such a great feeling isn’t it? It’s something that doesn’t get old 🙂<![CDATA[CHENNAI: The State government has approved 650 high-speed internet-enabled tablets to be issued for verification of passport applicants that will help the work to be done in three days. The Regional Passport Office (RPO) here would issue hand-held devices to police personnel involved in field-level verification, say diplomatic sources. The City Police usually take more than a week to complete the verification process that begins with the downloading of applications from the passport office. Field-level officers are given hard copies which they carry to the addresses to physically verify details of the applicant. They resubmit the applications to the police commissioner’s office which uploads the verified documents on to the passport office website. Using the new system, the field-level officers can access the applications on the tab and update the documents after verification, sources said. The commissioner’s office will send the same to the passport office. All tabs would have high-speed internet connection. Two Police personnel from the city police received training in Bengaluru last week on using the tab. The Ministry of external affairs is also planning to make Police verification an once-in-a-lifetime procedure. A passport which is to be reissued within three years will now not require Police verification. The Regional Passport office is also mulling the payment of 150 per application for the verification done by police which now go to the state exchequer. The RPO now wants this amount to go towards the police revenue as it would serve as an incentive for policemen who carry out the verification. Police personnel carrying out the verification will upload the details onto the passport office web site. A top MEA official said, “In the new system, the field-level police personnel involved in the passport verification process can directly see the application on their Tabs and, after finishing the verification, the application will be updated and the unit office sends the same to the passport office. The entire process takes three days’ time”.]]>

Egyptian press reports indicate that a new foreign minister, whose identity is still unknown, will be sworn in two days after incumbent Amr Moussa becomes the secretary general of the Arab League.
The semi-official daily Al Ahram said that Moussa’s successor would be sworn in by President Hosni Mubarak at the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh on Wednesday.
The papers quote unnamed diplomatic sources as saying that the candidates include Nabil Fahmi, Egyptian envoy to Washington; his colleague in Paris, Ali Maher; and in Tel Aviv, Mohammad Bassiouni; in addition to the head of the country’s mission to the UN, Ahmad Abul Gheit.
Others speculate that Mubarak’s adviser, Osama Al Baz will take the portfolio.
Meanwhile, the chief of general intelligence, Omar Suleiman, who previously topped the list of candidates, appears to have been counted out, according to the reports.
Speculation about the new foreign minister’s identity has been rampant since Moussa was assigned by the March Arab Summit to succeed his compatriot, Esmat Abdel Meguid, as the Arab League’s head.
The popularity of Moussa, an expert at handling thorny regional issues, has crossed Egypt's frontiers for a long time, says Arabicnews.com.
Moussa, who was born in Cairo in 1936, joined the foreign ministry after earning a BA in law from Cairo University in 1957.
He then followed the traditional career path of diplomats, taking several posts abroad. In 1987, he was appointed Egypt's ambassador to India, and in 1990, he moved to New York to become Egypt's permanent representative to the UN.
Less than one year later, in March 1991, Moussa was appointed as foreign minister to succeed Abdel Meguid, who was then appointed secretary general of the Arab League.
This occurred at the point when the headquarters of the league returned to Cairo from Tunis. The headquarters had been moved to Tunisia in 1979, following the severing of relations between the Arab states and Egypt after it signed the Camp David accord with Israel.
Moussa became foreign minister after Egypt's reconciliation with the Arabs, and just a few months before the launching of the Madrid conference in October 1991.
Since then, Moussa and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have contributed to drawing up the Palestinian policy towards Israel by advising Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, making Cairo one of the most prominent regional mediators in the peace process.
Moussa's popularity has been such that a popular Egyptian singer, Shabaan Abdel Rehim, composed "Ana Bakrah Israel, Bahib Amr Moussa" (I Hate Israel and Love Amr Moussa). This song has been very popular in Egypt, and several Arab and Western media outlets have labeled it an "embodiment of the mood on the Egyptian street."
In January 1999, while in Tel Aviv, Moussa refused to shake hands with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon.
The news of Moussa's nomination to head the Arab League came as a surprise to many. Certain independent and opposition commentators had said that the purpose of the appointment was to isolate him from Egyptian policy.
Arab diplomats expect Moussa to energize the his post’s role in the league, and to work to settle inter-Arab differences, especially between Iraq and Kuwait, as well as the Western Sahara dispute between Morocco and Algeria.
Abdul Meguid’s term of office at the Arab League ends on May 15 – Albawaba.com

After a nearly 2 month break i’m back to labbing for the ccie exam. I’d never had similar breaks before but the reason for doing so were manifold.
Firstly, i was just fed up with doing labs every single day. Secondly, i felt i was making progress anyway because of how much stuff i learnt at my work. Thirdly, I had to revise the mpls theory, which i’d never been very strong at. Finally (and most importantly), my little project called ”the son” is way more fun than doing labs and probably any father can relate to that.
So after this little break, i’m back with recharged batteries. My personal deadline for the exam is still January 31, 2019 so let’s get down to business.About nozzle quiz® info

Made in TaiwanDustin Poirier faces the biggest fight of his mixed martial arts career at UFC 236. “The Diamond” takes on featherweight champion Max Holloway for the UFC interim lightweight title. It’s fitting that he’ll use it to achieve one of his biggest charitable goals.
In Aaron Hill’s Honor
With each of Poirier’s recent fights, the lightweight contender has raised money through his non-profit, the Good Fight Foundation, to benefit his hometown of Lafayette, LA. Following each fight, Poirier auctions off his fight-worn gear to help fund the foundation’s current goal. In the build-up to UFC 236, Poirier will be raising money to fund a playground for disabled children at Lafayette’s Prairie Elementary in honor of the late Aaron Hill.
According to the foundation’s homepage, Aaron was diagnosed with the incurable disease ALD (Adrenoleukodystrophy) at the age of six. Within six months of his diagnosis, he lost his ability to see, hear, walk, talk and eat. Aaron passed away at the age of seven, 14 months after he was diagnosed.
The foundation’s page reads that Aaron “was a happy, healthy boy who loved to read, laugh, watch cartoons and play outside… He absolutely loved going out to the playground. When he was in the wheelchair, he liked going for walks, [but] he would’ve loved to swing. He most enjoyed being outside with his friends, playing. Aaron’s wish was to have a disability playground for children with special needs!”
Though Aaron didn’t live to see this through, his life and wish inspired Poirier and his wife, Jolie, to raise funds through the Good Fight Foundation to create the playground in Aaron’s honor. Poirier told MMAJunkie in an interview that it will feature a plaque in the center of the playground dedicated to Aaron. The playground will have equipment accessible to disabled children, such as swings for those in wheelchairs.
UFC 236 Details
UFC 236 takes place on Saturday, April 13 at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta. Poirier and Holloway are likely fighting for the next crack at UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov. Nurmagomedov was suspended in October for his role in a post-fight melee following his title defense over Conor McGregor at UFC 229. UFC 236 can be purchased live on PPV through ESPN+.

Craig Lasher is a Senior Policy Analyst at Population Action International (PAI).
As a veteran foreign aid advocate, I was keenly interested when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced in January a major restructuring of the U.S. government's foreign assistance program under a new vision of "transformational diplomacy." Its lofty goal was described as "helping to build and sustain democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system." As the details of the new strategic framework for foreign aid begin to emerge, however, my cynical concern that short-term national security and democracy promotion objectives favored by the State Department would trump the traditional focus of U.S. foreign assistance on development and poverty reduction appears to be on its way to being confirmed. Such a shift could prove enormously detrimental to long-term development programs, including family planning and reproductive health.The River City Book Bash was on Saturday, July 20 in Cincinnati.

Buzzing into School Today
I had a great time as the “mystery reader” for my son’s first grade class this morning at Buckner Elementary (that’s my son sitting by me-at least he’s not old enough for Mom to embarrass him yet). I read Fuzzy Buzzy’s Treasure to them and gave every kid a cute pom-pom bee. The kids loved the story and had lots of questions/comments. A great big thank you to all the kids, to Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Collins for letting me share today.
Here is one of the bumblebees I made:

Sometimes, I find myself wishing I was a kid again, especially when I get out of bed cracking and popping like Rice Krispies. I bet you wish you could turn back the hands of the clock of aging as well. But, if you really think back to when you were little, you might remember some big struggles. Like learning to ride your bike without training wheels. Learning to tie your shoes. Learning to read and write. Speech impediments. Getting glasses. That first day of school–so scary and exciting at the same time! Braces…ugh. Bullies and big brothers, and a multitude of bruises. Let’s not forget peanut or bee allergies.
Then there were tougher things. Losing grandparents. Divorce. Perhaps even poverty and abuse. Things we don’t understand fully as adults. Some of us had to grow up a lot quicker than we should have.

Ukraine took its first major step to rid itself of dependency on Russian gas imports on Thursday (January 24) when it signed a $10 billion shale gas deal with Royal Dutch Shell. The 50-year production sharing agreement, signed on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos,. They remain at odds over the terms of a 2009 Russian supply deal brokered by former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, for which she is serving a jail sentence. President Viktor Yanukovich presided over the signing between Shell's Chief Executive Peter Voser and new Energy Minister Eduard Stavitsky. "This is a great opportunity to say - it is just a beginning, we will continue to improve our relations, to be able to find flexible mechanisms to develop the economies of our countries in this difficult time of crisis," said Yanukovich after the deal signing ceremony. "We are very pleased with this big step which now means - and you can say that to me afterwards - now Shell needs to work and deliver and we will do that," said. Production in Ukraine is several years off and will depend on results from 15 test wells. - ReutersUS financial regulators have approved a new rule that requires banking organizations to report any “significant” cybersecurity incident within 36 hours of discovery.
Under the rule, banks must notify their primary federal regulator of events that are likely to materially affect the viability of their operations, their ability to deliver products and services, or the stability of the US financial sector. Huh. This can include large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt customers’ access to banking services, or computer hacking incidents that disable banking operations for extended periods.
Additionally, banks – which the rule defines as “banking organisations”, which include national banks, federal consortiums and federal branches of foreign banks – must notify customers “as soon as possible” if the incident affects their customers. Affects for four hours or may occur or more.
“Computer-security incidents can result from destructive malware or malicious software (cyber attacks) as well as non-malicious failures of hardware and software, personnel errors, and other reasons,” Computer-Security Incident Notification Final Rule telling. “Cyber attacks targeting the financial services industry have increased in frequency and severity in recent years. These cyber attacks can adversely affect the networks, data and systems of banking organizations and ultimately their ability to resume normal operations. can affect.
The final rule, approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), will be effective April 1, 2022. With full compliance expected by May 1, 2022.
It is not clear whether this rule will also apply to banking startups and fintech companies. Nerdshala contacted the FDIC for more but did not immediately hear back.
Financial regulators first proposed the notification requirement in December, but after receiving some negative feedback from industry groups, it was forced to change some elements of the final rule. For example, the original version stated that banks would have to report incidents if they “believe in good faith” they had suffered a significant cyber incident, but the industry warned that this could lead to a higher incidence of incidents. There could be over-reporting of a wide range, and the rule changed.
“After careful consideration of the comments, the agencies are replacing the ‘goodwill’ standard with the determination of a banking organization,” The final rule sums up, “The agencies agree with the commentators who criticized the proposed ‘believe in’ standard, which was too subjective and precise.”
Bank Policy Institute, one of the industry groups that commented on the regulation, said in a statement that it supported the last rule.
“BPI recognizes the value of timely notification and supports the final rule, which establishes a clear timeline and flexible process for notifying regulators and affected parties when a significant event occurs,” said BPI’s Technology and Risk Strategy. Heather Hogsett, senior vice president of “The rule significantly lays down a clear distinction between notification and reporting. Cyber Incident Notification encourages early collaboration between regulators and banks to keep regulators informed of situations that could have broader implications for the financial system while banks work to respond and investigate the incident.Plugin to create a resistive layer between 2 materials in order to compute effective transport properties.
Transport properties (conduction, permeability, …) can be computed on tomography images using various softwares. For heat conduction for example, each voxel is assigned an intrinsic conductivity and the effective conductivity is computed by solving the heat equation on the system.
In some cases, a resistance on the transport can appear at an interface between 2 materials. For example, in Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), a cathode is made with 2 types of conductors: an electronic conductor which brings electrons to a reaction site, and an ionic conductor which brings ions from the reaction site to an electrolyte. At the reaction site, an electrochemical reaction occurs between a gas (oxygene for exemple) and electrons to form an ion. This reaction induces a resistance in the transport of species due to the charge transfer.
The plugin Sort Contact locate the reaction sites and replace the contact between 2 types of material by a resistive layer. The value of the resistance of this layer depends on the size of contact.PP tee 63 x 50 x 63

Thirty seconds into our conversation, she said: “I’m a single mom, too!”
Actually, Tomima (whose Scottish name rhymes with “Jemima” but with a “T”) is so much more: she runs two successful companies– HerRoom.com and HisRoom.com. So, I got Tomima’s card and promised to catch up post-BlogHer.
“After having a child, I was wearing those granny panties,” Tomima says. “Women often dumb down their fashion when they’re pregnant, and they have to pull themselves out of it after having a child.”
The same could be true after going through a divorce, or a disappointing break up. Those frumpy panties certainly can’t make you feel better.
Unfortunately, even years after their divorce or split, many women are still wearing granny underwear. On the one hand, it’s understandable: fancy new panties are pricey!
But Tomima says that sexy underwear doesn’t have to be expensive. “Besides, if you’re on the dating scene, you have to be ready,” she adds.
She shares a trick she learned from Tyra Banks: “I always wear high cut briefs. Tyra said, the skimpier the bathing suit, the skinnier you look. The same is true for panties.”
Tomima also explains the basics of women’s sizes: “A small is a size 5, a medium is size 6, and a large is a size 7. When you get panties that are too large, they’ll get loose and creep up.”
And thongs? “No one wants to wear a thong all day. A thong is good for a night time date, so you feel sexy.”
How about Tomima’s favorite brand for men? The number one designer brand 2xist.
“Men often get stuck in a rut of buying those three packs of white underwear from Walmart,” says Tomima. “But they need to upgrade, too! Please, no more $6 Hanes underwear. And guys should steer clear of of white. They look like goobers when they finally get their magic moment. Men, buy black or gray. Black also makes you look thinner.”
Here’s the contest. Tomima has offered to give away one free pair of women’s and men’s underwear to one single mom and one single dad.
Tell us: What is your favorite brand of underwear… and why? Don’t be shy.
Personally, my favorite style is the boyshort panties, like LuLus.

The First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced further changes to the Covid-19 restrictions.
The Welsh Government has confirmed further relaxations will be brought forward from 17 May to 3 May,. A higher proportion of people have.
‘Sacrifices’
The First Minister Mark Drakeford.
Welcoming the announcement Jane Dodds Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats said: “This is great news for the hospitality and fitness industries.
“Exercise classes, personal training and swimming lessons are all important aspects for our physical and mental health and will play a part in our recovery from Covid.
“I know from speaking to many pub and restaurant owners how pleased they will be to open indoors once more.
“As a nation we must all work together to ensure the vaccination programme continues and that the lockdowns and closures we’ve been through never need to return.”The main reasons for transfer are these: you have been laboring forever and you need pain interventions and possibly help advancing your labor; your midwife is concerned that you are developing an infection or your body is not going into labor on its own; there are serious complications in your labor and you are being transferred emergently (don’t worry– this is not common).
Whatever the reason for the transfer, by the time you get to me, this is what I see.
You are in pain. You are scared. You are defeated.
It breaks my heart.
You see, there are so many things that we have in common. Most importantly, we all have the same goal– healthy mom and healthy baby.
I know you’ve heard that phrase before, and you may think, “That’s all well and good, but there is so much more that I want from my labor and delivery experience.”
I understand that, too. I’m writing this post for you, my mama under a midwife’s care. I want you to feel that no matter where you ultimately deliver your baby, you will feel empowered and your opinion valued.
To begin that process, there are things you need to know about what might happen if you are transferred to a hospital, so you can be mentally prepared for it.
But first, I have some suggestions for you. Throw some salt over your shoulder, knock on wood, rub a Buddha’s belly… hopefully you’ll never need this preparation. But labor is unpredictable. If you do, you’ll be glad you did.
Steps I want you to take
1. Have a serious discussion with your midwife about hospital transfers.
In particular, there are things I want you to ask her. What hospital would she probably take you to? This may depend on where you live, and if the midwife has a relationship with a particular hospital. You’ll need this information for step two.
Also find out from her what parameters she has for when to transfer a patient to the hospital. Some midwives I collaborate with have very strict safety guidelines for when they will transfer a mama. Others bring us what I can only nicely describe as hot messes.
Let’s put it this way. If I see you in my L&D unit, I want a chance to give you as close to your dream delivery as I can. I don’t want you to wait so long that a c/section is the only safe option by the time you get to me. Does that make sense? Some of this may be out of your control, but it helps to have the conversation ahead of time.
2. Take a tour of the hospital
Once you know what hospital is the most likely you would go to should you need to be transferred, call them up and schedule a tour of the maternity unit.
Why?
Again, hopefully you’ll never be back! Touring it ahead of time, though, can boost your confidence and take some of the anxiety out of a possible transfer.
You can see what equipment the labor rooms are stocked with. You can see where the c/sections are performed and where your family can hang out. You can see the postpartum rooms and the nursery.
You can also ask questions about that hospital’s standard birth practices and what they can be flexible on. You can even find out what doctors might be delivering your baby if you show up unexpectedly.
Taking this simple step can take one of the variables out of a potentially scary situation for you.
3. Have a birth plan just for the hospital
I’m sure that you’ll be going over all of your labor preferences with your midwife. It may benefit you to have a separate birth plan that addresses the most important points to bring with you in case you are transferred to a hospital.
The reason for this is that many things may become irrelavant and just bog down your admission process. For me as your labor nurse to have a list of the things most important to you is a great help.
Don’t know where to start? At the bottom of this post I have a free downloadable birth plan that can help you streamline things. You may also want to have a small “go bag” of some basic essentials in case you have to rush out the door.
Things I want you to know
Okay, you’ve done your part! Now I want you to have a better idea of what to expect if your homebirth turns into a hospital birth.
1. You can refuse anything you want.
Let’s start here because it’s a big one. It’s a hospital, not a jail, and we can’t force you to do anything. But let’s talk about it a little bit. Hopefully by the time you get to the hospital, you’ve come to grips with the fact that your birth isn’t going to be exactly as you envisioned it. In some ways, it’s time to let your body and your baby make some of the decisions.
What do I mean by that? I’ve had patients come in who are refusing everything. They get an epidural, maybe, because they are exhausted from such a long period of time in labor, but they are refusing Pitocin and a c/section and any intervention at all. Yet, they have been stalled at 6 centimeters for five hours, they have a temperature, and their baby’s heartrate is elevated. What are we to do for her? Wait until her baby crumps and rush her back for an emergent c/section with a possibly compromised baby? No one wants that.
For goodness’ sake, ask questions. Ask for rationales and risks vs. benefits. We love that. But know that you are in the hospital because your labor has not been without bumps. Something is preventing the normal flow of the labor curve and decisions must be made.
If we’re talking risk vs. benefit, it may come down to questions like these: Which is preferable? Artificial oxytocin (Pitocin) to strengthen your contractions, or a c/section because your labor stalls out and your baby can’t tolerate it anymore? A c/section now, or possibly a baby who has to go to NICU after a vaginal delivery because of infection or complications? These aren’t questions we ask to scare you. They are questions we ask because we can see the signs of impending complications and are trying to prevent poor outcomes.
So, know that we are here to support you, but we will always err on the side of your safety. Please work with me.
2. getting pitocin doesn’t mean you’ll need an epidural
No way, mama. You’ll never believe how many women I’ve seen rock their Pitocin-induced labor without aid of narcotics or an epidural. All of the preparations you have done will continue to see you through these contractions as well.
You may also be surprised that Pitocin doesn’t produce contractions far different than the ones you have already been experiencing. There is also a world of difference if you are receiving Pitocin to induce (start) your labor as opposed to augmenting it (keeping it going). If you are in the hospital to be induced with Pitocin, you may see that the contractions are stronger, sooner, than if you had gone into labor spontaneously. If you have already been in active labor, Pitcoin will serve to get those contractions back to the strength and the frequency they were.
You also may experience this differently and need some help with the pain. That’s okay, too. No one’s judging. Another benefit that you have is that you’ve probably brought your doula and/or midwife to the hospital with you. The same coping techniques they’ve been helping you with in your homebirth will continue here.
You’ve got this.
3. You won’t necessarily get a c/section just because you transferred to the hospital
I know that’s a fear because I hear it over and over from my patients. You already know that you are being transferred because there’s some sort of complication. You’ve also heard all of the horror stories about the “cascade of intervention” that takes place.
Oh, mama. Let me say it again. We want the same thing you do– a healthy vaginal delivery.
It’s our goal for every woman who walks through our door.
It both hurts my heart and makes me smile when I hear one of my midwife patients say to the OB tearfully, “Wait– you’re going to let me keep laboring?”
Yes. If you and your baby are still tolerating labor, of course we will let you continue! Sometimes you may truly need a c/section. We’ll tell you that, and why.
So, continue to ask questions and raise concerns. But leave a little room for the unknown, because sometimes our babies call the shots and it’s out of our control.
4. many of the items on your birth plan… we do anyway
This is the point that surprises most people who have been planning a homebirth.
Delayed cord clamping? Sure, if baby’s condition allows. (Your midwife would make that determination at your homebirth as well.)
Immediate skin-to-skin? You bet! In my hospital, we strongly encourage skin-to-skin for at least the first two hours after birth, and I give the side-eye to any family member who tries to separate mom and baby before then. You’ll get your turn, dad! Mom and baby need this!
Allow for movement during labor? Of course! Unless you are relegated to your bed for safety reasons like an epidural or certain medications like magnesium sulfate, get up and moving! Birthing ball, hands and knees, you can stand on your head as far as I’m concerned as long as you can promise me you won’t fall.
Intermittant fetal monitoring? We’ll work with you on this, but know that your baby’s safety is our top priority and there are protocols that we have to follow. Every hospital is different in their standard procedures and protocols, so the “rules” may vary as to how often we have to monitor your baby’s heartrate. Even if you need continuous fetal monitoring, your hospital may have access to remote monitors that give you more freedom of movement, and even the ability to shower while we are monitoring your baby.
In my many years of labor and delivery nursing, some of my most grateful patients have been ones who transferred to my hospital from a homebirth or a birthing center.
I love this so much. Being a midwife is not my calling. Assisting at homebirths is not my calling. Respecting women– and their bodies and their decisions– and being their guide and advocate thoughout the most vulnerable time in their lives… THAT’S my calling.
Sadly, I know this is not always true. I am just one labor nurse speaking from my experience in the facilities where I have worked. I know that sometimes women are confronted with judgement, and they feel bullied into decisions that they did not want to make. If this has happened to you or to someone you know, I am truly sorry. Please feel that you can talk about it.
I run a series for my email subscribers called Demystifying Birth Stories where I use my knowledge as a labor nurse to possibly shed some light on the questions you have about YOUR birth story– and what might have been going on behind the scenes. If you would like to share your story and read others’ stories, submit your email in the form below, and send your birth story and questions to grace@labormom.com. I look forward to hearing from you!
Frequently asked questions:
Will I have to get an IV?
Will I be separated from my baby?
I can think of a few times when a brief separation may be necessary:
- if you have a c/section, your baby may need to leave the operating room before you do. You’ll be reunited in the recovery room.
- if your baby needs to go to the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) for additional care, you may not be able to go with him or her immediately, especially if your baby is transferred there right after delivery.
- if you elect for your son to have a circumcision while you are in the hospital.
That’s about it! Just communicate with the nurses and the pediatricians and make your requests known.
Can my midwife deliver my baby?
In most cases, though, the actual medical care and delivery of your baby will be done by the OB and the hospital staff. Your midwife will essentially take on the roles of your coach, doula, friend, and resource.
How much will a hospital delivery cost?
If you are making an unexpected transfer to the hospital, chances are the bill is the last thing you are thinking of. If it’s a big concern to you right now, though, I’d suggest that you call the billing department of your hospital and ask for some estimates. Most hospitals will work with you, too, with payment plans and discounts if you are having trouble paying the bills after your stay.
Can I still keep my placenta?
This may be state-specific, though. For instance, I currently practice in Texas. Up until a couple of years ago, when state law finally mandated that a person had a right to their own body parts, families had to get a court order to be able to take their placentas home. It was a ridiculous process. You may want to check up on your state’s position on placenta keeping.
Also, if for some reason the OB determines that your placenta needs to go to the lab for testing, you will most likely not be able to take it home (it will probably have been treated with a substance like formaldehyde anyway, and who wants to injest that?).
Did you have an epidural?
Yes. Two, in fact! No complications short or long-term. Beautiful deliveries. And my babies and I bonded like superglue.
But you do you! I respect all women and will support you in whatever decisions you make about your pain management. I have L&D colleagues who have opted for an unmedicated labor. Respect.
Will I have to come in an ambulance?

I think you meant "(sp?)"
Sic is Latin for "as such." It's used when quoting someone who used an incorrect or archaic spelling of a word.
remember him and Lloyd became friends a few years ago.
ARod is a fan of the University of Miami... IIRC, he donated money to build their new baseball stadium.
EDIT: I didn't neg you.
Damnit, I was thinking of Jeter. I hate baseball so much.
Derek Jeter -- a Michigan student for a semester IIRC before the Yankees called. Also a proud Kalamazoo Central Maroon Giant.
I hadn't realized that he had ever enrolled, but you are correct, he attended for a semester before leaving for the minors:
In another article, he talks about attending every football and basketball game (when the fab 5 were sophomores) that fall; no wonder he's a huge fan!
PS: Yay Kalamazoo!
He was a friend of mine's roommate for that semester. Then Mikey got the room to himself for the rest of the year. :-)
I think Felicity Huffman of all people has been seen sporting Michigan gear.
...you'll never be one in anyone else's.
Because then you could count all our celebrity alums. James Earl Jones and the like. (Personal favorite? Lucy Liu).
I keep seeing pics of Leonardo DiCaprio with an M hat on. But he may just like the colors.
Ss he says, "my wrist blue and yellow like Michigan"
It's only yellow because there is no such thing as maize diamonds.
That doesn't make him a Michigan "fan" because he knows what our colors are. He's a sports fan. Wale says he "protects Hart like Michigan's line" in song. He also raps about Ernest Wilford of the Jaguars and nobody accuses him of being a huge Jags fan (he's a DC guy). Both of these guys are huge sports fans -- you'll see them on First Take -- not Michigan fans, despite name drops in songs.
On the other hand, I saw Luke Walton and Richard Jefferson at the Michigan @ Notre Dame Football Game in Denard's Sophomore year, sitting in the Michigan section. I think they have some sort of connection. Shane Battier is married into a prominent Michigan family and I've seen him around Ann Arbor a few times. He's a Dukie obviously, but I think may be a M football fan.
of "60 Minutes" went to Michigan I believe. He's DEFINITELY a "down in front" kinda guy.
False - I sat next to him at a football game when I was in high school. A former regent had given me his tickets, and Mike Wallace was two seats away. He was totally cool.
are Michigan fans. They opened with Hail to the Victors when they played a concert in Columbus once. Ballsey and awesome.
Is that all the RHCP or just Anthony Kiedis? I know he's from Grand Rapids
...because of him. They vacation on Lake Michigan a lot during the summer.
I think he went to Lahser.
There's that too. The RHCP are pretty much awesome in every way.
I will probably get negged for this, but I think that Taylor kid from the twilight movies is a Michigan fan. He grew up on the west side. Obligatory disclaimer? Yes: my sister is 15 so that's how I came upon this info.
On a better note, Mini Me was at a spring game one time so ye must be a fan.
And maybe Hugh jackman? I only say that because of the xmen movies and have no factual basis.
They had a Twilight kid ask "Dr. Lou" a question and it was about RR and UofM....So you may be right.
He's Taylor Lautner from Hudsonville MI - a little Dutch farmtown outside of Grand Rapids. No word on if he's a M fan but I'd assume so.
Just so you know, I'm not a Twilight fan but I live by there so that's how I know where he's from.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Actually he's went to high school in Norton Shores a suburb of Muskegeon, and I only know this because my girlfriend went to high school with him. So IDK where he was born but he grew up in Muskegeon, and I've heard he was a state fan.
He's also totally cute. And I only know, because I am also a vampire. xoxoxo
My bad on my first post...
Vern troyer = mini me
I tried to edit it but it was too late.
Not much on here that hasn't already been mentioned but I figured I'd throw it out anyway...
Rich Eisen fron ESPN and NFL network (went to Michigan) and I think Adam Schefter. I've seen him on Sportscenter with a UM helmet in the background on his bookshelf.
Never knew this before (from Wiki):
"A graduate of the University of Michigan and Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, Schefter was an editor at the Michigan Daily."
Even more interesting:
"It was so hard to get a job. When I was in college, you couldn’t have done more than I did to get a job in journalism. I was the sports editor with Rich Eisen of The Michigan Daily — we were co-sports editors along with some other people. I was working for the Ann Arbor News covering high school games on the weekends. I was Mitch Albom’s research assistant. I was stringing for the Detroit Free Press doing news updates for them from the Michigan campus. I was sending out resumes to every single newspaper in the country and I truly could not get a single job anywhere. I always tell people that there’s a bar on the Michigan campus called Dominick’s that for every rejection letter you have, they give you a drink. I had so many rejection letters I could’ve owned the bar. I went to graduate school at Northwestern to get my masters in journalism only because I could not get a full time job. There was nobody that would hire me."
And I heard he was straight... Both could be rumors but likely one is true and the other false.Released as 7" and 12" single with different covers:

One of the greatest marketing campaign in my opinion, in the field of charity as a skillful way to make people publicly demonstrate their charity by using the proverbial “blowing the trumpet” through getting an icy self inflicted shower, this cleverly planned campaign made people who otherwise are not attracted to charitable giving finally show some interest in altruism.
Now, even if one for the gift sake, or the cause it benefits, may ignore the fact that self-serving, opportunistic giving is not “real” giving, I really can’t say that the benefits of genuine Christian charity can be ascribed, to those who participated in such a public manner. Jesus told us to practice our charity in private. As God privately rewards those who pray in private, He will reward those who give in private; as men reward with accolades and recognition those who do it all in public, no reward will be left to those who find public approval and acceptance.
I know that, for many the Bible is a book to be questioned, ant it is only a part of other sources of religious authority, but, if these apologists of plurality of Christian authoritarian teaching could tell me, I would like to see any of their own para-sources of authority that teaches that our charitable acts should be practiced in public… Oh, but it is all for fun, intended to combine charity with fun… I’d say that I own a company, inactive at this moment, called “FunRaisers” whose slogan is “We put the FUN on FUND RAISING”, so, I am for having fun in giving, but, when the fun of giving becomes a buffoonish way of being ostentatious about your giving and attracting the attention to you more than to the cause you’re giving, then, YES, giving can become and exercise in the futile violation of Matthew 6.
Am I splitting hairs? Am I being demanding and legalistic? Well, saints, the little foxes spoil the vines, and often the things that we consider to be unimportant, and faddish, perhaps even innocent, but massively practiced, are the ones that will ultimately water down and dissolve good and traditional Christian teaching and trivialize the cause of those who truly depend on charitable donations. It will be not so far fetched for me to say that henceforth it will be very hard to motivate people to give to a great cause without somehow affording them some type of public recognition even if it includes something as innocent and clownish as wasting cold water! It is already happening! People get naked in the streets for the protection of animals, radio stations offer donations for each cockroach one can eat (as it happened in So. America) etc. So, where is the good old secret and worshipful giving?
I congratulate all of those who risked so much with a bucked of iced water being poured over their bodies, specially in summer, who sacrificed so much for the cause of charity. I give you my recognition and so do many Facebook and Tweet readers and the overwhelming majority of the population. Now with mine and the world’s recognition, plus the thrill of the cold water suddenly changing your body temperature, “you have received your reward”; expect none other!_3<<

away your competition and connect with new customers like never before.
Your blogging secret weapon doesn’t need months to set up either. Richard Goodwin, the author of How To Start A Blog Online, offers powerful and easy-to-follow blogging tips that have helped many people get their start in online publishing. Having been featured in Forbes, The Huffington Post, Entrepreneur and Inc., he explains that, “Twenty minutes is all you need to start a blog, and you don’t need any knowledge of HTML, coding, or graphics design.”
To get started, Goodwin points to a step-by-step process that can help get you through the initial learning curve. “When you decide to start a blog, and begin to look into everything involved, you may become frustrated or overwhelmed. The best thing to do is start fresh and break up the steps into a more manageable process.”
With that in mind, get answers to eight common blogging questions along with more of Goodwin’s practical advice to get into the groove. You’ll feel like a business blogging pro in no time.
1. How often should I blog?
You don’t have to blog every day or even every week to get things started. At first, aim for at least one blog post per month, as that will keep your blog active but won’t overwhelm you as a content creator. Once you’re comfortable with that schedule, add another post per month to keep the content funnel going. The important thing is that you create consistent content that is valuable to your reader.
2. What should I write about?
Write about things your customers will be most interested in and that will provide unbeatable value. You are the expert, and your readers should see that in every post. For example, if you regularly answer the same customer questions, your responses could make for perfect blog articles. You can even scan your past emails and turn any client advice you’ve given into an article.
Goodwin also explains the importance of choosing topics that you find fascinating. .”
3. Do I need to be a good writer?
Once you’ve knocked your topics out of the park, you don’t need to be a rockstar copywriter to have a successful blog. Instead of trying to write Nobel-worthy articles, focus on making them straightforward and easy to consume. The most important part is that you write in a professional but relatable way – as you would in an email to a client. You want to come across as an expert, but not overly stuffy or academic. Avoid spelling mistakes and poor grammar by using spellcheckers and grammar tools (try Grammarly, for example). And always make sure to proofread your article twice before posting.
Goodwin suggests finding your own personal voice to tell your story, which can make for more relatable content. “This is a skill that will get better with a time, as it has a lot to do with developing your own voice with your writing. … Seek out topics and subjects that interest you, and then add your own personal flair to it! If you’re talking about the latest release of a new smartphone, add your own thoughts on it or your experience with the company who makes the phone. If you’re writing about a new entry in a movie series, tell a story of how that series has had an impact on your life while growing up.”
4. How long should an article be?
Blog posts don’t have to be really long to gain attention. 500-word articles tend to be a good starting length, as they’re lengthy enough to provide value, but aren’t too time-consuming for the reader. If you have more to say, then keep writing. And if you don’t have enough to say, you may want to consider doing some extra research or adjusting your topic.
Eventually, your article length will expand. 1500 word posts have been shown to rank highest in online searches, but save those longer articles for later on in your blogging journey.
5. What makes a good title?
Don’t underestimate the title of your blog post. It will be one of the most important things to capture interest – through social media posts, SEO, email and links. Aim for 70 to 100 characters long at your maximum, and fill the content with the right mix of uncommon, power and emotional words.
It may be helpful to write a list of up to 20 title options at the top of your page until you find one that really fits. To find out how good your headline options stack up, use the CoSchedule Headline Analyzer tool and test them before you hit publish. You may be surprised at which one wins.
Then include at least three sub-headings within the body of your article so that it directs the reader to the relevant points. 43% of people admit to skimming posts, according to HubSpot, so drawing their attention with relevant keywords in the sub-headings is also a great way to keep your reader’s interest as they scroll down the page.
6. Do I need to add images?
Blog articles with images get 94% more views, and that’s a huge benefit when faced with countless online competition. A great image is paramount to making sure people take interest in the article, especially when you share it online. There are tons of great royalty free image sites and tools online to help with this, such as Pixabay and Canva.
Pikwizard is the latest addition to the stock photography family. It holds over 100,000 high-quality images, with 20,000 that are completely exclusive to the site.
You can also take your blog media strategy a step further by adding the right alt tags (keywords) to each image, and by using embedded video in your posts. Goodwin explains that, “Today, blogging is more than just about writing words. Adding graphics or even videos to the content can realistically help your blog stand out from the rest … Graphics also serve as an important component of the SEO strategy. In fact, most successful blogs often invest a significant amount of resources on their graphics.”
7. Should I use the blog to sell products or services?
Most great blogs teach their readers valuable information rather than direct selling. That means you will offer expert advice and guidance, building trust with your clients and prospects. The important thing is establishing a lasting relationship with your readers.
But you can also add links and prompts to keep the readers interested in your brand, and keep them on your website longer. Include at least one call to action in the body of your article and another one at the end of the article. Calls to action (or CTAs) will help convert your traffic into more meaningful conversations or leads.
For example, you can link people to another article on your blog that they might want to read next. Or you could offer a free consultation at the end of the piece if they’re interested in your services. This is a nice way to show you’re committed to offering exceptional information without a hard sell. When your reader is ready, they’ll come to you for the next step.

8. How will people find my blog?
All great content must get promoted, so make use of your online channels to get more readers to your blog. That includes social media, e-newsletters, your email signature and sending blog links directly out to individual clients who might see value in the article.
,” recommends Goodwin.
Often a new blogger will only use their personal social media accounts to promote content, and that is okay to get started. Goodwin explains further that, “When you’re just starting out with your blog, take to your personal social media account and share links to new content that you’re producing on a frequent yet modest basis. Once you build up a bit of an audience this way, it might be time to take your advertising to the next level.”

The player program is well established, and it is planned that the identified umpires will attend their county academy training sessions to train with the players and develop their umpiring skills. And if they do not already hold it, take the Netball Europe C Award. From these umpires, some will be put forward to be attached to one of the Talent and Performance Centres in Netball South West.
Essential Criteria for being accepted onto NSW TYUP Programme
- Must be recommended by County Umpiring Secretary
- Must be a minimum of 14 years of age
- Must be a C Award Umpire Talent and Performance Centres these umpires will be used to umpire the screening trials for the players at the Sports Training Village at the University of Bath. At the U16 Regional League and U14 Regional Tournament competitions, they will again be mentored/tutored to assess their progression and ability. If they are considered to be ready and do not already hold it they will be put forward to take the Netball Europe B Award.
After finishing this program the umpires will then be invited into the pool of under 25 umpires who, while still linking in with the talented players at Bath STV, will be mentored/tutored towards obtaining the Netball Europe A Award.
The long term aim is to have one or two umpires who will go on to be considered eligible to be put forward to try to become internationally accredited while still under the age of 25. And if this could be linked with other countries who hopefully are doing the same, will result in having two neutral, under 25 year olds umpiring the under 19’s world finals.Notify me when the price drops

Scientists discover gut-brain sugar sensor in mice
Artificial sweeteners have never fully succeeded in impersonating sugar. Now, a Columbia study in mice has identified a brain mechanism that may explain why.
In a scientific first, researchers have shown that the brain responds not only when sugar touches the tongue but also when it enters the gut. Their discovery of this specialized gut-brain circuit offers new insight into the way the brain and body evolved to seek out sugar. And because artificial sweeteners do not activate this circuit, the study also offers compelling evidence as to why these sweeteners are never quite as satisfying as the real thing.
The findings, reported today in Nature, stand to have a substantial positive impact on public health. Excess sugar intake has been linked to obesity-related conditions such as diabetes, which affects more than 500 million people worldwide. By laying the foundation for new ways to modify this gut-brain circuit, this research offers promising new paths to reducing sugar overconsumption.
"When we drink diet soda, or use sweetener in coffee, it may taste similar but our brains can tell the difference," said Hwei-Ee Tan, the paper's co-first author who completed his doctoral research in the lab of Charles Zuker, Ph.D., at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute. "The discovery of this specialized gut-brain circuit that responds to sugar—and sugar alone—could pave the way for sweeteners that don't just trick our tongue but also our brain."
Today's study was led by Dr. Zuker and builds upon decades of work by he and his lab to map the brain's taste system.
When the tongue encounters a taste—sweet, bitter, salty, sour or umami—specialized cells on the tongue called taste receptors send hardwired signals to the brain. Artificial sweeteners, such as NutraSweet and Stevia, work by co-opting these hardwired signals. They switch on sweet taste receptors to fool the brain into thinking that sugar has landed on the tongue.
When the sweet taste receptors are deleted in mice, which should have eliminated the animals' desire for anything sweet, the animals still display a preference for sugar. The research team's goal was to was to find out why and how, and to uncover the neural basis for our insatiable desire for sugar.
The Columbia team focused on a brain area called the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract, or cNST. The cNST is tucked inside the brain stem, the most primitive area of the brain.
"We discovered that the cNST lit up with activity when we bypassed the sweet taste receptors on the animals' tongues and delivered sugar directly to the gut," said Alexander Sisti, Ph.D., the paper's co-first author who also completed his doctoral research in the Zuker lab. "Something was transmitting a signal, indicating the presence of sugar, from the gut to the brain."
The research team then turned their attention to the vagus nerve, a well-known conduit between the brain and the body's internal organs.
In a series of experiments in mice, the scientists developed techniques to monitor the real-time activity of cells in the vagus nerve. The team observed how these cells' activity changed when sugar was delivered into the animals' gut.
"By recording brain-cell activity in the vagus nerve, we pinpointed a cluster of cells in the vagus nerve that respond to sugar," said Dr. Sisti. "We saw, for the first time, sugar-sensing via this direct pathway from the gut to the brain."
Further experiments revealed the circuit in greater detail. Inhibiting a specific sugar-transporting protein in the gut eliminated the animals' neural response to sugar, showing that this protein, called SGLT-1, is a key sensor transmitting the presence of sugar from the gut to the brain via what is known as the gut-brain axis.
In a key prediction from this study, the team then showed that silencing this gut-brain circuit completely abolishes the animals' craving and preference for sugar, demonstrating how controlling the function of this circuit can dramatically impact the animal's desire for sugar. In one of their final set of experiments, the researchers also switched on the brain cells that normally respond to sugar signals from the gut. This time, however, they activated these cells every time the animal consumed a sugar-free Kool-Aid drink, in essence hijacking this circuit. Remarkably, says Dr. Zuker, the animals acted as if they were getting real sugar. In effect, fooling the brain into responding as if they were consuming sugar.
Taken together, these findings demonstrate the existence of two complementary, yet independent, systems for sensing energy-rich sugar, one getting input from the tongue, the other from the gut.
"These findings could spur the development of more effective strategies to meaningfully curtail our unquenchable drive for sugar, from modulating various components of this circuit to potentially sugar substitutes that more closely mimic the way sugar acts on the brain," said Tan.
Going forward, the team plans to link the gut-brain axis to other brain circuits, including those involved in reward, feeding, and emotions.
The paper is titled "The gut-brain axis mediates sugar preference."

[UPDATE: We're gonna play a little Oliver Stone here, so bear with us.
- A couple of days ago a video "preview" of Katy Perry's jiggling boobies' appearance on Sesame Street was posted all over the web.
- Gawker commenters were riled up into sanctimonious outrage about Katy Perry's jiggling boobies.
- Sesame Street announced they wouldn't be airing Katy Perry's jiggling boobies.
- BUT, people could still watch Katy Perry's jiggling boobies on Sesame Street all over Youtube
- And, today, lo and behold, YOUTUBE'S FEATURED CONTENT IS...SESAME STREET! (see picture)
- Was this a massive publicity stunt featuring Katy Perry's jiggling boobies???
This, my friends, could be the biggest Sesame Street-related conspiracy since notorious unibrowed homosexual Bert joined Al Qeda!]
Katy Perry's Jiggling Boobies Too Racy for "Sesame Street" (originally posted 9/23/2010)
It's pretty obvious that Katy Perry is an inoffensive pop singer targeted to preteens, who specializes in bouncy, repetitive tunes about candy and other child stuff (board games, playing doctor) all mashed up with coy references to sex--not sex as an adult, sweat-drenched activity, but more like a funny spin-the-bottle, pajama party kind of thing.
You know, for preteens and such.
(See also the brilliant South Park episode that explains how the Jonas Brothers are just an excuse for Disney to sell sex to preteens).
Well, some genius invited Los Feliz resident Perry to Sesame Street, who targets pre-pre-teens. Things didn't go very well:
Perry sang a variation of her sex-for-people-who-are-too-young-for-actual-sex song "Hot and Cold," with lyrics changed to reflect a confusing teasing game with the puppet Elmo:
The problem was that Perry displayed her cleavage in her usual, sex-for-preteens way, and the moralists at Gawker caused a fuss about it and the Sesame Street people freaked out: Yahoo.com)
In a nutshell, a shitshow. Nobody ended up looking good, with the possible exception of Perry's jiggling boobies. And everybody--babies, preteens, teens, adults and old people--loves boobSupporting Information for this article is available on the WWW under or from the author.

1997 Chevrolet Cavalier Question: where and how to replace thermostat on chevy cavalier 1997 2.4 engine
need to replace thermostat and dont know where to begin - Visitor
Answer 1
as you stand in front of car----- look to the upper radiator hose on right side- follow it to the engine. the place where it connects is the water outlet and the thermostat is under that. it appears by the diagram and labor time that a few things may need to be removed to access the bolts to remove it. be sure to "burp the system", that is make sure no air is in system or the car will overheat. good luck! - tuneupowner

Super Helpful – The Help
Self-released: 2013
The Pro Era crew have been pretty hard to avoid as of late. Whether it be the release of their solid PEEP: The aPROcalypse mixtape, or the tragic and untimely death of fellow member Capital Steez, there’s certainly been a lot to talk about, and it seems as though they plan to enter 2013 the way they bowed out of 2012 with the release of a new EP under the guise Super Helpful. Comprising of Pro Era regular Chuck Strangers, Kwame and producer/Joey Bada$$ tour DJ Lee Bannon, the trio come through with a five-track, 15-minute EP of straight-up left-field hip-hop, and it doesn’t take long for you to get sucked into their super-blunted soundscapes.
Opening track “The Help” is one of the more ‘conventional’ tracks on the EP featuring some dusty, boom-bap drums and a hook about smoking weed—as well as the particularly cringe-worthy line “bitches on Facebook/you on Instagram showin’ how you look” (I guess I’ll just never get used to rappers talking about iPhone apps)—but towards the end the drums slam on the brakes, the synths ascend and things take a turn for the weirder. The proceeding song, “Lawns”, sounds like it could’ve been stolen from a dumpster behind Madlib’s studio, with its Quasimoto-esque pitched vocals and funky bass-line, but look beyond that and it’s probably the best track on the EP: a pure stoner jam that is only enhanced by a brief Joey Bada$$ cameo, three switch-ups in the beat and a cheeky Kanye West reference (“I know it’s past visiting hours, but can I get a lick of that sour”).
Elsewhere there is the track “Sumo”, which originally surfaced on the Internet in November last year, and showcases both Chuck and Kwame on top form in terms of both their lyrics and their flow, “Drug Tested”, a hazy, sci-fi-tinged beat with the sub-bass turned up to 11, and “2step (apex version)”, with an infectious, twisted vocal hook and yet another great beat courtesy of Lee Bannon, although by the time you get to the end of The Help you realize that this goes without saying.
Bannon’s work on this EP is sublime; every instrumental fits the bill perfectly and the experimental production techniques are always captivating without ever coming across as novelty or clichéd. Tracks such as ‘Drug Tested’ might be mixed poorly – with the bass far too high in the mix and the vocals far too low, for example – but it only reinforces the DIY ethos of this whole EP, and goes to show that you don’t need fifteen producers behind a track in order for it to hold its own.
They’ve got progress to make for sure, but Super Helpful has delivered the first great hip-hop EP of 2013. This is pure, highly concentrated stoner hip-hop with a particular emphasis on Bannon’s special blend of dusty, hot-boxed boom-bap instrumentals. Pro Era can release as many mix-tapes as they like this year, but if we don’t hear anything else from Super Helpful, then let us declare 2013 over and done with.

"Once I am appointed a mentee, it's for life." Otto P. Cipolla (JD '83) first assumed the role as preceptor in 2012 upon the program's official induction to the law school, and he says that mentoring students has been the most rewarding activity in the last twenty years of his career. Otto's immense dedication to the law school resulted in an eponymous award. The Otto P. Cipolla, Jr., Preceptor of the Year Award at Pepperdine Law recognizes outstanding service by the school's Preceptors—a group of practicing attorneys and judges who mentor one or more first-year law students at Pepperdine each year.
Otto goes above and beyond the expected as a mentor, frequently traveling for weddings, graduations, and even to apartment shop in Brooklyn. "I'm like their family, I tell them we are family." Otto offers a "full service" preceptorship, meaning his relationship with law students extends beyond the classrooms and calendar of an academic year. He creates lasting bonds with students and their families and ensures that it's a lifetime deal.
This year, Otto is retiring from the preceptor program. He hopes that more alumni will step into the preceptor role and forge lifelong mentoring relationships. What's important, Otto explains, is that connections last beyond graduation because there is a whole new set of questions and uncertainties once students become practicing lawyers. Pepperdine Law is grateful to Otto for his dedication to the growth of the alumni network and the wealth of time he has committed to our students over the years.Consign Your Best Items with Lelands.

When is book three coming?
I’ve been getting that a lot off line and now I’m starting to even see it in my search options as well.
PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING FOR BOOK THREE IN GOOGLE. lol
I thought it was exciting to know.
ANSWER THE QUESTION, SYLVIA!
Book three should be available by March 1st. SHOULD BE?
Currently, I’m on Chapter 27. Yeah, serious. As I type this, I’ve just finished up 27 and moving to 28.
That’s how quickly I’m moving. three pages a day. On good days, I could get up to six, but this is a bad week so you’re getting three pages a day.
Don’t push it.
I’m trying to move in a house, get the kids together, keep my sanity during this bad time in my life and just trying to push out the best book you’ve read.
Maxine’s fun.
Onyx is funner.
(I know that’s not a word.)
Back to work.
Have you gotten your copy? Have you done your review?

Hi Ms. Sylvia,
I hope all is well. Please slow down. We, your loyal readers, know the strain you are under. We know some of the things you’ve been through. DO NOT BURN YOURSELF OUT. We need you to keep that precious writing ability you have intact for all the great writing you will do in the future. So, with that being said, TAKE YOUR TIME. We will be here through thick and thin. I think that a lot of new readers to your work are excited and wants to see more. They remind me of how I was when I first reading your materals. I searched every site I could think of. Now, I just patiently wait until you put out a new novel or do a live feed story on your site. TELL YOUR SON, I SAID HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND MAY GOD BLESS HIM TO HAVE MANY, MANY MORE. PLEASE REST MS. SYLVIA, and I am patiently waiting.
You loyal fan,
Stephanie
thanks Steph and I really will try not to burn myself out. I’ll try.
I think i’m doing pretty good. I only had a migraine for two days instead of four. yeah me!!
Happy Bday to your son. Enjoy your weekend.
thanks @Mona!
Please get some rest. Like Stephanie said we will be here when the book is done. Happy Birthdhay to your son.
will try @cyp!
Wow, you really are on a roll… SLOW DOWN!!! We your loyal fans will continue to patiently wait. Let the anticipation continue to build. It’ll be like an orgasmic explosion once the book drops. I have people blowing up my phone for the next book, they are so use to me directing them to the next read. Lol. Your sales will take off so no worries, take your time. It’ll go like hot cakes when you’re ready. Happy Birthday to your son, may God Bless & Keep him always. Enjoy! ♥♡♥
omg! SERIOUS?! i’M so nervously excited about this next book. I mean I’m finding a lot about Maxine and what happened with Philippe. wow! you guys will lick it… i mean like it. LOL
blowing up your phone? Really? go gosh!! (cheesing)
Im really excited too! However, I don’t mind the wait because im enjoying Sexweed. Lol. My sister is the number one culprit for blowing up my phone. Its funny because she is the one that got me hooked on you starting me with Love Like This then Hope is Love ( but I know the correct order now). She now has to keep up with me. We each give insight on which book the other may have missed. I have so many in the closet Hubbard fans its crazy. Lol. They all love you but feel comfortable in a one on one discussion through phone on inbox instead of in the bookclub. Too many “holier than thou” to admit they can’t get enough, but im dragging them out of the closet (my FB Bookclub) next month. My other bookclub openly enjoys our discussions & all your books. Keep up the good work!:-)
I;ll gladly come to a book club discussion on any books you want. You have me at your beck and call sdunn. :) I can do google hangouts, skype and I’ve even done phone convos too!
Oh that would be absolutely GREAT!!! I’ll definitely let you know when. I have to get their feet wet before I throw dark facade at some, but as I stated before many are waiting to find out what happens next with book three. Lol
that’s why i was reluctant about releasing dark facade and why i pulled it in the beginning cuz it was really dark.
but then when i saw people going crazy over 50shades I was like what the heck, i might as well put it out there.
consensual was what started it all and i think i';l go even darker in 2014 as i build a story around philippe’s son.
Oh this just keeps getting better. A story around Philippe’s son??? I take it we will be introduced to him in book 3. :-). I have to get Consensual. I love when your mind ventures to the dark side… CREATIVITY GALORE!!! YOU REALLY GO IN!!!
yes, i haven’t spoken about Philippe’s children at all, but in book three they are there.
Do we know how old Phillippe is? Just curious… Trying to figure out who rescued her as a child. Will you be revealing this in book 3 or 4?

Another one of mine is not letting hungry become hangry, so I set off to get some lunch straight after arriving in Osaka.
One of the travel bloggers I follow described a bowl of pork rib ramen as one of the best dishes she’s ever eaten so I went out to eat exactly that. This was also the one time the GPS on my phone decided to work too, so I took that as a sign. All I can say is that the bowl of ramen was glorious; the pork so delicious yet I knew it was so bad for me; the broth was the best I’ve ever had and the noodles were perfect. Sometimes I describe my life as a series of first world problems, and I couldn’t decide whether or not that made the top 5 or 10 of best dishes I’ve ever eaten, as I’ve eaten three-Michelin-star standard food.
I didn’t really fancy being a tourist, so I went back to the hostel and chilled. I noticed in the corner of the room that there was this metal post with a rope, so I took a closer look and it seems like instead of a fire escape, we have a harness and if we need to make a quick escape we are expected to teach ourselves how to abseil down a building. Obviously 100% safe.
Yesterday was a bit of a meh day, but I was in a good mood. I started off at a Pokemon Center – if I did not have a budget for this trip and wasn’t living out of a backpack for the next 3+ months, I would’ve totally bought everything in sight. It was nice to see other people who were older than me having a moment whilst in that shop, because I was too.
After, I set off for lunch and a walk, then opted to travel on the ferris wheel in the tourist area. As my day trip was going to be Himeji Castle which I did last week, I thought that I’d go to Osaka castle, and go to a much better castle for a day trip for the following day. Osaka castle wasn’t much on the inside, just a museum with a view from the top, equal to the view from the ferris wheel.
So, today, I was going to go to another castle. I’ve wanted to go for the past fourteen years; I’ve kind of been twice in England and the one I can actually visit was built whilst I was in high school. After a Google search, I found out that not only could I not visit Hogwarts at the Japanese version of Wizarding World of Harry Potter, there was in fact a typhoon destined to hit near Osaka today. Brilliant.
This morning I headed off to a convenience store to stock up on some food and booze, and I’ve been a grown up today, finalising my India trip, forgetting to pay off my credit card bill and researching a couple of things for when I get to Tokyo and beyond. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to end up on BBC News like I did when I got caught up in Cyclone Debbie, but I should be able to move on towards Fuji tomorrow.Media Todays provide to Media channels, Teleport, DSNG and RF solutions.

The BBC star had "total" access to the high-security Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire - where he would walk in on females as they bathed, a former patient from the 1970s said.
His former personal assistant Janet Cope claimed that Savile had free rein of Broadmoor, where she accused him of working to gain access to high-profile criminals.
She told ITV's Exposure documentary: "Jimmy was untouchable. (He) was very proud of the fact that he spoke to all these very high-profile poorly criminals."
Ms Cope said that although she had never seen him abuse anyone, he was a controlling person.
She added: "I knew how he operated so I was very wary of him and I felt there was an undercurrent, there was a bad side, which not many people saw."
At Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Ms Cope said Savile held a position of real authority, adding: "He controlled everything. He controlled me.
"Everybody was - I'm going to use the word frightened - of him."
Savile, a former BBC TV presenter who died last year, has been accused of hundreds of allegations of child sex abuse and rape.
A former female patient told the programme Savile would walk in while female patients were having baths.
She said: "He would come in when you'd be having a bath...he would just walk in."
Speaking anonymously, she added the star once tried to touch her breast - and when she reported him she spent months in solitary confinement.
Former Conservative MP Edwina Currie told the programme she was "fairly sure" that Savile suggested himself for the role at Broadmoor in the 1980s.
She said: "He would have been seen as an extremely useful person and to have a high profile doing this would have been so much the better.."AIR FLOW

Did you know? Curly-tailed Lizards get their name from their rapidly twitching tail. They whip their tail around furiously as a defense mechanism to threaten other lizards and to distract predators. Curly-tails can “drop” their tail when they need to get away and will grow a new, although different looking, tail.
Step 1Choosing a Terrarium
Curly-tailed Lizards originate from Peru, the Caribbean and Cuba. They can be territorial and
are best housed individually, although females can be housed together if given enough space.
Terrarium
(A) Use a 20-gallon (26-30" long) or larger terrarium for a single Curly-tail. If housing two females
together a larger terrarium will be needed.
(B) Screened lid, if not included with habitat.
Step 2Heating and Lighting
Curly-tails require a temperature gradient (cool side/ warm side) to appropriately regulate their body temperature. Temperatures within the habitat should vary between daytime and nighttime hours.
Heating
• Equip the habitat with two thermometers (one for each side of the habitat) and one
hygrometer to monitor the humidity levels.
• The basking spot should be the warmest point in the habitat during the day. Heat is provided
by a high-wattage heat bulb placed directly above the basking spot. Turn the basking light
off at night.
• Use a ceramic heat emitter or night heat lamp as needed to maintain nighttime temperature.
Lighting
• Curly-tails are diurnal, meaning they are most active during the day. Use a daytime (F) UVA/UVB (ultraviolet) linear or compact fluorescent bulb for approximately 12 hours per day.
• For night viewing, use a night-specific bulb to minimize light provided to your reptile.
Step 3Substrate and Decor
Substrate
(G) Use a 2-3" (5-8 cm) of bark or fiber bedding.
• Clean out waste weekly and completely change bedding at least once a month.
Decor
(H) Include decor to elevate your lizard close to the heat source for basking.
(I) Add a wood/rock hiding place in the cool area of the home for hiding.
• Ensure decor is large and stable enough for the size of your lizard. Decreased basking;.September 19: Iowa Wholesale E85 Price Listing Service

But when it came to adding a few thousand more members to the family, she welcomed them with open arms (wearing gloves, of course)! Being a beekeeper takes a lot of work, but comes with many rewards. Keep reading to get all the buzz straight from Megan Lucy.
Meet Ruth Bee-der Ginsburg Mini beekeeper at her post
What made you catch the beekeeping buzz?
During Elementary school, I have a vivid memory of watching a bee documentary. The video showcased the infamous Bee Waggle Dance. When a scout bee finds a new source of food, she returns to the hive to perform her special dance to show the foragers where to go. After watching that documentary, I’ve always loved bees. Such interesting creatures with an amazing life span. Each bee plays an integral role in keeping the hive alive, thriving and in harmony. They really are one of God’s most amazing creatures.
While I was researching beekeeping, I loved learning about how different cultures have cherished, or even worshiped, the honeybee for thousands of years. I appreciate the relationship that has evolved between humans and bees. My relationship with my hive makes me feel connected to nature, God and also our ancestors.
How do you fit beekeeping into your busy schedule?
Beekeeping does take a lot of research. Before I purchased the hive, I started reading books and articles to educate myself and prepare for the hive. I did my reading research at night after the kids were asleep for my “me-time” in the evenings. There are also tons of helpful YouTube videos online from professional beekeepers. My kids and I love watching them together.
Actually, owning one or two hives isn’t that much of a time constraint. During the summer I check on them every other week to ensure they are healthy and functioning properly. The less you disturb the hive, the better. During the winter, I will only open the top lid once a month or less to place in pollen patties to supplement their food source during the cold weather.
The most time intensive project will be harvesting honey, which is so much fun! After I extract the frames from the hive, we make it a family affair to remove the honey from the combs.
Being a mom of two small ones, I try to keep them as involved as I can. When the bees are in a good humor, I allow for them to wear protective gear and be my assistants. I really enjoy teaching them about nature and the harmony of the hive.
How does beekeeping help you as an ad person?
When I am in the beehive, it is a very peaceful time for me. I am able to re-center my aura and enjoy my connection with nature, earth and God. The bees can sense that I am not a threat, but a peaceful presence just moving things around. Using this time to clear my head, helps me become a better mom, wife and co-worker. I am able to reprioritize my tasks and ready to tackle new challenges in the day.
Are there any other hobbies or side hustles you dream about trying in the future?
When I have four or five strong hives, I plan to start creating Nucs and queens. Nucs are small honeybee colonies created from larger colonies. The term refers both to the smaller size box and the colony of honeybees within it.
Are there any people or brands or business owners that inspire you?
I have enjoyed meeting the local beekeepers in my area. Before COVID, they would meet once a month to discuss beekeeping, provide educational speakers and training classes for beekeepers of all experiences. However, social distancing hasn’t stopped them from providing information to the local beekeepers. Once a month, they send out educational videos along with articles and resources for the group. It is so nice to have this group as a resource—even during challenging times. These individuals are true entrepreneurs. There is a lot of hard work to make a successful career out of beekeeping. I admire their resourcefulness, dedication and caring hearts. My interactions with them are quite humbling, and often remind me of challenges small business owners face. When the kids are a bit older, I would like to become more involved in the chapter.
What do you love most about being a beekeeper?
My hive is part of our family. It may sound strange, but I definitely have a relationship and emotional connection with my bees. They are living creatures that need care and maintenance to thrive. I’ve only been stung once, so I feel like they appreciate me as much as I appreciate them.
What’s your end goal?
Short term, this is a fun hobby for me. Long term, I would like to have several hives and sell honey, wax, queens and nucs (starter beehives) when my husband and I retire.

Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Healthcare
Motilal Oswal has set a price target of almost 21% over the current market price for the stock of the company and has placed a buy call.
According to Motilal Oswal, Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Healthcare delivered strong sales growth in the first half of the decade, with a 20.4% CAGR over FY10-15.
“The company saw a lull period over the next three years due to overhauls such as demonetization and the introduction of GST. However, since FY19, growth seems to have returned strongly (barring a temporary blip in FY20 due to COVID-related disruptions). With 19% sales growth delivered in FY21, PGHH appears to have returned to the growth levels seen in the earlier half of the decade,” the brokerage has said.
Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Healthcare: Rapid growth
The company should see rapid growth over the long term on the back of certain encouraging developments: (a) the increasing pace of distribution expansion, (b) the continuingly strong pace of category development efforts in schools to boost awareness and growth, (c) rising ad spends after a lull in preceding years, (d) a healthy pipeline of new products, (e) accelerated consumer entries into the category through launches at low price points, and (f) the willingness to take price cuts, whenever required, to boost growth.
“We maintain a Buy rating, with a target price of Rs 17,450 (50x Dec’23 EPS),” the brokerage has said.
Buy Britannia Industries, says Motilal Oswal
Brokerage firm, Motilal Oswal also has a buy call on the stock of Britannia Industries, though it has not set a target price on the same.
According to a press release issued by Britannia, the company is witnessing unprecedented levels of inflation in the market prices of palm oil (+54%), industrial fuel (+35%), and packaging materials (+30%), leading to an overall inflation of 14% in 2QFY22.
According to Motilal Oswal, the management was able to partially offset this impact through strategic forward covers and accelerated cost efficiency programs. It has also initiated necessary price hikes across the portfolio.
Consolidated sales rose 5.5% YoY to Rs 36.1 billion (est. INR34.9b) in 2QFY22. Consolidated EBITDA/PBT/adjusted PAT declined by 17.3%/22.1%/23% YoY to INR5.6b/INR5.2b/INR3.8b (est. INR5.8b/INR5.7b/INR4.3b).
“Base business volume growth likely to be between 6% and 7% in 2QFY22 (est. 4%),” Motilal Oswal has said in a press release. The stock of Britannia last closed at Rs 3,611 on the National Stock Exchange.

Thanks for having me, guys! That first photo consistently makes me smile – I don’t think I’ve ever looked that happy on camera, and to think it’s from being smeared with clay and doused with freezing cold water. Hope we cross paths again soon!
Thanks for taking the time to answer the questions Jodi. The first photo is great – it really captures the moment. We’ll be in SE Asia for a while and something tells me you won’t be able to stay away, so hopefully we’ll see you there!
I’m a big fan.
The admiration is mutual! Hope you’re well and surviving wedding season.
I quit my work last year and have been working freelance ever since. I plan to regularly travel, too but I think I’m still far from this kind of adventure. She’s inspirational! Thanks for featuring her.
Thanks for the kind words, Sheila! I’m glad you enjoyed the interview
I heart Jodi. That is all.
Is there anyone who doesn’t? =)
I can think of more than a few people, yes! Thanks guys – you’re too sweet
This is a fun interview with Jodi. I didn’t realize how much time she’s spend in SE Asia over the past several years. We’ve probably crossed paths at some point! I’ve spent nearly 2 of the last 3.5 years in this region alone myself
Gotta love Jodi. Great interview!
Glad you enjoyed it Kelsey.
Thanks Jodi, you’ve got a new follower for sure!
Thanks Jordan! Hope you enjoy the site.
This article definitely exposed me to another travel lover and foodie. I’m Vietnamese and I still have to say Vietnamese still probably tops my list of favorite food. Jodi just gained another twitter follower & FB ‘like’ from me!
Excellent! Yes, the food in Vietnam is a big reason to go – I tend to eat it quite often, and as someone with celiac disease it’s a great way to enjoy terrific eats and not get sick at the same time! So much of it is rice paper or rice based that I’m excited to eat my way through the country from top to bottom.
Thanks for the follow!
I’ve had some amazing Vietnamese food outside of Vietnam that I’d love to try it there.

MAY 15, 2014 9:42p ET
Vols offensive linesman Antonio Richardson went undrafted after being a projected third-round pick.
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- While three Tennessee players were selected in last weekend's NFL Draft, the one that wasn't has drawn just as much or more chatter.
This time last year, Volunteers left tackle Antonio "Tiny" Richardson was listed as a consensus first-round draft pick by nearly every respectable NFL Draft pundit. Even following a mediocre junior season in 2013, the mammoth tackle was still considered no worse than a third-round draft pick this year, if not higher.
But by the time the drafting of 256 players in seven rounds over three days ended on Saturday night, Richardson was surprisingly not among those selected. He wasn't able to join drafted Volunteers that included right tackle Ja'Wuan James in the first round (No. 19 overall) by Miami and a pair of sixth-rounders -- right guard Zach Fulton by Kansas City (193rd) and defensive tackle Daniel McCullers by Pittsburgh (215th).
Instead, Richardson was relegated to signing an free-agency contract with the Vikings.
"Never saw this coming," said Richardson via Twitter about not being drafted. "With that being said, this doesn't shake me."
Nobody else saw Richardson going undrafted either, unless you are one of the 32 NFL general managers who passed on the 6-foot-6, 327-pound Nashville, Tennessee, native. He was named second-team All-Southeastern Conference last season by the Associated Press.
In his complete mock draft released before the start of the NFL Draft last Thursday, FoxSports.com draft expert Peter Schrager predicted Richardson would be taken late in the third round by the Packers with the 98th overall pick.
Richardson and neither Vikings general manager Rick Spielman or coach Mike Zimmer have commented this week during rookie orientation. The Vikings will conduct rookie minicamp starting on Friday.
Apparently, the combination of Richardson's poor workouts at the NFL Combine in February and so-so effort at Tennessee's pro day on April 2 were red flags. There is also a report that he has a micro-fracture of his left knee that could require surgery.
"I'm getting healthy," said Richardson following his pro day workout, "and I'm just getting healthier and healthier week by week. And wherever I go, I'm going to compete and try to get me a spot."
At his pro day, Richardson did not participate in the bench press and 40-yard dash. But he did have a vertical jump of 31 inches and a broad jump of 9 feet, 4 inches, which would have been third-best among offensive lineman at the Combine.
"I tried to show them that I was healthy because people were saying that I'm not healthy, his knees are hurting," said Richardson, "so the stuff like the vertical jump and broad jump shows that I'm explosive."
Apparently impressing scouts was James, who became the 27th Volunteer since 1989 and 45th overall to be drafted in the first round. In all, there have been 335 Tennessee players selected since the draft's inception.
"I'm a tough, smart offensive lineman," said James after being selected by the Dolphins. "I pride myself on being smart and not making many mistakes. I bring athleticism to the table and a lot of experience, too, being able to play that many games at the position in the conference I did."
James (6-6, 311), a Suwanee, Georgia, native, started 49 games the last three seasons for the Volunteers at right tackle. Like Richardson, he was also a second-team All-SEC selection.
"As we went through the process, we were looking for tough, smart, productive players and guys who have produced at a high level for a long time," said Dolphins general manager Dennis Hickey, "and (James) fit the criteria of what we were looking for. As we scouted Ja'Wuan through the process, at every step of the process, he definitely fit as a Miami Dolphin."
Fulton (6-5, 323) was the second Volunteers offensive lineman selected. The Homewood, Illinois, native was a three-year starter and can play all five line positions.
"He's more of a road grader," said Chiefs area Scout Pat Sperduto of Fulton. "At Tennessee, they had four different offenses while he was up there and a couple head coaches. So, he had gone through a lot of change, and he adjusted and adapted to all the different styles that they had to."
In McCullers (6-7, 352), the Steelers get a large defensive lineman who can play all three of the down positions in their 3-4 defense. The Raleigh, North Carolina, native had 72 tackles the last two seasons, including 33 in 2013 that included four-and-a-half for lost yardage.
"I was getting a lot of talk about my playing leverage and playing intensity on every play," said McCullers of pre-draft analysis. "I'm working on it. I feel like I can be a dominant player if I just get in the best shape possible. I'm trimming down, working on my feet and quickness every day."
Volunteers other than Richardson to sign undrafted free agent contracts were guard Alex Bullard (Lions), long snapper J.R. Carr (Redskins), running back Rajion Neal (Packers), kicker Michael Palardy (Jets), linebacker Dontavis Sapp (Cowboys), defensive lineman Jacques Smith (Falcons) and center James Stone (Falcons).Faith Hill – There You'll Be

Hansen’s most notable endeavors have been the negotiation, construction and opening of the Wynn Solar Facility, a standalone solar photovoltaic project located on 160 acres in Fallon, Nevada; management of the company’s move to the open energy market; and the development of an energy supply plan that melds the first micro grid for implementation at one of the resorts situated at the Encore Boston Harbor property in Everett, Massachusetts.
Currently a member of the Nevada Governor’s Committee on Energy Choice, Hansen has more than a quarter of a century of experience. According to the press release, his career began in the energy industry, having spent more than a decade in various veins including transmission policy and contracts, power trading, project leadership and business development. Prior to joining Wynn Resorts Ltd., he held the position of Vice President for EnergySource, representing a wide range of Nevada’s biggest energy customers spanning the gaming, mining, utilities, data centers and technology industries.
EVP and General Counsel for Wynn Resorts Ltd., Kim Sinatra, said, “Erik has proven to be a visionary as we continue to deepen our company’s sustainability strategy and make monumental moves towards taking control of our energy future.”
“His experience extends across all facets of environmental protection and government regulation, and his understanding of cutting-edge technologies will continue to shape our use of a new generation of renewable resources,” said Sinatra.

If you’re questioning whether now is a good time to buy, take into consideration what you are paying for rent, what a new home costs, and today’s interest rates. In San Francisco, when you compare average rents with the low cost of ownership at 5800 Third Street, the answer is an unqualified YES! And with mortgage rates at an all-time low, according to CNN Money, you will actually SAVE a substantial amount each month when you purchase one of our spacious homes with private balconies, energy star appliances, in-building parking and much, much more.
Here’s an example: A renter paying $2,500/month for a two bedroom apartment could pay just $1,732 a month – or less – for a mortgage and full home-ownership! That example assumes a sales price of $375,000 with a 20% down payment and reflects after-tax savings of approximately $407. It also includes HOA dues, property taxes, and principal and interest on a 30-year fixed rate loan amortized over 30 years at 4.125%. But if you act fast, you can get an even lower interest rate now! PLUS we can work with you on a lower down payment, which will still put you (way) ahead, both now and in the future! With tax season upon us, call us to find out how much you can save by purchasing a beautiful new home. So hurry, payments may change with interest rate, credit score, purchase price and other variables, and terms can change quickly. Call us today, at 415-822-3800.Dare? by Vermontster

Close your eyes for a few seconds the next time you're watching TV. If you couldn't see that the bad guys are hiding around the corner, or that the hero just received an important text message, you could miss a lot of the story. A frustrating experience, for sure!
Over 15 million visually impaired viewers in the U.S. and Canada can enjoy watching TV, thanks to a service called "Descriptive Video.". As a narrator, a somewhat unemotional type of speaking style is necessary, because again, we don't want to take anything away from the actors' performances.
Here's a clip of my narration from the 1983 movie Mr. Mom:
And here's a scene I narrated from the CBS show Flashpoint:
It's fun to do and also challenging -- especially love scenes! Even though most of the programming is PG, it can be awkward to describe what's going on in a bedroom scene. ("He slowly unbuttons Katie's shirt. They kiss passionately ...") I'm often grateful that no one can hear a blush.
I love my job; I get to watch a lot of movies and TV (some awesome, some awful!), and it feels good to be contributing to a better quality of life for the visually impaired.
Video description is not as widely available as closed captioning is yet, but more and more networks are getting on board. If you want to access this free service at home, check with your cable provider to see if they offer a "described video" audio setting.

Other ITS and 5.8S sequences which were previously reported are confirmed as being clearly of mycorrhizal origin and are variable within one isolate of S. castanea. However, these results mean that previous conclusions which were drawn regarding the heterokaryotic status of AM fungal spores remain unproven. We provide an enlarged 5.8S rDNA dataset that can be used to check ITS sequences for conflicts with well-established phylogenies of the organisms that they were obtained from.FOUNDATION OF TOMORROW

Pain in the lower back can come on suddenly as a result of heavy lifting or an accident, or it can develop slowly over time due to aging’s role in changing the spine. Leading a sedentary lifestyle can also cause low back pain as the back muscles become weak and more vulnerable to injury.

Causes for lower back pain
Though the majority of low back pain is due to injury (i.e. a strain or disc injury), this isn’t always the case.
It’s also important to note that there are two types of back pain: pain that comes on suddenly and lasts no more than six weeks (aka acute back pain) and pain that lasts more than three months (aka chronic back pain).
Other causes of lower back pain include the following.

2. Spinal stenosis
When the spinal column narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.

3. Abnormal spine curvatures

What to do about lower back pain
According to Mayo Clinic, the majority of low back pain gradually improves with home treatment and self-care, usually within a few weeks. Home treatment can include alternating between ice and heat to relax muscles, over-the-counter pain medication, cessation of intense physical activity, and/or a warm bath or a massage.
If you practice home treatment diligently and your pain doesn’t improve after 72 hours, you should call your doctor.
There’s also the chance that your back pain is indicative of a serious medical problem.
In rare cases, back pain can signal a serious medical problem. Seek immediate care if your back pain leads to new bowel or bladder problems, is accompanied by fever, or follows a fall/blow to your back, seek immediate care.
Additionally, you should contact a doctor if your back pain becomes severe, causes weakness/numbness in one or both legs, causes tingling/pain down one or both legs, or is accompanied by inexplicable weight loss.
If you’re over 50 years old and you start experiencing back pain for the first time with no clear cause, seek medical help. The same goes for those with a history of cancer, osteoporosis, steroid use, or excessive drug or alcohol use.
Image Credit: Anut21ng/iStock.
Future prevention
Some back pain can be prevented through lifestyle modifications such as regular low-impact aerobic activities, abdominal and back muscle exercises, quitting smoking, and maintaining good posture.
Alternative medicines such as cupping therapy and acupuncture have also been shown to markedly improve backpain.
Remember, though, that most products that promise prevention and/or relief aren’t scientifically proven to help (i.e. special mattresses or insoles). Always consult with your doctor before beginning a new program/protocol for your back pain.

Honestly, you have got to love any project with the tag line ” Do Less: Achieve More”. That’s a project mission statement written by a developer, not a marketeer. The British Telecom “Project Web21C”: helps you do less and achieve more. Project Web21C is part of BT’s larger 21st century network initiative called 21CN, an IP-based, multi-service network.
They have released APIs that let you access
*(disc) Messaging
* Voice
* Location
* Authentication
* Conference Call
* Profile
* Contacts
on their network. They have even released “sample PHP”: code to help you get started using these cool services.
Here’s a short blurb from the project’s main web site.
bq. Need to integrate highly secure services such as Messaging, Voice, Location, Authentication, Conference Call, Profile, or Contacts into an application? Now you can with as little as one line of code. We currently offer tools for .Net, Java, PHP, and Python, and we are developing additional innovative services to allow you to build ever more powerful solutions using BT’s global infrastructure.
p. According to “programmableweb.com”:
bq. Given that often these APIs interact with phones and therefore the idiosyncrasies that entails, BT provides a set “Virtual Phones” that you can use in testing, each named after one of the Seven Dwarfs including “Bashful” that answers but disconnects after 3 seconds, “Grumpy” that always rings busy, and “Sleepy” the phone that never connects.
p. These APIs show promise and it’s great to see companies like BT realizing the value of APIs.

First of all, you should make sure you will be interested in the individual’s profile and that you are not mailing too much info. Second of all, keep the principles short also to the point. While you can go on for a few sentences, you must keep it under 20 key phrases. If you have more than twenty ideas, it is better to keep it short and the point.
Finally, you should be clear about what you want to say. The internet dating principles is your first and the last impression of you. If you respond too quickly, you may scare people away. You need to be honest and true in your concept. If you don’t just like a person, always be upfront and do not reply to their very own messages immediately. Always stay away from threatening, rude, or questionable messages. Likewise, it is alright to not react to your online dating announcements.
An online online dating message ought to be flirty and positive. You should talk about something that caught your eyes or trapped the additional person’s focus. Be lively and try to discover a common earth. It is OKAY to be flirty and silly. When it comes to the information of your note, you should also attempt to avoid talking about a lot of about your self. When you’ve written an internet dating personal message, the message ought to be thoughtful and friendly. Additionally important remember that it is a good idea to include a little information that will show that you have got something in keeping with the other person.
Besides being polite, online dating messages should be effective and tempting. If you don’t answer a woman’s message, you are sure to turn off potential partners. This is also true if you’re dating a stranger. You should also be honest about yourself to the Internet. Deficiencies in honesty inside your online personal message may result in the other person feeling not comfortable and unwelcoming. This will create a negative impression and make you appear desperate for to start a date.
It is essential to use a 3-step system when publishing a web based dating communication. It helps women get more reactions by commencing their meaning with what they like about her. By following these guidelines, you’ll have a better chance of producing the beneficiary feel more confident in your principles and increase her odds of contacting you. This will make the recipient more inclined to respond to your note. You should also make use of a unique first of all name make your contact information at the bottom of the message.
When you have been conntacting someone online and have received a message, you should be careful to avoid staying as well casual. Often , the person you aren’t talking to is not going to reply to some text that you’ve directed. A person’s on the net message is an important part of a relationship. For anybody who is being as well basic in your internet dating messages, it might hurt the chances. Therefore , you should be interesting, memorable, and catchy.
Another aspect to consider when ever writing a web dating note is time. It’s important to give your mail messages on the right time. Should you be not getting any replies, you must avoid sending your message at the wrong period. A good on-line message can be emailed on a regular basis. For anybody who is sending the message only one time a day, it might not get recognized. But it should be sent at least three times every day.
Your online seeing messages should be fun. Don’t use a whole lot of text and buzzin language. A humorous sculpt can help you choose your message more likely to be reading and loved. For example , if the person comments your appears, she’ll become more interested in your own. Adding a funny touch on your message goes a long way over time. When you make your first personal message playful, then you can definitely build a rapport with the other person.
An optimistic message may be one of the most unforgettable messages to get. At the time you send a compliment, likely to make your meet feel valued. The note should be brief. If you’re requesting a date, inquire further about their interests, as well. For anyone who is asking all of them out, you may give them a warm welcome. If you’re certainly not interested in a particular person, they’ll in all probability move on to a second profile.The Palestinian-Israeli Camp David Negotiations and Beyond "Camp David: Tragedy of Errors"
You are visiting the old website of The Institute for Palestine Studies
Please visit our new websiteClick Here
It was not until a year after the collapse of the Camp David talks in July 2000 that authoritative voices in the U.S. press began to challenge what had become virtual dogma: that Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat had rejected the unprecedentedly "generous offer" of Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, which reportedly involved the return of the quasi totality of Palestinian territory. Among the consequences of this dogma is the widespread notion of Palestinian responsibility for the al-Aqsa intifada that erupted a month later.
Foremost among the new challenges to these perceptions in the U.S. mainstream press are the two articles reproduced below. The first, published in the 9 August 2001 issue of the New York Review of Books, is by Robert Malley, who participated in the Camp David summit as President Bill Clinton's special assistant for Arab-Israeli affairs at the National Security Council, and Hussein Agha, an editor of JPS's sister publication, Majallat al-Dirasat al-Filastiniyya, with close ties to the Palestinian negotiators. The second, published in the New York Times on 26 July 2001, is by Deborah Sontag, the newspaper's correspondent in Jerusalem.20% off Select Clothing Use Code: BLACKFRIDAY21

Not everybody is entirely persuaded that shifting mental health care online is the method forward. “For me, what works in therapy is when you fulfill someone face-to-face, produce the nearness, the intimacy, that really gets individuals to open and check out things.”
” I have actually performed some research study into Skype counselling,” says London-based psychotherapist Dr Aaron Balick, “and it’s not the ‘practical equivalent’ of traditional counselling; it’s just not quite the same thing. It’s really essential that people who participate in it are aware that it’s a various experience from remaining in the room with somebody, speaking in person.”

Modeled after the popular CBC TV program Dragon’s Den, the Generation Innovation Challenge is a project designed to provide Métis youth (aged 13-29) with confidence, motivation and, above all, concrete business skills and mentoring. Also for the second year, the challenge was recorded and edited into a fast-paced and exciting video that you can view here.
Métis youth from across Ontario were invited to submit applications describing their business or innovation, in order to receive business training and compete for prizes in a Dragon’s Den style competition where they would pitch their business ideas to a panel of judges.
Deanna Parker, a recreation therapist from Dryden, was awarded first place. Parker pitched an idea for a Sioux Lookout Aquatic Rehabilitation Centre that she hopes to start in the “Hub of the North” where she can practice aquatic therapy. She hopes to expand across the region in the next 10 years.
“The experience was amazing,” said Parker, who won a $1000 cash prize, a new laptop computer and a printer. “I felt like a movie star! I was very surprised at the amount of work that goes into one show.”
From the applications received, seven Métis youth were chosen to receive online training from the GoForth institute as well as face to face business and pitch training from Peter Smith, President of the Commerce Assessment Group. Andre Laurin, President of Ocean Transportation Services Freight Forwarding Inc. provided the trainees practical business advice. The candidates also had the opportunity to receive pitch and business advice from Ryan Foley, President of NuvoCare Health Sciences Inc. and past contestant on CBC's Dragon's Den.
Based on the business plans of the seven trainees, three finalists were chosen to pitch to the judges in studio. The 2013 judges were Chinyere Eni, National Director, Aboriginal and Public Sector Markets at RBC; Peter Smith, President Commerce Assessment Group; Larry Mah, Director of Programs at Youth in Motion; and Paul Ungerman, Manager of Government Affairs at Union Gas.
Contestant Renée Michaud, a Liaison Officer with the University of Ottawa, came in second place with an idea for a mobile restaurant (food truck) serving Aboriginal cuisine cooked over a wood fire. Taylor Hari, a Ph.D. Candidate from the University of Ottawa, placed third with a pitch for an exclusive sock design company that manufactures with an emphasis on quality material and fit.
The Generation Innovation project stimulated the entrepreneurial spirit in its participants while providing them with confidence, motivation and, above all, concrete business skills and mentoring.

I came to Dundee in 1990 as a medical student and after graduating in 1996 worked in Ninewells as a junior doctor before going on to complete my specialist training in Medical Oncology in Newcastle, Aberdeen, Australia, and New Zealand.
I returned to Ninewells Hospital and School of Medicine in 2015 as Professor of Medical Oncology at the University of Dundee and a Consultant Medical Oncologist in Tayside Cancer Centre. It is fantastic to be back in Dundee and in Ninewells Medical School where an exciting and vibrant environment exists to support research and innovation to ensure we are able to develop and offer the best and very latest cancer treatments as quickly as possible to our patients.
My research focusses on understanding why oesophageal and stomach cancers are resistant to treatments and precision cancer medicine which aims to personalise and optimise cancer treatment for each patient to provide the best chance of success.
I lead a programme of cancer clinical trials and laboratory of research in Dundee. I have been able to progress treatment opportunities for cancer patients in a number government and professional advisory roles including to the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientist in Scotland, The Scottish Parliament, National Cancer Research Institute, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, European Society of Medical Oncology and the International Gastric Cancer Association.
I am honoured to be able to work with the Ninewells Cancer Campaign in their aim to make a difference to the lives of local people affected by cancer, and help ensure the treatment they receive is the best it can be, and by supporting research impact cancer patients locally and across the world as well.(Amman, Jordan) — As he and his team prepare for the arrival of Pope Francis to Jordan later this month, the Prime Minister of the Hashemite Kingdom, a Muslim man governing a predominantly Muslim Arab nation, has a message for all Christians, be they Catholic or Protestant: Come and walk where Jesus walked.
“We are part of the Holy Land,” Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour told me during a thirty minute meeting at his office in Amman on Sunday.
.
“In the north you will find first churches in the world,” the Prime Minister added. “We are very proud of this.”
“Christians were persecuted” by the Romans on the west bank of the Jordan River in the first century, “and they were oppressed,” he noted. “So Christianity fled from there to here.”
During our meeting, we discussed several pressing issues, from the breakdown of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks to the crisis in Syria to the scarcity of Jordan’s economic and natural resources to Jordan’s aggressive efforts to fight terrorism and maintain calm and stability. In that context, we also discussed King Abdullah II’s efforts to make Jordan a model of moderation and peace.
For me, as an evangelical Christian, it was particularly interesting to see how important the Prime Minister feels about the Biblical history of Jordan, and about the His Majesty’s initiative to reach out to the Christian community around the world and make them feel welcome and at home in the Hashemite Kingdom.
It should be noted that this will be the fourth Pope to visit Jordan in fifty years, and the third to visit since King Abdullah took the throne in 1999. Like several senior officials I have met with in recent days, including the Foreign Minister and the Tourism Minister, the Prime Minister hopes the Papal visit will encourage many more Catholics to come visit Jordan. But he also wants many more Protestants and evangelicals to come, too.
“We are moderates,” he told me. “We don’t hate Jews or Israelis. We can live in peace together….And we are open to Christians. We need your efforts.”.

Some call me “Von”, others call me “Sly”. So I guess you can call me whatever you want.
I’m a personal trainer, online coach, and self-proclaimed lifehacker.
Other than coffee, there’s nothing I love more in the world than helping people transform their bodies while eating all their favorite foods. You know, stuff like cookies, cake, cheetos, donuts, fries… you get the idea.
You might have seen some of my writing over at BodyBuilding.com, STACK, Yahoo Sports, and Fitocracy, but this site right here is my baby.
A Quick Transformation Story
You know, just a little bathroom selfie.
So there’s something you need to know about me: I’ve never really been into fitness.
You see that guy on the left? Yep, that was me.
That was wayyyy before I lifted my first ever dumbbell. As you can see, I was a skinny twig.
Back then, you would have never seen me at the gym. Instead, you would have found me locked in my room playing Call of Duty or Halo all day and all night. That was my thing back then — geeking out on my computer and playing video games. Sure, you would have found me playing basketball somewhere, but you would never find me at the gym.
I was a big nerd (and still am).
It wasn’t until I started lifting weights that I realized leveling up in life was a lot better than leveling up in a game. It got addicting. Day in and day out, I went to the gym and lifted heavy shit. I saw my body slowly changing. I finally had muscle in my body, and people started to notice. It felt awesome.
From then on, becoming the strongest version of myself is what I’ve been striving for, and I never looked back.
A Confession
Here’s another thing you need to know about me: I’ve tried everything just to get to where I am now.
I mean, everything.
See, the thing that sucks about the fitness industry, which I’m sure you have experienced (or are currently experiencing) yourself, is that there’s just way too much information out there. I’ve read everything you can read about training and nutrition, watched hundreds of fitness-related YouTube videos, and tried all sorts of supplements and products.
Basically, I was my very own experimental guinea pig:
- I’ve gained over 50lbs of muscle since Day 1, but also put on an excess amount of fat that covered it all up.
- That said, I’ve leaned out to the point where I’d lose fat but also muscle, basically bringing me back to square one.
- I’ve had my days of eating nothing but chicken, tilapia, broccoli, and sweet potatoes every single day for months and months because they said you should eat “clean”. It was one of the most horrible experiences of my life.
- I ate 6-7 meals a day — one every 2-3 hours — because they said it would “stoke your metabolism” and speed up results.
- I stopped eating carbs completely because apparently it was the best way to lose fat.
- I’ve spent THOUSANDS of dollars on useless supplements that didn’t do anything.
It wasn’t until I started to learn about the science of nutrition that I finally started to realize that there’s a more effective, simple, and sustainable approach to fitness.
Gone are the days where I would pack tupperwares of food just so I can eat every 2-3 hours. I also no longer have a diet of just chicken and broccoli. Instead, I’ve incorporated flexible dieting into my lifestyle so that I can still eat all my favorite foods while still keeping my six-pack.
The best part of it all? Being able to help hundreds of people from all over the world do the same thing.
My Philosophies
A few things about this site (and my philosophies):
- I take a no-BS approach when it comes to fitness. Years of reading and self-experimentation has taught me how to identify what works and what doesn’t. There’s too much noise out there in the fitness industry, so it’s my job to do whatever it takes to simplify it for you.
- Training should be fun. If it isn’t, you’re doing it wrong.
- Whatever your fitness goals may be, you should still be eating your favorite foods. I am a big advocate of flexible dieting. Nobody should ever have to eat chicken and broccoli just to get in shape. There are too many good foods out there.
- Fitness should be a part of life. It should never be your life.
- Fitness should never make your life more complicated. If it is, you’re doing it wrong.
- My all-time favorite exercises: push-ups and pull-ups. You can pretty much do them anywhere.

Heather Manus, RN
Medical director, Sacred Garden of Santa Fe; president, Genesis International Cannabis Solutions
When transitioning from a traditional career into the cannabis industry, it’s important to understand that you must cover your back at every turn. Remember that safety nets do not yet exist in this industry. As a Registered Nurse, my instinct to care for others before myself was a flaw in my business plan when it came to financial issues.
Kindness and compassion will always be character strengths, but must be balanced with a sensible business plan, financial structure and contracts.
A healthy balance of passion, curiosity, and business sense is vital for success in this emerging and rapidly growing industry. Recognize when you are providing more than you are receiving and evaluate your reasoning.
Be extremely careful about the people you choose to partner with; it could mean the difference between getting your big break, and breaking you in a big way.
Hire for Cultural Fit…
Derek A. Peterson
CEO/President, Terra Tech
Entrepreneurs in the cannabis industry face unique hurdles from other businesses. We must navigate political issues, weigh the risks of federal legality, and manage complex taxation, to name a few. In order to thrive, a cannabis business requires a team of specialists to operate it smoothly and ensure its continued growth.
Early on in my career in this industry, I thought a sound plan was to identify the top people in each respective field and amalgamate that group in order to achieve our goals. What sounded good in theory, failed in application.
Through experience I have found it is far more important to hire a team that integrates well. A single weak link can cause the entire system to collapse. Today when we add someone to the team, we first make certain that they function well within our culture and consider secondarily how their resume stacks up.
Take Active Role in Legalization…
R. Michael Smullen
Executive chairman and co-founder, AltMed
The failure of Amendment 2 in Florida (which would have legalized medical marijuana) forced the executive team at AltMed to step back and re-evaluate our business plan.
We knew that before we could determine our next steps, it was critical to evaluate our efforts to date and determine, what, if anything, we might have done differently.
The biggest lesson learned for AltMed is that we should have been more aggressive in helping to shape the narrative for the Vote Yes campaign.
One of the major reasons for the Amendment 2 shortfall was that the other side ran a strong campaign with a barrage of TV ads that were highly deceptive and filled with fear mongering. Very little was done in the last few weeks to counter those claims.
With our deep experience in healthcare sales and marketing, we could have taken a stronger position with United for Care in helping to shape the campaign, more than just making a financial contribution.
AltMed did participate in several debates, talks and interviews with several local TV news stations and newspapers, but these did not have the reach necessary to impact the other areas of the state.
Don’t Underestimate Your Financial Needs…
Matt Walstatter
Owner, Pure Green
Make certain that you request and secure enough money from your investors to execute your business plan. This may seem obvious, but it can be tricky.
We initially asked our investor for about $100,000 less than we ultimately needed. We had a business plan, but after we got the initial yes, we revisited the numbers and realized we were at least $50,000 short.
We had to go back and essentially re-pitch the investor. After we got rolling, we realized we needed an additional $50,000. We were able to return to the well once more, but not everyone will have that option. To avoid the same mistake:
- Make sure you have a business plan with projected expenditures for getting started, as well for monthly operating costs.
- Include a sum for unanticipated contingencies in your plan. I recommend taking your total start-up budget and adding an additional 30%.
- Make sure you have a plan to cover your operating expenses for a sufficient interval going forward. Start with at least six months operating expenses in the bank.
Funding a new business can be complicated, but with enough foresight and planning you can assure that you are financially prepared for whatever challenges arise.
Brace for Unique Challenges…
Jennifer Beck
CEO and co-founder, Cannabase
If you’re exploring starting a cannabis business, remember that every opportunity comes with a price tag, and the cost of cannabis is steep (and not just for recreational users!).
If you choose to take the plunge, be prepared to have both your problems and opportunities limited by cannabis’ federally illegal status. Access to banking, restrictions on out-of-state investments, and the lingering social taboos will play a large role in shaping your decisions throughout your company’s growth.
Today, marijuana is still a small town where powerful partnerships are being formed and businesses are popping up in untapped spaces. If I had to do it all over again, I would give up the sleep, freedom, and sanity to build Cannabase all over again … but I would appreciate my final days with a bank account a little bit more.It was time to begin preparing felt Easter ornaments. The technique was the same as in the case of my embroidered felt Christmas ornaments.
First of all I made different sizes egg shape templates on the computer.
I printed them out and after I cut them out I drew them on a cardboard paper.
I cut out the cardboard egg shapes to use as final templates for the felt.
I traced a line around the template on the felt sheet.
I drew dots on the felt egg and I embroidered the dots.
I fixed a cord to the top of the inner side of the egg shape.
I stitched up the two parts with white thread.

Beryl Romero became a server at Taco Diner 14 years ago. Now, she’s general manager. In an industry where female leaders are few and far between, Romero is the proud matriarch of her Taco Diner family.
Taco Diner’s mission has always been family-oriented, and they favored female employees from the beginning. When the first restaurant opened in 1998, the staff was all female because of the love and care women put into their work, Romero says.
The store caters to families in some creative ways. The drinks are made to pack a punch so that parents can drink in front of their kids and enjoy themselves while sipping a single margarita. The Lake Highlands location even goes as far as separating the bar area and making it 21 and over. Romero keeps the family feeling alive by making sure her staff has what she calls “humble hospitality,” especially with children.
“The kids are going to be your future guests,” Romero says.
Romero loves being one of the few women in the boys club. She thinks women can handle the job better and are more detail-oriented. It makes the environment warm and caring.
“Being a woman general manager, it makes everyone say ‘wow’ because I’m running this place, and that’s what I love,” Romero says.
Taco Diner is a chain restaurant but considers itself a collection of neighborhood restaurants, which means the Lake Highlands location is specifically catered to our neighborhood. It doesn’t look like any other location. New menu items are tested here before they’re added at other locations. Hits such as bowls, elote, the shrimp-and-chorizo taco and the signature frozen paloma all started here in Lake Highlands.
There were rumors that the frozen paloma was introduced to replace the mambo taxi, but rest easy, the mambo taxi won’t leave the menu anytime soon. Taco Diner just needed its own signature drink to separate it from its sister store Mi Cocina. While the mambo taxi may be more famous, both drinks are equally good. Try one of each on the patio as long as you don’t have to drive the kids home.

There are two doors: a blue door for the family friendly side and a clear door for the 21-and-up side.

I’m going to help you get past those initial stumbling blocks. Your newsletter might still take a while to get on its feet, and that’s fine. But if you keep these top email newsletter best practices at the forefront of your newsletter crafting, you’ll be a step ahead of those who got lost finding the starting line.
It’s important to note that crafting newsletters is a key component of The CLICK Technique: K – Keep Going. Once you have your audience’s e-mail, it’s time to keep them warm by reaching out to them at least once a week. The best way to do that is (you guessed it!) with a newsletter.
All that said, today I’ve got some tips for newsletter creation, including consistency, focusing on a purpose, incorporating visual elements, content delivery, and getting permission from your audience. It’s a good chunk of info to cover, so let’s get started on the top five email newsletter best practices.
The First of the Email Newsletter Best Practices: Have a Purpose
Your newsletter needs to have a clear purpose. Why should your intended audience sign up for it? What will they get out of it? Like any part of your business or website, your newsletter needs to be filled with worthwhile content.
Go back to the heart of your brand, and build your purpose from there. Make sure that each newsletter is centered around that purpose. Of course, you’ll be building on your brand image and hooking back to your website, but that’s just the start. You need a reason to be emailing them.
You wouldn’t send an unsolicited email to a friend unless you had a reason, right? Think of your readers as your friends. You might want to check in and see how their day is going. You might want them to know what’s new with you. You might want to tell them an exciting story about something that happened to you. Connect with your readership like you would a friend!
One of the top email newsletter best practices is to keep the purpose for your emails at the head of the proverbial ship. This isn’t easy, I know. If you’re keeping consistent with your newsletter, it can be challenging to come up with informative, interesting, and purposeful content for every single newsletter. You’re a busy person!
I assure you, however, that this is time well-spent. Newsletters are a crucial part of community engagement, and can net you a lot of traffic to your site. Spend the time to brainstorm what your readership wants–you won’t regret it.
Give Them What They Signed Up For
Now that you’ve honed in on what your readership wants, give it to them. This seems obvious, right? In practice, it’s not as easy as it sounds. It’s stupidly easy to get off-track with your content. That’s why one of the top email newsletter best practices is to stick to your guns.
If you’ve been watching the trends closely, you’ll notice that uniform content is king right now. Western society usually goes through cycles when it comes to these trends. Sometimes we’re a society that likes our barber shops to also be a cafe and a laundromat. These days, we want a business to offer one single thing, and we want them to be good at what they do.
Don’t be tempted to start going off on tangents in your newsletter. You’ve identified what your audience wants, so give them what they want! Reassess your newsletter constantly to make sure it’s still supplying your readers with what they signed up for.
These people wouldn’t be signing up if they didn’t already like your business, and that’s a great place to start. Figure out what your audience likes about you, and build on it.
Avoid selling. This is a newsletter, not a sales pitch. People aren’t going to buy because you sell; they’ll buy because they like you, and they like your content. People buy from places that they trust, and a surefire way to build trust is through supplying good, useful content. Make your newsletter one of the sources of that good and useful content!
Keep your titles short and punchy. Keep your content focused. Keep your eye on the prize, and you’ll nail this section of the email newsletter best practices.
Get Fancy – Go Visual
Plain text emails aren’t that engaging, are they? When was the last time you got an email from a business that was only text? We might be willing to read an article online that relies on text, but we want our newsletters to be spruced up. Put some flare in that newsletter; rely on some multimedia.
You’ll want to dig through any visual elements available to you. Most newsletters start their emails off with a picture, as it easily entices and intrigues the reader. Humans are simple; we like pretty things. We’re more likely to engage with text after looking at a nice picture. Simple.
Videos aren’t generally a part of the email newsletter best practices, but experiment with what works for you. Depending on what your business and website entails, a video might be just what your audience wants. If you’ve released a trailer for new content or a vlog all about a new product, your newsletter recipients will at least want a link to it!
A quick note: one of the email newsletter best practices is to NOT embed your video in the email. There are a lot of spam filters that may disable your video altogether. Instead, try including an intriguing picture of your video that’s actually a link to access the full video. Those with slow internet speeds will thank you.
Don’t go overboard! Include too many images, videos, or other multimedia, and your newsletter will become difficult to navigate. On the internet, anything that is difficult to navigate is clicked away from immediately.
Get Permission
All of us get excited at the prospect of people signing up for our newsletter. After all the hard work we’ve put in, it’s good to see those numbers stacking up. Because of this, it may be tempting to simply send the newsletter without checking the validity of the sign-up
You need to make sure that they signed up for your newsletter intentionally, and always give them an out. It’s the internet; scamming, bots, and the like happen all the time. You need to make sure that someone’s email address wasn’t stolen and plugged into your newsletter.
First, make sure that your newsletter sends a confirmation email to the address prior to anything else. The owner of the email will then have to confirm that, yes, they did intentionally sign up for your newsletter. It might make you sweat bullets to have your audience base second-guessing themselves, but no worries. Those who want to sign up will appreciate you putting security first!
Second, it’s a good practice to include an “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each newsletter. It’s possible that someone might want to unsubscribe, and you don’t want to burn bridges by making that process difficult. If you love them, let them go, right?
The top email newsletter best practices include ways of ensuring your audience actually wants to be there. There’s no point in sending out newsletters to people who have no interest in engaging with you! Be brave, and make sure that “Exit” sign is still on and visible.
One of the Best Email Newsletter Best Practices: Be Consistent
Consistency: possibly the most important of the email newsletter best practices I’ll put on this list. Your newsletter could be shined to a polish. It could be chock-full of amazing content that knocks the socks off of people. If it’s not consistent, though, your newsletter will fade into memory.
The last of the email newsletter best practices I’ll be discussing today has to do with getting them out regularly. Your readers need to be able to know when your newsletters are going out. (In other words: Keep Going!)
How frequently should your newsletter be going out? Most people agree that once a week hits the sweet spot, but it’ll depend on your audience. Gently test the waters. Try starting slowly and gently ramping up. Pay attention to how many people stay on board as you make your newsletter a more frequent presence in their inbox.
The key to balancing frequency correctly has to do with intention. Your newsletter is there to keep communication open between you and the people who engage with your brand. Too many emails, and you’ll scare people away who think you’re desperate to sell. Too few emails, and they’ll forget about you.
Too often, I see people start up a newsletter and then neglect their list of contacts. Remember – they signed up for your newsletter because they want to hear from you. At the top of the email newsletter, best practices are always consistency. You’ve gotten people to sign up; don’t waste that opportunity by going silent! Keep going!

With many children being overweight and suffering from health issues, one tends to wonder how parents can prevent this. With the help of nutritionists and healthy lifestyle changes, it is possible to ensure that children can maintain the ideal weight and be at peak health. In this article, we will examine the ways this can be done.
Promote healthy eating and drinking habits.
Instead of trying to force a child to reach a certain weight, instill healthy eating habits. When the consumption of unnecessary sugar and fat is reduced, and children are given wholesome meals and snacks, they naturally shed the extra weight and become more fit and healthy. They will also be likely to fall sick and require visits to a medical center.
Parents should incorporate less processed food in their meals instead of lean meats, beans, and lentils to increase the protein content. Carbohydrates should not be eliminated; however, they can be switched to wholemeal and unrefined foods. Sugary drinks should be limited, and fruits and vegetables should be increased.
Reduce the amount of calorie-rich foods that are available
Any pediatrician would say that the best way to reduce temptation is by removing it. If there are crisps and candy at home, children will want to consume them. However, if those items are not there, they may not even think about having them. Therefore, parents should make sure that food and drinks that are high in calories are not available at home.
Introduce healthy variants of their favorite snacks
It is common for children to want to enjoy their favorite sweets and savory snacks. Trying to stop them from consuming these items can be a futile task, as they can purchase them on their way to school. Instead, introduce to them healthier variants of those treats.
It is possible to make healthy crisps and sweets at home. There are many recipes available that one can use as a guideline. These variants contain fewer calories and fat, making them a delicious treat that will satisfy a child’s craving.
Enroll them in a sport
Even the best pediatrician will say that physical fitness is the way to avoid childhood obesity. Sports are the perfect solution for a child to do exercise and burn calories while having fun. Not only will it keep them active, but it will also teach them valuable skills and is helpful for their future.
Parents should not force their children to follow a sport they think is good for them. Instead, allow the child to choose which one they would like to learn. This would make them more likely to be passionate about the activity and continue it for a longer time.
Speak with a nutritionist before making any changes.
Children are still growing; therefore, they must receive the correct nutrients they need to aid their development. Making them go under a diet without supervision or advice from a nutritionist could put their health and wellbeing at risk. Therefore, parents must always consult with a professional before making any changes to their child’s meals and lifestyle.ACParadise Network: American Cosplay Paradise American Cosplay Experience American Cosplay Snapshots

I was home and away, out many evenings, catching up during the day. It felt like holiday celebration and fiscal year end all wrapped up together. I’m happy that December will be a quieter month, with some holiday fun and celebration along the way.
Amidst everything that was going on, I managed to make two CCC recipes in November and they were both delicious.
Parsnip and Ginger Soup
I’ve been filling the freezer with containers full of one or two servings of soup. I love making soup in cold weather, in big batches. It’s satisfying on the day it’s made, then the flavours develop over a day or two, making it even more delicious. I always try to put some away, though, for those days when it’s wet and miserable and I’m too cold and tired to cook from scratch. Those days, soup isn’t just satisfying, it’s sustaining.
This soup will be perfect for those days. It’s filling and spicy, fragrant with ginger and cardamom. The parsnips retain a little of their sharpness, which works in this soup. I froze some without adding any milk, the final step in the recipe, as soup freezes much better without it. I added a little almond milk to the soup we ate, to keep things vegan, then sprinkled a few toasted pumpkin seeds on top.
Even though I said the sharpness of the parsnips works in this soup, I’ll roast them the next time I make this. I think the caramelized sweetness of roasted parsnips would put this soup over the top for me.
Roasted New Potatoes with Two Mojo Sauces
We roast potatoes all the time, tossed in olive oil, herbs and spices, with cloves of garlic along for the ride. What we don’t do very often is make roasted potatoes the focus of an appetizer.
That’s a mistake I’m happy to have corrected. These potatoes are parboiled, then roasted tossed in olive oil, salt, and pepper. (I’d skip the boil next time, just because I love the crust that simply roasted potatoes develop.) Then, they’re served with two Canary Island inspired dipping sauces.
The first sauce,mojo cilantro, is garlicky and vegetal, creamy without any added dairy. It’s good enough that I’ll make it again, but it wasn’t the star of the show. That was the mojo picón. I roasted and peeled red bell peppers for this one and it was worth the effort. With hot chiles, cumin, and smoked paprika rounding out the flavours, this sauce is hard to stop eating. We should have roasted more potatoes.
Here’s to the start of a wonderful holiday season! I’m looking forward to reading all the CCC cooks’ posts.
Here are the links to the rest of the group’s posts for this month. I encourage you to check them out – you’ll meet some wonderful bloggers and get some great inspiration for vegetarian eating.

Dear Teresa, hope the month of December will bring a bit more peace and quiet – I down-sized the recipes to five for the month of December, I know we will all be so very busy at this time of year.
The parsnip soup was a huge hit and I love your idea of roasting the parsnips before getting started on the recipe – a nice option to keep in my mind when making this soup agian. The dipping sauces for the potatoes were also extremely favorably recieved at our house – no surprise you thought that you should have made more potatoes!
Wonderful post, glad you and Kevin enjoyed these dishes.
Enjoy December!
Andrea
Thanks, Andrea! It looks like December is going to be very busy, though in a very good way. So many things to do, people to visit, meals to share. I imagine it’s going to be a very busy and festive month for you, too!
Lovely choices for November from your kitchen! We enjoyed these at our home too. But I grilled the par boiled potato instead of roasting!
I think grilling the potato sounds like a great variation, Emily!
Hi Teresa, Both of your selections for the month look scrumptious. I make soups constantly in my kitchen so I’ll need to give that parsnip and ginger soup a go. The potato sauces also sound delicious and appear to have been favorably received by many in the group so I’ll put that on my to do list too.
Wishing you the best in the upcoming holiday season.
Thanks so much, Peggy! I recommend trying both of these dishes. And have a wonderful holiday season, too!
Hi Teresa, looks like you have been really busy, so nice December will be an easier month. Love, love your parsnip soup, wish I would have made it. The potato dish sounds wonderful too, not sure why I did not make it as I am a huge fan of them. Happy Holidays!
Happy Holidays, Cheri! The potato dish was a huge hit for us, especially. Hope you can fit it in soon.
November *was* a totally crazy month here too. Not that December is about to give us a breather! The soup looks terrific, I have some parsnips left over and this would be an amazing way to incorporate them!
You should try it. And I know what you mean about December – I still haven’t caught up from last month and this month’s going at a breakneck pace!
Both your dishes look delicious Teresa. I like the idea of roasting the parsnips first to take away some of their edge and your little potatoes look beautifully crisp, perfect for dipping.
Thanks so much, Zosia!The latest United Arrows retail venture was opened within the Narita Airport in Tokyo, which signified an interesting approach from the retail group.

Check out the related content below while we wait for the question to be answered by a professional mechanic.Fair warning up front: this is not a Terraform, AWS, or Elasticsearch tutorial. You’ll need to know a bit or read the docs to apply the examples.
When I wanted to add the AWS version of ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) which is Elasticsearch, Cloudwatch and Kibana, I hit a road block that Terraform did not support provisioning the actual streaming of logs from Cloudwatch to Elasticsearch naively. Googling lead me approximately nowhere, and I had to devise a solution from scratch.
Automating setting up Cloudwatch once hosts are set up is reasonably straightforward using e.g. Ansible, so it’s the Lambda function to parse messages and send them to Elasticsearch that is the problem. It’s super simple to set up if you follow the docs and click through the AWS console, but there are few hints on how you would automate it reliably.
Terraform supports setting up Cloudwatch log subscription filters and Elasticsearch clusters/domains as well as Lambda functions, and once you know what to put in the Lambda, the process is just plain old Terraform. While the solution is not very sophisticated, it works for me ^(tm) and I belive it might work for others as well.
As so often in software, the solution is to copy something that works. In this case, I created a subscription filter from some random Cloudwatch group to a freshly created Elasticsearch domain on a test account, and then checked the resulting (NodeJS) code for the generated Lambda function. To my delight, the code has almost no environment- or target specific contents except for the Elasticsearch endpoint itself, so there’s not much that needs to be done to adapt it for any setup.
In this case, I simply replaced references to the endpoint with references to a environment variable
ES_ENDPOINT, which I then inject when creating the lambda function.
Putting the resulting index.js (or whatever) into a zip file, we can then provision it using Terraform:
resource "aws_lambda_function" "logs-to-es-lambda" { filename = "files/es_logs_lambda.zip" description = "CloudWatch Logs to Amazon ES" function_name = "Logs_To_Elasticsearch" role = "${aws_iam_role.my-es-execution-role.arn}" handler = "index.handler" source_code_hash = '${base64sha256(file("files/es_logs_lambda.zip"))}' runtime = "nodejs4.3" timeout = 60 environment { variables = { ES_ENDPOINT = "${aws_elasticsearch_domain.my-es-domain.endpoint}" } } }
With the Lambda function in place, we can create a log subscription filter to send events to it:
resource "aws_lambda_permission" "cloudwatch-lambda-permission" { statement_id = "allow-cloudwatch-lambda" action = "lambda:InvokeFunction" function_name = "${aws_lambda_function.logs-to-es-lambda.arn}" principal = "logs.${var.my-aws-region}.amazonaws.com" source_arn = "${aws_cloudwatch_log_group.my-log-group.arn}" } resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter" "logs-subscription" { name = "ElasticsearchStream-logs" depends_on = ["aws_lambda_permission.cloudwatch-lambda-permission"] log_group_name = "${aws_cloudwatch_log_group.my-log-group.name}" filter_pattern = "[timestamp, level, thread, name, message]" destination_arn = "${aws_lambda_function.logs-to-es-lambda.arn}" }
The filter pattern follows the same rules as in the AWS console, and I’d generally use the console and some example data to try it out since I find the documentation incredibly hard to find and parse.
For a full example, you’d of course need to provision the role (
aws_iam_role), domain (
aws_elasticsearch_domain) and stream some interesting logs to the log group! In addition, the first time I did this I hooked a quick Python hack to inject the endpoint and zip the JavaScript source on the fly, but I don’t think that makes much sense in retrospect. The last couple of projects I’ve done this, I’ve simply committed the ZIP to the source repository instead.

Forming an LLC may appear frustrating and also daunting at initially, however actually, it is relatively easy when you have a mutual understanding of exactly how an LLC works. In this brief overview to creating your very own LLC, damage each action down into digestible little bits so you can understand whatever there is to understand concerning exactly how to start an LLC swiftly and effectively …
Creating an LLC is quite various from most other kinds of company enrollment. One of the first things you need to do when you begin the procedure is make a decision the name for your new LLC. Right here, you will certainly additionally decide on the operating agreement, which ought to cover every one of the little details concerning how your service will certainly be run, and also which participant(s) will possess and preserve business. There are some great devices around to assist you begin. The United States federal government has practical types offered online, in addition to directions for submitting your posts of incorporation.
The next step in forming an LLC is selecting the tax obligation standing you will run under. Depending on your service structure, this might not be a basic decision. Will you be a single proprietorship, a partnership, a C firm, or an LLC? Each of these frameworks have different regulations about who bears which taxes. You’ll need to consult with someone specifically about which classification to choose, as well as what you’ll need to pay as well as what you’ll owe for each category.
As soon as you’ve chosen the type of organization structure you desire, you will need to pick a legal name for your brand-new business. This name will additionally belong to the Articles of Company, which are the lawful records that develop the LLC. Your other papers, like your Operating Agreement, Service Permit, and also Other Operating Terms, will be submitted with your regional office. It’s an excellent idea to print out copies of all these files so you can bring them with you when you most likely to register your brand-new service at the area staff’s workplace. You’ll require to register the LLC. Make certain to read all of the small print, and always read what you and also your accountant have set concerning the Operating Arrangement prior to you authorize.
One of the most essential things to cover when you begin an LLC is responsibility defense. Many various kinds of companies supply various degree of responsibility security. You will certainly want to learn which company will certainly supply it finest for your circumstance. Normally, the higher the liability defense, the much less you’ll need to pay in tax obligations if your business obtains sued. If you’re simply starting, start out with a responsibility protection degree that’s low, and afterwards enhance it as your business grows.
The last point you need to do when forming an LLC in New york city is submit your Articles of Company. In New York, write-ups of organization are submitted with the state. Apart from that, your proprietors must submit their tax obligation returns and also see to it that their LLC is registered with the IRS. This can take six months to a year relying on the length of time you’ve had your business. This is just one of the most laborious, yet critical steps when developing an LLC in New York.
Kind an LLC – Local Business Tax Obligation Advantages
Forming an LLC is not as hard as you might assume. You will intend to follow the actions outlined below if you intend to create an LLC. If you are still puzzled, make certain to get in touch with a qualified tax obligation expert. He/She will certainly be able to discuss the numerous options offered to you, consisting of the details regarding your state’s income tax and business tax regulations. When your accounting professional has actually taken care of these details, you will require to choose what sort of entity you desire to create.
There are 2 basic sorts of businesses – single proprietorships and also firms. A sole proprietor is taken into consideration to be anyone who possesses a house and also operates that house as his/her primary address. Instances of people who could drop into this category consist of single proprietors of assisted living facility, personal service providers, and so on. Corporations, on the other hand, are companies that are had by one person. They are exhausted like an organization as well as need to report their possessions as well as income on a yearly basis. Examples of corporations are collaborations, restricted responsibility business, and corporation.
Numerous little organization owners like to form an LLC due to the fact that they can avoid dual tax. A solitary pass-through entity will be strained as an individual for earnings as well as dividends but will be tired as a firm for funding gains and also payroll tax obligations. Because several small company proprietors select to develop an LLC, they generally pay fewer tax obligations.
Creating an LLC is relatively very easy. You will need to identify the name of the LLC, choose a legal organization name, and also register it in your name. Most business owners begin with a C firm. This is referred to as being “in the public eyes” and also refers to the fact that your LLC will be openly provided for tax obligation objectives such as on a notice board in your community’s service area. After filing the kind called “developing an LLC in the state of California,” all that is required of you is to deposit a quantity equal to the overall quantity of money spent in the LLC, pay the prescribed cost, as well as submit a yearly income tax return. After you file, your LLC will end up being “registered” and will certainly be able to negotiate business as a corporation.
Creating an LLC does not transform the truth that you are still the only individual with all of your personal possessions. That indicates that if you were to be taken legal action against, you are the only individual that has any possessions that can be protected. With sole owner responsibility collaborations, you and your partner each very own 100% of business’s properties, while the other possesses absolutely nothing. As for personal possessions, you possess your residence and also all of your individual possessions, while your partner has his or her home and individual properties. If all of your possessions were split up according to this type of collaboration, you would certainly be able to sleep well during the night understanding that your individual liability for financial obligations to your partners is no. As for an LLC, your individual liability for debts of all kinds is double, so unless you wish to be recognized as a LLC owner that owes thousands of thousands of bucks to various creditors, you should probably just form an LLC and hold onto your residence, retired life fund, as well as checking account.
Forming an LLC is not totally devoid of risks, especially if you or your partners are simple “residence cleansers” and also do not have a performance history of effective procedures. There are times when a legal action is submitted against you, either by a private or an entity that you did not produce. In these cases, you can shed everything that you have actually functioned so hard for, including your company as well as personal assets. When you hold a meeting to talk about feasible resolutions to the legal action that will safeguard you and also your companions, never include your residence, retired life, and also checking account because conversation. You might finish up losing whatever that you have actually functioned so hard to acquire, including the fallen short service.
Creating an LLC is reasonably very easy, and it should not cost you way too much in fees. The most vital consider your option of state to register your organization is its service permit, since this will figure out the sort of tax advantages that you appreciate. A number of states limit the quantity of individual liability that organization companions can be held accountable for, and also some limitation the quantity of earnings that they can gain as well. Some states call for that an LLC be signed up on the area level, while others permit you to choose the tax obligation status of your LLC at the time of enrollment. To find out more about the options that you have for tax advantages, take a look at your state federal government site.
Creating an LLC is useful for several local business, since it can offer them the option to divide their individual properties from their organization assets, while still maintaining control over those separate entities. Also for big corporations, who generally run as one massive entity, establishing an LLC (allow’s call it shanty town) enables them to secure themselves from personal responsibility for the activities of any of the subsidiary firms that they have. An LLC is also practical for owners that are constantly altering their company models, since rather of being held accountable for every little thing with the name of their firm, they only need to fret about their individual financial investment accounts.

#PalaceAlbany #PalaceSessionsAbstract
Purpose: To study the magnitude and nature of the wavefront aberrations induced after standard LASIK refractive surgery. To compare the results provided by a modal Zernike polynomial analysis to those obtained with a zonal fitting of the wavefront aberration in eyes after LASIK.
Methods: Ocular wavefront aberrations were measured using our own research prototype near–infrared Hartmann–Shack sensor for a 6 mm pupil diameter, sampled with around 300 microlenses. Measurements were done before and two months after standard LASIK surgery. Three groups of patients with different pre–op refractive errors were included: moderate myopia (n=10), low myopia (n=10) and low hyperopia (n=4). For each eye and condition, wavefront aberrations were analyzed both by using modal fitting to Zernike polynomials up to the 8th order and Fourier–analysis zonal fitting of the wavefront slopes.
Results: The root mean square of aberrations after LASIK was found to be correlated to the pre–op refractive error (r2=0.15). Coma induced by surgery was well correlated (r2=0.39). However, we found a somehow no expected behavior of 4th–order spherical aberration (SA). While subjects with low refractive errors showed a clear correlation of induced SA with pre–op refraction (r2=0.68), this tendency did not hold for the larger myopic subjects (above 5 D). For these subjects, lower than expected values of induced SA were found, while coma consistently increased. The wavefront zonal fitting confirmed these results, excluding the possibility of these results being an artifact of the Zernike modal fitting algorithm for this type of eyes.
Conclusions: We found an increase of aberrations after standard LASIK as previously reported. Induced SA and coma are correlated with pre–op refractive error for a limited range, the SA. However, induced SA in patients with larger myopia was quite small, failing to follow the general tendency. These results were confirmed by Fourier–analysis zonal fitting. The presence of induced coma not secondary to SA can be explained by the overlapping of a portion of the transition zone with the subject’s pupil, caused by ablation decentration.Scripture:
4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you will be like him yourself.
5 Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes.
Proverbs 26:4 & 5 NIV
Observation: King Solomon, in all of his wisdom, has written what I believe to be completely opposite statements of fact. I’m confused!
Application: Vincent, I’m sure there is a perfectly logical explanation and I hope that you can explain. Obviously, if anyone else can shed some light I’d appreciate any enlightenment I can get. I really don’t understand how Solomon can not only author both proverbs but apparently do it in such a way that they must be chronicled back-to-back in this book. Thanks in advance to any and all comments.
Prayer: Father, I don’t know what to say. You are so mysterious sometimes. I really can’t wait to be able to ask you some questions some day. Until then, thank you for your word that sometimes makes us ask each other for help which causes us to grow. Thank you Lord. Amen

P.S. Please take a minute to read the comments section for this blog entry and also follow the link provided by Vincent Murphy in his comment which expounds on his and Pastor Leon’s explanations. It’s good stuff!

4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you will be like him yourself.
5 Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes.
Proverbs 26:4 & 5 NIV
Verse 4 tells us that if we respond to a fool according to his folly, we are stooping to his level. The emphasis on what is happening to me. (A stupid answer to a stupid question shows that one giving the answer is just as stupid as the one asking the question. –note: press conferences with the government spokespersons!)
Verse 5 tells me that if I respond to a fool in like manner, I am like a mirror reflecting his foolishness back to him. If I answer him wisely, he will think that he was wise. If I answer him in foolishness he should be able to see his foolishness in my response. (Sometimes a stupid question needs a stupid answer to show how stupid the question was!)
Verse 4 is emphasizing what happens to me and verse 5 emphasizes what happens to him.
At least this is the way I see it! 🙂
Thank you Pastor Leon. That makes perfect sense. I appreciate it.
Doug
Hi Doug;
I think that what Pastor Leon wrote summed it up really well, according to my limited understanding of the text. What I think we have here is not a contradiction of the text, but a contradiction between what the best choice of action is. This is common in the book of Proverbs – there are many places where the arguments on both sides are given separately. I think it is probably important here to remember what kind of a book Proverbs is; and that whilst it is inspired by God just as all scripture, it is not a book of law laying out commands for man to keep.
The two proverbs illustrate the two sides of the coin, and so being well informed of the consequences of each choice, it is for you to decide what to do. Do you answer him, risking becoming like him yourself, or do you not answer him, risking him growing in his own conceit? If you had just one proverb, then you would make up your mind based on that alone and possibly make a poor choice.
The Rev Hewlett has an excellent discussion on this in his excellent work ‘Bible Difficulties Explained’. Luckily Google has put it online – so you can find it here:
May the Lord be with you and Laurie;
Vincent
I knew that I could get some great guidance if I just asked for it. Thank you Vincent, I appreciate it and I will read what the Reverend Hewlett has to say. Thank you again.

Diel patterns of larval release by five brooding scleractinian corals
Tung-Yung Fan1,2,*, Ke-Han Lin1,3, Fu-Wen Kuo1, Keryea Soong3, Li-Lian Liu3, Lee-Shing Fang1,2
ABSTRACT: Timing of larval release in benthic marine invertebrates plays an important role in determining the reproductive success and extent of larval dispersal. Few studies have been conducted on diel variations in planula release by corals. Five brooding corals Seriatopora hystrix, Stylophora pistillata, Pocillopora damicornis, Euphyllia glabrescens, and Tubastraea aurea in Nanwan Bay, southern Taiwan, were selected to compare diel patterns of planula release. Corals were collected from the field and maintained in outdoor, flow-through systems to quantify the hourly release of planulae. Planulation by S. hystrix and S. pistillata was highly synchronized with 1 peak of planula release occurring close to sunrise. Planulae of P. damicornis and E. glabrescens were released throughout the day, and usually 2 peaks occurred in the early morning and at night. Planulation of the ahermatypic coral T. aurea occurred throughout the day without a consistent peak. The diel cycle of planulation for all 3 pocilloporids and E. glabrescens suggests that the light-dark cycle may be the cue that induces planula release. The majority of planulae of these 4 species being released in the dark might be beneficial for minimizing predation effects. The peak planulation occurring close to sunrise might be advantageous for exploiting light cues after sunrise by mature planulae in order to quickly settle, shortening the time they remain in the water column and promoting settlement within the natal reef. Variations in diel patterns of planula release show that variable strategies of reproductive timing exist for brooding species.

Unhealthy Christians—Healthy Christians
By Lewis Turner
Unhealthy Christians—Those who continually study God’s word but not personally connecting with others. They may be mentally sharp, but not relationally sharp.
Healthy Christians—those who study God’s word and take the time to connect with others through doing things with others, obeying the law of God to love our neighbor as ourselves.
Discussion:
We can do projects for others or WITH others taking a personal interest by working alongside of them. Working with others develops our ability to be relational. It involves many relational skills, which includes listening, eye to eye contact, and other relational skills.
If we take an interest in our daughters developing—we can connect with them—teaching homemaking skills, and other skills needed for them to use in life. They learn interrelationship with others through this connection.
Men, we can take an interest in men’s hobbies and find ways to do things with them—not just a sport game—though that may be a start.
Not taking and interest in people can have detrimental effects. I remember having a depth perception problem, and I did not know it. When I played ball, the balls would hit me in the face as a young child. That made me afraid of balls. That could have been overcome if someone had taken time to help me work through it. Their help would have helped me to learn to compensate for that depth perception problem. In college (A Christian College) I had a college coach laugh at me about it—that laugh killed my interest in sports after that incidence. It has resulted in making it hard for me to take an interest in sports today, and that may possibly hinder my connection with some men even today. They do not understand why I feel as I do. Still, it is a hindrance to overcome. It is important to take time to connect with others.
I remember when as a student in college, I would have some people come to me and say, ‘you are not being yourself’. Those other students did no know who I was. They hardly knew me—how did they know who I was????
The Bible speaks of the concept the poor man searches out. Proverbs 28:11 (KJV)
11 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
–carrying this principle further about the poor man--(the poor may be one that is possibly also poor in heart), we seek for answers when we do not understand.
Perhaps something positive we can do is to make a real effort connect with others.
Here are two more things that I have experienced to help others possibly to consider the seriousness of this issue. Keep in mind that a failure to connect can cause missed opportunities to be in position to help another person.
*I have asked an elder in my church if they knew what I was involved in. They did not. If they as leaders do not know what you are involved in, how can they lead you spiritually?
*It is also important to take the time to listen to a different point a view than ours. We may think ours is RIGHT, but genuinely listening is critical to building relationships. Perhaps our thinking has come from narrow thinking tainted by only one point of view. That can change if we become willing learn by listening. When we listen, we may discover that there are often other views or thoughts on a subject. What we learn may help us relate to a real need somewhere else which can bridge gaps that divide.
In the search for answers, which has taken me a lifetime, I believe God is showing that we need to be involved in interpersonal relationships, showing others that we are personally interested in them. That will give us the opportunity to share our faith with them and challenge them to come to and to grow in Christ—this gives opportunity for ministry and especially prayer ministry to occur.
One way I have found to help with relational issues, is that praying together with others over a long period of time has opened the door to being involved one way or another with them. It has tied us together spiritually, and personally. It gives opportunity to stretch our relational ‘muscle’.
This journal of thoughts on this subject could go on and on. We need to take the time to genuinely want to know how we can connect with others.
When we do not take time to connect with others, we can become as unhealthy Christians, knowing a lot, because we are not giving out to others by involvement with them.
Connecting with others gives opportunity to give out so we can become healthy by our being refreshed when we do. Job 32:20 (KJV) I will speak, that I may be refreshed…
I would like to hear from others on this subject, and how prayer has helped in ministry to others.

Your commentary makes me think of James warning us that faith (and that includes Bible study) without works (love-motivated actions) is dead (useless)...
<![if !IE]>▶<![endif]> Reply
Phil, this in a way is confession from one who has studied and needed a way to give out. Sharing with others is so important, and when we share there is something important that we need to do. It is through listening to those around us that the Lord will help us to find a way to share his love. Listening is a major important step in coming alongside of others. The willingness to take the time to encourage others after we have taken the time to genuinely listen is as one intercessor puts it -so important. True encouragement is not preaching at, but humbly reaching out, letting the love of Christ guide us in our relationship with others.
I have appreciated the forum of Pray.Network. It has giving an opportunity to connect and encourage others. In so doing, I too have received much encouragement.
I am also sensing that the Lord want me to connect with others outside our circle, and am asking the Lord to open those doors. With God’s encouragement and providing the opportunities, we may come to the point where we can also reach out to others and be ready to answer for our faith. Yes, by our action of listening, opportunity may come in interaction with others to find ways to exercise our faith and share it in various ways to help the other person to learn about who God is and that He cares about them.
Those are just some thoughts—reflective thoughts. I would like others to share about prayer, study of God’s Word, and how it is leading to helping us interact with others.

Badges | Report an Issue | Terms of ServiceRecently I had the pleasure of speak with John Scully, who is one of the most respected trainers, boxing analysts and historians in the game. He is now running a stable out of Florida and working on a book based on his life in boxing called The Iceman Diaries, he also trained former light heavyweight champion Chad Dawson. A variety of topics were discussed in this interview, which include the Manny Pacquiao vs Timothy Bradley rematch, the rise of Deontay Wilder, the likely hood of a future Manny Pacquiao vs Floyd Mayweather mega bout, and much more.
Robert Brown: In your opinion does Deontay Wilder’s recent first round KO now confirm his legitimacy as a top contender, can he contend against the likes of Chris Arreola, Bermane Stiverne and even Wladamir Klitschko?
John Scully: I think each of Deontay’s fights have brought him more and more into public consciousness and even though this last one didn’t end without controversy it may have actually gotten his name mentioned even more afterwards. The fact is that with a record like his, even if people don’t believe in him, they are going to tune in to see what all the fuss is about.
With his size and record and power he’s someone to watch, definitely. From strictly the view of a trainer, I would like to see him actually go the distance with someone or be in a tough fight that he wins by late round stoppage before he gets thrown into a fight with the likes of those mentioned in the question.
Robert Brown: Did Danny Garcia just have a bad performance or was he exposed by Mauricio Herrera, who would you like to see Garcia fight next.?
John Scully: I think Danny had a tough fight and showed less than he normally does because not only is it almost impossible to be super sharp and to reach your potential in every fight but he was also in with a very capable guy who had a lot to say about the outcome that night.
Herrera hasn’t gotten enough credit for his showing that night, I think. I think Danny is obviously better than he showed in that fight but Mauricio was part of the reason for that and he deserves his credit.
Robert Brown: How do you see Manny Pacquiao vs. Timothy Bradley playing out, what is your prediction for that fight?
John Scully: I think both guys looked very good last time out, especially Bradley because he really stepped up and showed much more in the way of excellent technical skills and ring generalship than he did in any of his previous fights. I think confidence wise he is on a real high right now and even though I think Pac showed in his last fight to be still be very formidable I also think the timing is right for Bradley to do much, much better than he did in their first fight against each other.
Robert Brown: Is there a strong possibility of more controversy because judges may give close rounds to Manny Pacquiao this time, as a result of the controversy over the decision in the first fight?
John Scully: Definitely there is. People need to realize that all judges are human, they are boxing fans and they are subject to the same biases and influences as anyone else. I would think that, realistically, it takes a particularly focused individual to score a match with absolutely zero percent bias.
Robert Brown: Why do you believe Floyd Mayweather chose Marcos Maidana over Amir Khan? Did he bow to public pressure over criticism surrounding the legitimacy of the Khan fight?
John Scully: I believe that is part of it, yes. I think with is recent win over Broner that Maidana really deserves the fight and finally the right thing was done. Khan will need to build himself back up to where he was before with at least one or two solid wins where he looks very sharp and fights up to his potential again. Marcos earned this fight the old fashioned way and I appreciate Floyd for seeing that and rewarding him with it.
Robert Brown: If Manny Pacquiao fails to get the Victory over Timothy Bradley should he then retire?
John Scully: Well, it’s not for anyone to tell a guy when he should retire but the fact of the matter is that should he lose to Bradley again it would likely kill much of the extreme desire some still have to see him face Floyd again.
The fact is that a fight between Floyd and Pac was at an extremely desirable point three years ago and they let that boat sail unfortunately. It would take a lot from both men to bring it back up to the fever pitch it was at in, say, 2009.
So if he’s not going to face Floyd or if he puts himself into a position where he’s not seen as even having the potential to win such a fight then he would be sort of stuck in the role of just being another guy who isn’t able to beat Floyd. At that point I guess it all depends if you’re happy competing at a level below the ones you are accustomed to being at.
Robert Brown: Can Miguel Cotto carry his power up to 160 and can Sergio Martinez recover from his recent heath issues and poor performance against Martin Murray? Who comes out on top?
John Scully: I don’t think Cotto will be a real puncher in the true sense of the word at 160. He won’t be a massive hitter but I’m sure he will carry enough pop to get a middleweights attention.
Either way, if Sergio is still as sharp and usual I believe his herky jerky movement and style will see him win a comfortable decision over Cotto.
Robert Brown: Paulie Malignaggi vs. Shawn Porter is also set? What is analysis and prediction on that fight?
John Scully: I really, really thought Shawn looked very good in his last fight, very professional and mature. Paulie stepped up very well against Zab, too, so it’s a good fight that I think will tell a lot about how far Shawn has come. Both guys have the potential to defeat the other, I really believe that, but I’ll hold off on an official prediction until we get closer to the match. It’s going to be a good watch for fans to watch, though.
Robert Brown: Why do so many fighters end up with income tax issues?
John Scully: Because most fighters who come into money are guys who never really had money like that until they hit it big as professional fighters. Many guys go their whole lives with no money, struggling to get by, boxing as amateurs for free then for little money early on as pros. So when they suddenly hit it big in the span of a year or so it’s like a shock to them. Spending and upgrading is a thought before taxes are a thought.
You’re 22 years old and suddenly you have 100 times more money than you’ve ever had before in your entire life combined, you’re first thought generally isn’t to put some away so you can give it to the government a few months down the line.
Fighters simply aren’t educated on such matters like, say, a college educated baseball, basketball or football player is in his college years.
Robert Brown: The fact that Manny Pacquiao has not yet resigned with Top Rank and is millions in debt, Does this mean if Manny gets past Timothy Bradley there is higher probability of the mega bout happening with Floyd Mayweather?
John Scully: Well, if he wins against Bradley and is still in big debt with no other way to get out of it, there is only one way to turn in order to wipe that slate clean in one fell swoop. Only a fool wouldn’t jump on that fight but, by the same token, both of these guys have left 40 million each on the table already so there’s no telling what’s going on in the minds of men who would do something like that.
Robert Brown: Tell us about what is going on in your life and is the book finished?
John Scully: I am currently living in Orlando, Florida and at this time I am working with a few prospects from this area, including undefeated middleweight “Phenomenal” Philip Penson and 2-0 light heavyweight Craig “Danger” Duncan.
I also have several other things in the works but I prefer to keep them quiet right now until if and when they do come to actually pass.
“The Iceman Diaries” has been in the making for over ten years now and I know many are very frustrated that I haven’t finished it yet but the fact of the matter is that I have so many things I want to tell in this book that I’m having some trouble editing it and deciding what not to tell. I initially wanted everything in it but that would constitute a book of over one thousand pages! I have a lot to tell and say and I just want to make sure it’s the best possible content that I can deliver.
So it’s not finished yet but I do believe it will be worth the wait to boxing fans and especially to the fighters out there.
Robert Brown: We have the age of Bernard Hopkins Vs the youth and inexperience of Beibut Shumenov, which of these factors is more likely to show itself on the night and as a result who is more likely to prevail?
John Scully: I believe that Hopkins will dictate the pace and the style of the fight as he did against Cloud and most of his other recent opponents. I see it as another distance fight with Bernard winning eight or nine of the rounds. I think his experience will obviously play a huge role
Robert Brown: What do you make of the Adrian Broner – Amir Khan back and forth? Should they fight each other to settle the argument?
John Scully: Honestly, I don’t feel that much interest in any words either of them has for each other. Twitter and Facebook beefs have become sort of foolish now and I don’t really put much stock in them. It’s a pretty transparent way of trying to get yourself into a big fight.
I’d be interested in seeing them fight each other but it would have absolutely nothing at all to do with any type of Internet war of words between them.
Robert Brown: Is there a possibility that Wladamir Klitschko may be distracted as a result of the political and humanitarian crisis in the Ukraine does this have the potential to affect his upcoming title defense against Alex Leapai?
John Scully: Oh, of course it’s a very real possibility. Being involved with politics is no joke, I’m sure. I am sure it takes quite a bit of focus and intensity, just like boxing does. I’m also sure the people who are looking for him to help them in the political arena would expect and want his full attention as do the people involved in his boxing career.
I am not in favour if boxers taking on such important jobs and interests outside of their chosen profession because it’s sort of disrespectful to the title of champion. Being a professional fighter, especially being a world champion, calls for full on focus and commitment. If I was his trainer I would be too happy with his dual career situation.
nah floyd needed that extra money for his next jail appointment after he beat up his former bodyguards for molesting justin bieber
This f***ckin’ Scully,knows nothin’ about Pacquiao….he was just listening to to Gayweather’s gossip…don’t talk somethin’ if your not quit sure….Pacquiao can even buy you hell,Scully, cause he’s one of the richest personality in Asia.
richest personality in asia? lol
Win or losse.debt is not issue..5 yrs ago after dela hoya surrender and hatton 2nd KO he was so scared followed brutal stop cotto.!he was focusing on alibi.!more excuse until manny loose..and debt issue .floyd they can’t trade paquiao power.he has no power all he’s winning is 12 rounds.manny throws more punches than him.this analogy will give floyd low confident.that’s why until now..he was runingggg.
the fag tell the lie
this writer knows nothing about boxing!! do your homework DUMBASS!!
This man Schully is a loser, how come Manny Pacquiao needs that money from a Mayweather fight to pay his taxes, when Pacman challenges Gayweather to donate their income of their fight to a charity. You have no idea how rich Pacquiao is. So you better shut your mouth and hide behind your mother____.
get your fact straight another gayweather payroll for sure.. If Pacquiao is fighting for money how come he even challenge Gayweather to fight for charity.. all money will be given to lucky chosen charity… and what did Gayweather did? nothing scared of losing that ZERO… money is not the issue the problem is gayweather ego… to big to to handle to much to loose pride…
who’s john scully?
…pAcquiao is in debt? scully doesnt know a shit, its all floyd show because this arrogAnt coward has always wanted to discredit pac by sAying stupid unbelievAble things, pac challenged him to fight for charity but floyd has no balls to do it, if he trully believes that he’s great then he should demonstrate it in fists and not by his loud mouth, john scully go to hell!
Y’all are some damn fool. Scully is a former pro boxer, and current trainer for many pro boxers. Former trainer if Chad Dawson. Saying he doesn’t know anything about boxing, yet not knowing who he is, makes you look idiotic.
Not only does he not have to ‘hide’ behind anything, he would slap the taste right out of your mouths with little effort.
You should just concern yourself with boxing and not meddle in people’s debt and personal affairs. Boxing is becoming more like showbusiness because of Floyd and people like Scully. Gossips and rumors.
RELAX people lol. The reporter asked me questions and I answered them. They say Pac is in big debt and I answered as if he was. That’s the word from many media outlets . Do YOU know for sure he isn’t ? I like Pac. I’m just calling it as I see it.
Relax.
All this talk about Pacquiao’s need of a big money and is bankcruft are all false items by mis-informed media, haters and co-horts of the gayweathers. Pacquiao is the biggest landowner in southern Philippines right now. A respected congressman of southern Philippines loved by his own people, floyd gayweather must be oozzzing with envy once he found this oust as his own american people despised him for his ganglike character, cockyness and cherry picking of his opponent. This floyd gayweather will go down in history as the best boxer of his time according to him and his father, who created a lot of hurdles so as not to fight that midget asian named ‘Pacquiao’ for fear of losing.
If Pacquiao have problems with the IRS, I am sure its not a big amount and his promoted and manager can solve it as it is their fault or whatever if this come out. But if its going to be a big money then I am sure, Pacquiao who is not an american citizen is ready to give away whatever properties he have in america as it is not that important to him which I presumed if I am in his shoe. Floyd gayweather cannot do that as he is living here and born american and a citizen of the US.
Pacquiao’s problem with the Philippine taxation is easy to solve, remember he is a congressman there with connections and influence.
So all this talk about Pacquiao’s money problem are all baloney and have no bearing on his need to fight gayweather.
SO WHO NEEDS WHO….Pacquao is not aiming for money now to pay his non-existent problem, Pacquiao fights for legacy, and if legacy is so far-fetched with his fight against gayweather and so be it, Pacquiao will not insist as he is already happy with what he did in his career. Floyd Gayweather fights for two things, 1. big money and 2. Assurance that he will not be beaten by fighting whom he can easily defeat.
FLOYD GAYWEATHER NEEDS PACQUIAO, but he will not do it because of my number two reason.
SO WHO NEEDS WHO WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY….. so Mr. John Scully, next time you write an article, use a little bit of imagination and go from side to side, see all angles and do not be a stupid idiot.
am guessing on or about 90 days after the bout IRS will be knocking at pac’s chamber doors saying “WHERE’S THE REST OF MY MONEY?” hope am wrong.
I didn’t write this article you “stupid idiot” lol…and I find it funny that the big thing each of you is upset about is the reference to his money situation. WHO cares?? I was asked a questions do answered it. Period. Calm yourselves.Feel free to explore the stories below!
Real estate
(July 2020, Pakistan)
When tax reforms of 2020 were introduced which not only reduced the rate of Capital Gains Tax to almost a half, but also the duration for CGT exemption (from 8 to 4 years), Hamid who had recently lost his job decided to invest in real estate. Problem was, although he had some experience in property management (operation, control, maintenance, and oversight of real estate), he wasn’t very good in real estate investment (real estate strategy e.g. correctly predicting how and where prices would go up or down and making all the hard decisions accordingly to gain maximum capital gain). He had some money invested in stocks which he could cash and invest instead in property through REITs or other real estate investment options. However, these investment options wouldn’t allow him to use his property management skills, so he decided to instead enter into a partnership. His friend was a seasoned real estate investor so together they put together a deal. They agreed to invest 50/50 for 50/50 equity but agreed to split any capital gains 60/50 (Hamid getting more for his day-to-day management). To avoid potential disputes, they drew up a comprehensive agreement, detailing the tentative timeframe, (how much time it will take to renovate and sell the house), profit margin (what’s the minimum profit below which they wouldn’t sell that property), and assignment of various tasks and responsibilities. PartnershipXperts helps these kind of partnerships tremendously as the ready-made partnership agreement templates are not only too restrictive in their substance but also very unfriendly in their form due to their excessive emphasis on legalese.
Food
(April 2020, Texas)
Joe worked at a small restaurant of Houston as a senior chef when the Covid struck. He had anticipated the fall and was not shocked when he received his layoff notice. Many restaurants were switching from dine-out to take-away model and he heard that there was an outreach program underway based on donations from Mariano’s (retailer), Sysco (wholesaler) and Allen Brothers (online retailer & wholesaler). He called up Richard, the kitchen manager of his hotel (who also happened to be his friend) to see how others were faring and to catch up on the latest news and opportunities. Among other things, they discussed how some families in their neighborhood have started homeschooling their children for good and how this is requiring parents to spend more time on their children and less in the kitchen. This gave them an idea. They decided to target similar families and provide home delivery food services. They had another mutual friend who had some entrepreneurship experience. They decide to partner with him to sort out the logistics and marketing aspects while these two chefs take care of the operations (cooking, menu making etc.) To formalize their partnership, they looked online for a partnership agreement but didn’t like the ready-made templates as they were too restrictive and jargon-laden. They couldn’t afford an attorney either.
Here, PartnershipXperts enters the picture. It sits right in the middle of expensive yet rudimentary bespoke partnership agreements and free self-drafted ones. We take the burden of drafting a good partnership agreement off the shoulders of fledgling partnerships, so they can focus on the work at hand and don’t get bogged down in the details. We not only save your time now but also prevent disputes later while ensuring a sound business strategy at the same time.
Marketing agency
(July 2020, Pakistan)
Ahmed -a graphic designer- , Bashir -a web developer- and Kamran –a digital marketer- had graduated together and had been freelancing on Fiverr for two years until recently when they finally decided to join hands and start up their own marketing agency. This decision was prompted by two events. One, the increasing surge in demand as businesses and institutes make a move from onsite to online. Two, an entrepreneurship scheme that the government had just launched whereby youth were granted interest-free microfinance. The three friends were already overloaded and had many projects in queue. Everyday they would turn down a bid or two as they were already booked until August. On the outside, the market looked saturated but the insiders knew that the real talent was scarce and that many times a good leadership was all that was needed to resolve the digital market inefficiency. The idea of launching their own agency had been simmering in their mind for some time and was often discussed over coffee, but because they had no or insufficient savings, it was always archived and never executed. Now they had hope, and a path. But there were so many things to do and they were already working 14 hours a day. They had to plan a budget, put together a win-win deal, assign tasks, set up an office, buy and update equipment, register their company, etc, the list just goes on.
PartnershipXperts helps such start ups tremendously by drafting the most comprehensive partnership agreement online. With a 60% discount for small startups like this one, it’s probably the cheapest partnership success recipe handbook to date.

Statement of Problem
Orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) is the definitive therapy for children with cardiac disease; approximately 400 pediatric OHT are performed each year in the U.S. But survival after transplant is limited, and research shows that patient quality of life after transplant is less than their healthy peers.
A child’s transplanted heart usually works well, pumping blood as well as most healthy hearts, and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends no specific exercise-related restrictions for heart transplant recipients. However, children with transplanted hearts have impaired exercise performance and do not exercise as much as their peers. This is concerning, as impaired exercise tolerance is associated with reduced survival, diminished health-related quality of life, and depression and anxiety. Therefore, identifying interventions that positively impact physical activity and promote transplant longevity, like individualized exercise programs, should be a priority for post-transplant care.
However, pediatric cardiac rehabilitation programs are limited and distance to rehabilitation centers may be a barrier to receiving services. Those from racial minority backgrounds and with lower socioeconomic status are also associated with less exercise, increased sedentary behaviors, more unhealthy eating patterns, and higher rates of obesity, underscoring the presence of additional barriers to post-transplant physical health for some of our most vulnerable patients.
These findings emphasize the need to develop accessible, effective interventions to help children after transplant develop a culture of activity.
Description
Through Motivational Interaction Group Heart Transplant Exercise and Education (MIGHTEE), we are studying the feasibility and impact of a 16-week group aerobic training program, delivered remotely via video conferencing, on physical activity and psychological well-being in adolescents after heart transplant. Upon enrollment, we give participants a wearable activity monitor that tracks physical activity. This activity monitor also pairs with the MyHeart application, which serves as a central information portal for study coordinators, participants and their families. Subjects also meet with a transplant psychologist to discuss barriers and motivations to exercise, and to create an exercise-related goal. These goals could include participation in the transplant Olympics, joining a school sports team, or improvement in exercise or physical activity parameters.
After we collect baseline physical activity data and measures of quality of life, participants meet with a cardiac exercise physiologist with experience and training in the care of children with heart disease, who reviews appropriate aerobic training exercises that maintain patients’ heart rates within their target ranges. In groups of 6-10, participants are assigned a 30-minute time frame to meet virtually after school 3 times per week. An exercise physiologist will attend these sessions to interact, encourage, and instruct participants while they complete their assigned aerobic exercises, which include a series of activities that can be performed at home and with minimal equipment.
Each session will be unique and may have different themes, including “80s music” or “Halloween celebration,” measures intended to encourage subjects’ interest and participation. At 4-week intervals, a study psychologist will have virtual meetings with each participant to review progress and perform motivational interviewing.
At the end of the 16-week intervention, we will evaluate MIGHTEE’s feasibility and impact through a series of metrics, which includes a comparison of the participants’ measures of activity and quality of life to their baseline. We will conduct structured interviews with participants and their families to gain feedback that we will use to refine and improve further iterations of the program.
Next Steps
We hope that this project will offer novel information about the ways in which collaborative methods, wearable technology and virtual platforms can be used to improve the care of pediatric heart transplant recipients. We anticipate that the approach described in this study will increase the accessibility of cardiac rehabilitation programs to traditionally underrepresented patient populations, and will provide the foundation for larger-scale, multi-center studies of heart transplant recipients.
Our ultimate goal is that this methodology can be extended to enhance the care provided to children with a wide range of diseases, both cardiac and otherwise, leveraging the known benefits of physical activity to improve outcomes and quality of life.

Can I claim compensation for VW emissions?
Owners of Volkswagens, Audis and Skodas affected by the diesel emissions cheating scandal of 2015 may be entitled to compensation as a result of class actions brought by law firms Maurice Blackburn and Bannister Law.
What did VW get in trouble for?
In April 2017, a US federal judge ordered Volkswagen to pay a $2.8 billion criminal fine for “rigging diesel-powered vehicles to cheat on government emissions tests”. The “unprecedented” plea deal formalized the punishment which Volkswagen had agreed to.
How did VW get caught cheating on emissions?
Volkswagen was caught by independent testing carried out by a clean-air advocacy group, The International Council on Clean Transportation, which tested the cars because it thought they were such a great example of how diesel could be a clean fuel.
How did the culture of Volkswagen create the ethical scandal?
he culture of working smarter not harder for Volkswagen seemed to create this ethical scandal. In this case, the advancement of technology helped feed the culture of working smarter not harder when Volkswagen created a defeat device to meet standards and regulations for emission tests in their testing labs.
Who is responsible for the Volkswagen scandal?
Former Volkswagen CEO Indicted Over Emissions Testing Scandal : The Two-Way A U.S. grand jury has charged Martin Winterkorn, VW’s former CEO and five other ex-executives on felony charges of conspiracy. In 2015, VW admitted installing cheat devices in its diesel vehicles.
How does Volkswagen recover scandal?
To push through the public relations nightmare and regain sales traction following their 2015 emissions testing scandal, Volkswagen embarked on a four-step process that centered on four key words: Replace, Restructure, Redevelop and Rebrand.
Should I buy a Dieselgate VW?.
Why is Volkswagen so successful?
VW has come a long way from its roots in wartime Germany, in no small part due to its international focus and highly localized marketing strategy. The company’s success has been propelled by soaring sales in China which now accounts for a third of its revenue.
Has Volkswagen recovered?
Volkswagen is still recovering from the financial damage that occurred after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accused the carmaker in 2015 of illegally cloaking poisonous emissions for almost a decade.
Why does Volkswagen have a bad reputation?.
Can Volkswagen be trusted?
While the company and the companies under its wide umbrella may have been criticised for its involvement in the 2015 emissions scandal, something that it is still paying for, Volkswagen’s reliability is rarely thrown into question. The assumption is that because it’s a German car, it’s going to be reliable.
Is Audi more reliable than VW?
Winner: Audi Audi has an average safety score of 9.7, as calculated from the brands’ 2017 models, while VW has an average safety score of 9.2..
Are Audis more expensive to repair than VW?
Audi is a bit more expensive, a front bumper for an cheap Audi is 15% more expensive than the VW one for example. Now Mercedes and BMW are both more expensive than the VW, Audi. They are 15–50% more expensive in almost everything...
How long do Volkswagen engines last?
For instance, in 2009, the lifetime of vehicles was placed at an average of 9.4 years; this increased to 10.8 years in 2013 and 11.. In essence, old Passat cars have an average lifespan of 6.4 years while the modern cars models have an engine lifespan of 10.5 years.
Should I buy a Volkswagen or Toyota?
Volkswagen is manufacturing good cars without a doubt, but they are a little expensive as compared to Toyota. If you are looking for more driver comfort, high-speed stability with more fun then go for VW.
Is Volkswagen more reliable than Toyota?
Toyota and Volkswagen in this day and age, are almost equal in terms of reliability. The only difference is that, Toyota cars last longer, and have more durability. Whilst Volkswagen cars are tanks, they’re solid build, you feel like it’s serious business, that too Volkswagen cars tend to be very practical.
Is Volkswagen bigger than Toyota?
Volkswagen Group has long been the largest automaker in Europe. As of 2007 it edged out Ford to rank third in the world after General Motors and Toyota. It is also the parent group of Audi, Porsche, SEAT, Škoda, Bugatti, Lamborghini and Bentley.A:

_2<<Meet Austin, an aerospace engineering senior, who chose to study abroad during spring break with the Burnett Honors College. This engineering-based trip counts for a technical elective and gives you access the industry leaders at aerospace conglomerate, Embraer.
Why He Chose to Study Abroad
“I’m Austin Searles, an aerospace engineering senior, I’m graduating this May. I transferred here from FSCJ, and I’ve been here now for about three years. I had never considered doing study abroad before. I just thought…I’m very focused on graduation, I’m very career oriented, I want to get my degree as fast as possible and get out of here. That’s what really attracted me to this program – it was a study abroad, but not for an entire semester or a prohibitive amount of time. It was the perfect opportunity to get engineering experience, a technical elective, and to have fun in a foreign country. I don’t think there are a lot of study abroad programs that offer that.
We had a class staring in January that involved learning contemporary manufacturing methods and several classes leading up to the trip that usually met weekly. In addition to the classes, we had several trips to manufacturing facilities here in Florida, including a couple of different trips to Embraer’s Melbourne facility. We also went to the Piper facility in Vero Beach, and to the regional airport to meet with a local pilot where we toured his plane. We did this in preparation for our big trip to Brazil where we were to tour several Embraer facilities.
.” -Austin Searles
The Journey Through São Paulo
The trip was over spring break, so it was about 10 days long. We arrived in São Paulo, and we got to visit several cultural tourist attractions. From there we went to little city called Botucatu – Embraer has a facility there. We got to see their pre-assembly – they have manufacturing lines for several of their aircraft there. After that, we went to Campinas to meet with a professor of aeronautics, where he gave a lecture about aeroacoustics. Next, we went to São José dos Campos, which is where Embraer has its main facility and headquarters – that’s where they have final assembly for most of their aircraft. They have their commercial line and executive line, and we got to see the process from start to finish – from the sheet metal being pressed, all the way up to the final assembly of the aircraft. That was actually my favorite part of the trip – seeing their commercial line.
On the weekend, there weren’t any manufacturing facilities open, so we went to Camburi Beach, which is this little beach town on the coast of São Paulo. It was a really cool cultural experience – I lived in Brazil for 2 years, so it was interesting to see it from a different perspective. While we were at the facility in São José dos Campos we also got to see a master’s program they have called PEE [in partnership with the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica], where they mimic the design process at Embraer. It begins with a challenge to research and develop a completely new design for an aircraft. They have to go through aerodynamic definition, manufacturability, and all other aspects that go into the design, and present their aircraft as their final. It was really cool to see what happens in the real industry – something that I personally had never experienced before. We also got to see the National Institute for Space Research and tour their facilities – at the time they were collaborating with a few other nation-states on satellites. We saw a lot in the short amount of time!
Making Connections
It was also really cool to be with Dr. Ali Gordon for the full 10 days. You’re usually so limited in interactions with professors, but to be able to constantly have Dr. Gordon’s ear to bounce around ideas and talk about the industry and make a real friendship out of it was a really unique experience. Dr. Gordon’s awesome.
After the trip, Dr. Gordon selected a few of us to present a project to a panel of engineers at the Melbourne location. For my project, I wanted to mimic what they did in the PEE program. I created a design for an electric air taxi, I created the aerodynamic definition on solidworks, and I basically went through the steps of research and design and investigated existing technology. I created a rough concept sketch and a manufacturing flow based on what I learned from the facility visits. I got to present that to the managers at the facility in Melbourne, so that was pretty cool.
I got a lot of connections at Embraer and Piper – all of these real-world industry connections that we wouldn’t normally get, as students. Unless you do an internship or research, you don’t get a lot of real-world experience in the classroom. During the trip, there was a lot of networking going on, which I appreciated, especially going into graduation.
Most of the classes in aerospace engineering are so specific, it’s hard to get the full scope of ‘what is aerospace engineering?’ Visiting these facilities really opened my eyes to the expanse of aerospace – it is a MASSIVE operation. Even the smaller companies, like Piper, the amount of engineers and manpower that goes into a small aircraft are just astounding to me. There’s just so much from all the courses that we’ve learned that we’re drawing upon and combining into teams of hundreds of engineers to build a single product. It was really cool to see engineering in practice, and this was actually my favorite class. To be able to touch engineering and see it in industry practice was great, because in class we get so far down into the nitty gritty of engineering that we lose sight of what we’re going for and what we’re passionate about, and for me, that’s aerospace.”The perfect gift for activity based play.

Publication: Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume: 17 Issue: 81
By:
On May 31, Russian security forces killed two alleged militants in the suburbs of the Ingushetian city of Sunzha, in an area where officials had introduced a counter-terrorism operation regime. The Russian National Antiterrorist Committee reported that the suspects were surrounded in an uninhabited building. After the presumed militants declined an offer to surrender, the government forces killed them. Video footage available on the website of the government agency shows intense shooting with what seems to be a heavy machine gun at a sizeable one-story building, which catches fire and burns. The shooting apparently happened in close vicinity to a local residential area. Scores of Federal Security Service (FSB) members sheltering behind an armored personnel carrier (APC) are shown at the site. After the special operation concluded, officials alleged that the killed militants had been planning terrorist attacks. The official video also shows a heavy machine gun presumably owned by the rebels. Additionally, the service members reportedly found an improvised explosive device (IED) (Nac.gov.ru, May 30).
Civil and human rights activists in Ingushetia said that the authorities’ explanation for the killing of the alleged militants is dubious because officials provided no proof to legitimate their actions. Indeed, the website of the National Antiterrorist Committee does not even mention what radical organization the presumed militants were affiliated with—usually, it is either the Islamic State or (more rarely) the Caucasus Emirate. The two killed individuals were identified as Magomed Ozdoev and Bilan Mereshkov. Reportedly, Ozdoev had previously served in the Russian border guard forces, which are part of the FSB. Later, he left the service and became a small-business entrepreneur. His friends remember him as a quiet and decent family man, who had two or three children. They also said that Ozdoev was religious, but they did not notice him espousing any sympathies for radicals. Local rights activists additionally pointed to inconsistencies in the official accounts of what happened in Sunzha. First of all, there is no information as to why the security services thought that the killed individuals were rebels in the first place. Second, back in 2017, the authorities in Ingushetia stated that the insurgency in the republic had been uprooted. Activists, thus, question why and how new rebel cells formed, if they indeed did so. “Sleeper cells of the Caucasus Emirate” are only a pretext for militarizing the region, some rights activists argued (Kavkazsky Uzel, June 1).
Reports from Ingushetia suggest that the local police were kept out of the special operation in Sunzha. Russian authorities have habitually distrusted local police enforcements, preferring to rely on the FSB. Local sources in the police, meanwhile, asserted that Moscow regularly exaggerates the presence of rebel “sleeper cells,” while turning a blind eye to more serious security threats. Notably, several people died in a shooting in Ingushetia in recent days, as members of one of the local religious orders turned against one another (TASS, June 1).
Another ambiguous counter-insurgency operation last month took place in Dagestan. On May 22, Russian government forces killed six suspected rebels in the forested area near the village of Goksuv, in the republic’s Khasavyurt district. The killed individuals presumably were affiliated with the Islamic State. One member of the Russian National Guard was also wounded in the clash. According to official sources, the suspects had planned to carry out attacks against the police and religious figures as well as to extort money from local businesses. The government forces used a helicopter and other heavy machinery to kill the alleged militants (Nac.gov.ru, May 22). The killed individuals were identified as residents of a Kumyk village of Endirei, in Khasavyurt district; however, until recently, all of them had resided in Moscow. They were also all quite young—19 or 20 years old. Officials purported that the youths had returned to Dagestan to carry out attacks. When the security forces reportedly blocked the rebels, they were offered the chance to surrender but refused. The suspects were allegedly amateur militants, used bicycles to get around, and were easily identified (Kommersant, May 22).
Russian security services veterans told reporters that special operations in the North Caucasus are regularly carried out under orders to kill all rebel suspects without taking captives. Residents of the same Dagestani village as that of the six killed young men said they were baffled by the events. If the official version is true, it means that young Kumyks from Dagestan went to Moscow for work, radicalized there, and returned to start a militant organization (Kavkazsky Uzel, May 30). When individuals from the North Caucasus go to Moscow or other predominantly ethnic-Russian-populated areas of the Russian Federation, they are often discriminated against on the basis of their ethnicity and religion. Perhaps, the six residents of Endirei simultaneously radicalized while in Moscow due to some mistreatment. But if the authorities were aware of these youths’ radicalization, and if their alleged conspiracy was, indeed, so downright amateurish, it is unclear why the youngsters were not simply intercepted and placed under arrest.
Though Russian officials continue to report on killing “bandits” in the North Caucasus, they consistently fail to provide any substantial proof for the seriousness of their suspicions. The lack of transparency from the authorities then leads to both human rights activists and onlookers automatically placing all blame for violence on the government. Despite the proclaimed victory over the insurgency in the North Caucasus, the security services still somehow discover new rebels over and over again. Either the government authorities were overly optimistic about their declared final triumph, or the security services are engaging in self-serving and self-perpetuating activities so as to continue receiving resources and power from the state.Abstract Phaeocystis antarctica was an important component of surface communities (slush and surface ponds) where its acclimation to high light may precondition it to seed phytoplankton blooms after the sea ice melts in spring.
Introduction
Over the course of an annual cycle, the sea ice that forms on the surface of polar oceans extends over an area of 15-22 × 106 km2. This enormous surface area ranks sea ice as one of the most expansive ecosystems on Earth, covering approximately 4.1–6.1% of the surface area of the global ocean (Arrigo, 2014). Much of this ice is found in the Southern Hemisphere, expanding in size around the continent of Antarctica from a minimum extent of 3 × 106 km2 in February to a maximum area of 19 × 106 km2 in September. Sea ice ecosystems are home to a diverse community of bacteria, archaea, microalgae, protists, and metazoan grazers within the numerous microhabitats that are formed during its lifetime.
Sea ice microbial communities grow best in microhabitats that are in close proximity to seawater nutrients and receive enough light for net microalgal photosynthesis. Microhabitats within Antarctic pack ice inhabited by ice microalgae include surface melt ponds, slush (melted or flooded snow at the surface of the ice), gap layers, internal ice, and bottom ice (Legendre et al., 1992). Surface ponds form either when snowmelt collects in discrete ponds on the surface of relatively flat ice (melt ponds) or when the ice surface is forced below the freeboard level due to ice rafting or snow loading and becomes flooded with seawater (deformation ponds). While melt ponds usually contain relatively little biomass owing to their low nutrient concentrations, deformation ponds can support high algal biomass (Garrison et al., 2003). Internal layers of relatively solid undeformed ice are generally the most inhospitable habitats for microbial life in sea ice. While these layers often receive ample light, they can be very cold with brine salinities too high for microalgal growth (Arrigo and Sullivan, 1992) and brine volumes too low for adequate nutrient exchange (Golden et al., 1998, 2007; Garrison et al., 2003). When the skeletal layer (the actively growing region at the base of growing sea ice) is present, bottom ice is often the most biologically productive sea ice habitat owing to its ubiquity, proximity to seawater nutrients, and mild temperature and salinity gradients (Grossi et al., 1987).
Sea ice communities are responsible for a small but important fraction of total primary production in Southern Ocean waters (Arrigo et al., 1997, 2008; Lizotte, 2001). They provide food for protists, ctenophores, annelids, and a variety of crustaceans, including copepods and euphausiids (Garrison and Buck, 1989; Daly, 1990; Gowing and Garrison, 1992; Guglielmo et al., 2007; Kiko et al., 2008; Caron and Gast, 2010). In particular, high krill densities have been observed beneath the ice throughout the year as they feed on microalgae within and at the base of the sea ice (Flores et al., 2011, 2012).
As the sea ice melts, the microbial community is rapidly released as a large pulse into surface waters (Grossi et al., 1987; Suzuki et al., 2001; Juul-Pedersen et al., 2008). Some of the algal cells can provide seed stock for phytoplankton blooms at the receding ice edge (Haecky et al., 1998; Mangoni et al., 2009). Much of the remaining biomass is eaten by pelagic grazers as it sinks through the water column (Brown and Belt, 2012). Ice algal food is rich in polyunsaturated and other essential fatty acids (McMahon et al., 2006; Søreide et al., 2010) that are necessary for zooplankton growth and reproduction. Uneaten ice microalgae can settle on the seafloor and are consumed by benthic invertebrates (Ratkova and Wassmann, 2005; Boetius et al., 2013). Ice microalgae are often enriched in 13C relative to pelagic phytoplankton (Rau et al., 1991) and their 13C signatures have been used to assess the proportion of sea ice microalgae in the diet of benthic invertebrates (Wing et al., 2012).
Although the number of observations of sea ice microbial communities has increased in recent years, there are still large areas around the Antarctic for which few samples are available. These include the south Pacific and south Indian oceans and the Amundsen Sea (Meiners et al., 2012). Here we present results of a study of sea ice algal biomass and physiology along a 17-station transect from the Amundsen Sea to the Ross Sea (Figure 1). The focus of the study was to assess spatial variability in ice algal biomass and determine what factors control their distributions. We were also interested in investigating how ice algal physiology varied in different microhabitats within the ice, in part to better understand how this fragile ecosystem might respond to future changes in sea ice conditions.

Methods
Samples were collected from the Swedish icebreaker Oden along a roughly zonal transect extending from approximately 100°W to 166°E (Figure 1). Sea ice was sampled between 16 December 2010 and 10 January 2011 by deployment of personnel directly onto the ice pack. Sea ice samples were obtained using a SIPRE corer (0.076 m interior diameter). Ice cores longer than 0.2 m were sectioned at 0.1 to 0.2 m intervals and each segment was placed in individual labeled polyethylene bags. Slush and surface ponds were sampled by scooping a known volume into 4 L dark polyethelene containers and processed immediately upon return to the ship.
All sea ice samples were stored in a thermally insulated cooler until they could be processed. Once onboard (within 1 h of collection) a sufficient quantity of 0.2 µm-filtered seawater was added to each ice core section to maintain salinity > 28 (to minimize osmotic shock to the microbial community), and the samples were allowed to melt in the dark (< 24 hr) prior to further analysis. No seawater was added to surface pond or slush samples. The exact quantity of seawater added to the ice sections was recorded so that concentrations of solutes could be corrected to their undiluted values. Comparison of stored samples with samples that were processed immediately after collection showed that there was little change in physiology or pigment composition resulting from this treatment. Water column samples were collected from 1–2 m below the bottom of the ice using a bilge pump.
Snow and ice thickness
Before drilling ice cores, snow thickness was measured by inserting a ruler through the snow to the snow/ice interface. At least four holes (usually spaced 1 m apart) were drilled at each sea ice station for determination of sea ice thickness. A tape measure attached to the center of a brass rod was inserted into each hole, and the tape was pulled tight until the brass rod held securely to the bottom sea ice surface. The thickness was then read off the tape measure at the snow/ice interface. The mean ice and snow thickness for each station was calculated by averaging the thickness at all core locations at that station.
Sea ice salinity and temperature
The temperature of each ice core section was measured by inserting the tip of a digital temperature probe (Corning Science Products) approximately 0.01 m into the ice. The reading was taken after the temperature had stabilized (ca. 10 s). Sea ice salinity for each core section was measured using a refractometer (accuracy 1 ppt) after ice core sections had melted and were corrected for seawater dilution.
Pigments, POC, PON, δ13C, and δ15N analyses
Pigments
Samples for fluorometric analysis of chlorophyll a (Chl a) were filtered onto 25 mm Whatman GF/F filters (nominal pore size 0.7 µm), placed in 5 mL of 90% acetone, and extracted in the dark at 3ºC for 24 hrs. Chl a was measured fluorometrically (Holm-Hansen et al., 1965) using a Turner 10-AU fluorometer (Turner Designs, Inc.). The fluorometer was calibrated using a pure Chl a standard (Sigma). For samples of relatively high biomass, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of pigment composition, including chlorophylls, phaeopigments, and carotenoids, was performed using the method of Wright et al. (1991) as described in DiTullio and Smith (1996).
Fluorometric Chl a concentrations generally exceed those measured by HPLC by ∼ 50%. Because we only conducted HPLC analyses on a subset of the total samples, all Chl a concentrations reported here were measured fluorometrically. Pigment ratios, however, were determined from HPLC data.
Particulate organic carbon and nitrogen
Particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) samples were collected by filtering water onto pre-combusted (450°C for 4 hrs) 25 mm Whatman GF/F filters. Filter blanks were produced by passing ∼50 ml of 0.2 µm filtered seawater through a GF/F. All filters were then immediately dried at 60°C and stored dry until analysis. Prior to analysis, samples and blanks were fumed with concentrated HCl, dried at 60°C and packed into tin capsules (Costech Analytical Technologies, Inc.) for elemental analysis on a Elementar Vario EL Cube (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany) interfaced to a PDZ Europa 20–20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Sercon Ltd., Cheshire, UK). Standards included peach leaves and glutamic acid. The stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes of POC and PON in high biomass samples were simultaneously measured using the elemental analyzer and mass spectrometer system. Isotopic compositions were calibrated against the NBS-21 and IAEA-N1 standards that were run before and after each set of analyses. Isotopic reproducibility was on the order of 0.11‰.
Sea ice algal photophysiology
Photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-E) relationships for microalgae released from their sea ice matrix were determined using a modification of the 14C-bicarbonate technique of Lewis and Smith (1983) as described by Arrigo et al. (2010a). Microalgae were inoculated with 0.925 MBq 14C-bicarbonate and each 2 ml aliquot was exposed to one of 20 irradiances ranging from <1 to >500 µmol photons m2 s-1 for one hour at 0.0±0.5°C. The DIC concentration used to calculate C-uptake rates was measured as described in Tortell et al. (2012). The photosynthetic parameters P*m (maximum photosynthetic rate, mg C mg-1 Chl a hr-1) and α* (photosynthetic efficiency, mg C mg-1 Chl a hr-1 (µmol photons m-2 s-1) -1) were calculated by normalizing uptake rates to fluorometric Chl a concentration; values were estimated from a fit of P-E data to the equation of Platt et al. (1980). The photoacclimation index (Ek, µmol photons m-2 s-1) was calculated as P*m/α*.
The particle absorption coefficient (ap) from 300 to 800 nm was determined spectrophotometrically (Perkin Elmer Lambda 18 with a RSA-PE-18 integrating sphere) on fresh samples by collecting particles onto a 25 mm filter (Whatman GF/F) and measuring its optical density relative to a blank reference filter. Spectral absorption coefficients were calculated as described in Mitchell (1990). Following measurement of ap, sample filters were extracted in 90% methanol and re-measured to yield detrital absorption (ad). Microalgal absorption (aph) was determined by difference as aph = ap – ad. Chl a-specific microalgal absorption (aph*) was calculated as aph/Chl a, where Chl a was determined fluorometrically.
Although light levels within and beneath the ice were not measured during this project, the potential light environment for each microhabitat was characterized by calculating a light index based on the amount of overlying sea ice and snow. Because snow attenuates light approximately 10-fold higher than sea ice, a simple metric was produced wherein the light index was set to 1/(10 · snow thickness + ice thickness). For interior communities, only the amount of ice above the community (rather than total ice thickness) was used in the calculation. Based on this simple metric, microhabitats were classified from high to low light as surface pond, slush, high light interior ice, low light interior ice, bottom ice, under-ice high light, and under-ice low light.
Results
Snow
Snow thickness varied considerably throughout the study region, averaging 0.30 ± 0.24 m. Snow cover along our transect ranged from virtually snow free conditions in a few locations to snow cover as thick as 0.82 m (Table 1). In general, snow was thickest along the eastern section of the transect, averaging 0.42 ± 0.22 m, and much thinner to the west of 130°W (0.08 ± 0.07 m). There was no apparent relationship between ice thickness and snow thickness for the stations we sampled. Six of the 17 stations sampled (2, 3, 27, 30, 31, and 41) had slush layers between the snow and ice. These stations had the thickest snow cover, suggesting that slush formation was primarily due to surface flooding as the thick snow cover forced the surface of the ice below freeboard.
Temperature and salinity (mean ± standard deviation) are vertical averages within the ice core; Chl a, POC, and PON are vertical integrals from the top to the bottom of the core.
Sea ice
Most of the sea ice sampled during this study was first year ice that ranged in thickness from 0.65 m to 2.26 m (Table 1) and averaged 1.47 ± 0.76 m. The lone exception was at station 42, located along the eastern side of the Ross Ice Shelf, where multiyear ice nearly 4 m thick was observed. Ice thickness increased from 0.66 m along the northern ice edge (station 1) to 1.31 m at the interior of the pack (station 4), in conjunction with the increase in sea ice concentration (Figure 1). However, within the interior of the ice pack, there was no apparent spatial pattern in sea ice thickness distribution.
Due to our sampling in early summer, the ice pack was largely isothermal and near the freezing point of seawater at the time of sampling, with the vertically-averaged ice core temperature at all but one station ranging from –0.23°C to –1.92°C (Table 1). The single exception was at the multiyear ice station 42 where the vertically-averaged temperature of this extremely thick ice was substantially colder at –4.50°C. The skeletal layer was generally but not always present.
The bulk salinity of sea ice sampled during our study averaged 5.07 ± 1.61, with significantly higher salinity on the eastern portion of the transect. East of 130°W, bulk salinity averaged 5.70 ± 1.66, while to the west, bulk salinity averaged only 3.90 ± 0.54. There was no significant relationship between mean bulk sea ice salinity and either temperature, snow thickness, or sea ice thickness at a given station.
The salinity of surface ponds, which were generally less than 0.2 m deep, averaged 20.0 ± 2.8. Slush layers were approximately 0.05 m thick with a mean bulk salinity of 26.3 ± 7.3. These relatively high salinities compared to bulk sea ice salinity suggest that seawater was infiltrating the surface of the ice, due either to surface flooding or percolation through the ice. Temperatures of both melt ponds and slush layers were just above the freezing point.
Depth-integrated microalgal biomass
Chlorophyll a
Depth-integrated Chl a biomass in sea ice ranged from 1.80 to 72.2 mg m-2 during our study, averaging 17.3 ± 17.8 mg m-2 (Table 1). The highest values were concentrated in the region of the Amundsen Sea between 113°W and 118°W (Figure 1, Table 1). Interestingly, depth-integrated Chl a was significantly positively correlated with snow depth (Figure 2a) but not with the ratio of snow depth:ice thickness (not shown), with the four stations with the highest algal biomass also having the thickest snow cover (Table 1). Thicker snow was also associated with the depth of the microalgal biomass maximum that was nearer the sea ice surface (Table 1). There was no apparent relationship between sea ice thickness and Chl a biomass (Figure 2b)..
Particulate organic carbon
The mean depth-integrated POC within the sea ice during our study was 2041 ± 687 mg m-2. Total POC varied from 822 mg m-2 in the thin ice at the northern ice edge to 3211 mg m-2 in the interior of the pack at station 4 (Table 1), which also had the highest depth-integrated Chl a concentration. POC was positively, but non-linearly, correlated with Chl a (Figure 3a), rising rapidly at Chl a values below 20 mg m-2 and then rising more slowly at higher levels of Chl a. Unlike Chl a, depth-integrated POC exhibited no statistically significant relationship with either snow depth (Figure 2c) or ice thickness (Figure 2d).

Particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration versus (a) chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration (POC = 570.09 ln(Chl a) + 645.18, n = 16) and (b) particulate organic nitrogen (PON) concentration in sea ice.
The depth-integrated POC/Chl a ratio averaged 214.1 ± 191 (g:g) throughout the study region. Values ranged from 44.5 at station 4, where the ice algal bloom was most intense, to 852 at station 43, which had very low Chl a accumulation despite a moderate amount of POC. The POC/Chl a ratio was significantly negatively correlated with snow depth (Figure 2e) but exhibited no apparent relationship with sea ice thickness (Figure 2f).
Particulate organic nitrogen
Depth-integrated PON averaged 266 ± 151 mg m-2 in our study area, ranging from 97.1 mg m-2 at the northern ice edge to 599 mg m-2 at station 4 within the interior of the ice pack (Table 1). Depth-integrated PON was highly correlated with POC (Figure 3b), with the POC/PON ratio averaging 8.72 ± 2.76 within our study region. Like Chl a, PON was positively correlated with snow depth but exhibited no statistically significant relationship with ice thickness. Because of the positive correlation between snow depth and PON, the POC/PON ratio was significantly negatively correlated with snow depth (Figure 2g) and exhibited no relationship with ice thickness (Figure 2h).
Microalgal physiology
Many assays used to characterize algal physiology require an ample supply of algal biomass to produce a measurable biological signal. Because algal biomass is often heterogeneously distributed within an individual sea ice core, we could best measure algal pigments and physiological properties on those sections of each ice core that had a sufficient amount of algal biomass. Therefore, the values reported below do not reflect averages over the entire core, but are indicative of values in microhabitats where ice microalgae were most prevalent. In descending order of incident light intensity (estimated as described in the methods), the microhabitats sampled in this study include surface pond, slush, high light interior ice, low light interior ice, bottom ice, under-ice high light, and under-ice low light. The stations used to quantify algal pigment ratios and physiology in each microhabitat are given in Table 2.

Microhabitats are ordered from highest light to lowest, based on light index described in the Methods
Pigment concentrations
The concentration of Chl a associated with microalgal blooms in sea ice microhabitats was greatest in deformation ponds (105 ± 116 mg m-3) and within the low light interior ice (111 ± 127 mg m-3) (Table 2). Surprisingly, Chl a concentrations were substantially lower in the bottom ice and in slush associated with surface flooding (20–30 mg Chl a m-3), two habitats that typically support high microalgal biomass. Maximum Chl a concentrations in sea ice were more than 40-fold higher than Chl a concentrations measured in the under-ice water (2.2–2.5 mg m-3). The concentrations of both phaeopigments (fluorometry) and the sum of Chl a allomer and epimer, chlorophyllide a, monovinyl-chlorophyllide a, pheophorbide a and pheophytin a (HPLC) in sea ice habitats were generally 2–8% of Chl a concentrations, indicating that little degradation of Chl a had taken place by the time of sampling.
Fucoxanthin (Fuco), a photosynthetic accessory pigment associated primarily with diatoms in sea ice, varied markedly within the various microhabitats when normalized by Chl a concentration (Table 2). Consistent with the role of fucoxanthin in light harvesting, the Fuco/Chl a ratio was highest in low light environments such as the bottom ice and low light interior ice (Table 2). The lowest Fuco/Chl a ratios were measured in deformation ponds and in high light under-ice environments.
The concentration of the xanthophyll cycle pigments diatoxanthin (DT) and diadinoxanthin (DD), which are used by microalgae for photoprotection against excessive irradiance, were also measured in the sea ice (Table 2). In contrast to the photosynthetic pigment fucoxanthin, the ratio (g:g) of DD+DT to Chl a was greatly elevated in the environments with the highest light levels, including deformation ponds (0.30) and slush layers (0.15). Interior ice and bottom ice, as well as at the under-ice water column, all exhibited relatively low (DD + DT)/Chl a ratios ranging from 0.04 to 0.08 (Table 2).
Finally, the photosynthetic accessory pigment 19′-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (19-Hex), which has been confirmed microscopically to be an effective marker pigment in the Southern Ocean to identify Phaeocystis antarctica in both the water column and the sea ice (Arrigo et al., 1999, 2002, 2003), also varied considerably with sea ice habitat (Table 2). The 19-Hex/Chl a ratio (g:g) was highest in microhabitats within the upper ice, such as deformation ponds, slush layers, and high light interior ice, and lowest in bottom ice. This vertical pattern suggests that Phaeocystis antarctica grows best in regions of the ice that receive the most light.
POC, PON, and isotopic ratios
POC concentrations ranged from an average of 1354 ± 869 mg m-3 in ice algal blooms associated with bottom ice to 9304 ± 5811 mg m-3 in ice algal blooms associated with deformation ponds (Table 3). These values are 13–90-fold higher than POC concentrations measured in the under-ice water column. PON showed a similar vertical distribution, with bloom concentrations being greatest in both low light interior ice (1179 mg m-3) and deformation ponds (1032 mg m-3) and lowest in bottom ice (210 mg m-3). Like both Chl a and POC, bloom values for PON in sea ice were substantially higher (6 to 33-fold) than in the under-ice water column.
Microhabitats are ordered from highest light to lowest, based on light index described in the Methods.
POC/PON ratios in sea ice algal blooms ranged from 5.5 to 9.2 (Table 3) and tended to be higher in high light environments located closer to the sea ice surface (e.g., surface pond, slush, and high light interior). Values in sea ice were much greater than those measured in the under-ice water column (POC/PON = 2.4–3.2).
δ13C of particulate matter in sea ice ranged from -21.8 to -14.3 ‰. 13C enrichment of POC was significantly positively correlated with POC concentration (Figure 4), indicating higher levels of enrichment at higher levels of ice algal biomass. There was no such correlation between δ15N of particulate matter and algal biomass, although 15N was significantly enriched in sea ice environments compared to the under-ice water column (Table 3).

Photosynthetic parameters
Maximum light-saturated photosynthetic rates (P*m) among the sea ice microhabitats were greatest in the slush layers, bottom ice, and deformation ponds and lowest in interior ice (Table 4). Maximum values for P*m in sea ice were not as high as those measured in the under-ice water column, the latter of which were also more highly variable. Photosynthetic efficiency (α*) was highest in the bottom ice, exceeding values in other sea ice habitats by a factor of 3–10. Values for α* in both the high light and low light interior ice were by far the lowest of any habitat sampled. The photoacclimation parameter Ek varied from 20 to 96 µmol photons m-2 s-1 and was highest in habitats nearer the sea ice surface and declined with depth within the ice (Table 4). The highest values for Ek in the sea ice were greater than the highest values measured in the under-ice water column.
P*m = mg C mg-1 Chl a hr-1, α* = mg C mg-1 Chl a hr-1 (µmol photons m-2 s-1)-1, Ek = µmol photons m-2 s-1, MAA peak = m2 mg-1 Chl a Microhabitats are ordered from highest light to lowest, based on light index described in the Methods.
Absorption parameters
The ratio of the magnitude of the algal absorption peaks at blue (e.g., 443 nm) and red (e.g., 676 nm) wavelengths provides an indication of the level of pigment packaging, which increases with larger microalgal cell size and higher intracellular Chl a concentration (Morel and Bricaud, 1981). Lower blue/red absorption ratios indicate a greater level of pigment packaging (Figure 5a, Table 4). Within the sea ice, blue/red absorption ratios were lowest in the interior ice and highest in the surface communities (slush and deformation ponds), with values very similar to those measured in the under-ice water column (Table 4). Interestingly, the blue/red ratio in the bottom ice fell between these two extremes..
Absorption peaks at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths varied markedly within the sea ice (Table 4), suggesting differential production of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) by the microbial community. MAA absorption was generally low in bottom ice and in both low light and high light interior ice communities, ranging from approximately 0.02–0.03 m2 mg-1 Chl a (Figure 5b, Table 4). In surface slush layers, MAA absorption was 3–4-fold higher than elsewhere in the ice, averaging 0.070 ± 0.053 m2 mg-1 Chl a. The highest MAA absorption values were measured in deformation ponds (Figure 5c), which exceeded values in the slush layer by a factor of two and values elsewhere in the ice by nearly a factor of five (Table 4).
Discussion
Microalgal biomass
The mean microalgal biomass in sea ice within our study region (17.3 ± 17.8 mg Chl a m-2), which consisted primarily of stations sampled in the Amundsen Sea during summer, was comparable to the circumpolar summer mean (12.9 ± 16.5 mg Chl a m-2) calculated from historical data in the Antarctic Sea Ice Processes and Climate (ASPeCt)-Bio database (Meiners et al., 2012). Like the ASPeCt-Bio database, peak Chl a biomass during our study was distributed in microhabitats throughout the ice column. However, in the AntarcASPeCt – Biology (ASPeCt-Bio) database, surface, internal, and bottom microhabitats contained approximately equal fractions of total depth-integrated Chl a. This pattern contrasts with our study in which bottom communities were well developed in only 18% of the stations sampled, while surface and interior ice communities were well developed at 53% and 71% of stations, respectively (some stations had multiple communities so the percentages sum to > 100%). In this respect, vertical distributions of Chl a observed in our study share a greater similarity with those measured in the Ross Sea, where surface and interior communities also were relatively more abundant than bottom communities (Meiners et al., 2012). It is possible that, because the Amundsen Sea is aggregated with the Bellingshausen Sea in the ASPeCt-Bio database, the vertical distributions of Chl a are being skewed by the large number of samples near the Antarctic Peninsula, which may differ from those in the Amundsen and Ross Seas. In addition, the ASPeCt-Bio database includes data from all months of the year, while our study was conducted in summer, so some temporal bias may have been introduced in the comparison.
Snow depth appears critical in determining both the depth-integrated Chl a (higher with deeper snow) and distribution (dominance of slush communities in deeper snow) of ice microalgae. This observation is almost certainly a reflection of the impact of snow loading on nutrient availability via surface flooding rather than its impact on light availability, since more snow leads to reduced light levels (Perovich, 1990; Arrigo et al., 1997; Saenz and Arrigo, 2012). Low snow and a high freeboard means that the greatest nutrients can be found down at the ice/water interface, while heavy snow depresses the freeboard and causes flooding/nutrient renewal near the ice surface. Such surface flooding occurs over 15–30% of the ice pack in Antarctica (Wadhams et al., 1987).
These results are consistent with model results that demonstrate the importance of snow loading and surface flooding to the development and maintenance of high algal biomass in surface communities (Saenz and Arrigo, 2012; Saenz and Arrigo, in press). However, our results for the Amundsen Sea contrast with previous observations from the Ross Sea, which showed higher microalgal biomass at lower snow thicknesses (Arrigo et al., 2003). The difference between the two studies is likely explained by the lower snow accumulation in the Ross Sea, which rarely exceeded 0.1 m (Arrigo et al., 2003) and was unlikely to depress the surface of the ice below freeboard and cause surface flooding. In contrast, flooded sea ice in the Amundsen Sea during our study had snow accumulations of 0.3–0.8 m (Table 1) and well developed slush and surface pond communities associated with relatively high salinities, indicative of flooding. Thus, snow accumulation appears to be detrimental to algal growth due to light attenuation (as demonstrated in the Ross Sea) until it becomes sufficiently heavy to cause flooding, at which point the detrimental effect of reduced light would be more than compensated for by the advantage of nutrient renewal. Concurrent measurements of nutrient resupply and microalgal parameters would confirm this scenario.
Our results support previous observations showing that microalgal biomass in the ice is much greater and more highly concentrated than in the under-ice water column below (Garrison et al., 1990; Legendre et al., 1992; Arrigo et al., 2003). As a result, microhabitats within sea ice represent an important food source during those times of year when pelagic production is still low. Given the seasonal importance of sea ice biology, factors that control the amount of biomass within the ice can have a profound impact on other parts of the marine ecosystem (Arrigo et al., 2010b). For example, models predict that in the future there will be increased precipitation in the Southern Ocean resulting in greater snow cover on sea ice (e.g., Sarmiento et al., 1998). Our results suggest that such a change in forcing could increase the amount of algal biomass within the ice by enhancing nutrient supplies via surface flooding. This effect might be especially important in places like the Ross Sea where snow depths are currently too low to promote surface flooding.
Microalgal physiology
The photosynthetic rates of sea ice microalgae are controlled by a combination of sea ice temperature, brine salinity, and light and nutrient availability (Arrigo and Sullivan, 1992). At the time of our study, the sea ice was almost isothermal, so differences in sea ice temperature and brine salinity were likely having little impact on the spatial variability of sea ice microalgal physiological state. Therefore, the differences in elemental composition, pigment content, and photosynthetic parameters that we observed for sea ice microalgae were likely driven almost exclusively by vertical and horizontal gradients in light or nutrient availability.
For example, the POC/Chl a ratio in sea ice was lower at stations with a thicker snow cover (Figure 2e), indicative of microalgae increasing their cellular pigment concentrations in an effort to harvest more of the available light (Moisan and Mitchell, 1999; Kropuenske et al., 2009). Although the magnitude of these ratios suggests that the samples contained some detritus, complicating a possible physiological interpretation, the non-linear relationship observed between POC and Chl a is consistent with a photoacclimation response to reduced light levels (Figure 3a). As microalgal biomass (e.g., POC) increased, light availability was reduced due to self-shading, and the microalgae increased their cellular Chl a concentration to compensate. Consequently, the amount of additional Chl a necessary to sustain net photosynthesis at high biomass was higher than would have been necessary in the absence of microalgal self-shading.
While the observed POC/Chl a ratio in our study likely reflects acclimation to light availability, the variation in the POC/PON ratio with snow depth (Figure 2g) is also consistent with a microalgal response to nutrient availability. While it is true that the decreasing POC/PON ratio with increasing snow depth is consistent with an enhancement of N-rich photosystems by microalgae growing at reduced light levels (Klausmeier et al., 2004), the magnitude of the POC/PON ratio at low snow thicknesses (> 10) is very high relative to the ratio expected for N-replete cells (5–7). This finding suggests that the microalgal community growing beneath a thin cover of snow also may have been nutrient-stressed due to a lack of surface flooding.
Our other pigment data also provide strong evidence of acclimation by microalgae to the different light regimes associated with various microhabitats within the sea ice. Enhanced pigment packaging is manifested as a flattening of the algal absorption spectrum (i.e., lower blue/red peak ratios) as more light is absorbed by a microalgal cell, either due to a larger cell size or a greater amount of pigment per cell (Morel and Bricaud, 1981). The degree of pigment packaging was low in surface pond and slush communities and greatest in interior ice (Table 4), suggesting that microalgae growing in these low light environments either were larger or had higher pigment content than algae growing nearer the sea ice surface. A higher pigment content per cell is supported by the vertical distribution of the ratio of the photosynthetic accessory pigment fucoxanthin to Chl a, which showed a clear increase with depth within the ice (Table 2). Interestingly, pigment packaging was also low in the under-ice water column beneath the ice. Because this environment would be expected to experience relatively low light, the small amount of packaging could be the result of this pelagic community being dominated by smaller sized cells than are usually found in sea ice (Gradinger and Ikävalko, 1998; Riaux-Gobin et al., 2011).
Like pigment concentration, the types of pigments present in various sea ice microhabitats also reflect acclimation to different light environments. The xanthophyll cycle is used by many microalgal species to protect themselves from excessive irradiance. For sea ice microalgae, the xanthophyll cycle consists of enzymatic de-epoxidation of the carotenoid pigment DD to DT, the latter of which thermally dissipates excess energy (Olaizola and Yamamoto, 1994; Demmig-Adams and Adams, 2006; Goss et al. 2006). This photoprotective mechanism is particularly important for microalgae that get mixed periodically into surface waters (Alderkamp et al., 2013) or that live in the upper reaches of the sea ice. In our study, by far the highest (DD+DT)/Chl a ratios were measured in deformation ponds and surface slush layers, habitats that can be subjected to very high light levels throughout the 24-hour day. Xanthophyll cycle pigments were also found in microalgae within interior and bottom microhabitats within the ice and in the under-ice water column, but at much reduced concentrations relative to near-surface communities. This vertical pattern demonstrates clearly that microalgae living near the sea ice surface were using xanthophyll cycling as a mechanism to withstand excessive irradiance. However, it should be noted that even the lowest (DD + DT)/Chl a ratios measured in the sea ice during our study were 3-fold higher than values measured previously in ice-free waters of the Amundsen Sea (Alderkamp et al., 2013).
Like xanthophyll pigment concentrations, absorption of UV radiation by MAAs was very high in surface ice communities (pond and slush) and declined with depth within the ice (Table 2). Production of MAAs by microalgae can be photoinduced by elevated levels of UVB (280–320 nm) radiation, and to a lesser extent by UVA (320–400 nm) and visible (400–700 nm) radiation (Hannach and Sigleo, 1998; Klisch and Häder, 2001; Sinha et al., 2001), although the relative response to UVB, UVA, and visible radiation varies by algal taxa (Riegger and Robinson, 1997; Moisan and Mitchell, 2001). Algae produce at least nine different MAAs whose spectral absorption peak ranges from 310 nm to 386 nm (Riegger and Robinson, 1997). The vertical pattern of MAA absorption observed in ice during our study, which was only high in near surface samples, suggests that UV radiation was attenuated rapidly within the snow and ice and was not an important factor influencing rates of microalgal growth within the ice interior and sea ice bottom. The heterogeneous vertical distributions of both MAAs and xanthophyll cycle pigments demonstrate that, while sea ice is generally considered to be a low light habitat, microalgae living there must be able to acclimate to a wide range of light intensities.
The variations in photosynthetic parameters in the different sea ice microhabitats also demonstrate microalgal acclimation to both light and nutrient levels. Although both P*m and α* can vary as a function of either light or nutrient availability, in our study nutrient availability seemed to be the dominant controlling variable. Both P*m and α* were higher in the under-ice water column than in the ice, a likely reflection of greater nutrient availability (although we cannot rule out differences in phytoplankton species composition). This conclusion also is consistent with the vertical patterns observed within the ice, with both P*m and α* being higher in flooded surface communities and at the bottom of the ice (where nutrient concentrations would be high) than within the sea ice interior (Table 4). If light had been the controlling variable, P*m would have declined and α* would have increased with depth within the ice, a pattern contrary to our observations.
Interestingly, while both P*m and α* measured in sea ice indicate a system in which photosynthetic activity is most likely controlled by nutrient availability, the photoacclimation parameter (Ek) shows that light levels are also important. Because Ek is calculated as P*m/α*, it reflects a balance between the dark and light reactions of photosynthesis (Cullen, 1990). Because it is advantageous to maintain an optimal balance between light harvesting machinery and carbon fixation machinery, Ek often reflects the mean light history experienced by microalgal cells. The relationship between light history and Ek is apparent in our dataset as a progressive decrease in Ek with depth within the ice. Ek was highest in deformation ponds where light levels were highest and, unlike both P*m and α*, was lowest at the bottom of the ice where light levels were lowest. Ironically, the maintenance of this balance between Ek and light history in the bottom ice community would be made possible by abundant nutrients. Although P*m was relatively high in this microhabitat (Table 4), α* was even higher (relative to other microhabitats). Maintaining such a high photosynthetic efficiency (e.g., α*) when light is low requires a large pigment bed capable of harvesting additional photons and transferring them to the reaction centers, the synthesis of which requires a sufficiently large nutrient supply. Because nutrients were likely to be relatively high in the bottom community due to its proximity to seawater, microalgae growing there could elevate their photosynthetic efficiency far above that of internal communities (where light was also low). These high values for α* are what allowed bottom communities to reduce their Ek values to match their low light environment. Thus, we conclude that the balance between light and nutrients was critical in shaping sea ice microalgal metabolism in the Amundsen Sea during our study.
Although greater nutrient availability likely explains the higher biomass and more active microalgal physiology we observed in some microhabitats, there was also evidence that these high biomass microenvironments may have depleted their resources. We observed a statistically significant relationship between POC and the δ13C of POC in sea ice (Figure 4), which is likely the result of depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon by extremely high accumulations of ice algal biomass and consequent enrichment of the inorganic carbon pool (Rau et al., 1991; Kennedy et al., 2002; Arrigo et al., 2003). This relationship is similar to that observed in bottom ice in the Beaufort Sea region of the Arctic Ocean (Pineault et al., 2013), although both our POC and δ13C values were higher, indicating greater depletion of inorganic carbon by a larger algal community. Although there was no significant relationship between PON concentration and the δ15N of PON in sea ice, δ15N of particulate matter was significantly enriched in sea ice environments compared to the under-ice water column. Enrichment could be due to the presence of heterotrophs in sea ice (DeNiro and Epstein, 1981; Teranes and Bernasconi, 2000), but it is most likely due to NO3 being nearly depleted in ice cores such that both light and heavy isotopes of N were assimilated (while in the under-ice water column, mostly the light NO3 was utilized, Berg et al. 2011). This level of nutrient depletion was possible because, unlike the water column where iron (Fe) concentrations are insufficient to support complete NO3 drawdown by microalgae, microbial communities in the sea ice have enough Fe to more efficiently utilize the available macronutrients (Edwards and Sedwick, 2001). Thus, the biological pump associated with sea ice in the Southern Ocean is likely to be more efficient (but not stronger) than that of the water column, even on productive continental shelves. Given the more complete utilization of NO3 in ice relative to the water column, it might be worth exploring whether δ15N of PON in sediments can be used as a proxy for the presence of sea ice in a given area.
Finally, we were surprised to find a relatively large proportion of the pigment 19-Hex in sea ice microhabitats exposed to high light. 19-Hex is a marker pigment for Phaeocystis antarctica, a colonial prymnesiophyte that forms dense blooms in open waters on Antarctic continental shelves (Arrigo et al., 1999). Although this species has been observed previously in newly formed sea ice (Arrigo et al., 2003), and can tolerate prolonged darkness and freezing (Tang et al., 2009), the results of this study are the first to imply that it was physiologically active in the upper layers of sea ice in late spring/early summer. Its presence in recently flooded sea ice may indicate that it was introduced to the ice relatively recently and was able to grow there because of its ability to withstand high light levels. P. antarctica has an active xanthophyll cycle and is capable of efficiently repairing photodamage incurred during periods of high light stress (Kropuenske et al., 2009, 2010), allowing it to outcompete other species under highly variable light conditions (Arrigo et al., 2010a). It also is able to regulate its MAA content to protect itself from excessive radiation, including UV (Riegger and Robinson, 1997). Because the release from the sea ice into surface waters can expose microalgae to high radiation levels, high MAA content and enhanced xanthophyll cycle pigment concentrations may pre-acclimate P. antarctica to survive the transition from the sea ice to the water column as the sea ice melts in spring. In this way, we suggest that high xanthophyll cycle pigment and MAA content may facilitate the role that sea ice algae play in seeding ice-edge phytoplankton blooms and thereby structuring phytoplankton communities.

Deputy Commissioner Kulgam, Talat Parvez Rohella on Thursday chaired a meeting to review the progress, so far, on reported incidents of braid chopping in the district.
He directed for constituting a special composite investigation team comprising officers from revenue and police, besides doctors, counselling psychologist/psychiatrist who will investigate braid cutting incidents and provide assistance to victims.
On the occasion, the Deputy Commissioner said that Village Level Committees have already been constituted to maintain vigil and report facts on such incidents.
The members of the special investigation composite team said that during any incident, the crime spots are not preserved which debilitate them from carrying out proper investigations. In this regard, the Deputy Commissioner sought the cooperation of the people in helping the administration in preserving the crime spots so that evidence could be preserved on the basis of which, conclusive investigations are carried out.
The counsellors of the health department sought the cooperation of the victims and their families so that they can be taken out of the post-incident trauma.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Commissioner directed the members to ensure the investigation into the matters in a time bound manner with some conclusive evidences.
The Deputy Commissioner appealed the people to lend every sort of support to nab the culprits and help the district administration to prevent spreading of mass hysteria. In case of any assistance or help, people have been urged to contact the district administration on 01931260156/ 7051510654.View all available promotions

All Around Great
To start I had made the reservation for the wrong days but the staff said it was no problem and that they would take care of it. I was so relieved that I didn't have to pay any extra. The hotel is beautiful and old I really loved the antique
style. It is only 2 or 3 blocks from the town center so it was a perfect location. The day we checked out we had to be at the airport early and the staff called the taxi for us. Also, because it is not right in the middle of the centro things cost less around the hotel. There is a small restaurant right in front of the hotel to the right on the corner that serves the most delicious fresh food ever and very cheap. I totally recommend Tapatio Tours which costs only 100 pesos and takes you to Tlaquepaque, Tanala, Zonapec, and all around Guadalajara you get to see all the artisan work it is amazing.
The restaurant on the right corner in front of the hotel. You walk across some type of a cement median, but it's right in front like 50 steps from the hotel. They make everything super fresh and so delicious. It is the cheapest too.
Would not recommend
Definitely not 4 Star
Good location in the city. The rooms are badly in need refurbishing in order to keep the 4 star rating they claim. When we checked in, the room had a non-operating TV so we were relocated to another room where the toilet leaked all over the
bathroom floor. It was repaired the next day. Food in the restaurant was quite good and everyone on Staff was helpful and friendly.
Business
This hotel is walking distance to the central market where you can find anything and everything at reasonable prices. Lots of fun to browse plus great food.
Good Bye Old Friend
This hotel is in a good location to see the historic area, catch local transit, go to San Juan de Dios market,ect. It is sad to see it slowly deteriorate. They are trying to fix it with a coat of paint, but that doesn't do it. The restaurant was
one of the reasons we always returned here, but this time the service was horrible and the food was just mediocre. We think this is Hasta La Vista.
La Chatta for the best pozole
Restaurant with Bavarian man in front - good breakfast & coffee
Great location, ok hotel.
In a great spot and the price was right. The hotel is a bit worn out but for me this can be over looked because the location is so great. I walked to all of the sights.It was clean and the staff was friendly.
Free WiFi that worked great.
Grand classic needs some loving help
comfortable beds would be helpful, as would money changing options at the desk
dynamic and quintessional mexican all around you in city centre
It was an experience!
Room had a mildew odor. Staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful however we were charged for an extra night.
There's an alternative night club across the street which draws a crowd at night.
Very nice atmosphere
Very nice hotel in the Historical Center of Guadaljara. Close to walk to all the sightseeing spots. The rooms in the back are wonderful and quiet, no street noise. Friendly hotel personal and trustworthy. I can just recommend it!
Historical and Beautiful Location
The hotel is 1 block from San Franciso Church, the oldest church in Guadalajara, and walking distance of 4 more including the Cathedral. It is within walking distance of one of the largest outdoor shopping areas I have ever seen and a giant 3
story swap meet!! Great location. The hotel is an old Spanish Mansion, 4 courtyards, all with lots of plants and cages of the happiest little finches. All rooms have a window or door that overlooks one of the courtyards...and did I mention old fountains in each one?? The architeture of this place is beautiful, thick solid wood doors, spanish tile and frescos all over. Nice restaraunt with a breakfast buffet in the morning, really cheap by American standards. We stayed 2 nights, and were really impressed.
San Juan de Dios is the swap meet,1 block east, 4 blocks north, and Plaza Patriot is the outdoor shopping mall from the main cathredal west to east for blocks and blocks.
Great place to stay!
We arrived later then planned due to the awful traffic on Friday night, so keep that in mind, try not to arrive on a Friday night. When we arrived we were treated very kindly. Someone went with my husband to park our van. The hotel is so great
for the eyes. So, much to see in the lobby and while walking to the room. Big wooden doors, greenery, working fountain, and more. However, the rooms (large enough and with very high ceilings) are pretty plain. Quaint is what I would call it. The bathroom showed years of wear. We were only there for the night and left in the morning.
The Good & The Bad
Hotel is located in the Centro district which is great for getting around by walking or using the bus system. At night the area is quite seedy - not recommended for children. The in house restaurant has excellent service, good food,nice patio area
for eating. The rooms are showing age. Check for cleanliness and plumbing problems. Bring any complaints to front desk.Good place to stay for the price.
There is a store for every imaginable item around plazas and down streets. The prices range from very expensive to very reasonable. Be sure to visit Mercado Libertad (also known as San Juan Dios). If you don't find it there it is not available.

Organizers of the Western Conservative Summit have told Log Cabin Republicans it can't have a booth there because Log Cabin 'exists to redefine the family.'
Even committed progressives should understand why the Republican Party needs LGBT voters and why LGBT voters need the Republican Party.
As Republican leaders recognize the inevitability of marriage equality, let’s be gracious in our victory, particularly as the fight for equality ensues in red states.
With little debate, the state party adopted a platform without language opposing same-sex marriage.
The tea party leader called Log Cabin Republicans 'a thug organization' for supporting the bill.
We think these classic TV characters would be great additions to any LGBT family.
Who is really responsible for the anti-LGBT messaging that has been tied to the Republican Party?

Kelly is the second well-liked, long-tenured Senator to be shipped out of town in less than a week.
On Thursday, Mike Fisher was sent to the Nashville Predators for first and conditional third round draft picks.
General manager Bryan Murray lamented the fact he was giving up yet another of the team’s “character players,” but his actions indicate the team is committed to a major overhaul.
“These are difficult deals for myself to make, because Chris was such a good player when I coached and followed directions so well and to have to make the moves that we’re making are difficult, but that’s the way we have to go at this point in time,” he said following the Senators’ 4-3 shootout loss to the New York Islanders Tuesday night.
Murray said that while players like Fisher and Kelly are often criticized for the amount of money they make to play non-starring roles, they’re the kinds of players other teams want.
Kelly was stoic as he faced the media after learning the news.
“It’s pretty tough to be traded, this is my first time, but these things happen, especially with the way things have gone this season,” he said.
“I spoke with (Bruins general manager) Peter Chiarelli and he seemed excited and I told him I was excited to get an opportunity to play in the postseason and an opportunity to go late, hopefully, in the playoffs.”
Kelly knew he could be on the way out after the Fisher deal.
Obviously to see a guy like Mike get traded, who’s been here for so long and to be moved, I think it really was an eye-opener that everyone could possibly be moved,” he explained.
Known primarily for his role as a defensive centre, Kelly was on pace for a career year in goal-scoring. He has 12 on the season to go with his 11 assists. This was his sixth full year with the team.
Ottawa fans won’t have to wait long to see Kelly again, however. The Bruins play a road game against the Islanders Thursday night, then fly straight to Ottawa for a game at Scotiabank Place Friday night.
“It’ll be a weird feeling coming out on the other side of the rink,” Kelly said. “Obviously Ottawa’s all I’ve known, I was drafted here, played my full NHL career, so it’ll be a bit.The Undiscovered Country

Synopsis
Winner of the Beverly Hills Book Award for Southern Fiction and the Yerby Award for Fiction (Augusta Literary Festival), this is a story about a murder no one knew had been committed tucked inside a Southern family drama about a mother's desperate struggle to conceal her explosive secrets.
Randle Marks buried his abusive father three years ago and thought he had escaped the gravitational pull of his dysfunctional family. Nonetheless, when he is summoned to his mother's hospital bedside in Augusta, Georgia, he expects to face long-suppressed memories and contemptuous siblings, but he does not expect to find a man claiming to be his birth father, conspiracies to embezzle money, and a murder no one knew had been committed.
To learn the truth about his past, Randle embarks on a journey through Old South traditions and the fading mores of his mother’s generation to untangle the layers of lies that enshroud his family’s history. As he uncovers the twisted facts, Randle battles the medical establishment, solves the murder and grapples with the riddle of his own identity. Only then can he choose between revenge and reconciliation.

Excerpt
When William Tecumseh Marks marched through the door, Beth sensed his presence, pulled out of my embrace, and crossed her arms over her modest bosom. She did not go to her husband for comfort.
“What’s going on?” Billy said in a tone that implied he was worried more about his wife in my arms than he was about his mother’s status. Billy and I are opposites in every way. I’m an optimistic dreamer, while Billy is pugnacious and contemptuous. I have dark hair and brown eyes like our mother, while Billy has sandy hair—thinning—and steel-blue eyes like our father. I’m tall and lithe. Billy is short and square. I played college basketball. Billy was a power hitter in baseball and a running back in football. Unfortunately for Billy, he was one of those sad people for whom high school was the high point of a life that ran downhill after graduation.
“Mom’s undergoing tests—heart and brain—and won’t be back till late afternoon.”
Billy moved a few steps into the room. “I didn’t expect to find you here.”
I glanced at Beth and saw fear on her face. When she had called the previous night, she asked that I not disclose how I had learned of Mom’s hospitalization. I hadn’t seen Billy or Katie since my father’s funeral nearly three years ago, and neither of them had called me since my incarceration. “The hospital called me. I’m on the next-of-kin list.”
Billy looked doubtful; Beth looked relieved.
“Still wearing my father’s watch?” He pointed to the gold Rolex President on my wrist, my father’s retirement gift from the Savannah River Plant. He didn’t want to wear the symbol of his desultory career, so he presented it to me as we exited his ceremony. It was the only keepsake he had ever given me. My siblings had plundered his other possessions when he passed.
“Yes, it’s my father’s watch. The metal band wore out, so I changed to a leather strap.”
Billy sneered. “Never understood why he gave it to you. He thought you were an idiot.”
“The feeling was mutual.”
“Then why wear it?”
“To remind myself to prove him wrong.”
Billy shook his head and edged closer to us, creating a conversation circle. “What have the doctors told you?”
Ignoring Billy, I spoke directly to Beth. “What happened? I talked to Mom a week ago. She said she was fine.”
“She told us you called, but she wasn’t really fine, Randle. You know how she sugarcoats everything.”
I did know. Mom never wanted anyone to worry about her.
“Tell me about yesterday,” I said. “How did you find out? How did she get here?”
Beth flushed. Without asking Billy for permission, she said, “It started Thursday night. Mom had pain in her legs and couldn’t sleep. Could hardly walk.”
“The fluid buildup,” Billy said.
“The symptoms of a heart attack are different for women than for men,” I said. “It was about to happen, and she didn’t know it.”
Beth nodded. “Friday around lunchtime, she used the bathroom but then she couldn’t stand up. She was paralyzed. She had to crawl to the bedroom to get to a phone.”
“Took her four hours,” Billy added.
“She called me at home,” Beth continued. “Billy was at work, so I called 9-1-1 and met the first responders at her house. It was terrible, Randle. Her panties were still around her ankles. She was so embarrassed.”
I could imagine the scene: the prim Southern Belle in shocking disarray. It made me very sad to think this might be the messy end of my mother’s neat and proper life. “Could she see?”
“I guess so. She crawled to the phone, dialed my number.”
That implied she had the stroke while she was in the hospital, under a doctor’s care. That puzzled me. I paused to think about the ramifications.
“So they transported her, but then they didn’t do anything for her.”
“They gave her shots that saved her life, Randle. They put her on oxygen.”
True, but they didn’t assign a cardiologist and hospitalist until she proved she could survive the night.
“We were here all night,” Billy said.
I knew that wasn’t precisely true, but I didn’t challenge him. “Is she still paralyzed? They never mentioned it to me.”
“No,” Beth said. “She regained movement after they treated her in the emergency room.”
That’s a relief. Now that I had the background, I recapped for Billy and Beth what Metzger and Kaplan had told me. They were shocked to hear that Mom couldn’t see. I had more pressing matters to pursue.
“Why is she malnourished?”
Billy constructed an innocent expression. “She’s not. She gained weight, ballooned to a hundred sixty pounds at one point.”
“She’s a skeleton now. Do you guys check on her?”
Billy’s nostrils flared like a wounded bull in a fighting ring. “We live in Martinez, not around the corner. Why didn’t you check on her?”
“I’ve been occupied.”
“With that hocus pocus you call science? How’s that worked out for you?”
“You know where I’ve been.”
“Yeah, making license plates.” He snorted in derision.
I had to change the subject before I strangled my baby brother. “When was the last time she’s been to the doctor?”
Billy shrugged. “Not long ago.”
“Was she being treated for water retention?”
“Sure, she has pills.”
“What about the infection on her legs?”
“She takes steroids. We took care of her while you were ‘occupied.’”
“I’m here now. I’ll look after her.”
Billy shook his head. “Too late, Jack. You can go back to your ex-wives and your boats and your houses—all the things that have been more important to you than family.”!

However, it is not always easy to tan both fast and safely. So, in this article, we want to share with you a couple of make up tricks for getting a sunkissed summer glow without putting your health on the line for it.
Tips for Getting the Best Tan Safely
Before we share with you makeup tips and tricks for a better suntan, we want to show you how to play safely under the sun.
First, it is important to protect your skin from within. Therefore, make sure you eat products that are high in lycopene and beta carotene. These can include tomatoes, sweet potatoes, dark leafy greens and carrots.
Second, put on some avocado, olive or coconut oil before you apply your sunscreen. These oils are rich in antioxidants, so they offer additional protection.
Third, avoid playing under the sun between 12 and 3 p.m. Besides, make sure your daily tanning sessions are no longer than 2-3 hours. Fourth, change sides often and go under a cool shade from time to time.
Basic Makeup Tips and Tricks for Better Suntan
Now that you know what measures to take in order to protect your skin, let us share with you some makeup artist tricks for a glowing tan.
First, do not underestimate the power of proper hydration. As we sweat more in the summer, it is vital to apply moisturizers before going to bed, as well as before applying makeup. Also, make sure you use creams that keep your skin healthy without disturbing its texture.
Other makeup tricks for beginners revolve around using primer, as well as the right foundation. If you use primer, your makeup will last longer even during extreme weather conditions.
However, no makeup tricks to look younger will help you if you do not choose a foundation shade that perfectly matches your skin tone.
Next, the color of your skin tone plays a crucial role when it comes to bronzers, too. If you have darker skin, opt for chocolaty tones with shimmer. If your skin is medium to olive, then go for sheer copper and earth-coloured bronzers. As for fair to light-skinned folks, it is best to choose peach-coloured or rose tones.
The last make up tricks we want to share with you refer to lip care. You cannot enjoy a sunkissed summer look if you constantly wear heavy lipsticks. So, avoid overdoing the lips.
Also, it is ok to define your lips with a lip pencil but stick to natural SPF lip balms. On top of that, lip gloss and powder highlighter products come in handy when you want to add some shimmer.
This was our selection of basic make up tricks for getting a summer glow. We hope that they will help you get a tan fast and safely.

The estimated budget for the first year of the Speechless Reconciliation project (Part 1, 2 and 3) is 16,000 euros.
Currently, RC Prague International and some of its individual members have committed the equivalent of more than 3,000 euros.
Additionally, a grant of 2,000 USD (approximately 1,600 euros) was awarded to the project by Rotary District 2240 (Czech & Slovak Republics).
RC Prague International continues to raise funds, and members are committed to providing at least 6,000 euros (including the District 2240 grant) to the project.
We have a goal to raise the other 10,000 euros from additional Rotary sources, sponsorship and individual donations. You can follow our funding on the Fundraising Updates page.
We have received messages of encouragement and pending financial support from Rotary clubs in the participating countries, and those clubs are also applying for grants in their districts.
The project team is also hard at work securing additional funding from sponsors.
Sponsors will receive prominent mention on this website, in social media for the project, in press releases and other project communications, and, when possible, on the websites of the facilities and other Rotary clubs involved with the project.
Sponsorship / Donations
There are several ways you can provide financial support to the Speechless Reconciliation project:
Rotary Club Sponsorship: This project is among the first in Rotary International’s newer focus on Peace Building and Conflict Resolution. Support of this initiative is “close to home” for clubs on the European continent, and may be especially important for those in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Clubs interested in providing larger donations and support should please contact Matěj Keka or Gerry Tipple.
Third-Party Sponsorship: Corporate sponsors can contribute this project in several ways, including in-kind donations for items and services the participants may needs, including travel and personal care items, incidentals, meals, etc. The best way to help, though, is to support Speechless Reconciliation with monetary donations. For information about company sponsorship, please contact Tim Belon.
Individual Support: Donations can be made to the Speechless Reconciliation project by clicking either of the links below and following instructions. Please be aware that Darjume donations can be made in euros or Czech koruna. Donations through Donio can be made only in Czech koruna.

THE MAIDSTONE CONSPIRACY
PROLOGUE
Colorado Springs, CO
April 12, 2010
“I’m heading home,” Paul Winston said. “Promised the kids some baseball after school.”
“See ya tomorrow,” replied Bill Daniels, his senior vice-president.
Paul walked down three flights to street level. He strolled casually toward his pickup parked at the curb nearby, caught up in the sights and sounds and smells of early summer.
A few steps from the truck the wealthy entrepreneur felt himself hit from behind, forcing his body against a parking meter. Paul reached out to keep from falling. He couldn’t hold on, landing on his back. Paul looked up. A disheveled-looking man stood over him. An old revolver was clutched in his right hand.
Good God! he thought. That son-of-a-bitch just shot me!
“What the hell?” Paul tried to challenge his young assailant. The words were a garbled wheeze. The unshaven face above him was familiar, but he couldn’t quite place it.
Paul watched helplessly as the shabbily dressed man raised the old weapon. His mind was shouting at him to flee but his body wouldn’t respond. The gun jumped, and then jumped a second time. Paul heard loud bangs as two bullets slammed into his chest with enormous force. He couldn’t breathe.
“Right! That’ll fix you, ya greedy bugger,” he heard the man say. “Bloody well serves you right!”
‘Why?’ Paul tried to ask, noticing the British accent. Only his mind could form the words.
CHAPTER ONE
Durham, NC
20 Years Earlier
Paul Winston was studying hard for the last of his MBA final exams at Duke University’s business school when his cell phone rang.
“Hello?” he said. There was no response. He sensed a presence at the other end, but no sound. “Hello?” he said again. “Who’s there? What’s going on?” There was a muted cry of anguish.
“Oh, Paul!” He heard Emily’s voice cry out, convulsed with grief.
“What is it, Emily?” he said. “What’s going on? Are you all right? Do you need help?”
“It’s Mom!” his sister cried. “It’s Mom and Dad!” she corrected herself. “They’re gone,” she sobbed. “They’re both gone! A crash! Dad’s plane! They were killed, Paul. They’re dead. Oh my God, Paul!”
“What?” Paul said. He struggled to grasp what he’d just heard. “What… what happened? How?”
“The plane, Paul,” Emily said. “It crashed and exploded. Dad was landing at the ranch… on the airstrip. Mom was with him. George said the plane blew up while landing. He says Mom and Dad must have died instantly. Oh my God, Paul! Can you come right away, please? There’s something not right about this. I just know! I need you, now!”
Paul tried to console his sister while she struggled to share with him the few details she knew about the tragedy. They sat in silence on the phone for a few moments then exchanged words of comfort, knowing nothing they could possibly say would bring them solace.
Finally, Paul said, “I’m on my way, Emily. I’ll see how soon I can get a charter and let you know. Are the police there?”
“Yes, they’re here,” she said. “But something’s wrong. I’ll explain when you get here. Hurry, Paul!”
“I’m on my way, Emily,” he repeated, too shocked to think of anything else to say.
Paul called Jerry Appleby, the head of the charter aircraft company at Raleigh-Durham International Airport that Paul’s father had helped finance years earlier. Paul explained what had happened. Once his Dad’s friend managed to get past his shock, he told Paul a Learjet was due to land soon from a one-way trip. He would have the plane prepared immediately for Paul’s flight west across the country.
Paul’s next call was to a friend at the Colorado State Patrol.
“I’m so very, very sorry, Paul,” Josh Schroeder said. He and Paul had been buddies through high school. “For what it’s worth, Paul, I will personally see we do everything we can to find out what happened. Right now, all we have are a lot of questions and not many answers. We both know your Dad was an excellent pilot. This doesn’t make any sense at all.”
Paul was at the top of his MBA graduating class at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business in Durham, NC. He’d enrolled at the request of his father, Ted Winston, a successful Colorado entrepreneur and rancher, after being asked to take over the family’s rapidly growing business interests. At 28, he was the eldest of three children. Both of his sisters were married and pursuing their own careers.
During the 17-mile taxi ride to Raleigh-Durham airport, Paul tried to shake off the fog of grief clouding his mind. He needed to think clearly. He knew that as the eldest of the three, his sisters would look to him for leadership through this horrendous calamity that had befallen their family.
CHAPTER TWO
Colorado Springs Airport
“This is terrible… horrendous, Paul. I’m so very sorry,” George Underhill said as they met at the Colorado Springs airport. The ranch foreman’s eyes were red. He grasped Paul’s hand and then put a muscular arm around his shoulder. They walked together into the executive flight terminal building.
“What in the world happened, George?” Paul asked, struggling to hold his composure. “How could this happen? Dad had thousands of hours on that plane. He’s landed hundreds of times at the ranch. This makes no sense, George! What went wrong?”
“We don’t know yet,” George said. “People from the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) have just arrived. Maybe they can give us some answers. The Sheriff’s Department has the site cordoned off.”
“Where are Mom and Dad?” Paul said. “Where did they take them… their bodies?”
“Colorado Springs,” George said. “The coroner took them, and the sheriff has ordered autopsies. It’s normal in accident cases.”
“Paul!”
He turned quickly after hearing Emily’s voice calling out. His diminutive sister was running across the small reception area. She collapsed in his arms. Her cries of grief drew everyone’s attention.
“Oh, Paul,” she said after a few moments, tears streaming down her face. “Thank God you’re here! Let’s go home!”
“Where’s Roberta?” Paul said.
“She’s out at the ranch,” she said. “She drove out with Stephen and their kids.”
He wasn’t looking forward to seeing Roberta. There’d been a strain between him and their youngest sister since they’d been teenagers. Paul didn’t understand why, and Roberta steadfastly refused to discuss it. He’d finally decided to just let it go.
That wouldn’t be quite so easy now, he thought.
Emily grabbed Paul’s arm and began pulling him toward the entrance.
Paul glanced back at George. The big ranch foreman raised an eyebrow and tilted his head sideways sympathetically.
CHAPTER THREE
Earnscliffe Manor
Maidstone, England
While Paul’s chartered jet was landing in Colorado Springs, Lord Percival Winston, the 11th Earl of Prescott, was dying. His frail body lay in a huge four-poster bed dominating the master suite at Earnscliffe, a 500-year-old manor house nestled among the picturesque hills of Kent, southeast of London.
“Willard,” he whispered to his cousin, “It’s time.
Lord Percival’s breathing had become shallow but he still managed to whisper a few words from time to time, despite the cancer ravaging his internal organs. He’d just ordered all life support disconnected.
“Don’t talk like that, Percy,” Willard said, mostly for the benefit of the few family and staff gathered at his bedside. “You’ll be up and about again before you know it. This is just a setback. It’ll pass.”
Percival managed a weak smile. At 83, he was the eldest of five children. His only surviving sibling, Ted, was the youngest. Their other brother and two sisters had been small children when they were killed in the Blitz during the Second World War. Percy regretted that he and his late wife Mary had been unable to have children. He missed her terribly, the love of his life. She’d died 17 years earlier.
I wonder if Willard has any idea what comes next? Percival thought.
He was aware his mind, that amounted to more than the inheritance Willard had any right to expect. So, in the absence of a direct heir, Percival had bequeathed the bulk of his considerable wealth and his title to his only sibling, Ted Winston, in America.
Willard refused to believe he was not the natural heir, even though being a second cousin put him some distance from the usual lines of succession. He wasn’t about to let matters rest. Secretly, he’d made plans to challenge the will after Percival’s death. Willard knew he wouldn’t have long to wait.

Years from now, do you want to be able to look back and reflect how this was the year that changed everything for you?
Will this be the year in which you stop thinking about being successful and actually begin living successfully?
People often ask me to explain what coaching does. They want to understand how or why it works. As much as I would like to tell everyone that I have fairy dust to sprinkle, or that I do the work for you– that is simply not the truth. The truth is that coaching is in fact a magical and introspective experience. It is a unique partnership between you and I in which you are asked many, many questions and enticed to think and respond in a way in which you don’t often allow yourself to. Coaching is your permission slip to imagine the unknown, to let go of excuses, and to allow yourself to explore and make decisions about possibilities and opportunities that can literally change your life.
When you change your perspectives…you change!
I take a whole-life approach to coaching you. Which means that the agenda is always yours and we coach together in 360 degrees. What impacts you personally impacts you professionally. When you change your business, this in turn recalibrates your life. Transition is now trendy and chic. One of the biggest growth segments of my coaching practice is with founders and emerging entrepreneurs. I am proud of the successful business that I have built over the past 7 years and I love supporting others in making that a reality as well.
One of life’s greatest transitions is to make the decision to step away from the corporate track, the mommy track, or the job you have known for years, and to venture into starting and successfully running your own business or an entirely different role. Investing in the additional support, expertise, and resources of someone who has done just that herself can save you time and money and can ultimately be the difference between a business that thrives or one that is an epic failure. Working together we will access and tweak the situation so that you are aligned with your brand, balanced in your life, and taking renewed and positive action where you most need to in all aspects of your life.
What is your success really worth?
Now is your new next! Coaching is the very best investment you can make in your own personal growth. It is an investment that keeps on giving because long after your sessions are complete you will have the strategies, tools, and resources to make sound, clear decisions, to take positive action steps, and to impact the legacy and the life you most want to live NOW.

Point guards are plentiful in the Mission League, but two of the best were missing in action Monday night at West Hills Chaminade, and the absence of the Eagles' Jaron Martin (strep throat) and Loyola's Parker Jackson-Cartwright (ankle injury) created opportunity for the understudies.
In the end, Max Hazzard of Loyola came through at a decisive time, getting the ball to 7-footer Thomas Welsh deep into the key for an easy basket with 1 minute 19 seconds left to give the Cubs (12-2, 2-0) a 62-61 road victory over Chaminade.
"It was two teams fighting their tails off," Loyola Coach Jamal Adams said. "I told our guys we made one more play than they did. We're fighting and clawing with Parker out."
Jackson-Cartwright was on the Loyola bench with his left foot in a walking cast. He has been declared out of action until his ankle fully heals after it has bothered him for months. He's not expected back for several weeks.Coconut Cardamom was the very first flavor our founder developed and remains her favorite! The flavors in this Oat Porridge are warm and exotic.

Updating a previous report, Boston Red Sox OF Rusney Castillo's recall has been a topic of conversation, according to manager John Farrell.
Fantasy Tip: With the lack of offensive production from the right field lineup spot this season, it should be a foregone conclusion Castillo's bat is needed in Boston. He owns tremendous upside, and fantasy owners shouldn't be surprised to see him join the club sooner than later. He should be owned in all formats at this point..
Tue, 19 May 2015 14:54:31 -0700
Boston Red Sox OF Rusney Castillo could be receiving a call-up to the big leagues once he returns after the birth of his child, as manager John Farrell indicated it was a possibility.
Fantasy Tip: Castillo is hitting .304 with two home runs and nine RBI in 69 at-bats with Class AAA Pawtucket (R.I.) this year. If he's available in any of your leagues, you should scoop him up immediately and stash him. Castillo could make a significant impact at FantasyScore right off the bat, too, as he's expected to see regular playing time in Boston.
Thu, 14 May 2015 10:47:58 -0700
Boston Red Sox OF Rusney Castillo (ankle) returned to the lineup for Class AAA Pawtucket (R.I.) Thursday, May 14, after mildly spraining his left ankle Wednesday, May 13. He is batting second and playing center field.
Fantasy Tip: Castillo should be held onto in pretty much all fantasy baseball leagues, as he's likely to see consistent playing time at the major league level whenever Boston calls him back up.
Wed, 13 May 2015 10:59:39 -0700
Boston Red Sox OF Rusney Castillo (ankle) suffered a mild sprain of his ankle Wednesday, May 13, but manager John Farrell said Castillo's exit at Class AAA Pawtucket (R.I.) was "precautionary."
Fantasy Tip: It seems like Castillo just can't stay healthy as he attempts to get back to the big leagues. His injury appears minor, though, but there isn't a timetable for when the BoSox are expected to bring him back up. Right now, there continues to be a log jam in Boston's outfield. Continue stashing Castillo in deep mixed and AL-only leagues, as he'll likely see consistent playing whenever he is called up.
Fri, 01 May 2015 14:12:27 -0700
Boston Red Sox OF Rusney Castillo (shoulder) is expected to return to the outfield in the minor leagues early next week, according to manager John Farrell.
Fantasy Tip: Castillo is working his way back from a shoulder injury that prevented him from opening the year in the majors. Once he's gets enough playing time under his belt in the minors, he could be called up to Boston shortly after. He should be owned in all AL-only leagues, and it might be time to stash him away in deep mixed leagues to get ahead of your competition.
Tue, 28 Apr 2015 22:34:46 -0700
Boston Red Sox OF Rusney Castillo (shoulder) is scheduled to return to Triple-A Pawtucket after a stint on the 7-day disabled list in the minors due to inflammation of the right shoulder.
Fantasy Tip: It's uncertain when Castillo will get the call to the big club, but he has to get healthy on the farm first.
Mon, 27 Apr 2015 21:39:09 -0700
Boston Red Sox OF Rusney Castillo (shoulder) is expected to serve as the designated hitter for Triple-A Pawtucket Wednesday, April 29. He has been sidelined due to a shoulder injury since spring training.
Fantasy Tip: It's uncertain if or when Castillo will be promoted to the big club so FantasyScore owners need not bother with him for now. However, if he gets hot with the PawSox he could be promoted.
Fri, 24 Apr 2015 14:24:15 -0700
Boston Red Sox OF Rusney Castillo (shoulder) could be the designated hitter for Triple-A Pawtucket Wednesday, April 29. He is currently on the minor league disabled list.
Fantasy Tip: Shane Victorino's hamstring injury and Castillo's hefty contract could land Castillo in Boston sooner than later, and Castillo should be stashed in the majority of formats. Continue to check for updates on Castillo's recovery and for news of a recall. He has the upside to tip the scales in all fantasy categories.
Tue, 14 Apr 2015 12:39:51 -0700
Updating a previous report, Boston Red Sox OF Rusney Castillo's (shoulder) MRI exam showed no structural damage in his shoulder, but the Red Sox do not have a timetable for his return.
Fantasy Tip: The Red Sox have no reason to rush Castillo back with Mookie Betts playing so well, and Boston has good outfield depth on the major league roster. It doesn't appear to be a significant injury for Castillo. Continue to stash him in all fantasy formats.This is a guest post from our friend and co-worker Tim Strange. It’s his account of our real-life adventure with a missions team from California. Missionaries can’t prepare for every natural disaster, but with a lot of prayer and help from others we were able to get our whole team out of the jungle without any loss of life. BTW, Tim is getting married in a few days, so maybe his wild bachelor missionary days are behind him… probably not.
“When you pass through the deep waters, I will be with you. When you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. The flames will not set you ablaze.” Isaiah 43:2
The past weekend was an incredible adventure in ministry. I accompanied Josh Amiot, a team from Rocklin California and some language school students to Namaldi an indigenous reserve in the Limón Province. They say that getting there is half the battle, only this time I think they were wrong…
As we turned off the highway to the reserve it started to sprinkle and no one gave it a second thought. After entering the reserve we made our way down to the Chirripó River and drove along side it for a couple of kilometers toward the church. We crossed 4 small rivers along the way all flowing into the Chirripó. After leaving the river road we drove up the hill to the church and the rain started to fall harder.
Since it was raining we could not paint the roof of the church as planned and decided we would paint the inside. We “ran” back out to the main highway to buy some paint. As we entered the first hardware store, I thought it was funny the store had a 3 foot wall around it and a ramp that went up over the wall. Daniel, our Costa Rican pastor friend, said it was to keep the flood waters out. I soon found out how bad the waters would rise.
After returning to the church we noticed the river was rising but not by much. We had a great church service that night and all hunkered down for the night in hammocks, in the church, in a cabin and in our cars. Heavy rain fell all night. Around five in the morning I decided to drive down to the first river crossing and see if it was passable. Where yesterday it had been 8 to 10 inches of water flowing was now about 2 feet. I waded down the road to where the river’s edge had been and it was knee high, too deep for our cars to cross.
After some discussion and searching we found another road and river crossing that we could make it out on. We told the team we would be walking to the river and then crossing by foot, and then the cars would shuttle them to the bus. By the time we got back to the crossing the river had risen considerably. We started crossing by having the guys form human chain and passing all the teams backpacks and hammocks across, and then had the girls go across with the help of the guys. The whole time the river was growing as more water rushed down the mountain. After getting most of the team to the other side, Daniel decided to drive his car and trailer over to the other side. As the Forerunner and trailer entered the water it bounced on the rocks and water was pushing it down stream. With not a moment to spare it made it to the other side.
We still had 6 or 8 people who needed to cross the river and for some unknown reason some of the guys had started back towards us from the other side of the river. As they crossed it looked like they were loosing their footing and were going to be washed down stream. A Cabécar Indian named Alexis, who seemed to be able to walk on water, helped us rescue them and get a rope a cross and tied from my car to the trailer. The rest of the team crossed the river holding the rope and getting pummeled by the current. Josh and our language school students started to cross, but the current became too great and they had to turn back. After returning to our side of the river and the team on the other side, it was decided that Josh would try and make it back a cross and Daniel, Jon, Pierce, Meghan and myself would stay and try and get the cars out on Sunday.
We were happy they got out but had no idea the ordeal they would go through to get back to San Jose. We returned to the church and the shelter of the cabin. We only had snack foods and some cornflakes to eat and enough clean drinking water to last a day or two. We set an 18-inch stockpot out to collect rainwater. It filled to its capacity in less than two hours. It seemed like the rain never stopped. At times falling so hard you could not yell loud enough to be heard. Looking over the valley, the river had risen so much that the sandbars and the river bend had disappeared. All that was left was the tree tops.
Cell phone service was spotty. Signals faded in and out one could only hope the call would go through. I was able to call April Amiot and let her know the team got out and call and few others and send an email asking for prayer. IPhones are great on the mission field! Daniel was able to call his Dad, and found out he was on his way from Guanacaste to help us. We then learned that his mom was stuck not far from us, as the Forerunner could not make it out.
Late afternoon the rain let up for an hour or so and we set out to explore. The road we came in on was completely washed away by the rain and the swollen river. We tried to drive back to where the team had crossed and as we drove we could see the small rivers had combined and flooded the valley as we continued a tree had fallen and was blocking the road. Continuing on foot just after the tree the river had washed out at least a hundred foot swath of where the road had been and where the team crossed earlier. There was one other road we could try so as we turned around and proceeded up to the top of the hill and came upon a rockslide blocking our only hope besides walking out.
It was a long night and in the morning using my iPhone we found out that both roads going to San Jose were closed due to high water and most of the team had made it back to San Jose. Josh and 7 others had to spend the night at a restaurant in Siquirres. We were out of food and water was getting low. We decided to try and hike out and find Daniel’s mom. Where she was at there was food and shelter. As we packed our belongings and secured our cars. Our indian guide, Alexis told us he would help us cross the river and get to the road. We started out about seven in the morning and walked down to the river. We were not sure if we should go upstream or down closer to the mouth of the river to cross. As we looked across the valley we could see the road about 10 feet higher than the river. The water had washed the road and all the drainage pipe down stream.
Looking over the valley you could see rock and sand bars between the river currents. Alexis lead us through the currents dodging trees as they rushed down river and shifting rocks as we went. Fighting the currents took all our strength as the water pushed against us forcing us down river; it was by the grace of God we made it at each crossing. At each rock outcropping we found different wildlife waiting on us, from poison dart frogs to bullet ants. We made it about half way upstream when Alexis spotted a fellow Cabécar Indian who motioned we should come back down stream and cross where he was. So we turned around and headed back across the same rocks and currents we had just crossed over. You could hear rocks tumbling in the river as they were carried down stream, they sounded like gunshots as they smashed into one another.
After what seem liked an impossible journey we found ourselves within 60 feet of the rivers mouth. Water was carrying trees and other debris passed us as it rushed down the valley in the Chirripó. Several Cabécar Indians had crossed where Alexis told us to cross. The pastor and his two sons had joined us and were trying to cross to go to the nearest store to buy food. It was 4 kilometers away. Alexis crossed over to a rock outcropping that had several trees piled on it. He made it look effortless. Daniel started to cross but I told him I was not comfortable crossing here so close to the rivers mouth and rocks tumbling in the river, one miss step and one could be swept into the river and carried down stream and never seen again. The water seemed to go down a little and I decided to try and cross to the logjam. I was half way there and the water rose and began pushing me down to the rivers mouth. Alexis grabbed hold of me and pulled me to the rocks. I was now separated from the group.
After seeing the trouble I had in crossing to the log-jam the others decided to try and cross upstream where it had been a little calmer yesterday. Alexis pleaded with them to return and cross where I was but they proceeded upstream. We watched them until they were out of sight. Not long after they were gone several large trees washed down river one catching on the rocks I was sitting on. I began to pray for my friends who were upstream that God would protect them, I prayed for josh and the team that they would make it out. I prayed that God would guide me through currents and to a path to safety.
Alexis was worried because there was no safe place to cross upstream, as if where we had crossed had been safe! We walked on the logjam to the rivers edge and set out walking on the rivers edge. The currents pushed us as we tried to cross from one rock outcropping to another. At times we wadded through 3 feet deep rushing river. It was amazing seeing the destructive force of the river. Trees littered the rivers edge, some wider than cars. After following the river for a couple hundred yards we found an access to higher ground. As we climbed out of river the road was right in front of us.
Alexis began to ask every Indian he saw if they saw the others from my group. After a lengthy conversation we found out they were with another group of Indians trying to cross upstream. Alexis told me there was no path to safety where the group was and they had to come down to where we were. I waited as he climbed back into the river and watched him fight to go upstream to the others. About a half hour later I saw Alexis coming back with the others belongings and the group behind him. After climbing the muddy bank and we were all happy to see each other. We had made it to the other side! Almost 3 hours to cross but we had made it and we were safe.
Looking down the road we spotted two men in red shirts coming towards us. Daniel shouted, “It’s my Dad!” Pastor Eric and Alvaro, a member of the church, had found us. They brought us clean drinking water and food. After some more celebrating our reunion we began to walk out to where the car was located. After a couple kilometer walk we spotted the car, it was on the otherside of a bridge that had been washed out.
After driving towards the highway we found the trailer and sitting by another river crossing with a steep hill on the other side. After wrestling with the trailer and slip sliding up the hill we were on our way home. As we drove out of the reserve you could see how far the floodwaters had pushed inland. All the way to the highway and beyond water had pushed it way passed everything in its path. We had to detour through the town of B-line and the damage was worse. Water had been as high as 6 feet. Dogs were on the roofs of houses. It was sobering driving through there knowing most did not have the resources to replace what they had lost.
We proceeded on the highway to San Jose and there were pieces of banana trees over the road. I asked Alvaro where we where heading and he told me Guapiles to join Josh and the rest of the team. It was great to be reunited with Josh and the 7 team members. After a shower and a bowl of hot soup it was time to head home to San Jose. We crammed 18 of us into three cars and headed off. We knew we were overcrowded so 4 of us road the bus back from Guapiles. It was nice slow ride back to San Jose, I could finally relax and give thanks to our Lord for safely guiding us home.
Some one asked if I would go back to Namaldi considering the danger of flooding. Absolutely I would go back. Some one there still needs to hear the gospel. I’d just check the weather report next time!Abstract
Bile acids inhibit cholinergic constriction in proximal and peripheral airways from humans and rodents. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 318: L264-L275, 2020. First published December 4, 2019; doi:10.1152/ajplung.00242.2019.cut slices from human and mouse lungs to BAs and monitored dynamic changes incholinergic bronchoconstrictors. Similarly, secondary BAs strongly inhibited cholinergic constrictions in tracheal rings. In contrast, TC-G 1005, a specific agonist of the BA receptor Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), did not cause airway relaxation, and Tgr5 deletion in knockout mice did not affect BA-induced relaxation, suggesting that this receptor is not involved. BAs inhibited acetylcholine-induced inositol phosphate synthesis in human airway smooth muscle cells overexpressing the muscarinic M3 receptor. Our results demonstrate that select BAs found in BW of patients with lung transplantation can affect airway reactivity by inhibiting the cholinergic contractile responses of the proximal and peripheral airways, possibly by acting as antagonists of M3 muscarinic receptors.

BER.
German Railways on strike- again!
An empty Flensburg Railway Station. No train driver, no trains, but many infuriated passengers, even if none are seen here.
Third union strike in two months. Longest strike in the history of Die Bahn. Court decision on the legality of the strike.
Travellers heading to Berlin for this weekend’s 25th anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall may have to look at alternatives to train travel. Since this yesterday at 4:00pm, the train engineers are on strike, which has put most of the train service at a standstill in all of Germany. This strike is unique for two reasons: 1. This is the third strike in two months and 2. This strike is expected to last five days total (four days for passenger service), which is the longest in the history of the German Railways (a.k.a. Die Bahn). The cause: The arbitration talks between the worker’s union GDL and Die Bahn broke down after the latter rejected demands of the former calling for a wage hike of five percent and a reduction of working hours a week to 37 hours.
The strike has reduced train travel throughout Germany to an average of 30%. This does not include the private railroad providers that are not affected by the strike. Yet this unprecedented strike has caused widespread anger among passengers, industry leaders and even politicians in Berlin. Chancellor Angela Merkel has demanded that both sides hold talks to end the strike as quickly as possible. It is already having a rippling affect on the economy, already predicted to stagnate come 2015 because of problems throughout the European Union. Analysts are predicting a loss of over 100 million Euros a day, while gas companies are predicting fuel shortages as early as Sunday as many motorists hit the roads to either celebrate in Berlin or in the case of school children in Bremen and Lower Saxony, return home from vacation. An injunction is being sought by Die Bahn to end the strikes, with the decision by the Labor Court in Frankfurt/Main to be made this afternoon German time.
Even if the strike ends on Monday at 2:00am, should the Court in Frankfurt rule in favor of GDL, it will eventually force Die Bahn create tougher measures to make striking more difficult to even impossible, it will most likely start a debate in Berlin on the possibility of reforming the strike laws so that they are not used excessively, as is the case with GDL. While the concept is widely known in the US, the idea of Strikebreakers- people who work despite the strikes- will most likely be considered to ensure that train service runs. In either case, with two thirds of the German population being dependent on train travel for holiday travel or commuting to work, this strike will serve as a wake-up call for all parties involved, including those working in Frankfurt and Berlin, that changes in policies regarding employee and employer relations are long overdue. Especially for even if a compromise is reached or the GDL has it their way, the Bahn may have to shed more rail lines to private rail firms, such as Abiello, Cantus, ODEG or even Metronome in order to break even financially. This is something that Die Bahn cannot afford.
Please refer to ARD and Deutsche Welle for more on the Strike. Articles on the Strike can also be found on the Files’ facebook pages.:

The flame still keeps going even after the great ones leave. Photo taken at the Truman Presidential Library in August 2011 the outcome. In the Middle East, many families are talking about creating a new government after overthrowing the dictators in the Jasmine-Spring of last year. Here in Germany, our latest discussion is about Joachim Gauck. Apart from the fact that he was officially elected as the 11th President of Germany (Bundespräsident) thanks to the majority vote of 991 to 237 at the Federal Convention on 18 March, and that he originated from Rostock in Mecklenburg-Pommerania, there is very little information that we know about him right now. Even when I sent a questionnaire around on facebook a couple days ago, the response was blank, assuming that no one knows much about the man at all.
Therefore, I decided to do some research about Mr. Gauck and set my own predictions about how he will run the country and support Chancellor Angela Merkel. The results were amazing. Here are some fast facts that one needs to know about Joachim Gauck:
Flensburg Files Fact File- Joachim Gauck:
1. He was born on 24 January, 1940 in Rostock. His family consisted of sailors, one of whom was his father, who was a distinguished naval officer and ship’s captain. However, his father was taken away to Siberia by the Soviet troops when he was 11 and was never seen again afterwards.
2. While he grew up behind the Iron Curtain, he opposed the East German government and the ideas of socialism to a point where he refused to join the Free German Youth (FDJ) and joined groups that opposed anti-communism. Even the state security police (Stasi) considered him a natural-born opponent and had mentioned his actions in their reports. A good part of that had to do with what had happened to his father.
3. Because he was considered by the Stasi an “incorrigible anti-communist,” Gauck was denied entrance to his studies in German and Journalism and instead studied theology at the University of Rostock and became a pastor at a church in Mecklenburg-Pommerania. At that time, the East German government looked down upon Christianity and had the Stasi spy and harass the church. Gauck was no exception to the rule.
4. At the time of the revolution in 1989, Gauck joined the New Forum, which was a democratic opposition party to the socialist party. He was very active in the organisation, later becoming spokesperson and in March 1990, being elected to the People’s Chamber. It merged with two other democratic parties to form the Alliance 90 party, and upon his departure from the party in 1990, he was elected Special Representative of the Stasi Archives. Since 1990, he has had no affiliations with any of the political parties in Germany. The Alliance 90 party eventually folded into the Green Party in 1993.
5. Gauck worked as Federal Commissioner of the Stasi Archives from 1990 (as Special Representative) to 2000. During his time at the archives, he uncovered thousands of people, mostly in the eastern part of the country, who had worked for the Stasi and exposed the activities of the opposition. Many of the people who had worked for the Stasi lost their jobs in the public sector as a result. In addition, he advocated for human rights and stressed the importance of ensuring that the history of communism in central and Eastern Europe is not overshadowed by the era of the Third Reich and remembering that both National Socialism and Communism were equally bad and thus the history of the two should not be forgotten. He has written about communism which included a chapter in The Black Book of Communism (published in 1998) and was one of the signatory fathers of two key declarations: of both the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism (2008) and the Declaration on Crimes of Communism (2010). On his 70th birthday, Chancellor Angela Merkel commended him for his tireless work of advocating the education about and elimination of communism and other forms of totalitarianism.
6. Gauck was narrowly defeated by Christian Wulff in the Presidential elections to replace Horst Köhler in 2010. Yet Wulff’s scandals resulted in his falling out of favor with the government and the people and subsequentially had to step down from his post. However, many people believe that because of his honesty and tolerance to and acceptance of other people regardless of background, he was touted by many as the “better president.”
Keeping these facts in mind, the next question will be what impact will he have for Germany and the rest of the world? For Germany alone, he will bring the country into calmer waters and provide a fresh start for a government marred by a series of scandals that has resulted in the loss of credibility from the public over the last two years. One of his goals will be to win the hearts and souls of the public and ensure them that Germany is a country that prides itself on high quality, honesty, and transparency. This is something that is rarely seen these days as many countries are paralysed by politicians who are hypocritical and defer responsibility onto others instead of taking them. While Gauck may not be Harry Truman and his policy of “The Buck Stops Here”- where he bore the responsibility of the policies that were burdened by Congress during his administration (1945-53), given his religious background, combined with his past during the communist times, Gauck will ensure that the best way for the country is to be honest, help others in need and have tolerance.
Gauck will definitely provide the government with some much-needed weight with regards to cracking down on right-wing extremism, which includes eliminating the NPD by declaring the party unconstitutional. However, despite years of attempts to make the party unlawful according to German law, Gauck may want to consider rewriting a section of constitution which calls for eliminating any political parties that focuses on any sort of national socialism, socialism/communism, and xenophobia, while at the same time, try to reach out to the youth who are exposed to the right-wing influence, by discouraging that type of behavior.
His last goal will be to improve on international relations with other countries including the US, something that was almost non-existent during Wulff’s short term. He will have the advantage of being an independent and thus having strong relations with the other political parties supporting him, including Merkel’s CDU and the opposing Social Democrats, and even having an influence on their work as he will not have to worry about being influenced by one party or another (like it would have been the case had he been a member). A president who influences the government instead of the government (and in particular, the political parties) influencing the president is something that I hope we see in the US once the elections are completed in November of this year and perhaps if Gauck does a grand of a job in his first six months in office, the presidential candidates and the incumbent, President Obama, should look to him for reference and see what a person can do if he is independent of all the external influences, like it is the case in Washington.
While Gauck may be considered a grandpa by many, after looking at his past through research, I do believe that he is the right man for the job. If he can remain independent and work together on achieving the three primary goals mentioned here, he may end up becoming one of the best presidents in modern German history. But success can only be dependent on two important variables, the ability to take action independently and the ability to lead rationally and responsibly. We have seen the likes of Wulff ignoring the two and paying the price for that, but perhaps Gauck can change that and set an example for other politicians to follow, both in Germany and beyond.
Deutsche Welle also has an analysis on what Gauck will do for Germany and the rest of the world and you can see the report by clicking here.:
Flynnism for the Arrogant and Cocky
This column includes some stories from the Flensburg Files News Flyer
There are some people who are born to greatness and prove it through word and practice, both as a professional as well as in private life. They set examples for others (especially in the younger generations) to follow, endure and prevail in hardships, and succeed the hardest way possible, through the four Ps of success: perseverance, patience, passion, and persistence. Yet there are many who love to pretend they are the greatest, by showing off their greatness to the world with their words only and not showing the colors that fit the description. Many times, these marketing techniques can fail miserably through poor performance and scandals that can ruin ones popularity beyond repair. It is like buying a luxury car that has all the features a person could ever ask for (air conditioning, GPS computer, built-in cup holder and retractable seating), only to find that an important component (like the brakes or wiring) fails, and the driver loses control of the car, ending up crashing into a wall or a lake and paying a dear price for it.
This month so far, we have seen many promis who fell into that category as they showed off their greatness through their mouth but the exact opposite in practice. Tim Tebow, quarterback of the Denver Broncos (in American football the National Football League) pretended he was Jesus Christ in leading the team to the playoffs, knocking out the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round, and talking about his heroics and its connection with religion to the TV audience. This sparked a sensation known as Tebowmania, which many anti-Broncos fans were itching to see him eat dirt in humiliation. The New England Patriots under quarterback Tom Brady took care of that wish by not only burying him and his team 45-10 in the second round this past weekend, but also using him as a tackling dummy (and making him eat grass in the process). So much for Tebowmania, huh?
Then there is another American football team that everyone loved to hate with a passion, the Green Bay Packers. For 15 out of 16 games, they pummeled every single mediocre football team by an average score of 35-7. Yet the only loss was to another mediocre team (Kansas City), and the cracks started to show. Still, the team was way too proud and cheesy to address the problems and still stressed their greatness to the public. Bring in the New York Giants, a team that won only nine games and were projected to lose in the second round in the playoffs, and the team under Eli Manning disrobed the Pack under Aaron Rodgers on their home turf at Lambeau Field. I guess Goliath can bring down David after all. After all, the telephone switchboards of 1-800 GET HELP were blinking like a Christmas tree full of despair Packers fans after the Giants walked off the field feeling glorious and preparing for the NFC finals game against the San Francisco 49ers next week.
I just know that there was the sound of Angela Merkel, Germany’s Chancellor doing a solo for the Mozart Requiem the next morning when I found out about the Giants’ clear cut victory over Green Bay, because it can be heard clearly throughout all of Germany from the halls of the German Parliamentary Building in Berlin. Perhaps she is a Giants fan, but maybe it is because she is broiling in her own anger because of another scandal that has hit the Parliament; this time it involves the German President Christian Wulff and his private loan affair to purchase a house.
It is hard to believe that Wulff can hold the second most powerful post in the German government (behind Merkel), smile in the face of the public and have the nerve to inform the public on how to be frugal in our spending for 2012 during the Christmas Eve address, that was watched by over 20 million viewers, but at the same time, expose his own corruptive deeds through his own actions. And to exacerbate the situation further, he threatens the media with actions that are considered unlawful to today’s standards. Apparently he does not like the fact that the media is already writing him off for dead and that it is glorifying the Social Democrats for planning his successor for Merkel. Perhaps if and when the Dream Coalition gets voted out of office in 2013 the future former cabinet members would rather take a trip on a cruise ship off the coast of Italy. After all, if they have a captain who can abandon ship after running it aground and tipping it over- before all the passengers leave, that is- they can relate their experience in the Bundestag to the events that occurred off the coast of Toscana.
That would be invincibility is a recipe for disaster unless you know how to deal with the people first and- in a proper way. Talk is cheap if you are unable to show your actions and impress the people first. Even my former math teacher and high school track and field coach once said that a person’s mouth and actions will determine one’s destiny. He is definitely right about that, yet people don’t seem to take that advice nowadays.
I would like to close this column by bidding farewell to a judge whose wit and charismatic actions have coined another terminology in the legal dictionary. Jeffery Flynn, the 5th Judicial Court Judge in Minnesota, whose residence is in Worthington, Minnesota, is stepping down after 27 years. He provided students at high schools throughout the region with a whiff of what life in the legal business is all about, encouraging even some of my friends and former classmates to embrace the business, either as a lawyer, solicitor or even a judge. His quotes to the convicted and to the audience helped coin the term Flynnism, and while some examples would take another page of my column (you can read the article here: ), it sometimes makes me wonder what he would have to say to the people who have fallen flat on their faces so far this month. Before I make my prediction on that, I will just leave this last part blank and hope that when he has the opportunity to read this column, he can close it with some comments on his own. Besides, his Flynnisms for the hot-headed whose air has been released (regardless of which side of the Atlantic they are on) can only be done by the person who has done his deeds to the criminals for all those years.
Flensburg Files News Flyer:
Apart from Flynn stepping down, the Giants have made it to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2008 and will have a rematch with the New England Patriots. The last time these two teams met in the Super Bowl, the Giants spoiled the Patriots run for a perfect record, which would have been the second time this happened. Game time is the 5th of February and given all the rumors from the audience and within the American Football league NFL, this could be the last time the Super Bowl is played on a Sunday. Proposals for a Super Saturday is in the making even as this column comes out.
ALSO:
Calls for German President Wulff to step down are getting louder, for despite him presenting his financial records that are in connection with the real estate scandal, the media organizations have accused him of making threats to the yellow press for exposing his housing loan and abuse of power, and his former press secretary Olaf Glaeseker is coming under fire for assisting him in some of the cover-up. The Opposition (SPD, Green and the Socialist party Die Linke) have been trying to work with Chancellor Merkel on finding a successor for Wulff, should he decide to step down sometime in the course of three months. And even some of the members of his own party (the Christian Democrats) are expressing their dismay and have recommended Wulff to step aside in the interest of the party and his own family. Currently, approval ratings have dropped from 72% to a sobering 30% in the course of two weeks. What will happen next remains to be seen.
As for the tragedy off the coast of the Tuscan Island of Giglio, 17 deaths have been recorded so far (six coming from Germany) with attempts to find the remaining 20 passengers being very difficult because of the capsized luxury ship slipping off the reef and into the water. The captain of the ship has come under fire because of his inability to see the passengers off the ship and the excuses that were made, such as falling off the ship into the lifeboat. Needless to say, even if he is acquitted, his days of navigating the ship are finished after this incident.

Scientists have been exploring the role cyclin D, a protein that regulates cell replication, plays in the development and death of tumors found on walleye, a North American freshwater fish. The skin tumors, walleye dermal sarcoma, appear and disappear seasonally, says Don Holzschu, assistant professor of molecular biology at Ohio University and a lead researcher on the project.
First reported in a National Cancer Institute monograph in 1969, these tumors -- which appear in the fall and die during the spring spawning season -- seem to pose no health risk to humans, according to officials with Ohio Sea Grant. Walleye infected with the tumors have been reported in rivers and lakes throughout North America, including in Ohio, New York and Canada.
Researchers suspect infected walleye spread the virus that causes the tumors during the spawning season, when all the fish are grouped together. "It's just like sending your child to daycare," Holzschu says. "It's a perfect time to spread the virus." It's thought that the virus grows over the summer and tumors begin to appear in the fall. By spring, the tumors are dying and the infection is passed to other fish.
While the seasonal nature of the tumors is enough to keep the scientists' interest, new studies have added to their fascination with this project. In their analysis of the viruses that cause walleye dermal sarcoma and another skin disease, walleye dermal hyperplasia, researchers have discovered the culprits for these infections are three retroviruses that are unlike any ever studied.
A retrovirus is a virus that has RNA as its nucleic acid and uses the
enzyme reverse transcriptase to copy its genome into the DNA, whic

RFBI Coffs Harbour Masonic Village held a Medieval themed Christmas luncheon and it was a lovely sight to see all staff and residents dressed for the occasion. Titled “A Medieval English Christmas Feast Gone Wrong” was a skit produced by our very own resident, Shirley with CHAT Productions (a local theater company) and it involved everyone attending at the Village. It tells the story about a recently married Duke and Duchess of the Amazon who sat with the local court – staff and residents at their Christmas luncheon.
It was such great fun and amazing effort by staff and volunteers to organise such a festive luncheon for our residents and guest. This will be talked about for days!

The competitive action gets under way from Losail on April 21 and the event finishes at the rally bivouac, near Sealine, on April 25.
The fourth round of the FIA World Cup for Cross-Country Rallies and the second event in the FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship calendar has attracted 37 teams in the car category – including nine FIA Priority drivers - and 18 competitors on bikes and quads.
Both lists include all the respective championship protagonists, with the host nation’s former Dakar winner Nasser Saleh Al Attiyah returning to cross-country rallying action with an X-raid Mini All4 Racing for the first time since he finished third in January’s Dakar Rally.
“This event is special to me and I always enjoy competing in Qatar,” said Al Attiyah, who won the Qatar International Baja candidate event in a SAM Mercedes 35CC in 2011 and claimed outright victory in the inaugural Sealine Cross-Country Rally with the Overdrive Toyota team in 2012.
“My result last year was disappointing, but I know the Mini team well and I am confident that I can win the event with this team. It won’t be easy. The race is longer this year and more demanding and many drivers are chasing the championship and will be looking for as many points as they can pick up.”
Al Attiyah faces fierce competition on four wheels, with the high-flying Russian FIA World Cup leader Vladimir Vasilyev lining up in a second Mini and Saudi Arabia’s Yazeed Al-Rajhi returning to the Overdrive Toyota team with whom he won the opening two Baja rounds of the championship in Russia and Italy.
Minis and Toyotas dominate the upper reaches of the car entry list, which also includes the Qatari drivers Mohammed Al Mannai, Sheikh Hamed bin Eid Al Thani, Abdullah Al Rabban, Faisal Al Attiya, Jamal Fakhroo, Khalid Al Mohannadi and Khalid Al-Salam.
All drivers will start the opening selective section at two-minute intervals as per seeding order on the entry list.
The factory Honda and KTM cross-country teams are the highlight of an impressive motorcycle entry. The 2013 event was decided on the final stage and, if the last stage excitement of the recent Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge is anything to go by, this year’s Sealine event promises to be equally as enthralling.
Dakar winner and defending Sealine champion Marc Coma, Ruben Faria, Jordi Viladoms and Sam Sunderland front the Red Bull KTM challenge, but Team HRC Rally includes recent Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge winner Paolo Goncalves, Helder Rodrigues and the impressive Spaniard Joan Barreda-Bort.
Mohammed Abu Issa and Adel Hussein will represent Qatar on a pair of Honda and Yamaha quads at the rear of the field, although Poland’s Rafal Sonik tops the quad runners.
Administrative checks and scrutineering will take place at the Losail circuit on April 19 and April 20. In a compact total route of 1,912.95km, 1,739.55km will be competitive.

- Story Text:Hondurans took to the streets Wednesday (October 9) to oppose the government of President Juan Orlando Hernandez who is battling accusations that his brother has links to convicted drug traffickers.
Hundreds of Hondurans peacefully marched on the streets of the capital Tegucigalpa Wednesday, even as that same evening some protesters clashed violently with police in riot gear who fired tear gas in response.
Protesters cited the New York trial of the president's brother, Juan Antonio "Tony" Hernandez, a lawyer and former Honduran congressman, who is accused of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and possessing illegal weapons, as part of their opposition to the government.
Tony Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. A witness at his trial testified Tuesday (October 8) that Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman tried to give $1 million to President Hernandez's election campaign after being promised protection for his cocaine shipments.
The president has denied taking money from Guzman or other drug traffickers.
U.S. prosecutors have said Tony Hernandez, with the protection of his brother, moved tons of cocaine into the United States, some of it stamped with his initials, and took part in two drug-related murders.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has supported Juan Orlando Hernandez, a conservative, as a staunch ally in the fight against drug trafficking. In Honduras he has faced mounting popular opposition since he was sworn in for a second term in January 2018 despite allegations of electoral fraud.

- However Is It Really Secure? And Why Is It Called Blockchain?
Each block in a chain has its personal id – a cryptographic hash that is distinctive and particular to every block. That hash can also be stored within the next block in the chain, causing a link. A block can retailer thousands of transactions and the tiniest change in that block’s data would result in a new hash. So if a hash modifications but the subsequent block has a unique hash, then we know some data in the earlier block was tampered with. All of the above examples are proof that this know-how is right here to remain and will be a vital source sooner or later. Mining includes producing the hash of a block transaction, which is hard to forge, thereby guaranteeing the security of the complete Blockchain without having a central system. Blockchain expertise makes use of hash encryption to secure the information, relying primarily on the SHA256 algorithm to secure the data.
To know what’s blockchain, it is very important understand how it’s formed and how it is different from different traditional methods. This transaction is further propagated by forming a P2P community, in which the friends validate the transaction.
All You Should Learn About Ethereum
The advantages of Blockchain promise positive transformations for IP companies. However, the process of adopting Blockchain could be advanced and can take time to action. This may considerably reduce complexity and encourage more corporations to guard their concepts.
Therefore, the reward will continue to split till the twenty-one millionth bitcoin is created, at which point miners will only obtain transaction charges. Everyone has entry to the info inside each individual cell and saves a copy to their personal laptop. The information throughout the spreadsheet is shared between a number of individuals. However, no one can alter an individual cell or change the present information. In the blockchain world, we call this “immutable”—the inability to change or modify one thing over time. A deep dive into the workings of a blockchain, including mining, consensus algorithms, block instances, wallets, nodes, and extra. Some small businesses, like tech startups, might develop blockchain know-how themselves.
Blockchain Vs Bitcoin
While the fast rate of change spelled the top for Blockbuster, another legacy company has refused to fade into the historical past books. The personal information of hundreds of hundreds of thousands of Americans have been compromised, together with sensitive data corresponding to residential addresses and social security numbers. SMBs and large corporations alike are taking precautions against assaults within the wake of the information breaches at Equifax, Yahoo, and Target. To contemplate the massive image, adopting this revolutionary, immutable technology means fraud is significantly minimized, if not eradicated. Any concerns of third-events interfering with inaccurate data on job applicants might be a factor of the past. Furthermore, payroll will be streamlined, even for multinational firms and firms with overseas staff.
Anyhow, you’ll have to store the non-public key in a secure place since you’ll use this key to sign or perform any motion on the community. On the other hand, other users will use your public key to find you on the system. Initially, when a person creates a transaction over a Blockchain community, a block will be created, representing that transaction is created. Once a block is created, the requested transaction is broadcasted over the peer-to-peer network, consisting of computer systems, generally known as nodes, which then validate the transaction.
How Does The Blockchain Work? Nicely Right Here Is A Simple Rationalization That Cuts Through The Hype
For example, blockchain might make the concept of a “self-sovereign identification” for employees a reality, Roddy said. “It’s the thought of individuals being able to fully control knowledge about themselves,” he said. When the grain is shipped to the miller, a transaction between the elevator and miller will happen. First an elevator checks the product’s ownership by way of blockchain platform to ensure what was received meets the standard claims of the offered product. Then a message might be sent to the blockchain indicating the product is checked and obtained, and ownership is transferred from elevator to the miller.
They can be used to effect transactions in a number of different fields, from processing insurance premiums, authorized processes, to crowd-funding agreements. Blockchain’s distribution system does not lie in creating a number of authentication layers but within the distribution. Since blockchain solutions perform via distributed, encrypted, and shared ledgers throughout community’s users, it leads to a community of validation that can be verified, traceable, and onerous to hack.
Blockchain
Thousands of computer systems on the blockchain rush to confirm that the small print of the acquisition are right. After a computer has validated the transaction, it is added to the blockchain block.
Permissioned chains may also be differentiated into public permissioned and private permissioned blockchains. Blockchain technology can be utilized to create a permanent, public, clear ledger system for compiling information on gross sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wi-fi users or musicians. The Gartner 2019 CIO Survey reported 2% of upper training respondents had launched blockchain initiatives and one other 18% had been planning educational tasks in the subsequent 24 months. In 2017, IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to undertake blockchain technology in music distribution. Imogen Heap’s Mycelia service has additionally been proposed as blockchain-based mostly different “that gives artists more management over how their songs and associated knowledge circulate among followers and other musicians.”

In the normal shopper-server architecture, we retailer transactions records in a database, in a centralized location. Now you should have got a clear concept of how blockchain works and why miners can earn bitcoin by mining bitcoin. Blockchain is an algorithm and distributed information structure for managing electronic cash with no central administrator among individuals who know nothing about one another. Originally designed for the crypto-foreign money Bitcoin, the blockchain structure was pushed by a radical rejection of at (government-guaranteed) cash and bank-managed funds.
This is all carried out automatically in Mary’s pockets and double-checked by the bitcoin network nodes; she solely sends a ten BTC transaction to John’s pockets using his public key. When you encrypt a transaction request along with your pockets’s non-public key, you’re producing a digital signature that is used by blockchain computers to verify the source and authenticity of the transaction. The digital signature is a string of textual content resulting out of your transaction request and your non-public key; subsequently it cannot be used for different transactions.
What Is Hash Rate?
Hospitals and distributors also utilized a blockchain for wanted medical gear. Additionally, blockchain technology was being used in China to hurry up the time it takes for medical insurance funds to be paid to health-care suppliers and sufferers. Food supply — Blockchain expertise is being used to allow retailers and shoppers to track the provenance of meat and other meals products from their origins to shops and restaurants. Walmart and IBM are operating a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for supply chain monitoring for lettuce and spinach — all nodes of the blockchain are administered by Walmart and are situated on the IBM cloud.
So you could have heard of criminals buying Bitcoins illegally in numerous methods, but these crimes often take place before the cryptocurrency was acquired, for example by having others mine for the risk actor. Or afterwards, for example by stealing wallets or even robbing a Bitcoin exchange.
Blockchain Privacy And Security
No one, not even a system administrator, can delete a transaction. To velocity transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract — is saved on the blockchain and executed routinely. A smart contract can outline conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more. All network members have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable report of transactions. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only as soon as, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of conventional enterprise networks. Blockchain is going for use for extra than simply currency and transactions. To offer you an thought of how seriously it’s been studied and adopted, IBM has 1,000 staff working on blockchain-powered initiatives.
It’s much like your password; it mustn’t get hacked and you shouldn’t disclose it to anyone. If someone will get entry to your non-public key, there’s a excessive chance that your account is compromised, and also you might find yourself shedding all of the cryptocurrency deposits in your account. But giving out your e mail handle doesn’t mean someone will be able to ship out emails by way of your account. Someone must know your e-mail account’s password to do that. Blockchain wallets follow an identical course of using a public key and a private key together.Resources for Change are supporting the Sarah Brisco Trust and local partners to plan, develop, and fund a transformational project in Sarah Brisco House. This historic building in the heart of Newtown was built in memory of Robert Owen, founder of the Cooperative movement, who was born and raised nearby.
We were brought in to guide and support the group to reach a stage where they are ready to apply for funding to realise their ambitions. We started by identifying the needs and opportunities through interviews and dialogue with the project partners and current users of the building. We then developed these into specific aims and objectives and a defined proposal and produced a Business Case to present the case for the proposed development. It includes expanding the museum, improving accessibility, providing spaces for local businesses and entrepreneurs at the heart of the town, as well as providing a reading and education resource as part of the trust’s charitable objectives.
We advised the group on the next steps to take, identified potential funding to enable them to commission a community consultation to ensure the development addresses local needs and delivers the maximum local benefit. The funding also enabled them to commission an architect to draw up initial plans, and scope and the feasibility and costs of various options.
Coronavirus has put the work on hold, but the next steps will be to undertake the community consultation and support the group to develop an evidenced plan that also contributes to a wider effort to regenerate the town centre, and the aims of the newly published Newtown Place Plan.
The final step will be to develop the detailed plans for the development and support the group in identifying and acquiring the capital funds to realise their vision.Huffington Post, 8/2/11
In quick succession, two brightly lit danger signs burst on President Obama's re-election road. The first was the recent Washington Post/ABC poll that found that there are nearly as many African Americans who say that they are displeased with Obama's performance as those who say that they approve. The prime reason for the discontent is jobs, or the lack thereof, in black communities., and given the crushing burden of having to beat back every effort by the same forces determined to hack, slash and vaporize any spending on education and infrastructure. Nonetheless, the perception is still that Obama hasn't done enough on the black jobs front. And that hurts.
The second danger sign is directly tied tight to the first. When Congressional Black Caucus chair Emmanuel Cleaver flatly called the debt ceiling deal a "sugar-coated Satan sandwich," that raised eyebrows and the inevitable and seemingly eternal question: is this yet another signal that the Caucus is displeased with the president's compromise and conciliation with the GOP to get a debt ceiling deal, or is there a deeper meaning, namely, and certainly not to feed any public impression that their support for Obama -- and, by extension, that of black voters -- has in any way diminished.
But the other side of that fine line is the crisis of black joblessness, compounded by an exploding wealth gap between black and white households that is at a modern-times high. The expectation, driven by mounting desperation, is that Obama must take off the wraps and mount a frontal assault on the problems of the black poor. But that bumps up squarely against the political reality that the GOP, Congress and a divided and just-as-conciliatory Democratic Party have severely restricted the already tightly constricted political maneuverability that Obama had to jumpstart new initiatives and programs to tackle the jobless plight of black males and the disproportionate number of blacks in home foreclosure, spend more to combat failing inner city public schools and black homelessness, and push criminal justice reform.
The criticisms of Obama's perceived failings have hit the mark with some blacks. But criticism means little when faced with the stark political reality, and that's that, no matter how poorly some blacks think Obama has performed in confronting urban problems, and how much they rail at him for being too willing to make nice with the GOP, and even to reach out to other groups such as gays and Hispanics but not to black groups. But if not Obama, then who? It's beyond absurd to even suggest that was the Democratic presidential contender or not. Even if some blacks, out of frustration, discontent or dislike for Obama, were tempted to look elsewhere, the GOP contenders have made it clear in word and deed they will mount a full assault on every program and initiative on health care, education, infrastructure investment, labor and civil rights protections and, most importantly, increased federal spending on job creation, as well as holding the line on funding cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. Few black voters are prepared to back anyone that would do that.
The fall-off in Obama's poll approval ratings among some black voters is no surprise. The expectation that Obama could whipsaw a GOP that has dug its heels in and opposed any and every program and initiative on Obama's legislative table, corporations and banks that refuse to prime the job creation and lending pump, a legion of vacillating and weak-willed Democrats, and a towering financial crisis,, which is streamed onktym.com, featured as a podcast on blogtalkradio.com, and presented as an Internet TV broadcast on thehutchinsonreportnews.com.

Karina lives next door to Chris and goes to school with him. They used to tolerate each other, and she thought he was decently nice, but on the first day of middle school, idiot boys on the bus made fun of Karina's arms for being hairy, and Chris went along with them. Told in alternating view points, we hear from Chris, who doesn't like the jerky boys, but isn't quite sure how to stand up to them. He likes Karina, so when her grandfather, Papa, moves in with Karina's family and starts to tutor at her school, Chris is glad to be able to make a connection with her. The tutoring goes well, but when the three are outside the school, a man gets out of his car and starts harassing them. He spews hateful racist things and pushes Papa to the ground, injuring him badly. Luckily, other adults in the area do the right thing, photograph the car's license plate, call an ambulance, and stay with the children. Papa ends up in the hospital in need of surgery. Karina is very interested in photography, and manages to get some very moving pictures of her grandfather's glasses on the ground, and posts these to social media with messages against hate. These are much read, and the woman who helped, Mrs. Maxwell, is a reporter and interviews Karina. The community rallies around them, Papa improves, and Chris and Karina are good friends.
Strengths: Like this author's Abby Spencer Goes to Bollywood, this is an engaging, well-written story with interesting characters. It has the added bonus of including the very timely topic of hate crimes against people of color. I loved Papa's history; while younger readers won't quite understand the impact of Papa having come to the US in 1968, it struck me how difficult it must be for people who have been here that length of time and still have problems with people being mean to them. The use of hashtags and social media is not overdone, and certainly a part of cultural awareness these days.
Weaknesses: It always seems far fetched to me when a tween posts something and it goes viral, but that's probably me just being bitter that after almost 14 years nothing of MINE has gone viral!
What I really think: This was just a good story that was fun to read. The cover is fantastic. I see it being a long term investment, like Save Me a Seat or Front Desk. It would be a great read aloud for the new school year!

My father was just an infant when the Dionne quintuplets defied odds by surviving their birth in 1934. Their parents, Oliva and Elzire Dionne, were farmers who were doing just a little better than their neighbors, despite their six children. Elzire's pregnancy had been difficult, and even though it was expensive, she had consulted Dr. Dafoe, the local GP. When she went into labor two months early, the midwives consulted him yet again. When five babies, all very small, were born, he advised keeping them warm and handling them as little as possible, feeding them minute amounts of improvised formula and a little rum if they took a turn! Despite this, they survived, and their care was debated and mismanaged from the beginning. Because of an ill-advised contract with an American company to show them at the World's Fair, custody was given to the government. This helped with the massive amount of care that they needed, and a nursery building was built across the road. Unfortunately, the parents were denied access, at first under the guise that the children were medically fragile, and then just as a matter of course. This was an issue that was constantly fought, but Dafoe managed to triumph. Sadly, the girls were kept separate not only from their family, but from other children, and when they were finally returned to their family at the age of nine, it was difficult for them. Their father arranged for them to be educated by nuns with a few select children, and even their college education was very sheltered. This lead to problems in their later lives, and the girls never did feel at home with their family, which is not surprising, especially considering that their father was abusive. This book is a terrific overview of everything Dionne!
Strengths: The average twelve year old has NO idea about the Dionne's and how impossibly famous they were at the time! This is a fascinating topic, and Miller covers it beautifully, from caring for the tiny babies to the swirl of tourism that surrounded them... until it didn't. Very complete, well researched, and engaging to read. I can't wait to have this on hand for my students who love nonfiction, and also for those who are up for something different!
Weaknesses: I was expecting a novelization, similar to this author's Miss Spitfire, and I was envisioning a story told from the perspective of one of the quints (I was hoping for Marie!). It's hard to be disappointed when so much good factual information is laid out, but I think my expectation made it harder for me to process some of the nitty gritty details about custody and other legal issues. Still a great resource!
What I really think: Definitely purchasing! I think that Ms. Miller should retell the story of Karen Killilea for modern middle grade readers. I don't know why that kept popping into my mind as I read this book, but I remember being enthralled with the book Karen when I was in middle school, but it is very long and detailed. It is interesting to see how people who were different were treated in the past!
The shoulder pads are impressive and make me feel very powerful!
Count Me In is one I loved. You've reminded that I have a copy of The Miracle and Tragedy of The Dionne Quintuplets that I've forgotten about. I need to pick it up and read it!
I have Count Me In on my list and of course remember about the Dionne Quints, but not the details. I imagine some kids will enjoy reading this one. Thanks, Karen.
Count Me In is on my list. I am going to be looking for this book about the Dionne Quintuplets. As a Canadian, I can't help but know about them. A couple of weeks ago I finished an adult book that had a fictionalized version of them. I need to find out how much of it was based on truth.
I had no idea what the life of the Dionne Quintuplets was like but, wow, it was terrible. I didn't know about them but there were Dionne Quintuplets paper dolls at the local five and dime and my mom told me about them then because they were part of her childhood, too.
I do, however, enjoy your wardrobe choices each day. I hope you keep it up, at least for a while longer.
I liked Count Me In as well. I had kind of forgotten about the Dionne Quintuplets. I think kids would be fascinated by that. Thanks for your post.
The Dionne Quints book looks good. Their story has always fascinated me. I'd love a good novelization, too. And why not from Marie's POV? (She has the best name of the five. Just saying. But maybe I'm just biased.)
I'm definitely looking forward to Count Me In and now I'm adding The Miracle and Tragedy of The Dionne Quintuplets to my list. Your review captivated me - can't wait! Have a wonderful reading week!: K U S T O M 9 Event

While total glucose metabolism was stimulated 3-fold by insulin in lean animals (half-maximal stimulation at 400 microU/ml insulin), the hormone had no significant effect on glucose metabolism in obese animals, whatever the concentration used. In lean rats, the endogenous (i.e. hepatic) glucose production was completely suppressed at a steady state insulin concentration of about 360 microU/ml. In obese rats, an insulin concentration as high as 10,000 microU/ml was needed to suppress the hepatic glucose production. These results suggest that, in obese rats 1) basal plasma insulin levels appear to maximally stimulate peripheral glucose metabolism, and the presence of postreceptor defects prevents any further stimulatory effect of the hormone on glucose metabolism; 2) grave impairments of the action of insulin on hepatic glucose production are present, despite a normal responsiveness obtained at pharmacological concentrations of the hormone. These hepatic alterations could be due to postbinding and/or intracellular defects, as well as to defects, yet to be defined, of the homeostasis of insulin counterregulatory hormones.Cool Tables

Vintage chest of drawers Lemur design decoupage vaDrak-Modani Abdication Crisis
The Drak-Modani Abdication Crisis has its origins in the Bovinist Schism of 1676. To placate nativist demands, the King of Drak-Modan, Nathan II agreed to abdicate in favor of his youngest son, John Hilding Waffel-Paine. Prince John had been left to grow up in Drakorda since he was two years old and was seen as a good compromise with those in the Drak-Modani government who wanted less Natopian interference in Benacian politics. In anticipation of the abdication and expecting it to excite anti-Natopian sentiment, Chancellor Davit Teimuraz called for new elections in 1679 to increase his party's plurality to a majority. The chancellor's party, the Modani People's Union, was expected to secure a major victory after dropping its unpopular policy on withdrawing from the Raspur Pact. The unexpected divorce of Clara Sundara resulted in her and her children relocating from Batavia to Drak-Modan. The presence of such a major political figure drastically boosted the Bagelcratican Party's profile.
Fury Elections of 1679
The MPU secured a major victory in the Fury, increasing their share of Fury seats..
Coronation of King John
Nathan II had been preparing for his abdication for several years. He wanted a quick transferal of power and insisted on his abdication and coronation of his son to occur on the exact same day to prevent any republican sympathizers and Natoskeptics from taking advantage of the power vacuum. Nathan II would transmit his letter of abdication to the Fury at 8:00 AM on the morning of 25 Blumuar 1679, John's 8th birthday. John would then be crowned in a simple ceremony in Drakorda Palace, officiated by the Otchim of the Benacian Bovic Church.
- 24.V.1679 - Nathan II abdicates the throne of Drak-Modan.
- 24.V.1679 - John Hilding is crowned King of Drak-Modan.
Clara as Grand Judge
The position of Grand Judge was created as a concession to the Bagelcraticans in exchange for voting to elect Teimuraz as Chancellor. Clara Waffel-Paine was specifically named as the Grand Judge and given certain veto and protection powers over the king and Fury, ostensibly to prevent the naive monarch from doing anything rash and relying on Clara's extensive political experiences. Limiting the power of the king was the ultimate goal of the MPU, and the Bagelcraticans hoped to keep a Waffel-Paine on the throne as long as possible.
Stalemate and Deadlock
Everytime the MPU pass a law to reduce the power of the king and give it to the Chancellor, the Bagelcraticans amend the bill to grant the Grand Judge more veto powers. A traditional lindstromist government begins to form with an increasingly dictatorial chancellor and a veto-wielding judge. Eventually drastic back and forth reforms and concessions culminate in an absolute dictator and a grand judge with the legal authority to execute the chancellor.
Compromise
25.VIII.1679 - The Fury makes sweeping changes to the Laws of Drak-Modan, passing a constitution, and altering the laws to create a lindstromist republic. This allows chancellor Teimuraz to push his agenda through a compliant and loyal Fury while Clara Waffel-Paine ensures the welfare of the people are protected as grand judge.

Originally established in Auburn, NY, in 1989, Auburn Bearing & Manufacturing is considered one of the oldest continuously operating thrust ball bearing manufacturers in the United States today.
Auburn Bearing & Manufacturing has built a strong reputation in the bearing manufacturing industry over the years and is well-known for its unique raceway design, called the Auburn "V" Groove Raceway. This V-groove raceway is designed to contain the ball bearings with four points of contact, and as a result, these bearings are able to operate with much less rolling friction. Auburn Bearing's thrust bearings that feature this V-groove raceway design have the advantage of carrying much larger radial loads than that of the typical round grooved thrust bearings.
In 2006, Auburn Ball Bearing was purchased by Fairport Products, a designer and manufacturer of power transmission parts. Under its new owner, the two companies were merged and become one under a new name, Auburn Bearing & Manufacturing. Today, Auburn Bearing & Manufacturing operates out of Macedon, located in Upstate New York, and the company specializes in custom, obsolete, and hard-to-find thrust bearings in low- to mid-production volumes. Furthermore, the company is increasing its capabilities in manufacturing custom radial bearings.

TOKYO. KAZINFORM The Group of 20 major economies should lead global efforts to prepare for the next pandemic, the head of one of the organizations co-leading a body promoting global access to COVID vaccines has said, expecting their leaders to make progress to that end later this month in Rome.
Jose Manuel Barroso, chair of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, said in an interview with Kyodo News on Thursday that talks are under way regarding the establishment of a G-20 permanent body to coordinate responses to future pandemics and a fund to be deployed for countermeasures.
Such a mechanism should be linked to international agencies such as the World Health Organization, but it could take a very long time for member states to reach an agreement, said Barroso, who has served as prime minister of Portugal and president of the European Commission, Kyodo reports
«While I would welcome these enforcement powers at the multilateral level, I know the world sufficiently to tell it will not happen,» said the chair of Gavi, a Geneva-based international partnership created in 2000 for immunization of children against infectious diseases.
Gavi also co-leads COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access, also known as COVAX, an international scheme designed to ensure access to novel coronavirus vaccines around the world.
Prospects are dim for a potential new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response, likely to be at the center of discussions at the special session of the WHO's decision-making body in November, Barroso added.
Barroso thinks the G-20 is the most likely umbrella under which concrete actions can take place to prepare against future pandemics.
«It is the moment to understand that health is wealth» and that world leaders should give highest priority to public health, he said.
Praising nations making generous donations to COVAX, Barroso called on influential countries of the 20 major economies to show leadership in pushing for progress.
«I urge the G-20 and the global community not to miss this opportunity,» he said.Caruso 30 Molecular Ion Steam 202 Reviews
- Judi Young-petersonBullhead City, ArizonaBest Hairsetter Ever!I saw a TV ad for this product 13 years ago when my hair stylist told me I had to choose between perms and color. Without a perm my hair would NEVER hold a curl. After ordering and using Carusos Molecular Hairsetter I have yet to have another perm. I havent needed one. The curls this product produces last in my hair for two days! I still use daily the little pink "Happy 3-Way Traveler". I just replace the curlers every couple of years. This product has seen me through every change of sytle my hair has gone through over the years and it has worked perfectly every time. Today I wear my hair long and curly. It is the healtiest it has ever been thanks to Caruso and my hair stylist who now lets me color my hair any and every way I like. Thank you for a great productuso Molecular Steam HairsetterI am an over 50 woman who has been using the Caruso Molecular Steam Hirsetter for about 10 years and have been more than just pleased with it. The curls are long lasting and I no longer have any split ends even though my hair is color treateded and long (past shoulder length). With my original one, salt was needed in it to make it steam properly which worked wonderfully even though I live in an area with hard water. Yesterday my original one finally would not work any longer, after almost daily use, and I was panacked that I would not be able to find a replacement. My new one does not require the addition of salt and I cant wait to try it. Dont know what I would do without itThe days following the diagnosis was rough. Accompanying my love one to the doctor was overwhelming at times. The journey was indeed a very rough one, from doctor’s visits, test after test, and major surgery. God knows my heart was in constant pain. But amidst it all we kept praying and trusting God all throughout the journey. Some days were harder than some but we remain unified in prayer and fasting.
Praise the Lord my heart is filled with immense joy and gratitude today because of God’s healing power in the life of my love one. God is faithful, He is our great healer and physician. He is real, and He can do everything.
I am so blessed knowing I witnessed God’s healing power. It is a blessing to wait upon the Lord, to trust him completely and to see His promises fulfilled.
As always thank you for reading. Feel free to like, share, leave your thought or reblog.
Until we meet again in this space…much love and blessings.♥♥♥Forging physician signatures can get someone booted from the marijuana industry and could lead to jail time.
That’s the hard lesson Carolan Krajewski, owner of Delaware Holistic Medicine, is learning after pleading guilty to tampering with public documents. The business, which previously was known as Disjointed, provided health records to help patients get medical marijuana cards.

Court documents show she pleaded guilty to first- and second-degree charges of tampering with a public record. Her sentence of two years in jail was suspended for probation, according to the court order.
Krajewski is not allowed to have contact with her former clients or participate in any future medical marijuana business. She was arrested for falsifying client paperwork in June.
The report didn’t include comment from Krajewski, a lawyer or her clinic.

WaltTam Siu-yin | Radio Free Asia
China is a “festering” black hole when it comes to freedom of the press, a Paris-based media watchdog said in a recent report.
China fell one place lower on Reporters Without Borders’ (RSF) annual Index of Press Freedom, the group said, “because of the monopoly of power exercised by [its] president Xi Jinping.”
Citing Xi’s amendment of China’s constitution to enable him to serve a second, indefinite term in office, RSF said that the ruling elite suppress all debate in the country’s state-run media, “while cracking down relentlessly on citizen journalists who try to make a dissenting voice heard.”
“China’s anti-democratic model, based on Orwellian high-tech information surveillance and manipulation, is all the more alarming because Beijing is now promoting its adoption internationally,” RSF warned.
Not happy with obstructing the work of journalists within its borders, China is now trying to establish a “new world media order,” the report said.
“The Chinese system of total news control is increasingly serving as a model for other anti-democratic regimes,” it said.
More controls in recent years
Chinese media commentator Jin Zhongbing agreed with the report’s findings.
“There is a general sense that there are more [controls] in recent years, including legislation and various kinds of regulations, than there were before,” Jin said. “Those of us who work in the media often find that our stories don’t get published, because they touch on certain sensitive words.”
“It feels as if the definition of what is sensitive is getting broader and broader,” he said. “The space left by these policies is getting smaller and smaller, so it’s a worrying situation.”
Bruce Lui, senior journalism lecturer at the University of Hong Kong, said that even journalists working in or traveling to Hong Kong could be at risk of arrest for alleged infractions of Chinese law, under a proposed amendment to the city’s extradition law allowing the rendition of “suspected criminals” to mainland China at Beijing’s request.
“It used to be fine once you had gotten across the border into Hong Kong, but now, people will start to wonder whether they should take on certain types of reporting,” Lui said.
“If [journalists] pursue certain stories, such as anything to do with the military, or the assets of the family members of Chinese leaders, offshore companies and so on, then they could get you on any pretext,” he said.
“I think this is going to make some journalists a bit less bold about uncovering information in mainland China,” Lui said. “Ultimately, it will have an impact on the media’s function in monitoring those in power, and the public’s right to know.”
“It will mean that those in power have a totally free hand,” he said.
An extension of the CCP
President Xi has insisted that the state media are an extension of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), sharing its aims and political goals, and act as its mouthpiece.
Last September, the U.S. Justice Department demanded that China’s official Xinhua News Agency and state-owned international broadcaster CGTN register as foreign agents.
Xinhua News Agency is directly controlled by the CCP and answers to the country’s cabinet, the State Council, while CGTN is the English-language network of Beijing-based state broadcaster CCTV, under the direct control of the party’s Central Propaganda Department.
Media regulators have banned the country’s internet portals like Tencent and Sina from conducting any independent journalism of their own, requiring them to post syndicated content from organizations on the CCP’s approved state media whitelist.
The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC) found in a recent survey of its members in January that more than half thought conditions had deteriorated in 2018, and surveillance and official retaliation had become the hallmarks of reporting from China.
Nearly half of the respondents said they were followed or “were aware that a hotel room was entered without permission.” Ninety-one percent said they were concerned about the security of their phones, while 22 percent were aware authorities tracked them using public surveillance systems.
Overall, 55 percent of respondents said they believed conditions deteriorated in 2018.
Official harassment or retaliation also rendered Chinese nationals working for foreign news organizations vulnerable, the report found, with 37 percent of 91 respondents reporting that their Chinese colleagues were pressured, harassed, or intimidated.

I wrote thee my dearest love two months by a friend going to Ame-

whatever has taken place in my situation since that time, and it is
evident that none will in consequence of the order which arrived here
in July last. I informed thee that I had written in October to the
marine minister of France, but whether another order will be sent
out is very uncertain; nor have I yet learned what steps
Sir Edward
Pellew proposes to take on learning the obstinacy of
general De Caën
to keep me, or what are his sentiments upon it, but by the return
of a French cartel from Calcutta, I expect to receive much infor-

My friends have dissuaded me from throwing up my pa-
role, and insist that I ought to consider myself free to all intents and
purposes without that, since the order of the French government to set
me at liberty has been communicated. In short, my love, I have
nothing certain to tell thee, except that my affection for thee, for my
friends, and my country remain, and ever will, unalterably the same.
I continue to pursue the studies which have relation to
my voyage, with the intention of rendering it as useful as possible;
I enjoy good health, generally, and am happy in the good and kind
family where my fortunate stars first placed me on being liberated
from prison, as also in the favourable opinion and compassionating [sic]United States >

Practice resurrection.
Jacques Ellul died on May 19. The Washington Post noted his passing in a few scant paragraphs. It went unnoticed here in Detroit. Sojourners could readily devote an issue to himand did just that in June 1977, acknowledging a debt to his thought and witness. He tutored many of us in theology and social history.
Personally, I was introduced to Elluls writing as a seminarian through Dan Berrigan, who was then reading the signs of the time with the Book of Revelation in one hand and Jacques Elluls Presence of the Kingdom (1948) in the other. Presence was Elluls postwar manifestoand nearly five decades later it still rings true with an uncanny discerning prescience.
Removed as a professor of law by the Vichy government in 1940, he spent World War II in the French Resistance, spiriting Jews to safety. His postwar take on the times? Hitler won the war. The Nazi spirit triumphed. The atom bomb was emblem of the necessary "fact," the apotheosis of techniqueof means overwhelming and supplanting ends.
In this terrible dance of means which have been unleashed, no one knows where we are going, the end has been left behind. Humanity has set out at tremendous speedtofirst Godsdouls work, though seldom using the language of the principalities, did as much as anyone to unmask the powers, exposing the mechanisms by which a given social realitybe it technology, money, the state, ideology, violence, propagandawould, is a United Methodist pastor and the editor of the forthcoming A Keeper of the Word: Selected Writings of William Stringfellow (Eerdmans, 1994).If you're interested in registering for our newsletter updates and monthly specials please fill in your details below.

UnknownI'm a college student planning to do a mini project. I'v decided to link the college database with the bar code that is already present in our id cards. By using a bar code scanner the bar code can be scanned to retrieve that particular student's data alone..
I'm wary of which database to use as back end, access or sql. Moreover I have the student details stored as excel files.People suggested I use access, as it is easier to convert excel files to access database.But I'm not sure if access would support client server model because the database will be accessed by all departments simultaneously.
I'm also not sure of which front end to use to display the data in forms format.Can I use vb or any other front end??? The data of the database should be modifyable from the front as well as the back end.. I read someone's reply for a access question in which they suggested they could display the details in access database without any special frontend... Is it possible???:confused
I have little knowledge of vb,sql. But i must admit i'm only a Amateur.. I'm totally confuse. Please suggest a front and back end which is compatible with windows xp OS.........
for heavy uses people usually would use ms sql or oracle in most cases.
vb is a backend middle layer language. for front end you can use html/css/js. for backend vb could do.
I'd ask your tutors at college for some guidance, they wouldn't expect you to use anything that hasn't been taught in class.The software that runs the bar code scanner may dictate what technologies you can use.
Thankyou, is it possible for me to store the data in excel sheet itself and display it using html??
That doesn't sound like a good idea to me, you should get the data from excel into a database so you can easily query it.
Again, ask your tutors for guidance on which technologies to use - when you have chosen the technologies people here will be able to help with the specifics.
This sounds like fun little project. This is what I would do.

"Hey Aswang Gang!"
I was basically raised in Bracebridge since my family cottage is there. I was attending the Fire and Ice Festival in town and stumbled upon the one and only K-Dog and Fish store. I had to Pop (haha pun intended) in.
My collecting was pretty limited before walking into that magnificent store, but man didn’t it ever take a turn from that moment on. I love anything that resonates with my childhood and adulthood when it comes to my collecting.
From favourite movie and television series characters, comics, sports, music, name it I have a few Pops relating to my interests. It’s hard to pick any favourites but I 100% have a soft spot for anything Dragon Ball, especially exclusives! I think I’ve kinda made a name for myself at the Live Garage Sales when one comes up!
But I really have to take a moment to thank everyone involved with the Shop. You guys not only got me deep into an awesome world of collecting but have introduced me to a lot of awesome people along the way.
I love tuning in to everything you guys have going on and I look forward to being there for every one I can attend.

Read this article in Persian.
Thirty years after the end of the war between Iran and Iraq a fierce battle is being fought amongst statesmen, military commanders and scholars about the war. Three questions remain contested: Why did the war began in the first place? Why did the war continue after Iran’s liberation of territories occupied by Iraq? And why did the war with Iraq end? Most central documents from the war with Iraq remain outside the reach of scholars, but the open source material to which there is free access provide some answers to these questions. Answers which not only shed light on war era strategic decision making in the Islamic Republic, but also provide valuable insight into mechanisms directing the Islamic Republic’s nuclear strategy today.
Beginning of the war
According to official Islamic Republic historiography the war with Iraq began on August 22, 1980 as Iraqi forces made a surprise invasion of Iranian territory. Grand Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini himself made a point of stressing the element of surprise in the Iraqi invasion: “The usurping government of Saddam attacked Iran from the sea, and air and the ground without any excuse acceptable to the governments of the world and without information or warning and dreaming of conquest,…” Grand Ayatollah Khomeini complained in his October 17, 1980 address to ambassadors of Islamic countries.
However, other sources indicate that Grand Ayatollah Khomeini had been warned of an impending Iraqi invasion of Iran well in advance. In a September 22, 1991 interview with Payam-e Enghelab Hojjat al-Eslam Ahmad Khomeini disclosed that Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar’s chief of staff being denied audience with Grand Ayatollah Khomeini in Paris had warned Ahmad Khomeini of ethnic skirmishes in Iran: “He talked about the domestic problems which were as we ourselves had guessed. He said that there is skirmishes in Torkaman-Sahra, in a different way in Balouchestan and in parts of Kordestan and in the South there are movements called the Arab Nation and we in addition to guessing all this also found it probable that a war would be waged against the revolution.” Ahmad Khomeini also continued that the leadership of the revolution also had received reports on movements of the Iraqi forces before the invasion.
President Abol-Hassan Bani-Sadr’s June 15, 1980 letter to Grand Ayatollah Khomeini concerning movements of the Iraqi forces provides another proof that Grand Ayatollah Khomeini could not have been ignorant of the military threat from Iraq. Bani-Sadr’s September 19, 1980 letter is even more revealing: “I don’t know what happened at your place last night and what the Army and Guardsmen discussed with you. But I find it necessary to report this: 1. One month ago I sent you the exact same commanders who revealed information to you about today’s conspiracy. Afterwards you told me that you do not believe in such intelligence. Today the intelligence has proved right and there is a strong possibility of an extensive fight from the Turkish border to Pakistan.”
Questions abound: Why did Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and his entourage in Paris not listen to warnings of Bakhtiar’s envoy when the revolutionary leadership itself anticipated the war following victory of the revolution? Why did Grand Ayatollah Khomeini ignore Bani-Sadr and the Army commanders’ warnings about the developments on the Iraqi side of the border? And why did Grand Ayatollah Khomeini isolate Iran diplomatically by constantly threatening Iran’s neighbors with “export of the revolution” at a time he was perfectly aware of the threat of invasion?
Iranian academic Sadegh Zibakalam’s conversation with Ayatollah Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani may help solving the mystery. Zibakalam writes: “My conclusion is that deep inside the Imam was happy about the war. He never said so directly, but deep inside he thought that it was not us who wanted to attack the Ba’th regime of Iraq, but now that they have attacked us we will pursue it to the very end.” Ayatollah Rafsanjani responds: “I agree with your view. But it is not true that it was deep in his heart is not correct. He would also say that. He did not hide it.” Zibakalam says that “[Grand Ayatollah Khomeini] had found a moral justification for thinking of and acting towards total collapse of Saddam’s regime.” Ayatollah Rafsanjani responds: “The war gave us a path to solve the regional problems and build our nation. We all said this and the Imam too was of this belief.”
Ayatollah Rafsanjani’s analysis is only too correct. Thanks to the Iraqi invasion of Iran Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and the revolutionary regime managed to rally a fragmented nation around the revolutionary leadership. The revolutionary leadership also managed to keep the remains of the Imperial Army busy at the fronts and effectively out of politics. The invasion also gave the regime the necessary excuse of suppressing popular demand for political freedoms with reference to the state of emergency. The war indeed proved a “divine blessing,” for the regime–A divine blessing actively sought and called for by Grand Ayatollah Khomeini. But hardly a blessing for the national interests of Iran or for that matter those hundreds of thousands of Iranians who sacrificed their lives in war which could have been avoided.
Continuation of the war after Khorramshahr
On May 24, 1982 Iran liberated the city of Khorramshahr ending the Iraqi occupation of the city. But the liberation of Khorramshahr was not to end the war with Iraq. The question is why the Islamic Republic leadership chose to continue the war on Iraqi soil after liberation of Iranian territories.
Ahmad Khomeini was one of the first senior individuals of the Islamic Republic to disclose the secret behind the continuation of the war beyond Khorramshahr. In his September 22, 1991 interview with Payam-e Enghelab Ahmad Khomeini says: “Concerning the issues of Khorramshahr the Imam believed that it was better to end the war, but those responsible for the war said that we must move towards Shat al-Arab (Arvand-Roud) so that we can demand war reparations from Iraq. The Imam did not at all agree with this issue and used to say that if you want to continue the war know that should the war continue with the situation that you have now and should you not succeed this war can’t be ended at all. We must continue to this war to a certain point. Now that the issue of liberation of Khorramshahr has occurred is the best time to end the war.”
The second high ranking individual disclosing Grand Ayatollah Khomeini’s opposition to continue the war after liberation of Khorramshahr is Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri. In his memoirs Grand Ayatollah writes that “according to one account the Imam himself was inclined to end the war but the supporters of continuation of the war imposed their viewpoint upon him.” Grand Ayatollah Montazeri’s account of Grand Ayatollah Khomeini’s preference seems credible, but Grand Ayatollah Montazeri’s family connections and network and their careers taken into consideration it seems highly unlikely that Grand Ayatollah Montazeri was opposed to continuity of the war after liberation of Khorramshahr as he purports to have been.
But who were the “supporters of continuation of the war”? A survey of Ayatollah Rafsanjani’s memoirs provide the answer to this question. In his April 18, 1982 notes Ayatollah Rafsanjani writes: “The war like atmosphere of the country and the high expectations of the people and especially the combatants is such that they ridicule such propositions [of peace negotiations] and they do not consider immediate but conditional withdrawal enough and criticize those responsible for the war effort of why they don’t immediately enter Iraqi soil.” However, consistent with the accounts of Ahmad Khomeini and Grand Ayatollah Montazeri, also Ayatollah Rafsanjani’s account stresses that Grand Ayatollah Khomeini was opposed to continue the war on Iraqi soil. According to Ayatollah Rafsanjani Grand Ayatollah Khomeini conveyed his opposition to him through Ahmad Khomeini on March 26, 1982, and at a meeting with military commanders on June 10, 1982. According to Ayatollah Rafsanjani the military commanders managed to “persuade the Imam” of allowing them to enter Iraqi soil in depopulated or thinly populated areas. Rafsanjani repeats the same account in his conversation with Zibakalam, but also adds the arguments Grand Ayatollah Khomeini used–to no avail–against continuity of the war: “1. After entering Iraqi soil Arab countries will support Iraq more overtly and will display Arab extremism. 2. The people of Iraq have not supported Saddam until now because Saddam was on our soil. But should we enter Iraqi soil the people will support and we should not make the people of Iraq oppose us. 3. If we enter Iraqi soil the people will be harmed. In war, the people of Iraq who have not fought us should not be harmed. 4. Also the world will present us as invaders and will subject us to propaganda pressure.”
These sources show that by May 1982 Grand Ayatollah had developed a degree of political maturity which is a world apart from radicalism he displayed during the first months after the revolution. However, maturity of Grand Ayatollah Khomeini was to no avail faced with the will of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ (IRGC) will to continue the war. Thanks to the war the IRGC had managed to expand its force from a few thousand undisciplined revolutionaries to the most important security, military and even political force in the Islamic Republic. This development would not have been possible had it not been for the continuity of the war with Iraq. In this case it was the IRGC which sacrificed Iran’s national interest and hundreds of thousands of Iranian lives for the sake of its expansionist organizational interests.
End of the war
Following major setbacks in the final phases of the war with Iraq the Islamic Republic leadership accepted United Nations Security Council Resolution 598 and on August 20, 1988 a ceasefire agreement was agreed upon between Iran and Iraq. Grand Ayatollah Khomeini described accept of the ceasefire agreement as being “more deadly than poison,” but assumed complete responsibility for the decision. But what made Grand Ayatollah Khomeini drink from the chalice of poison?
According to Ayatollah Rafsanjani who was appointed commander in chief deputy on June 3, 1988, the heads of the powers of the state meaning Ayatollah Rafsanjani himself, Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Abd al-Karim Mousavi Ardebili, President Ali Khamenei, Hojjat al-Eslam Ahmad Khomeini and Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi knew that “they will not allow us to win in the war.” Therefore, Ayatollah Rafsanjani pursued a strategy of occupying a strategic location after which peace negotiations could commence with Iraq following the dictum “War war until a victory.” Grand Ayatollah Khomeini on the other hand apparently pursued his dictum of “War war until eradication of the discord,” while the IRGC demanded “War war until victory.”
Operating under such difficult operational circumstances coupled with United States downing of an Iranian airbus Ayatollah Rafsanjani was fortunate enough to face new demands from IRGC Chief Mohsen Rezai. According to Ayatollah Rafsanjani, towards the end of the war, Rezai approached Ayatollah Rafsanjani with “a strange list” of military demands in order to continue the war effort. Ayatollah Rafsanjani tells Rezai that he is incapable of providing for such needs and recommends that he writes the demands in a letter to Grand Ayatollah Khomeini. The letter which was written sometimes before July 16, 1988 and first disclosed to the public in 2001 by Grand Ayatollah Montazeri, shows that Rezai had confessed that there would be no victory in the next five years unless almost unlimited resources are directed to the IRGC and the regular military, that Iran develops a nuclear bomb and manages to force the United States to leave the Persian Gulf! Rezai’s letter is quoted in Grand Ayatollah Khomeini’s secret letter to the clerical establishment which is asked to prepare the public for Iran’s acceptance of the end of the war with Iraq.
The issue of the end of the war with Iraq shows that the Islamic Republic was defeated in the war because it failed to achieve its strategic objectives be it “eradication of discord”, “victory”, or for that matter “a victory.” But had it not been for Ayatollah Rafsanjani’s manipulation of Rezai, Grand Ayatollah Khomeini would not have discovered the dire realities of the war which could not be won without the unlimited resources asked for by the IRGC.
Another chalice of poison in the waiting?
Thirty years after the end of the war with Iraq the leadership of the Islamic Republic faces many of the same challenges that it faced during the war with Iraq. The revolutionary leadership is combining the greatest degree of unpreparedness for war with the greatest degree of provocations against regional countries and great powers alike. Threats of annihilation of Israel, ideological competition with Sunni Arab states, systematic provocations against the United States military in Afghanistan and Iraq, along with the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program which is suspected of having a military dimension have left Iran diplomatically isolated and friendless in a dangerous world. Every single day political factions and these days also the Revolutionary Guards, sacrifice Iran’s national interests on the altar of narrow factional interests. Another chalice of poison may be in the waiting for the political leadership of the Islamic Republic, but as always the broader Iranian public will also pay a very high price. This time, not even Ayatollah Rafsanjani may be capable of defending the regime against its own mismanagement.

As regular readers of my blog, you know I love this author’s writing! She is an auto-buy for me when she has new books being released. When this book was released, I immediately bought it!
Welcome to Fool’s Gold! The way the author set up the town was amazing. I instantly felt like I was part of the town. The characters were enjoyable and the writing was great! Charity is an independent woman who gets a new job as city planner in a town that is lacking men. She is introduced to Josh, who is a retired world-class cyclist trying to lay low in his hometown.
Yes, it’s the typical girl meets boy, girl falls for boy, they fall madly in love kind of story, but there is so much more that is involved in the story that you forget about the basic principles of the romance genre. It has suspense in the form of a thief, side characters that will keep you laughing and curious to read their stories in future books, and romance that will leave your heart fluttering.
I so enjoyed visiting Fool’s Gold and I can’t wait to read the next book in the series. If Fool’s Gold were a real town, I would be moving there in a heartbeat!

Aubrey Manaka Hamono -Kisuke Manaka is a relatively young, 5th generation, blacksmith in Kasukabe, Saitama pref. Manaka-san didn’t like the dishonest way his father-in-law operated his business so he decided to become a blacksmith himself. He began making knives from scratch about 10 years ago, with nothing but a workshop full of equipment and no mentor. He is completely self-taught, yet he mastered techniques to forge-weld steels in house, even forge welding stainless steel which is no easy task.
Now he forge-welds everything in house, from hard carbon steel clad with soft steel, stainless steel clad with stainless, and carbon steel clad with stainless steel. The Shirogami #2 steel used in these knives is forge-welded in house by Manaka-san. This is a very traditional steel that can achieve incredible sharpness and has great edge retention, a favourite of more traditional blacksmiths..Dear Michael and Caroline,
We passed through the turnstiles and took the winding ramp upwards. Higher and higher we went, the ground receding below us, until we reached the top level and stepped out into the stands. I never tired of that first glimpse of the field, and I never will.
It’s wondrous. When you’re still a kid, especially, any major-league ballfield seems impossibly green and vast and gorgeous, and at first you suspect you’re dreaming. And this was Yankee Stadium, with its classical frieze rimming the sky, the mother of all stadia. Yankee Stadium during the World Series to boot, the Yankees dominant for so long then, a dynasty.
We went to take our seats, there in the upper deck in left field, about as far away from home plate as you could possibly be without leaving the premises, maybe 500 feet away. It felt stratospheric, like being suspended over the action in a hot-air balloon.
We’d always sat closer in, maybe along the first-base line, or on the third-base side, close enough to hear the crack of bat on ball as it actually happened, close enough to hear a fastball smacking into the catcher’s mitt. Up there in the dizzying upper deck, all you could hear was the roar of the crowd, and the players looked so small. You’d hear bat on ball a fraction of a second after it actually happened.
But none of that, being so high up and so far away from home plate, made any difference to me.
I was at the World Series with my grandfather. What else counted? He loved me enough (and baseball, too) to have taken me there. All other considerations – how short I was, my lousy grades at school, my problems with my parents – fell by the wayside.
The day turned out to be as thrilling as I expected. The 1964 Yankees had Mantle and Maris and Yogi Berra, the Cardinals Bob Gibson and Lou Brock and Tim McCarver. The Yankees took a 3-0 lead, but then Ken Boyer – the brother of Yankees third-baseman Clete Boyer – hit a grand slam, giving the Cards a 4-3 win.
As it happened, he hit the homer to left field. I saw it coming toward us, sailing out from home plate, and held up my glove to catch it. Closer and closer the ball came. But it landed in the first deck, directly down below us. The stadium went wild. At that moment I turned to my grandfather.
“I wish this would never end,” I said.
He looked back at me with a smile I would call serious, outlined in a shade of rue.
“Everything comes to an end,” he said.”
I had no idea what he meant.
Even so, I doubted it was true. How could that be?
For a long time afterwards, I refused to believe him, refused, with all the brute will of an innocent, that anything you loved had to come to an end.Charlie Ruffled Knit Top - Clay..Marketta Fourmeaux, Winemaker / Owner
A native of Finland, Marketta Fourmeaux moved to France at a young age where she lived in Paris. She first earned an M.B.A. in Marketing and Business Administration, and continued her involvement in wine and enological science studies. Among her activities, she evaluated wine for the prestigious Institut National des Appellations d’Origine, and in the early 1980’s came to California to research winemaking and viticulture. Six months of daily wine tastings later, she reported: “Looks good. We stay.”
By 1988, Marketta and her then husband had moved their family to a 273-acre estate on Mount Veeder, Napa Valley to start a new life as winery owners. That winery endeavor was the successful Chateau Potelle. It was here that Marketta made her indelible mark as a viticulturist and winemaker, developing vineyards and growing grapes of great distinction from various regions in California, and producing wines internationally renowned for their balance, elegance and complexity. Her respect for the individuality of each vine and her commitment to “hands-on” winemaking ultimately earned her the recognition as a top-ranking producer of Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, and elevated her beyond the label of one of the world’s first female wine producers into the ranks of the most respected winemakers in America. During this time, Marketta also created the wine style and winemaking techniques for her famed Mount Veeder Estate wines.
In 2007, Chateau Potelle was sold, and in 2008 Marketta founded Marketta Winery, a city cellar winery in historic downtown Napa. Marketta’s mantra, passion of life…life of passion, is reflected in her chosen field. “There is an intellectual challenge of winemaking and working with the variables of nature that thrills me,” she says. “I seek to understand what the wine wants to be and then employ methods based on my observation of the changes that occur as the vines grow, grapes ripen and the wine develops.”
She constructs each wine with a minimum of technical intervention and with natural yeast fermentation to ensure that the wines retain their natural intensity and integrity, resulting in wines of extraordinary balance and finesse. “Each barrel is its own world,” says Marketta. “There’s no special trick, or any one thing that makes good wine. It’s like making a painting – you know you want green, but which green? It’s the simple work and details, the sum of every choice you make—big or small—that ultimately make the wine.”
From the planting of the vineyards to the day the wines are released, Marketta strives to keep the wines’ original character and layers of complexity. The result is wines that are, as the French say, bien élevés—well brought up, and naturally refined and civilized in the very best sense. In addition to new vineyard development and winemaking, Marketta has overseen the vineyard management of the grapes she procures from select vineyards that are sustainably farmed and hand-harvested, block by block. She then ferments the grapes with their natural yeast to preserve the integrity of each individual block’s character.
Marketta is a member of the Napa Valley Vintners, serves as a Board member of The Wine Institute, President of the Alliance Francaise of Napa Valley, and is past president of the Mount Veeder Appellation Council. She is also a frequent speaker on entrepreneurship and wine for business executives, and is involved in several non-profit organizations with which she shares the profits of her activities.
Of special note: The French Consul General in San Francisco hosted a reception at his Private Residence in Marketta’s honor to present her with the prestigious Medaille de Chevalier de L’Ordre du Merite Agricole (past recipients include Louis Pasteur), which she was awarded by the French President and Government for outstanding achievement in her profession both in America and in France.I’ve been writing a lot recently about the feedstock disadvantage naphtha-based European chemical producers have over Middle East and US ethane consumers. In the long term this could have a severe impact on chemical production here.
So the news that INEOS is going to build a 1m tonne/year ethylene terminal at Zwijndrecht, Belgium, raises some interesting possibilities. INEOS could chose to import cheap ethylene from the Middle East and close some European capacity. It has been mulling the future of its smaller, G4 cracker at Grangemouth, Scotland, for some time.
Importing and processing ethylene will not help with the impending structural shortage of propylene, however, caused by greater cracking of ethane and lower refining rates. Cracker economics is a complicated business.
Market sources suggest the new terminal will cost E80m-E100m to build. We at ICIS Chemical Business have been trying for an interview with INEOS since the announcement but they’re being tight lipped.
According to the press release: “Operation of the new deep-sea terminal, which is expected to start in 2012, will significantly change the shape of the ethylene market in Europe.” “Shape” is an interesting word to use.
Once completed, the new INEOS Terminal will be connected directly to INEOS’ ethylene consuming facilities in the Antwerp Rotterdam Area and into Europe via the ARG ethylene pipeline (formerly Aethylen-Rohrleitungs-Gesellschaft pipeline) linking Antwerp to Cologne and the Ruhr industrial areas.
“The INEOS Group is the largest consumer of ethylene in Europe and I am pleased to confirm this significant investment at our Antwerp facility,” said Hans Casier CEO INEOS Oxide. “The new terminal secures the competitiveness of our site and underlines the importance of our production facilities in Antwerp, located at the heart of the largest Petrochemical area of Europe.
“Additionally by connecting INEOS Olefins & Polymers Europe and the INEOS Oligomers LAO/PAO facility in Belgium to the new terminal, INEOS will be able to efficiently balance its ethylene requirements over its facilities in Europe.
“It is also clear the new INEOS Ethylene Terminal will re-shape the ethylene market in Europe, opening up a new gateway to world markets”, he concluded.Open connected medicine is a group of related projects aimed at enabling medical professionals to take full advantage of the connectivity capabilities of medical devices to enhance the quality of care for their patients. Our approach is to build a community focused on developing and enabling widespread adoption of open hardware and software for various clinical needs where connectivity can enhance care, and sharing of best practices and lessons learned in putting this technologies to use in patient care.
Projects
The three current major projects under the open connected medicine initiative are briefly described below. We also work on miscellaneous projects related to connectivity, integration, and technology to support patient care. Contact us if you would like to support or collaborate on our work of if you have a project in mind you think is of mutual interest.
openmedap
The open medical application platform (openmedap) a platform for experimenting with connectivity of medical devices to form a medical application platform, as well as experimenting with applications that leverage the connectivity of devices to support patient care.
We are working on a release of this software that is more accessible to others. Contact us if you would like to work with the current version of the software. You can see a demonstration of openmedap’s capabilities for closed-loop physiology management applications here:
CLAsim
The closed-loop assistant simulation framework (CLAsim) is a framework for experimenting with the kinds of applications openmedap enables using virtual patients. It.
You can find out more about CLAsim on its project page.
openmedlab
The open medical laboratory connectivity platform is a project focused on providing means for laboratory technicians to capture lab test results from various pieces of equipment and push the data captured directly to the electronic health record. This eliminates the need for manual input and reduces the errors associated with manual data entry.
We are in the early stages of this project and will have more to report soon.

We are working with them on device drivers for their devices, focusing currently on lab equipment. Our long-term goal there is to also put openmedap or similar connectivity solution into action in their clinic environment.Hello,
Becca has allowed me the privilege of entertaining you while she's away. My main pastime is fooling with photoshop. One of the things I love about this blog, and one of the reasons I'm so honored to be able to post here, is it's examination of pop culture and the female image. So without further ado I'll present a sample of my works:
In the coming weeks I hope to cover some bases on where to find great source material for creating these kinds of images--the viewing of which is pleasurable in it's own right--and to further expound the virtues of my guiding principles.
Thank you for your attention.

Tastefully Tantalizing . . .
Do you, or have you ever thought of making sexy/artsy calendars? In my artistic opinion, your quite symmetrical and precise compositional style, comfortable ability to embellished digitally and the honest, raw and polished manner in which you present and narrate the imagery and subject matter seem to beg for the pin-up calendar medium. I'd love to see what you could do with a zodiac or bond-girl theme. Just some thoughts I had, when I quickly glanced at those three pics (3-sec NSFW rule). Thanks for keeping this sexy skullcave rollin'.
tres chic,
-Twitchings
The second pic is awesome, so you will have to post more of your art.
oo la la
these are great, post more
thanks
Yes these are indeed really great! Thanks for sharing these and what I'm sure will be some really great posts!!!!
And thank you so much for donating your time and brilliance to help keeping this blog going while I'm soooo busy!
This first pic with the shuttle launch between the legs is great. I have to comment though because I believe the girl in the key-hole pic is "Alison Angel". I'll try to make a long story short but there was a time in my life when I was employed by the owner of that company to author DVDs. For years now I've wanted to do a tell all of that place and it's insanity. Of course I don't want to be held liable for slander-my point is that whenever I see a girl from those days it brings back the horror...the horror!View all headers

Q1. What is self?
Ans. self refers to the receiver of the message. It is usually used within
a method to send additional messages to the receiver. self is frequently=
used=20
when it is desired to pass the sender object (self), as a message argument,=
=20
to a receiver who requires knowledege of the sender or who will in some way=
=20
manipulate the sender.
Q2. What is super?
Ans. super refers to the superclass of the class that defines the message
sent to the receiver.Super is mechanism by which a sender can overide its=20
own defined method hierarchy.
Q3. What are three different message types in Smalltalk?
Ans. 1. Unary messages
2. Binary Messages
3. Keyword Messages
Q4. What is shallow copy?
Ans. shallowCopy returns a copy of receiver which shares the receiver's
instance variables.
Q5. What is deep copy?
Ans. deepCopy returns a copy of the receiver with shallow copies of each
instance variable.
Q6. What are class instance variables?
Ans. Class instance variables are similar to class variables, except that
they are created for eachsubclass.
Q7. What do you get when you inspect Smalltalk?
Ans. An instance of SystemDictionary. SystemDictionary maintains all the
names of classes, global variables and pool dictionaries in the system.=20
Smalltalk is the sole instance of the class SystemDictionary.
Q8. How can I implement stack and queue operations in Smalltalk?
Ans. An OrderedCollection can be used to implement stack and queue
operations. A stack is implemented by using addLast: anObject and
removeLast methods for pushing and poping respectively. A Queue is
implemented by using addLast: anObject and removeFirst methods.
Q9. What is the difference between an array and a set?
Ans. An array is a fixed size collection whereas a set can grow in size. An
array has integer keys and a set is not keyed. A set enforces uniqueness=
upon=20
its members.
Q10. What is the difference between protocol and category?
Ans. The methods of a class are organised in logical groups called
protocols. Classes are grouped together into groups called categories.
Q11. What do I get from 1+2*3?
Ans. 9
Q12. How do I stop the execution of a program?
Ans. By sending message halt.
Q13. What is the difference between =3D and =3D=3D ?
Ans. =3D is a test for equality. =3D=3D is a test for identity (same=
object).
Except for some special classes like Symbol, Character & SmallInteger, two
cases of a value (eg. 1.54) will not be the identical object, just one with
equal value. The special cases are "special" and any variables that points
to such an object will be by definition "Identical".
Q14. How do I iterate a collection?
Ans. By using the following enumeration messages.
1. do: aBlock
2. select: aBlock
3. reject: aBlock
4. detect: aBlock
5. collect: aBlock
6. inject: aValue into: aBlock
Q15. How do I use message perform: ?
Ans. perform: method is used to tell an object to execute a method whose
name, rather than being hardcoded, is sent as a parameter. This means that
the name of the message need not be know until runtime.
anObject perform: #methodName
Q16. What is the difference between detect: and select: methods for
collections?
Ans. detect: aBlock returns the first element of the collection for which
aBlock evaluates to true. select: aBlock returns a collection whose
elements are the elements of the receiver for which aBlock evaluates to
true.
Q17. What is the result of sending collect: [ :each | each > 5 ] to
aCollection?
Ans. A collection whose elements are true and false.
collect:aBlock returns a collection which contains the results of
performing the same operation on each element in the receiver collection.
Q18. What do I use to concatenate strings efficiently?
Ans. Streams.
Q19. What is superclass of Object?
Ans. nil.
Q20. What is subclassResposiblity method used for?
Ans. subclassResponsibility method is used to defer the actual
implementation of a method.
Q21. What is shouldNotImplement method used for?
Ans. shouldNotImplement method is used to indicate that a subclass wants to
undefine a method defined in a superclass.
Q22. What methods do I need to implement if I implement =3D method for an
object?
Ans. hash:
Q23. What method do I need to implement for proxy objects?
Ans. doesNotUnderstand: aMessage
Q24. What are three pseudo variables used by VisualWorks?
Ans. self, super and thisContext.
Q25. What is the difference between SmallInteger and LargeInteger?
Ans. A SmallInteger has fixed number of bytes and a LargeInteger has
variable number of bytes.
Q26. What is the difference between Symbol and String?
Ans. Symbols are similar to strings except that they are unique. This means
that whilst one can create several string objects containing the same
sequence of characters, there will only be exactly one instance of a symbol
with a given sequence of characters.
Q27. What is the difference between Bag and Set?
Ans. A bag can have duplicates whereas a Set contains no duplicate objects.
Q28. What is the difference between chaining and cascading?
Ans. In Chaining, one message can follow on after another. In this case the
second message is sent to the object which is the result of the first
anObject msg1 msg2 msg3
In Cascading, each message is followed by a semicolon (;) and another
message. In Cascading, subsequent messages are sent to the first receiver.
anObject msg1; msg2; msg3
Q29. What is yourself method used for?
Ans..
Q30. What is the difference between isMemberOf: and isKindOf: methods?
Ans. isMemberOf: aClass returns true if receiver is an instance of aClass.
isKindOf: aClass returns true if receiver is an instance of aClass or one
of its subclasses.
Q31. Where is the method new defined?
Ans. Method new is defined on instance side of class Behavior.
Q32. Why is an IdentitySet faster than a Set?
Ans. An IdentitySet is faster that a Set because =3D=3D is a faster test=
than =3D
Q33. What happens when I modify a collection while iterating over it?
Ans.]]
Q34. What is nil?
Ans. nil is the only instance of the class UndefinedObject and it is the
default value for any new variable until a specific value is assigned to
it.
Q35. What are pool dictionaries?
Ans. Pool dictionaries are created for providing access to pool variables
to several classes that are not related by inheritance.
Q35+. What is a literal?
Ans. A literal is a piece of Smalltalk code that the compiler converts
immediately to an object. Literals can be freely included in the programs
just by typing them.
Literal type Example
Character $s
Symbol #name
String 'David Letterman'
Number 12
Boolean false
UndefinedObject nil
Array of literals #('apple' 12.9 name)
Q36. What is MVC?
Ans. MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. Model stores information/data.
Model notifies its dependents whenever one or more of its variables is
changed. View is the component for displaying output. Contoller is the
component that enables the user to interact with, or control, the
application.
Q37. What is an aspect?
Ans. An aspect is a piece or subset of model's domain information.
Q38. What is a dependent?
Ans. A dependent is an object that is dependent on the information residing
in a model. A dependent object is usually a view, a window, or another
model and is contained in dependents collection of a model.
Q39. How do I add a dependent to a model? Ans. aModel addDependent:
aDependent.
This method adds aDependent to aModel's dependents collection.
Q40. How do I release dependents from a model?
Ans. aModel release replaces aModel's dependents collection with nil.
Q41. What is the changed/update mechanism?
Ans. The changed/update mechanism is used by a model to broadcast a
notification of change to all its dependents.
Q42. What happens when I send changed or changed: message to a Model?
Ans. A changed/changed: message sends an update message to all of
receiver's(model) dependents.
Q43. How do I implement an update method for a view?
Ans. The prototype for an update method for a view is
update: anAspect
anAspect =3D anAspectOfInterest
ifTrue: [ self invalidate]
Q44. What does invalidateRectangle: method do?
Ans. Invalidate messages initiate a view's redrawing process.
invalidateRectangle: aRectangle invalidates only that area of the view
defined by aRectangle.
Q45. How does a controller accesses keyboard events and mouse state?
Ans. By using its instance variable sensor, which references a
TranslatingSensor.
Q46. What is a ValueHolder in VisualWorks?
Ans..
Q47. What is a channel?
Ans. A channel is a value model that is used as a common access point for a
changing value.
Q48. How do an object register interest in a ValueModel?
Ans. By sending onChangeSend: aChangeMessage to: anInterestedObject to a
ValueModel. The advantages of this approach are:
(i) The interested object does not need to be a dependent of the value
model.
(ii) The interested object does not need to implement an update method.
Q49. What is a dependency transformer?.
Q50. How do I change the value of a ValueModel without triggering any
updates?
Ans. 1. By using setValue: newValue method instead of value: newValue
method. setValue: method replaces the value instance variable without
sending update messages to dependents.
2. Remove the DependencyTransformer from the ValueModel's dependents. Send
retractInterestsFor: anObject message to the ValueModel. This is done just
prior to sending value: newValue message.
Using setValue: disallows all updates. retractInterestsFor: only disallows
a specific update, allowing all others to proceed.
Q51. What is an AspectAdaptor?
Ans. :=3
Q52. What is the subject channel of an AspectAdaptor?
Ans. The subject channel is the ValueHolder containing the subject of an
AspectAdaptor. It is useful when several AspectAdaptors share the same
subject and its value of this subject needs to be changed.
Q53. What is a PluggableAdaptor?
Ans. :=3D.
Q54. What is an IndexedAdaptor?
Ans. An IndexedAdaptor is similar to AspectAdaptor except that its subject
is a sequenceable collection and value/value: messages are dispatched to
the subject as at:/at: put: . Q55. What is a SelectionInList?
Ans. A SelectionIinList is a selection model. It has two instance
variables.
(i) listHolder instance variable is a ValueModel containing a sequenceable
collection. listHolder acts as a model for SequenceView.
(ii) selectionIndexHolder instance variable is a ValueHolder with the index
of the current selection as its value.
SelectionInList does not have any dependents. Both of its instance
variables have two dependents : the SequenceView and the SelectionInList
object itself.
Q56. What is a BufferedValueHolder?
Ans..
Q57. What is the difference between an IndexedAdaptor and an AspectAdaptor?
Ans. An IndexedAdaptor operates on a numbered instance variable in the
subject, whereas an AspectAdaptor operates on a named instance variable.
Q58. What is a BlockClosure in VisualWorks?
Ans. Class BlockClosure implements the block notation in VisualWorks
Smalltalk. In VisualWorks, blocks are close to being closures. One can
declare variables local to the block, and the names of block parameters are
local to the block.
Q59. What is the launcher in VisualWorks?
Ans. The launcher is the root of the VisualWorks development environment.
Various development tools can be launched (or opened) from its menu.The
launcher is implemented by VisualLauncher which is a subclass of
ApplicationModel.
Q60. What is a SpecWrapper?
Ans. A VisualWorks component is a SpecWrapper. A SpecWrapper is wrapper
that contains a widget, decoration for the widget, a copy of WidgetState
object and ComponentSpec.
Q61. What is the difference between an active component and a passive
component?
Ans. An active component is a VisualWorks component whose widget is a View
and has a Model and a Controller. A passive component is a VisualWorks
component whose widget is not a View and it does not depend on a model and
a controller.
Q62. What is a widget?
Ans. A widget is a visual part responsible for the visual representation of
a VisualWorks component.
Q63. What is difference between application model and aspect model?
Ans..
Q64. What is a keyboard hook?
Ans. A keyboard hook is a used for intercepting all the keyboard activity
going to a VisualWorks component. It is a block which is evaluated just
prior to the widget controller handling a keyboard event. Keyboard hook can
be set as follows:
| comp |
comp :=3D anApplicationModel builder componentAt:=
#myComponent.
comp widget controller keyboardHook: aBlock.
Q65. What is the Transcript?
Ans. The Transcript is a text window used by the system to report important
events. The global variable Transcript is an instance of the class
TextCollector in VisualWorks and class TranscriptWindow in Digitalk.

and validation messages to the ApplicationModel. A dispatcher is an
instance of class UIDispatcher.
Q67. What is a ComponentSpec?
Ans. A ComponentSpec describes properties and features of a VisualWorks
component. ComponentSpec provides behavior for interface persistence in
form of source code or text file.
Q68. What is a builder in ApplicationModel architecture?
Ans. A builder is an instance of class UIBuilder. It is used to construct a
user interface according to the specifications. It also provides access to
the runtime interface. Builder provides access to named components, the
keyboard processor, the window and aspect models of a running application.
Q69. What is a FullSpec?
Ans. A FullSpec is a combination of a window spec and a spec collection. A
window spec describes a window and a spec collection is a collection of
component specs for all components of a window.
Q70. What is a builder's resource?
Ans. A resource is an object used by the builder to construct the interface
according to the specs. Examples of resources are aspect models, menus,
images, and labels. There are two types of resources:
1. Static resources - do not change during runtime.
2. Dynamic resources - change during runtime.
Q71. What is the builder's source?
Ans. The builder's source is an ApplicationModel that provides the
necessary resources to a builder for building an interface according to the
specs. It is kept in source instance variable of UIBuilder.
Q72. How does a builder caches resources?
Ans. A builder uses the following variables to cache resources.
1. bindings to cache aspect models reqired by active components.
2. labels to cache text labels.
3. visuals to cache visual components.
Q73. What is a lookPolicy object?
Ans. A lookPolicy object is an instance of one of the subclasses of the
UILookPolicy abstract class. A lookPolicy object is used to create a
VisualWorks component based on the componentSpec and the specific window
environment's look and feel.
Q74. How can I change a builder's look policy?
Ans. By sending policy: aLookPolicy message to a builder.
aBuilder policy: MotifLookPolicy new.
Q75. How is a VisualWorks component built?
Ans. & feel of that particular look policy.

aBuilder window.
aBuilder keyboardProcessor.
aBuilder componentAt: #componentID.
aBuilder aspectAt: #aspect.
Q77. What is a keyboard processor?
Ans. A keyboard processor is an instance of class KeyboardProcessor. It
directs keyboard events to the current widget controller. There is only one
keyboard processor per window. A widget controller that takes focus has an
instance variable, keyboardProcessor, used to reference its window's
keyboard processor.
Q78. What is the difference between preBuildWith: and postBuildWith:
methods of ApplicationModel?
Ans. preBuildWith: aBuilder method allows anApplicationModel to make any
changes to its builder prior to handling its full spec. postBuildWith:
aBuilder method allows any final changes to the interface prior to opening.
Q79. What is the difference between postBuildWith: and postOpenWith:
methods of ApplicationModel?
Ans. In the postBuildWith: method, the interface is completely built but it
exists in memory only and window is not open. Whereas postOpenWith: method
allows the application model to make any changes to the interface with the
window open.
Q80. How do I close a window programmatically?
Ans. By sending the closeRequest message to anApplicationModel.

Fabricant is no newbie to the NPA, though. Prior to leaving for the federal agency in 2011, Fabricant was president of global government and scientific affairs at the NPA. We asked him about making the switch between industry and regulator, leading a $32 billion industry, and skepticism over supplements.
TIME: After three-plus years at the FDA, why did you want to go back to industry?
Fabricant: I think we did more in my three and a half years there than had ever been done in dietary supplements, so I packed a career into a short time. I started to realize there is a lot I can do outside the agency to drive some of the issues I started to deal with inside in the agency, and that we can use the leverage we have to drive those initiatives. I enjoyed the work tremendously, and I am really proud of the work at the agency. This opportunity fell out of the sky, and it wasn’t without a lot of thought, but it’s an organization I really treasure.
TIME: How do you think your experience at FDA influence your new position at the NPA?
Fabricant: I think people look at the relationship between industry and regulator as an adversarial one. Not that it can’t be, but for our industry, the primary function is the same. It’s really about making sure the consumer has access to safe products. The thing we did particularly well when I was at the agency was tie it to public health. That’s big for us at NPA as well, and I think we are really going to have to drive the points home. There needs to be an understanding of why this is so important to the agency, and we need to make communications are crystal clear. In some ways I am lucky that I speak both languages on the industry and regulator side, which I think is becoming more and more important.
TIME: What challenges are you facing as the natural product industry continues to grow?
Fabricant: Culturally, there’s a shift, and there needs to be. The industry grew out of independent health care stores, and still has that independent spirit. At the same time, as things mature and we see natural products spread out to other market places, there may be misinformation or disinformation depending on who you ask. I think it’s about building a community across all chains of distribution throughout the supply chain and making sure everyone is on board with the concepts that got us to this going. The natural movement has gone more mainstream. You go into any store now and you see a lot of natural and organic products that you may not have seen 10-15 years ago. While everyone is excited about the growth in the marketplace, we also want to make sure that information is still out there to help consumers.
TIME: What about all the incidences of products with unclaimed and undisclosed ingredients, and criticisms of poor regulation? What is the NPA’s role in this?
Fabricant: I think one of the biggest things we can do is make sure that the agency is fully funded and the resources are there. Coming out of the FDA, you look at certain structure–and the bureaucracy takes awhile to change–but certain structures are not as appropriate as they used to be to get at the heart of those problems.
One of the concerns we had while I was at the agency, and it is still a concern in the industry, are not supplements at all, but products masquerading as supplements. Tainted products that are typically found in three areas: sexual enhancement, body building, and weight loss. They contain active pharmaceutical ingredients and they are in effect, unapproved new drugs. [These manufacturers] use the supplement rubric as a mask to get at the marketplace. That taints the whole industry.
One thing I got to know at the agency very well is the bandwidth at the FDA and the Dept. of Justice to bring to court those sorts of cases. This is what people are expecting of them. That’s part of our role—to make sure the agency is properly funded and also really adequately aligned with those interests. I don’t think that’s a tough sell.
TIME: There’s also a lot of skepticism over whether Americans really need to be taking supplements at all. How do you respond to that?
Fabricant: I think it’s interesting. I think physicians by and large only get on average about 16 hours worth of nutritional education in the medical school curriculum. Sixteen hours isn’t a lot, and I think less of that is dedicated to supplements and studies on supplements. I think it’s a community we really need to address, and make sure they understand the issues. One of the first things we tell anyone when they ask what we tell our retailers and manufacturers to advise consumers, is always talk to your doctor. But I think one of the things we need to do is make sure the docs are educated as well and really have a clear grasp of what’s what. A lot of people tend to have a strong opinion on dietary supplements on one way or the other. I think taking the emotion out of the topic and just looking at the science and is the place we would like to get things to.
TIME: What supplements do you take on a daily basis?
Fabricant: I take a multivitamin, I take fish oil, and I take a probiotic.
TIME: People are very interested in probiotics. How do you determine what to take?
Fabricant: There’s a lot out there. Talk to your physician and look at the research. I take it as general support for GI health and digestion, and I like the way mine tastes—it’s a liquid product. But if you go to clinicaltrials.gov there’s research on those sorts of products that support GI health. There’s a lot of information out there. They key question with any supplement use is why. When it comes to things like multivitamins, I take a multivitamin because I don’t necessarily always have the time to eat the best, so I want to make sure I am at least getting those things we know we need. It’s not so easy to get fatty fish in the diet, so I take fish oil.
TIME: What are you looking forward to as the natural product industry continues to grow?
Fabricant: The conversations. Getting people together who were not speaking as readily in the past. This industry has more in common than it does separate. I want to get people talking.Multiplayer Slots : Win An Excess Bonus!

By: Rafael Fernández de Castro* and Margarita Zavala**
This article was translated from Spanish by the Mexico Institute. Also in Spanish (See below). This corridor has experienced recurring humanitarian crises for several reasons, including massive suffering of thousands, and perhaps hundreds of thousands, of human beings, not only children, but also young men and women.
The damages caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1988 and Stan in 2005 created similar devastation in Central America and in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced from their homes, many of them to the United States.
Enormous misfortunes also occurred along this corridor in 2009 and in 2010. According to the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH), nearly 20 thousand migrants were kidnapped in Mexico. Although the statistics provided by the CNDH could be exaggerated, no one disputes that the kidnapping of migrants, in mass numbers, has not been slowed by authorities; thus, it remains a major threat to migrants passing through Mexican territory. A typical kidnapping operation involves abducting migrants traveling by bus or the "Beast", depriving them of their freedom by placing them in "safe houses" and forcing, through threats, their family in either Central America or the United States to pay ransom. If the kidnappers do not receive the money, the migrants are often killed and buried in mass unmarked graves.
In August 2010, San Fernando, Tamaulipas experienced one of the worst collective murders in the history of global migration: 72 migrants in transit were shot by the bloodiest criminal organization, Los Zetas. The move was a warning to smugglers who did not pay the "right of passage." The accounts of two survivors of the massacre, an Ecuadorian and Guatemalan, are chilling.
What makes the current humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied children distinct is that this time the problem exploded in the United States, forcing the White House to take action on the matter. Now, it is the press and U.S. television networks that have created huge media noise, emphasizing a mass migration of extremely vulnerable children and teenagers.
Why do children and young people migrate?
Like all migrants, Central American and Mexican children and youth are exposed to conditions that expel them from their countries of origin and conditions that attract them to the United States. Information and support networks, whether parents or relatives of children in the United States or Central America, play a very important role. In recent years, it has become impossible to cross the Mexico-US border without the aid of and payment to smugglers, better known as "polleros".
The conditions of expulsion in the North Central Triangle and even in parts of Mexico, such as Guerrero and Michoacán, are terrible. Abandoned by parents who already live in the United States, Central American children and youth experience miserable lives and are exposed to chronic violence. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), violence in Latin America is concentrated among young men, who perpetrate and suffer more than 90 percent of homicides. As Honduras has become the country with the highest homicide rate and the most violence on the planet, with about 90 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, it is not difficult to understand that thousands of children and young people are willing to migrate to the United States, even with some awareness of the dangers of transmigration through Guatemala and Mexico.
Ivan is a Salvadoran teenager of thirteen that I met at the Hostel of Mrs. Olga in Tapachula, Chiapas more than a decade ago. The Hostel of Mrs. Olga, now called the Hostel of Jesus the Good Shepherd of the Poor and Central American Migrant, is a rehabilitation center for migrants mutilated by the "Beast" and other sick and convalescing patients. There were young Honduran girls who lost both legs that had learned to walk with prosthetics. Ivan was recovering from losing his left arm, which happened when, while asleep, the weak belt that kept him tied broke, causing him to fall off the train. At thirteen, it was already the third time he had tried to reunite with his mother in Los Angeles, California. With a sincere smile and as a fully unconscious teenager, he stated – “Fortunately, it was my left arm, as I am right-handed. I will still be able to write to my grandmother when I get to Los Angeles, because this time nothing will stop me from reaching the United States.”
In The Voyage of Henry, journalist Sonia Nassario details the reasons that led a 16-year-old Honduran to try eight times before getting to South Carolina to meet his mother. A decade ago, Henry had stayed behind with his sister in the care of his grandmother. In his early teens, he dropped out of school and began using drugs. The only light in the tunnel of misery and violence for Henry was the possibility of finding his mother in South Carolina and conquering the American dream.
Helping the then-First Lady of Mexico, Margarita Zavala, put a face to the high statistics of unaccompanied Mexican children migrating to the United States, we discovered the story of Mary, a four-year-old from Oaxaca. Smugglers arranged that Mary separate from her mother in order to cross the border into the United States. For four months, Mary was lost. Like one who finds a needle in a haystack, Mary's mother found her in a hostel in Mexico, for Mary never managed to enter the United States.
The stories of young Central American girls are just as heartbreaking. Girls between the ages of 15 and 16 from El Salvador and Honduras explained why they decided to leave their country, stating – "They were asking for my phone number and demanding me to be the girlfriend of one of the gang members. If you say no, they rape you and force you to be their girlfriend.” The other girl told us, "If you do not go with them voluntarily, they rape you, or take you to visit their friends who are in prisons. If they have a problem with your relative, they also rape you and harm you.”
The terrible conditions of expulsion in the Northern Triangle of Central America give sustenance to the sudden increase of unaccompanied migrant children. The trigger, however, has been the sparse rumor that they would be accepted and regularized, examines the White House. In 2005, a similar rumor increased the flow of Mexican migration to the United States.
Crisis creates opportunities
We should take advantage of the power of communication from the White House and the U.S. media to go beyond the tip of the iceberg that represents the crisis of unaccompanied children and accept that the Central America-Mexico-United States corridor is a geographical space with recurring humanitarian crises.
The first thing that is required is that the governments of the three Northern Triangle countries, as well as Mexico and the United States, stop acting unilaterally when presented with a crisis, whether it be Mexico with the San Fernando episode or Washington with the overcrowding of Central American children in its facilities. It is in the interest of these governments to accept the existence of this corridor and act accordingly. We face a common problem that requires shared responsibility.
This requires a continuing dialogue, or even a permanent mechanism, which would allow the five countries – Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States – to not only address the crises but to detect and, to the greatest extent possible, prevent them. In this regard, Mexico has to play a very important role as it is a country of origin, transit and destination.
It is unbelievable that the Obama administration refuses to have a serious dialogue with the governments of the migration corridor because it could “arm Republicans” and debilitate the chances of immigration reform.
It is important that the governments of the Northern Triangle and of Mexico cooperate to prevent the number of unaccompanied migrant children to the United States from continuing to rise. But let us also require Washington to sit and have a dialogue to prevent and solve the situation. With or without immigration reform, we should address, for the sake of humanity, the recurring crisis of the Central American-Mexican-United States corridor.

Abstract
Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is defined as a focal dilatation of the pulmonary artery. It is noted to be very rare and infrequently diagnosed. From literature reviews, only 8 cases of pulmonary artery aneurysms were identified from a total of 109,571 cases within an extended period of 100 years. This gives an incidence of about 0.0073%. PAA is usually associated with some structural cardiac anomalies, structural vascular anomalies, pulmonary hypertension, vasculitis and infection. However, idiopathic pulmonary artery aneurysm has also been identified in some cases. PAA can be classified as proximal or peripheral PAA depending on its location. Most of the patients are asymptomatic. Symptoms are only seen when complications occurred such as bronchial or tracheal compression, dissection, rupture or thrombus formation causing pulmonary hypertension. It can be treated conservatively or surgically if symptomatic or if the size is more than 6 cm. We reported a case of a left pulmonary artery aneurysm, which is an incidental finding in a patient who underwent a CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for a suspected pulmonary artery embolism. A left pulmonary artery aneurysm was seen measuring about 4.2 cm (W) x 3.9 cm (CC), which extends into the proximal branch of the descending pulmonary artery. Unfortunately, no further treatment was able to be given to the patient since the patient succumbed from sepsis shortly after the diagnosis.Popcornflix Followed [2020] Full Movie Watch Online Free

I saw 'Alone' starring Jules Willcox-Dirty John_tv, Snake & Mongoose; Marc Menchaca-Ozark_tv, Homeland_tv and Anthony Heald-X_Men:The Last Stand, The Silence of the Lambs.
This movie is a remake of a 2011 Swedish movie called 'Gone. Jules plays a recently widowed woman that is moving away from the city to the country to help soothe her pain. She has a few run ins with Marc-innocently at first-but she soon decides that he is probably stalking her. Sure enough, he drugs and kidnaps her and she wakes up inside an isolated cabin in the woods. She escapes and is in the process of trying to get someone to help her when she runs into Anthony, a hunter. Can he save her? Does she trust him? Or should she just stay away from any strangers, altogether in the future, that is, if she survives this encounter? It's a pretty standard movie, which was made in 2018-I read the end credits-so it's 2 years old. Oh yeah, maybe it's just me but Marc Menchaca reminded me of Jason Sudeikis with a bushy mustache.
It wasn't rated but it contained violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 38 minutes.
I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.

:Based on reading that I've done as well as experience with the pair that I've had for the past year, I'm tempted to say that Tribs hiding and not moving much is rather normal. Mine stay hidden throughout the majority of the day,come out around dusk and then go back to hiding They also tend to stay still a lot. I REALLY think its a defensive mechanism. Mine tend to bury themselves under drift wood and stay completely still even if i unearth them. If i stay for a while they perk up some and suddenly make a mad dash for the water. the same goes for handling, mine stay VERY still until they decide escape is safe and they try to take off.
:Out of curiosity what temp are you keeping them at? I've had mine simply at room temp on and off for the past 7 or so months and they seem to come out more, eat more and generally be more active without heat than when i used heating devices. My room temp is a little hotter than normal since i have heat lamps on my prehensile tails and pink tongue skinks, but I still wonder...Anyone else seen anything similar?

The bottom two spots will just be random select. When I send the Beta out, the training character will be included for testing purposes. The statue has had the hair edited to look like Illian and some other stuff removed, I think it does the job as is.
And yeah I am very strongly considering moving this to Ikemen just for the in-game movelists alone, but also for the unlockable character feature, dizzy points and all that. I just haven't tried porting the stuff yet (though I'm told it's easy) and I'm a bit short on cash to pay Mordecool to port it for me.
Also the beta will be sent out very soon, possibly today. No intro or endings, just the characters, basic AI, stages, and the training tool to practice with.
Alright cool, I'm glad people are interested! I'm very badly hung up on stages stuff right now, I may send out a beta with simple placeholder stages in it though.
If you couldn't post threads how did you make this thread
does this stage look familiar to any of you? i think i actually found a link to it at some point but its dead, and this stage is lost. one of my friends found the source game of itm being Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2.
[youtube][/youtube]And now it’s a cool culturally transcendent car in more sense than one. It feels old, but looks ancient, and therefore is something of an anomalous time capsule. At the same time, it bridges a major gap in automotive styling between Japanese cars and domestic cars.
It’s definitely a product of the same vibes that drew things like the Ford Mustang II and AMC Javelin into existence, but it’s also one of the progenitors of tuner car culture.
I always liked the look of the original Toyota Celica. After watching this video, I have a much higher appreciation for the car in general. Here’s hoping this inspires more people to save these.
DISCUSSION
My grandfather, after returning from WWII in the Army Corp of Engineers in Italy, went to work as a microwave engineer in the 50s-80s. He was engineer as an engineer could be. Pocket protector, slide rules, etc. Magnetrons that he was awarded patents for were on bookshelves throughout the house. We made incredibly complex paper airplanes from his corporate letterhead and threw them from the roof of his house.
He had a yellow 1976 Toyota Celica, manual. It was a glorious little noise maker.
Good memories. Thanks for this post.- OSI-Approved Open Source (90)

Domaine Zind Humbrecht is among the first to make Alsatian wine with a concentrated fruity style, low yields and biodynamic viticulture. Residual sugar levels can vary considerably between crops, but the acceptance of such variations is part of biodynamic philosophy.

The Nets’ offense has disappeared entirely over long stretches of the second halves of their last 10 games. This pattern began in Miami on December 1, when the Nets led 73-65 midway through the third quarter, and then scored only 14 points over the next 16:32 en route to a 102-89 loss. Yes, the Heat are a terrific team who can flip the switch on just about anybody, but this pattern of late-game offensive collapses repeated itself six times in the last nine games:
With the exception of the second Knick game, none of these teams are exactly shooting the lights out. The average NBA team scores somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 points per minute (the Nets average 1.96). In the 93 minutes described above, the Nets have scored 100 points, and have almost as many turnovers (31) as baskets (33).
Looking at the various lineups that Avery Johnson has used, a few things stand out. Gerald Wallace shot 2-13 in these collapses, and missed all 9 of his three-point attempts. Crash isn’t a great three-point shooter (32% career), and the Nets would be better served by getting him some looks in motion near the basket.
The Nets are better with C.J. Watson in the game, either as the point guard, or next to Deron at the 2. The Deron Williams-Joe Johnson backcourt was used for 45 of the 93 minutes I looked at, and got outscored 97-42, which is significantly worse than any other possible backcourt combination. It’s clear, both from this and a simple eyeball test, that Deron and Joe haven’t figured out how to play with each other effectively yet.
Joe Johnson, aside from his late heroics in the Pistons game, has failed spectacularly in the clutch of late. In my sample, Johnson shot 7-28, and had one assist in 83 minutes. This is more minutes, and more attempts, than any other player over the same period. Also, Johnson’s ISO-heavy offensive repetoire seems to be encouraging Deron to call his own number more frequently than he should.
You want more good news? Andray Blatche. Blatche has been the main beneficiary of what little passing the Net guards are doing, making 11-of-20 shots, mostly at the rim. His interior play has kept things from getting even worse. Lineups using Brook Lopez at center have been about equally effective, but Avery Johnson may want to avoid ever using a lineup where Kris Humphries or Reggie Evans plays center. The Nets were outscored 32-0 in the nine minutes that Avery went super-small.
Based on this, the Nets ideal lineup to close out games should be Lopez or Blatche at center, Wallace and Johnson at the forward spots, and Watson and Williams in the backcourt. Watson’s shooting and secondary ballhandling isn’t something that any other player on the roster can provide. Lineups using Keith Bogans also performed surprisingly well. I have to wonder how hot Avery’s seat has to become before he thinks of trying to use Lopez and Blatche together.
While I don’t think the Nets should take a page from the Lakers and panic-fire Avery because of this losing streak, he’s not utilizing his players (most obviously Wallace) in the optimal way. The Knicks’ offense this year under Mike Woodson is a great example of how a team can use ISO plays constructively, and hopefully the Johnsons, Avery and Joe, are taking notes from last night’s beating. Carmelo doesn’t always get the ball predictably, because he moves without the ball and gets himself free for open threes, and because the Felton-Chandler pick and roll is often the first thing the Knicks look for. Once he does get the ball in an ISO, Melo makes quick reads, either making his move, or kicking it back out to one of the two point guards on the perimeter. You can put some of the Nets’ struggles down to failing to make shots, or run the plays correctly, but the team is going through repeated offensive slumps longer than a performance of “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” 25 games into the season. Maybe they need new plays. And more Blatche and Watson.
@Calling All Toasters– Thanks! I think the Nets don’t really have a choice here. The Knicks’ experiences with Melo are the closest parallel to what’s happening here. Melo didn’t fit very well into the Mike D’Antoni offense, even when he wasn’t being misused as a point forward. You’re not going to make Joe Johnson into a guy who can move without the ball effectively overnight– he hasn’t had to do it in years.
While Joe isn’t a scoring machine like the guys you mentioned, he does have one advantage over all of them– his passing skills (though you wouldn’t know it by this year’s results). Suppose the Nets ran ISO’s for Joe where the desired result was an easy basket for someone else. If Joe gets the ball, and doesn’t eat half the shot clock deciding what to do, this could work. Quick reads are the key. Melo’s improved on that a lot this year. He shoots, he drives, or he kicks it back out to the perimeter, within a couple of seconds. Is that even a true iso play? It’s a hurry-up iso, I guess. That’s what I’d recommend for the Nets, not the kind where you give Joe the whole shot clock, and he bricks a 15-foot fadeaway.
You see the Nets do things like the first 18 minutes of the 2nd Knicks-Nets game, and you wonder why they can’t play like that more often, when it really counts.
Let’s remember what ended Avery’s time in Dallas, too:
Yes, a strained relationship with Dirk meant a strained relationship with Cuban, and that was that … but he lost the locker room because he forced the players out of their accustomed roles.
* Dirk was pushed to be a rim-attacking power forward. It won him an MVP while the games meant little, then got the Mavs embarrassed by an 8 seed when the games meant something.
* Devin Harris was gripped too tightly and eventually he was traded.
* Josh Howard got bored and frustrated and high.
In the end, everyone gave up and just parked outside the 3-point line. SOUND FAMILIAR?? Defense isn’t as big a problem as is the misuse on offense…it’s severely depressing this team already.
I always thought their loss to Golden State was largely due to Don Nelson, who had just coached most of those players for years. It was the ultimate trap matchup– Golden State was better than a #8 seed, but Baron missed time with an injury, and they traded for Stephen Jackson and Al Harrington in midseason. They finished the year 16-5, and blew out the Mavs twice in that stretch. I don’t feel like you can pin that entirely on Avery. Their Finals loss in ’06 is more of a black mark on his record to me.
I uncovered a puzzling anomaly in the fourth quarter rotations, by the way. Joe and Crash usually play the entire 4th quarter, and Deron sometimes sits quite awhile for CJ. And it’s not because he staggers their rest– Joe and Deron play about the same amount of minutes in the other three quarters.
Fair point–George Karl and Pat Riley also lost to 8 seeds, and they seemed to find work after that…
One difference: Avery goes away from his team’s strengths. After winning 67 games in ’06-’07, come playoff time he changed his lineup for game 1 against Nellie–to RUN with the Warriors. Playing Golden State’s game? When Avery possessed the MVP and defending conference champs? Don Nelson knew he had Avery licked before the ball went up.
Now we’re seeing Avery take Deron out of his groove, stick Wallace out where he’s less effective, and play Bogans and Stackhouse when this team desperately needs a young rack-attacker who might find surging confidence. Not saying MarShon is a complete player, but he’s been a rare Nets bright spot over the last two seasons, and Avery’s gone away from that bright spot, too…gotta harness your strengths in this league.
Nellie was a mad scientist. Al Harrington at center and Stephen Jackson at power forward for the first two games. I don’t know how you match up with that, but Avery went with lots of DeSagana Diop. Wrong answer.Vldl Cholesterol Reference Range

In this procedure, your healthcare provider takes a sample of your blood making use of a non-penetrated skin hook. Your doctor then measures your triglycerides, high density lipoproteins, high pressure in your arteries, and also low density lipoproteins. Vldl Cholesterol Reference Range
If you take all of these right into consideration, after that your healthcare provider can determine just how healthy and balanced you are. He can additionally recommend a drug that is made specifically to reduced cholesterol. Another choice would be a mix of medicines. Some people favor to take a natural cholesterol drug in addition to a day-to-day workout regimen and also a healthy and balanced way of living adjustments program. If you do select to utilize cholesterol reducing drugs, make certain to follow your physician’s orders closely. Your doctor may additionally want you to undergo greater than one sort of treatment.
There are various other choices if your doctor feels that other methods of treatment are not functioning. One such option is to take statins. The function of taking statins is to reduce the quantity of cholesterol that builds up in your blood. Although statins do have side effects, they are the best of all readily available treatments for people having a hard time to control cholesterol.
While physicians are not sure specifically what states may do to your body, there are certain ways that it can increase your danger for a cardiovascular disease. For instance, people who have high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure are at higher threat for a heart attack. If you already have heart disease, then you are currently at higher danger. Statins can assist you reduced these threat elements as well.
If your physician believes that you have really high LDL cholesterol degrees, after that he may suggest a medicine called atheroma renolone to reduce them. Atheroma does come with some major side results, including vision troubles, diarrhea, and vomiting. Individuals with extremely high triglycerides as well as reduced excellent cholesterol degrees are not prospects for this type of therapy because triglycerides are a harmful substance in their blood stream. While it can reduce LDL cholesterol levels, it will boost HDL cholesterol, which is the excellent cholesterol.
The reason that statins enhance the risk for a cardiac arrest is since they disrupt the capillary activity in your body. As your arteries become stopped up, they won’t have the ability to transport the nutrients that they need. Without an enhanced blood flow, the plaque buildup will certainly start, and that will result in a major cardiac arrest. For this reason, individuals who take statins to reduce their blood cholesterol degrees are actually at a boosted danger for a cardiac arrest.
Of course, you don’t actually intend to endure a cardiac arrest, however using statins can most definitely increase your risk. One of the negative effects of taking these medications is that you will experience muscular tissue weakness. While this sign is just light as well as will not impact your capacity to work, it most definitely isn’t anything you intend to deal with. Opposite effects consist of looseness of the bowels, tiredness, queasiness, and a boost in the frequency of colds. Some people have even described the fatigue that they feel as approaching being at the end phase of cancer cells.
If you are thinking about beginning therapy, talk to your doctor about the feasible adverse effects and also risks. Statins are recommended by doctors throughout the world and also are commonly provided to individuals who have high LDL cholesterol degrees. Naturally, you should constantly talk about all alternatives with your physician prior to starting any kind of kind of medication, specifically if you have kidney condition or other severe medical concerns.
The bottom line is that there are several things you can do to decrease your overall cholesterol, including your diet plan, exercise, weight reduction, as well as boosted consumption of foods that are high in HDL, or great cholesterol. Trans fats located in some preferred restaurants are an issue for many individuals as well as should be stayed clear of if possible. Furthermore, you should attempt to consume as healthy and balanced of a diet as possible, avoiding fatty foods and also consuming even more foods that are high in protein. These foods are not only great for you, however are also really simple to find, which makes managing your cholesterol relatively very easy.via press release:
NICK NEWS WITH LINDA ELLERBEE FOLLOWS AMERICAN KIDS TRAVELING TO AFRICA TO STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN
“KIDS FOR SALE: SLAVERY IN GHANA”
SUNDAY, JULY 15, AT 9 P.M. (ET/PT) ON NICKELODEON
*DVD screeners and art available upon request; art also available at
NEW YORK, June 28, 2012 – This show is about a rescue mission. Human trafficking is an international problem affecting millions of people and many countries around the world. Nick News with Linda Ellerbee shines a light on this huge issue in the new half-hour special, “Kids for Sale: Slavery in Ghana,” premiering Sunday, July 15, at 9:00 p.m. (ET/PT) on Nickelodeon.
The special features Tetteh, who became a victim of human trafficking at the age of five when a man came to his village in Ghana and took him away. In Ghana, fishermen buy kids to work in and out of the water risking their lives for no money and not much food.
“Before you know it, you’re in hell,” says Tetteh.
In Brentwood, Calif., 15-year-old Tyler saw a television report about this issue when he was nine. He was so moved that he began raising money so that kids can return to their families.
“The parents are deceived into believing that the child’s life will become better,” says Tyler. “They just lie to you.”
“The job I do here is very difficult, and we work for long hours,” says Kwadwo, who was recently rescued. “I would just keep praying over and over that nothing bad happened to us.”
This year, Tyler traveled to Ghana where he, Tetteh and other people, including many kids and former kid slaves, joined forces to rescue kids from human trafficking.
“At Nick News, we’ve always said that wherever you find bad things happening, you find good people trying to make it better—kids included,” says Ellerbee.).By and large, Virginia Republicans are still locked in a fossil fuel echo chamber, where “all of the above” and “war on coal” guide their votes. Virginia Democrats mostly acknowledge the damage climate change is doing to the commonwealth and around the planet and support a course correction. And regardless of ideology, large majorities from both parties vote for whatever Dominion Power wants.
These are the major takeaways from this year’s legislative session and the 2016 Climate and Energy Scorecard, just released by the Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club. Constituents and clean energy advocates will want to look at not just the raw grades of individual legislators, but also the discussion provided in the report, to understand the dynamics of our General Assembly.
Twenty-eight Democrats earned perfect scores. All but a handful of Republicans earned failing grades. Sierra Club gave extra credit to legislators who introduced bills that advanced clean energy. This included several Republicans highlighted in the scorecard, but their bad votes on other bills dragged down their overall scores.
This is really a shame, since some Republicans have worked hard to advance clean energy legislation. Leesburg Delegate Randy Minchew comes to mind here for his dogged efforts on behalf of distributed solar energy, something you might not guess from his overall grade of D.
Often, it seems, reform-minded Republicans go along with their party’s more retrograde positions where they are pressured to do so by their party leaders, or where the votes are so lopsided that there is nothing to gain from breaking with the majority.
If party leaders have an outsize influence on voting, so too does Dominion Power. In fact, if you want to know who the true champions of the people are, don’t look at party affiliation. Look for the few legislators who will stand up to the most powerful political force in Richmond.
That assumes you can find votes to examine. In the introduction to the Sierra Club scorecard, Legislative Chair Susan Stillman noted with frustration this year’s paucity of recorded votes available to score:
The challenges of producing a fair and even scorecard are growing, as are the opportunities for Virginia citizens to have a clear and accurate picture of their elected representative’s voting record. Transparency in the General Assembly sunk to a new low this year: 95% of the bills defeated in the House of Delegates were done so on an unrecorded vote or no vote at all. This is not business-as-usual: just over a decade ago, nearly every bill that passed through the House received a recorded vote.
An ongoing problem, both for scorecard referees and for clean energy advocates, is that most bills that would advance the cause of renewable energy and energy efficiency never make it out of committee; in the House, the bills are heard in a tiny subcommittee. Not only do votes go unrecorded, but this approach deprives most of our elected representatives of the opportunity to vote on some of the most important energy policy issues facing Virginia.
And then there was this year, in which even the subcommittee members never got a chance to vote. A dozen or so of the most promising clean energy bills were never heard at all, but were sent to a newly-formed interim study subcommittee, ostensibly for the purpose of giving these bills the benefit of greater deliberation. The effect was to kill them quietly for the year.
As Stillman notes, all these unrecorded votes make it hard to know where the vast majority of legislators stand:
Without a recorded vote, the public is deprived of the full measure of his or her elected official’s voting history. And the problem of unrecorded votes is growing worse. This year’s unprecedented rate of unrecorded votes in the House is up from 76% in 2015—a 25% jump in one year. Virginia legislators are killing more bills than ever without accountability for their actions. This practice is wrong, and it’s dangerous for our democracy.
Stillman gives a shout-out to the founding members of the new, bipartisan Transparency Caucus for its efforts to make all votes public and ensure every bill gets a hearing.
These would be modest reforms, but welcome. If sunlight is the best disinfectant, there’s a big, dirty House (and Senate) in Richmond that need cleaning.
Thanks for this very informative, if disturbing, piece, Ivy. Virginia is clearly moving in the wrong direction, when it comes to democracy!
I just read your post. It was very good and thank you for sharing the Sierra Club Scorecard. I noticed Sen. Tim Kaine was not mentioned anywhere. What has he done? I read somewhere he may have ties with Dominion. Is this true?

Thanks, Maria. The Virginia Sierra Club’s scorecard grades state senators and delegates but not U.S. senators and congressmen, so Kaine is not included. But Kaine has been criticized for his close ties to Dominion. It seems to be a recurring theme in Virginia politics.

Ivy, in the Hampton Roads Daily Press:
“Nearly 95 percent of bills defeated in the Virginia House of Delegates this session went down without a recorded vote, according to a new analysis from the coalition Transparency Virginia.”
No record of how elected officials are voting on 95% of Virginia bills…WTF? That sounds a whole lot like the beginning of the end of democracy.Tennessee,

Nope, not Philadelphus - looks much more like Deutzia, probably D. scabra plena, although the photos aren't great on detail. If the flowers aren't scented, then Deutzia it is. Prune immediately after flowering is over just the same though.

Its often filled with desperation. Why me? Why does it still hurt? Why can’t it pass? But the path once you start to walk it, I can assure you, is fueled with mercy, magic, grace, openings, growth, grounding, so much sense and so much beauty.
It is a warrior’s path of courage and kindness (specially towards ourselves). It asks many times that we go against the grain of a world that in so many ways has lost touch with the sacred. On that road, we often need to (re)connect with the sense of sacredness, of something bigger than us, with a sense of surrender and devotion but also with the power that we are gaining through the initiatory path…All that that we have forgotten. All that that used to be us. Long before we even got our wounds.
To heed this call, it is essential that we honor our unique sensitivities and eccentricities and open to the possibility that even our deepest wounding may be filled with guidance, medicine, and meaning.
Will you walk the path?

What is the purpose of a résumé?
‘To get a job,’ you might answer. It’s not quite that simple. In fact, the best a résumé can do is get you an interview. But way before that comes its very first job – to not get rejected.
The 15 Seconds That Can Last A Lifetime…
Employers spend 15 to 45 seconds scanning a résumé! That’s all the time your résumé has to succeed in not getting rejected and maybe getting a second reading. Tough task.
A résumé is a short commercial about you. It has to look good and almost instantaneously communicate the most important factors about you that will interest the employer.
Education vs. Experience
There continues a debate as to which should come first in a résumé. Most employers prefer to see RELEVANT EXPERIENCE first; but if you don’t have relevant experience, you have to put your best foot forward with education.
It really does depend on each specific case. We can help you decide what’s best for you.
Some employers say they prefer to see any form of work experience before education. If you go that route, make sure you present your work experience in a “cause and effect” way. For example: instead of simply stating that you were a Sales Assistant, describe, as succinctly as possible, how you performed that function, the way in which you interacted with customers and how that impacted on sales, repeat business, etc.
Getting started
At this point, put down all the information that is in any way relevant… all your skills, abilities, education, work experience, extra curricular activities, awards – anything you feel is important about you. (You are going to have to cut this way down, but it’s a good way to start.) When you’re writing, use action words and make your accomplishments really stand out. Include extracurricular activities like athletics, etc, because that shows the employer a good balance between academic achievement and time/interest management. (Some or all of these may have to be cut out later.)
Structuring your resume
Your name is first and predominant. Then put how to contact you – address, phone number, e-mail address – directly beneath your name.
Next state your OBJECTIVE, the kind of work you are looking for, in terms specific to the job you are applying for. Even if you are sending a covering letter in which you can state and elaborate on your Objective, it’s a good idea to include it on your one-page résumé.
Next, present your (related) work experience or (related) education. (Try it both ways and see which is the most impressive. Ask other people. Ask us.)
Whether you decide on work experience or education first, make sure the most important points really jump out. Last degree or job comes first, second comes second and so on.
Cut Refine and Proofread. Cut Refine and Proofread…
Be prepared to go over your résumé many times, fine tuning and editing all the time. Take out anything that doesn’t make an impact or contribute to you getting an interview. Ask other people for an objective viewpoint. Ask us. Your résumé has to come down to one neat, dynamic page.
SPELLING, GRAMMAR AND PUNCTUATION ARE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. This cannot be emphasized too strongly. Your résumé really does have to be perfect to have any chance at all.
Your résumé has to be scanner-friendly or it may be rejected. This is what scanners like:
- text that is clear and free of graphics
- no italics, script or underlined words
- a sans-serif typeface
- one typeface only
- a point size of 10 to 14
- white or off-white paper only
- 8-1/2 by 11″ printed one side only
- no staples
This is meant to be a rough guide. Do all the work you can on your résumé, until it is as perfect as you can make it, and then consult us.
If you require help writing a resume or would like Resume Templates for your experience and position please email us at this link Resume Templates and request the position(s) you would like templates for .
Putting your best foot forward
Dress for the interview not the job. Dress to show your potential. It’s best to be conservative: a dark suit with a light-coloured shirt and dark socks, tie and shoes for men; likewise, a dark business suit or dark jacket and skirt with a light-coloured blouse, medium heels and skin-tone stockings is recommended for women.
Be polite and courteous with everyone. You just never know what will be noticed.
You may be asked to fill out an application form before or during the interview. This may simply be standard company procedure, or it may be a test. Perhaps you’re being tested on how well you process information and follow directions, and/or how well you handle written documents. But the first test will be how pleasantly and calmly you cooperate with this request. Don’t write “See Resume” on the application, fill it out.
Be honest. For instance “Why did you leave your last position?” write in “Will discuss.” If asked for a salary figure, write, “Open for negotiation.” When salary is brought up in conversation, let them know what you have been earning, but keep it open from your point of view and theirs. There may be prospects etc. in the position that may be worth taking less than the “ideal” figure for. Let them know you are reasonably open on this. After all, you are only after a job offer at this point.

A series of publications EVOLUTION OF MUSIC ALBUMS DESIGN
Design of music albums is a separate form of art that can not only define the sound or the message of a certain band, but also reveal cultural, artistic or even historical contexts. This work analyses the creations of the most famous music album designers of the 20th century and searches for hints on the aforementioned contexts, as well as looks into the influence of changes in recording formats. The contents of the analysis were systematized in accordance with the changing recording formats (78 RPM, LP, EP and CD).
The exposition consists of a custom box for interpreting vinyl and CD players, three publications with separate packaging, and a series of information posters that are placed into a separate version of a CD case. The packaging of the publications was created based on the works of a selected designer that is discussed in those particular publications, thus introducing the evolution of music albums design from the watcher’s very first contact.
Each publication features visual and polygraphic navigation elements. For instance, the first publication contains specifically selected types of paper and disc label stickers which were characteristic to the packaging of 78 RPM records. In the second publication tracing paper is combined with offset paper in order to emphasize the music albums’ context. The third publication’s different paper formats and colors point out significant objects. All of these features allow the viewers to get acquainted with the evolution of music albums design more easily and effectively.

Thanks, Brian…a great video. I’m determined to visit the Baseball HOF one of these days, and if these items are still displayed there, it will unquestionably bring back fantastic memories! What a year in Baseball it was…at least for the Cardinals and their fans!!
Sorry to hear about Bob Forsch’s death. He was a great Cardinal, but an even greater man from all I’ve heard. He will be missed, but not forgotten.
It seems like they get a little bit carried away with this stuff, but who knows what fans in the future will experience when they see these kind of things.
Sooner or later, as is all accumulates, the impact of each item diminishes.
The kind of thing I’d like to see them go for would be a game six scorecard filled out as the game went along.
Wow, a cap worn by Super Genius TLR when winning his 3rd World Series.
Jimminy Crickets is that one fantastic Hall of Fame exhibit item. They need to guard that cap like Fort Knox or the Coke Formula.
Maybe the HoF could give visitors special protective glasses to wear, when they gaze at TLR’s cap. TLR is as brilliant as a solar eclipse.
Best to wear protective eyewear, before looking at a cap that has had direct contact with such a brilliant cranium.
You’ve got to be careful with the weather getting colder, Jumbo. Wouldn’t want your lips freezing to what you’re busy kissing.
Once somebody retires, they can become even greater in our memories than during real life!
Since TLR was a Giant Super Genius for the Cards, its scary to think how massive he will grow in our memories.
With TLR retiring and Albert a free agent, this is a busy offseason for Mo. And there could be a lot of change ahead. No wonder Mo signed up Berkman to a 2012 deal, to reduce the off season personnel work.
Communicating with the press is a much bigger part of a manager’s job today. In this role, the manager represents the business day to day. I understand interviewing Matheny. He has been part of the fabric of the Cards, so could fit in well, even though he has not been a manager and thus spokesman already.
Nobody is going to be perfect in every possible way.
The World Series exhibit at the Hall of Fame is now open.
The HoF noted the following items have been added to the exhibit:
Press Pins from the Cardinals and Rangers
Front pages from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch detailing the Cardinals Comeback

OrLemmings is a long running puzzle series. The aim of the game is to get the Lemmings from point A to B whilst navigating obstacles and deterrents across a variety of different worlds.
This game certainly isn’t going to be pushing the powerful handheld to its max but it does have a solid looking foundation and decent soundtrack. Perhaps the best part of the soundtrack is the little grunts and nudges that Lemmings give you when you sit your Vita in idle too long for their liking.
As you progress through your game the backdrop of your levels change; here you will see the intricate details that go into the game and give it the majority of its charm. Themed worlds like Egypt that have hieroglyphic etchings on pillars and sandstone decay on bricks, to the flames and skulls that decorate of the Hell stages make up this aesthetically beautiful game.
Utilising the touch screen capabilities of the Vita perfectly, the Lemmings series has received a great entry to the handheld. A fluent and responsive touch system is at the heart of this game.
Lemmings mindlessly wander ever closer toward their goal (or demise) and it is up to the player to get them there safely. Drag your finger across the screen to pan and get a quick overview of the obstacles ahead. Tap to select a particular Lemming and command him to do a particular task. It may be to build a staircase over a small wall, while another Lemming can be commanded to block the others paths to stop them falling to their doom before the said staircase is completed. There are countless combinations and varying obstacles that require precise timing and lots of planning if you wish to get these little fellas home.
Scores are gained and points are accumulated for completing levels under a set amount of time whilst sparing the lives of as many of the Lemmings as you can. :09 Jul 2013
Another milestone for Team3M
The UCI-continental cycling team, of which 3M is the title sponsor, is now included in the most popular videogame ‘ProCyclingManager’. Really cool to see the Team3M riders virtually participate in the Tour de France and other races.
The Team3M story is turning more and more into a success, with a dozen of victories, only halfway the season, and over 250 articles in newspapers and magazines. Additional airtime on radio and TV has for sure contributed to the increased awareness of (Team)3M.
Now there is this next highlight. You can now ‘play’ with Team3M on your PC. Cyanide, the producer of this best sold cycling game, approached 3M to ask permission to include the Team3M and their riders in the 2013 version of the game. This has been arranged, so that people that buy the game, at a computer game or department store, now have the opportunity to act as a Team3M coach. A game-play (a demo video) has been published on YouTube. Click here to get an impression:

Home Secretary Theresa May’s speech where she proposed a new bill to fight terrorism within the UK has been criticised by the Open Rights Group and the Human Rights watch.
One of the proposed measures for the bill is a new statutory duty on colleges, schools, prisons, probation providers, police and councils to prevent individuals being drawn into terrorism. Ministers will have powers to issue directions to organisations that repeatedly invite extremist speakers or fail in the duty in other ways.
Mary Senior, Official for the Scotland University and Colleges Union (UCU), said:
“Universities and colleges have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students and staff and not to allow activities which are intended to foment hatred or violence, or to recruit support for unlawful activities such as terrorism.
“At the same time, universities and colleges rightly cherish, and must continue to promote, academic freedom as a key tenet of a civilised society. It is essential to our democracy that all views are open to debate and challenge within the law.”
Tom Lawrence, from the Home Office Press office said:
“The purpose of our Prevent programme is stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. It deals with all kinds of terrorist threats to the UK.
“Prevent activity in local areas relies on the co-operation of many organisations to be effective. Currently, such co-operation is not consistent across the country.
“The new duty will require specified authorities to have due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism. This will include local government, the police, prisons, providers of probation services, schools, colleges, universities and others.
“Universities’ commitment to freedom of speech and the rationality underpinning the advancement of knowledge means that they represent one of our most important safeguards against extremist views and ideologies.
“However, extremist preachers have used higher education institutions as a platform for spreading their messages. Universities must take seriously their responsibility to deny extremist speakers a platform.
“This duty is not about the government restricting freedom of speech — which the government is committed to – it is about universities taking account of the interests and well-being of all their students, staff and the wider community.”
The bill, which will be published tomorrow, will also give police the power to seize passports and travel documents for up to 30 days, from people thought to be leaving UK to engage in terrorism-related activities, and force internet services providers to release Internet Protocol addressees to the police in order to target individuals.Granville, 104 days in sex chat

What is then the most effective curly hairstyle to have? Well, experts counsel that the most effective curly coiffure you could have is the one that mixes your coiffure as well as the care to your hair. In case you are blessed with naturally curly air, like it. Nourish it and deal with it instead of going to excessive limits to straighten it to be part of the fashion crowd. Aside from long flowing wavy hair, brief cults too look nice on curly hair. Make a brief bob that envelops your face and you can retain for a long time your youthful schoolgirl look.
Many ladies in their fifties make the error of attempting to cowl up their body. Your body is a testomony to the path you have traveled for forty or fifty years, the last thing you want to do is wear over sized and frumpy garments. For all different Providers, the Relevant Verizon Media Entity is Oath Inc. (Address: 22000 AOL Means, Dulles, VA 20166). The thought of having the ability to receive new garments each month without leaving the home is very interesting to many various sorts of shoppers, and due to this there are literally many different corporations that provide the identical kind of monthly stylist service as DailyLook, together with Sew Fix , Golden Tote , Le Tote , and extra.
The button-down formal shirt has remained standard by way of all of those developments in men’s shirts and vogue. Its history is lengthy sufficient that it’s onerous to precisely pinpoint how this instance of men’s shirts and style got here into being. Prints: Female prints swerve in the course of floral and female inspirations with using almost of forms of vibrant and attractive colors. Menswear mirror blunt prints whereas womens clothes show more lighter and galvanizing colour that brighten days up. Standard feminine colours include pink, violet and ranging shades of brighter colours the like of yellow and orange.
Because most societies require a powerful and stiff manner to match how males are seen, clothes are designed and created on this fashion. Males’s style normally is created out of want and is usually designed for utility in non-company jobs. Ladies’s vogue nonetheless, has expanded from performance to design and style. Because of women’s emotional and expressive nature, it has solicited the attention and admiration of the alternative intercourse. This in flip has supplied emotional gratification to the ladies. Aside from personal style, the sophistication and totality of how clothes and niknaks are carried by girls are given importance and are even typically gauged as the intensity and extremity of womanhood.Deployment. Post-traumatic stress disorder. Self-medication with alcohol. Domestic abuse. And finally, in some cases, sexual assault.
It’s a cycle retired longtime Army attorney Captain Tony Hosein has seen many times.
Hosein, who served as a legal assistance and special victims attorney for the Army before he retired in February, had helped dozens of domestic violence survivors — “I’ve seen the worst of the worst.” But cases typically only got to his desk once an abusive situation had escalated.
“A lot of times domestic violence leads to sexual assault. And I believe it should receive the same attention and they should have the same resources available to them,” he said.
A two-year investigation by CBS News found roughly 100,000 incidents of domestic abuse have been reported to the military since 2015. Many of the nearly 40 survivors who had reported domestic violence to the military and who spoke to CBS News described a broken system.
“I started off very idealistic, you know, wanting to help, wanting to do better. And just somewhere throughout the years, it just — I felt like I was spinning my wheels,” Hosein said.
“Incidents of spousal abuse in the military” were “more than twice that of the national population,” according to 2019 data cited by the nonprofit Blue Star Families.
Liz Knight was one of those helped by Hosein. While military police investigated and found probable cause to charge the person she accused of physically assaulting her, Knight’s case did not go to a court-martial. The alleged perpetrator instead received a local letter of reprimand, which, she said, was removed from his record when he left South Korea.
“There was no protection for me. There was no help. There were no resources,” Knight said. “The soldier is an asset. They need him. They have spent a lot of money to train him to do his job. And who am I? As long as I’m removed and I’m not part of the problem, then they have their soldier.”
The Army values the soldier more than the victim’s safety, Hosein said, because “the Army is tasked with fighting this nation’s wars. So, the most important thing to the Army is its soldiers.”
“Soldiers are great at what they do. They are great at fighting this nation’s wars,” he said. “But when they come back home, there’s a disconnect. They’re not in battle anymore. A lot of ’em have PTSD and other traumas.”
Before Hosein stared working with survivors, he was a defense counsel for soldiers who were alleged to have committed sexual assault and rape. That gave him an unusual perspective. “There are people who have done horrible things that I may have helped, you know. But I got to see the other side, and the hurt, and the trauma, and the pain from the victim’s perspective,” he said.
Defense Department policy mandates that commanders ensure military offenders are held accountable. Commanders also have the power to make decisions about the outcome of a case, including whether it goes to a court-martial. Hosein said those decisions about the outcome of a case, including whether it goes to a court-martial, should be made by a prosecutor or a judge.
“Great for the soldier. But for the victim it looks like they’re in a system that’s rigged against them,” he said. “Until there’s drastic change, I think we’ll still see the same trends. Domestic violence in the military, I think, will persist.”.Arranged Marriage
Arranged marriage has been the tradition in Cambodia for centuries and remains the norm practiced for Cambodians both at home and overseas. Marriage is a very important institution for Cambodians. The courtship practices and the marriage ceremony are very different from those practiced in the Western culture.
Traditionally, marriage was always arranged without the knowledge or consent of the individuals to be married. Forced marriage was common. Many families arranged marriages while the betrothed individuals were still very young; friends made promises to each other that their children would marry. If a man were interested in marrying a girl he saw but to whom he had not spoken, his parents would arrange an engagement ceremony with the girl’s parents. The girl would have nothing to say about it.
Marriage is still arranged but individuals often are consulted about the choice of their spouse, and rejecting the parents’ arrangement is tolerated. Even a young woman has an opportunity to reject her parents’ wishes, although not many daughters are yet willing to exercise this option. honor are retained.
Children also have obligations toward their parents to do their utmost to maintain their parents’ honor..
Gender Roles
The traditional role of Khmer women goes back at least to the Angkor era (802 – 1431 A.D.), when the “apsara” or “goddess” was accepted as the embodiment of a virtuous, ideal woman and described in proverbs, folktales behavior includes not crying or screaming during labor, behavior also affects her family. In terms of marriage, she becomes undesirable by a ‘good’ family because no one wants a ‘dirty’ girl as an in-law. Her parents’ pride and honor honor.
For more on Cambodian wedding traditions, see also .
Loyalty, Divorce, behavior.. (Henry Kamm, Cambodia: Report from a Stricken Land 1998, Arcade Books)
The modern constitution forbids polygamy; some say it is commonly practiced liters practiced here.
Domestic Violence
Increasing domestic violence is another sign of the decline in married life in Cambodia. According to a survey conducted by a Cambodian non-governmental organization ‘Project Against Domestic Violence – PADV’ in cooperation with the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, 73.9 percent of interviewees stated that they knew of at least one family experiencing domestic violence.
Domestic violence in the form of physical abuse of wife and children by the husband and father is very common. There is also much emotional abuse. Positive reinforcement of children’s behavior is not culturally appropriate. Parents believe that giving compliments and affirmations to their children will go to their head. This is true among Khmer families in the U.S. as well as in Cambodia.
In Cambodia, the abusers are very violent. Fifty percent of women who reported abuse stated that they received injuries; more than half of those injuries were to the head. Women reported beatings, whippings, stabbing, and even ax attacks. Most often the violence is perpetrated in public.
Typically the police or the community gives little help to the victims. Police intervene only in the case of the severe injuries or death, as there is no law specifically against domestic violence. In fact, the law to combat domestic violence has just been proposed and is scheduled for debate in the National Assembly at the end of 2002. The attitude of society compounds this problem. Cambodians consider domestic violence as a private and family matter. Women most often are blamed for instigating the violence by not properly behaving or providing sex to their husbands.
As a Cambodian woman lamented, “If there are thirty days in a month, it seems as if my husband hits me sixty. My neighbors know he hits me at night. They always think it is a dispute over intercourse. The neighbors often advise me, ‘If your husband wants to have sex, you must give it to him. If you don’t, he will hit you.’” Cambodia: Rattling the Killing Fields
Spousal rape is an alien concept to most Cambodians, both men and women. According to PADV, thirty-two out of the thirty-seven women interviewed stated that a husband should be able to have sex whenever he wants.DiscardedYKTTW Nakige YKTTW Discussion
A game designed to make you cry that still has a happy ending.Needs Examples Description Needs Help Better Name Motion To Discard Already have?
Nakige is a Japanese portmanteau for "crying game", applied to VisualNovels. Usually, these games consist of a lighthearted half to start with, followed by a romantic middle, then introduce drama designed to make you cry in the second half, and eventually reach a happy ending (generally ending up with a girl of your choice). Quite a few have been adapted into Anime series or movies. Nakige are often populated by Bishoujo-style characters and aimed squarely at a Seinen audience. Being VisualNovels, they often contain quite a bit of the erotic content that comes with the territory. Especially successful games, however, are often released with their explicit content cut; some games, such as CLANNAD, never had any to begin with. While there were predecessors, the genre's breakout hit was Kanon, by Key Visual Arts.
Examples
- Many of KEY's works are nakige:
- CLANNAD, a game with no erotic content and themes of family / True Companions. It is also known for being very, very long.
- Kanon
- AIR
- Symphonic Rain, a musically-themed novel with a built-in Rhythm Game.
- Katawa Shoujo, a known for being one of the few novels respected by the vn community originally written in English. Somewhat controversial, as every love interest (and the main character) is disabled, and for having an Intentionally Awkward Title.

Providing patient-centered enhanced discharge planning and rural transition support: Building a rural transitions network between regional referral and critical access hospitals

Abstract
Residents of rural and frontier counties experience significant disparities in healthcare access and outcomes when compared to their urban counterparts. The organization of health care delivery contributes significantly to these disparities. Simply put, rural residents can face many challenges when they have to go to a hospital in a distant city for treatment and then return home to recover. The transition back home is also problematic because discharge planning generally does not adequately account for limited access to care in rural areas. The specific aim of this research project was to ascertain rural patients’ actual experience of the discharge planning process, and to involve patients and rural providers in designing and testing a contextually appropriate rural model that improves patient outcomes and reduces re-hospitalizations.
This manual was used in a research project, Rural Options at Discharge – Model of Active Planning (ROADMAP). Our objective was to develop and evaluate a model that improved the likelihood of a positive recovery and reduced the likelihood of re-hospitalization. Current trends in health care delivery suggest that the right supports provided to patients at the right time may improve outcomes and reduce re-hospitalizations. For patients being discharged from a tertiary care facility back to a small town or rural community, this support includes assistance in addressing instrumental and social support needs. The methods included in this manual come from the literature, from cutting-edge practices in the field of care coordination, from recommendations of medical care providers, from patients themselves, and from lessons learned through this research process.

Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption
Stephen King
This is an easy call for me. The twist at the end of the Stephen King short Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption never ceases to make me smile. The story of Andy Dufrane’s creative use of a rock hammer was made into an equally incredible movie. I read the short well before the film adaptation was made, but the reveal at the end still had me amazed, although I knew it was coming.
If you have not read the story or seen the movie, I encourage you to read the story first. It is one of King’s finest. Then catch the movie. You will be hard pressed to find a better one.

Chef Jared Tees is serving New Orleans favorites such as soft shell crab po-boys, barbeque shrimp, catfish court-bouillion and bread pudding.
Bourbon House is one of three restaurants owned and operated by Dickie Brennan, Steve Pettus and Lauren Brennan Brower. Palace Café suffered some damage and Dickie Brennan’s Steakhouse took extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina. Reopening dates for those restaurants will be announced soon.
More than 300 employees all told work at the three restaurants.
“We’re fortunate to be able to restore local flavor to New Orleans, but what’s more important is to be able to restore the lives of the many employees who work in our three restaurants,” said Dickie Brennan.
“Many team members.”

The report describes the nature of the program, the characteristics of supervised offenders and outcomes for these offenders. It also presents the results of an evaluation which compared outcomes for offenders in the program with those from a set of cases in which the offenders did not receive supervision. The evaluation also included an interview component which elicited reactions to the program from its participants.
The Palmer Project
The project in Palmer, which ran from 1998 through the first part of 1999, was conceived as a pilot project which would provide probation supervision to a selected group of offenders convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence violations. The majorityabout 95 per centof Alaska offenders convicted of domestic abuse are convicted of misdemeanors and ordinarily receive no formal supervision once released from custody. This absence of supervision has been perceived as a weak link in the criminal justice system. The pilot project was funded by a $131,000 grant under the federal Violence Against Women Act. It had two goals: to develop offender accountability and to increase victim safety. It comprised a collaborative effort among various branches of the justice system serving Palmer: local law enforcement; the district attorneys office; district and superior court judges; the Valley Womens Resource Center; and the Palmer probation office.
Those planning the program decided to target more serious domestic violence offenders for inclusion in the program, on the theory that supervision resources should not be expended on less serious offenders who might be likely to succeed without extra attention.
Over the fifteen months a total of 47 offenders were supervised. Most often, the district attorneys office made the request that an offender be admitted to the program, although judges also ordered supervised probation sua sponte. Defense attorneys typically did not ask for their clients to be admitted to the program.
One probation officer supervised all the domestic violence misdemeanants in the program. The caseload averaged about 40 offenders per month early in the program and 30 per month later. (This contrasts with an average active felony probation caseload of about 100 offenders per officer in the Palmer probation office.)
A review of the probation officers contact log showed the intense level of supervision permitted by the small caseload. The officer averaged 42 contacts with each offender and met face-to-face with all but three offenders. During these contacts, she inquired about employment, residence and compliance with treatment requirements and initiated discussions about the offenders perspective on what had happened and the nature of domestic violence.
The probation officer also contacted most of the supervised offenders victimsa practice not normally associated with probation supervision to ask about the victims sense of safety and the offenders behavior.
Characteristics of Offenders
The Judicial Council report presents a list of characteristics of offenders in the supervised group and a similar list for offenders in the set of cases which was used as a control group for purposes of statistical comparison. The report details how the control group was chosen from 1997 and 1998 filings in the Palmer court system.
Almost all offenders, in both the program group (47) and in the set of cases selected as a control group (123) for the purposes of the evaluation, had been charged with assault in the fourth degree, which is a misdemeanor. A few had originally been charged with Assault III, a felony. All had been convicted of a misdemeanor offense against an intimate partnermost commonly assault or interfering with a domestic violence report. Most offenders were married to or living with the victims at the time of the offense. Sentences imposed by judges typically included incarceration for several days or weeks; conditions of probation requiring offenders to complete a batterer intervention program and substance abuse assessment or treatment; and, in some cases, a suspended fine. Judges seldom ordered restitution or community work service.
The majority of offenders had at least one prior misdemeanor conviction89 per cent of the supervised group and 62 per cent of the unsupervised. About 60 per cent of the supervised offenders were under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the offense. Because of the way information is maintained in criminal history records and court files, data on substance abuse for the control group was less reliable, although for a little over half (54%) there was some indication in the records of a history of substance abuse.
The supervised offenders and those in the control group were mostly Caucasian, although minorities were slightly overrepresented in both groups compared to the general population of the Mat-Su valley. Women were 2 per cent of the supervised group and 17 per cent of the control group. The average age of supervised offenders was 34 years. In the control group the average age was 35.5 years.
All but two of the supervised offenders (4%) possessed at least a high school degree or GED. No educational information was available for the control group. Over half of the offenders in both groups reported full or part-time employment.
Outcomes
Five (11%) of the supervised offenders were alleged to have committed a new domestic violence offense against the same victim and two (4%) against another victim. A new offense against the same victim was alleged for eleven of the control group (9%) and a new offense against a different victim for two (2%).
The probation officer filed one or more petitions to revoke probation against 72% of the supervised offenders (34). Petitions to revoke were filed against only half (60) of the control group.
For those with treatment programs ordered as a condition of probation, about a third of both the supervised offenders and the other group successfully completed court-ordered batterer-intervention programs. Thirty-seven per cent of the supervised group partially completed their programs, as did 21 per cent of the control group.
Thirty-five per cent of the supervised offenders completed substance abuse programs and 42 per cent partially completed the required treatment programs. Thirty-two per cent of the control completed their programs and 34 per cent partially completed the programs.
Evaluation
The Judicial Council evaluation used both quantitative and qualitative data to understand the effects of the program. The quantitative data, some of which is detailed above, was obtained from court and probation files, from the Alaska Public Safety Information Network (APSIN) and from treatment providers. It became the basis for a statistical comparison. In addition, both structured and informal interviews were conducted with judicial officers, police, attorneys and victim service providers. One offender and one victim were also interviewed. (Attempts to contact more victims and offenders were hampered by time and scheduling constraints.)
As the discussion in the previous section indicates, the supervised offenders resembled the control group in many variables including ethnicity, age, employment, relationship to victims and charges. The groups differed on several important variables including gender, prior record, and conditions of probation.
After discussing the problems which undercut precise comparability, the report presents the results of the statistical comparison between the two groups. The comparison found: the difference between the supervised group and the control group in complying with conditions on completing treatment program was not statistically significant; no statistically significant difference in the rates at which the two groups re-offended appeared; a statistical difference did exist in the percentages of probation revocation between the groups, with the supervised offenders more likely than those in the control group to have their probation revoked.
(Another quantitative finding which emerges from the study as it is reported is that women were named as defendants in almost a quarter (23%) of all the Palmer intimate-partner assault cases examined for the study. They accounted for 17 per cent of those ultimately convicted. This was true even though Palmer prosecutors dismissed cases against women at a much higher rate than they did for men.)
The other component of the Council evaluation was based on interviews conducted with those involved in the program. (Those who were interviewed were not aware of the results of the quantitative evaluation at the time of the interview.) With the exception of defense attorneys, the people interviewed were satisfied with the project and asked that it be continued. Judges, prosecutors, law enforcement and victim service providers perceived the program as a helpful resource. They relied on the probation officer to keep track of offenders they regarded as being at high risk of re-offending or violating probation. They also believed that the probation officer played an important coordination role among all players in the justice system. Defense attorneys argued that the program was ineffective in helping their clients to complete court-ordered conditions of probation, with their supervised clients more likely to be charged with offenses or violations unrelated to the original crime in their opinion, a consequence that did not help clients complete treatment or stay out of jail.
The program provided an important resource to victims, many of whom kept in close touch with the probation officer. This level of victim service is not normally available for misdemeanor cases in the criminal justice system.
Observations
Based on the findings of the evaluation the Judicial Council made three observations. First, since this evaluation suggests that probation supervision did not help offenders complete court-ordered treatment, more research should be done before deciding to start any future monitoring programs. Research should examine other models of post-release monitoring which might be more effective.
Second, since the program provided a valuable resource to victims and a level of victim service not regularly available for misdemeanor cases, future research could focus on how to replicate this level of service in a cost-effective way.
Finally, the evaluation points to three other areas for possible research. Victims, offenders, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and probation officers might together design a post-release monitoring program aimed toward helping offenders complete court-ordered treatment. Another research project could re-examine the offenders studied in this report at a later date. Finally, additional research is needed to illuminate how often and under what circumstances women are involved as the offender in domestic violence cases.

It just works!! LOL.
No issues at all with my 6 Plus or my wife’s iPhone 6. In fact, it seems battery life has improved with iOS updates. We’ll keep using these things as long as possible, such as was the case with our iPhone 4 models which we had to replace when switching from AT&T to Verizon.
I’ve had my iPhone 6s Plus shut off twice. Battery at 48% and around 40% on the second time.
It kept happening to me so I brought it in, they analyzed it, and replaced my battery for free. Very happy with the service. All good now, so I recommend you bring it in.
My old 6 has this problem. And MDN, yes, typically Apple will refund the costs incurred in a “service enhancement” program upon presentation of proper paperwork (if Apple did the work, typically not even that is needed).
My 6+ started having problems right before the recall started. I traded it in on an SE. With the exception of typing things on the keyboard, the SE is a much better phone for me in just about every way. I thought I’d miss the big screen, I was wrong.
I could be upset that Apple made the recall right after I turned mine in. The only thing I’m upset about is that I didn’t trade that gigantor of a phone in earlier.By Allyson Beckman
On December 27, 2020, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“the Act”), which extends some financial relief to small businesses and individuals impacted by COVID-19. Of note to employers, the paid leave benefits have been extended but are no longer mandatory. This extension, along with some key-employment-related changes under the new Act, are addressed below [1]:
Does the new stimulus bill extend the paid leave provisions under the Family First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) beyond December 31, 2020?
No, however it gives employers discretion to do so on a voluntary basis through March 31, 2021. Otherwise, the Act no longer requires employers to provide employees with emergency paid sick leave (EPSL) or emergency family and medical leave (EFMLA) after December 31, 2020.
Does the Act extend FFCRA’s refundable tax credit incentives for employers who provide employees with paid leave in accordance with the EPSL and EFMLA requirements after December 31, 2020?
Yes, if certain conditions are met. Covered employers who voluntarily decide to provide employees with paid leave benefits in accordance with FFCRA’s EPSL and EFMLA requirements may be eligible for reimbursement of the costs of leave through refundable tax credit for employees who did not exhaust their leave benefits – 80 hours of EPSL, 12 weeks of EFMLA, and/or the $10,000 maximum payment for EFMLA leave – by the December 31, 2020 deadline. The Act extends the tax credit incentive to cover any paid leave provided to employees from January 1, 2021 to March 31, 2021.
Would an employee be entitled to another 12 weeks of protected FMLA leave after December 31, 2020 if their FMLA reset on January 1, 2021 and the employer is voluntarily providing FFCRA paid leave benefits?
It depends. Although the Act does not extend the time allotted by the FFCRA for paid leave beyond December 31, 2020, employees who received FFCRA paid leave after March 31, 2021 may be entitled to protected FMLA leave after exhausting the time allotted by the EFMLA if: i) the employer’s 12-month FMLA policy reset January 1, 2021; ii) the covered employer voluntarily extends the original FFCRA benefits deadline for employees who had not already exhausted all 80 hours of EPSL, 12 weeks of EFMLA, or reached the $10,000 maximum EFMLA payment; iii) the covered employer seeks corresponding payroll tax credits for employees who took FFCRA leave from January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2021; and iv) an employee meets the eligibility requirements and qualifies for additional protected leave after March 31, 2021.
However, if employers voluntarily provide paid FFCRA leave without applying for payroll tax credit, employers can deduct an employee’s amount of leave from their 12 weeks of FMLA leave (if the employee was eligible and qualified for FMLA).
Should employers draft a leave policy specifically for covering leave for COVID-qualifying circumstances?
Employers may want to consider adopting a specific pandemic (e.g., COVID-19) or public health emergency policy for employees that is acceptable to their business practice and that does not interfere with any protected leave rights afforded to employees by federal, state, and/or local laws.
It would prove beneficial to the employer and the employee to adopt a specific policy for these circumstances because it would provide employees with a clear and unambiguous understanding of what to expect and how to prepare professionally and personally (to the extent possible) should similar circumstances arise in the future. The policy would also demonstrate the employer’s consistency and commitment to make sure all procedures are administered in a uniform, fair, and legally compliant manner.
Some decisions employers would need to make if they are devising their policies and procedures include but are not limited to the following:
- what specific criteria must be met for this policy to become effective (e.g., public health emergency; COVID-19 qualifying circumstances);
- what are the employer’s business expectations during a public health emergency;
- what safety protocols or guidelines must employees follow during a public health emergency);
- whether employer benefits are available for employees during a public health emergency that may differ from their existing time-off and/or leave of absence policies;
- whether an employer would provide additional emergency sick leave and/or emergency family and medical leave (i.e., maximum emergency sick hours; maximum amount of emergency family and medical leave hours; maximum for overall benefits payment);
- whether the employer’s emergency leave is paid or unpaid;
- whether the policy has eligibility requirements to qualify for the additional leave benefits under this policy (e.g., full-time employees only);
- whether any leave benefits apply to employees facing mandatory child-care/school closures;
- whether additional leave benefits cover employees with school-age children undertaking virtual and/or hybrid learning;
- whether the policy is effective for a specified period;
- would the employee be entitled to roll-over any additional leave benefits; and
- whether the employer would continue providing additional leave benefits if another government plan is passed that affects small businesses.

Adenoid culture and PCR were positive in 56.3% for each, while tonsil culture was positive in 70% and PCR was positive in 90%. presence in the gastric lavage, the tonsillar and adenoid tissues by culture and PCR was significantly more frequent in the study group compared to the control group. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of clarithromycin-resistant isolates ranged from 1.5 to 8?g/ml. This study showed the presence of in around 50% of the patients with OME. PCR revealed its sensitivity than culture techniques. The incidence Neratinib of clarithromycin resistance was found to be high among the isolates (39.6%). infections are almost always acquired in childhood and if untreated, remain lifelong. In the developing world, up to 70% of children are infected with by 15?years of age (De Giacomo et al., 2002). It is one of the most frequent infections all over the world. The prevalence of the disease is 30C40% in the developed countries and 80C90% in the developing countries. Crowded families, ethnical status, migration to the endemic places, the frequency in the family and general condition of the patient are the risk factors. It is not very clear how the disease infects somebody but oralCoral, fecal-oral or gastro-oral contamination may be possible. There are many clues of colonization in the dental plaques, tonsils and adenoid tissues (Nguyen et al., 2000). Although OME is such a common disease of childhood, its pathogenesis still remains unsettled (Gulani et al., 2010). Causes of Neratinib OME are believed to be multifactorial, including viruses, allergy, bacteria and their products, and dysfunction of the eustachian tube. Gastroesophageal reflux could also be a cause of this disease. Reflux Neratinib of gastric contents from the nasopharynx to the middle ear is possible because of the angle between them and immaturity of the eustachian tube in children and infants and the supine position in which infants are often placed (Ruhani et al., 1996). Tasker et al. (2002a) showed pepsinogen and pepsin in the middle ear fluid of patients with OME, indicating that gastric fluid could reach as far as the middle ear and this might be involved in the pathogenesis of OME. If gastric juice could enter the middle ear, are microaerophilic, Gram-negative spiral organisms where many diagnostic assays have been developed; culture, histology, rapid urease test, urea breath test, serology, stool antigen test, and molecular-based tests (Vaira et al., 2002). Culture has the great advantage of permitting subsequent determination of the antimicrobial susceptibility of the strain isolated. However, disadvantages of culture include special conditions for specimen transportation, the use of complicated media with special conditions for maintenance, the need for special incubation conditions, and the length of time necessary to obtain Neratinib a result (Tankovic et al., 2001). Clarithromycin, a new generation of macrolide, has antiactivity and may replace metronidazole in eradication regimens. Clarithromycin acts by binding to the peptidyl transferase region of 23S rRNA and inhibits bacterial protein synthesis (Houben et al., 1999). Preliminary studies on clinical trials with this drug alone or in combination with proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics achieved eradication rates varying from 40% to 100%. Resistance to clarithromycin has been Grem1 observed and it may be an important factor in determining treatment failure, resulting in the varying eradication rates (Perez-Perez, 2000). The prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin varies among different countries, such as 12% in Japan, 1.7C23.4% in Europe, and 10.6C25% in North America (Toracchio and Marzio, 2003; Mgraud, 2004). The difference depends on macrolide consumption. Several studies suggest that clarithromycin resistance is higher in strains obtained from.Bust out your highlighters because the official NYE In The Park 2018 set times and maps are fresh off the presses!

Data managed by NJDOH and Rutgers Cancer Institute supports cancer research through SEER Program.
Data from the NJSCR aids investigators at Rutgers Cancer Institute and beyond in research that helps us better describe cancer patterns, discover cancer causes and plan programs for those impacted by cancer – all leading to better outcomes for our populations.
Steven K. Libutti, MD, FACS
Director, Rutgers Cancer Institute
The SEER Program is considered to be the most authoritative source of information on cancer incidence and survival in the United States. The NJSCR is one of only 18 population-based CORE registries in the country that are part of the SEER Program and is one of only three awarded SEER CORE infrastructure contracts during this highly competitive round of funding from the NCI. The SEER Program is an important source of information, widely used by health care providers, public health officials and administrators, and researchers.
“This funding is made possible in part due to Rutgers Cancer Institute’s designation as New Jersey’s only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, and will support critical work as there is a great demand for quality data resources for collaborative cancer research,” shares Rutgers Cancer Institute Director Steven K. Libutti, MD, FACS, who is also senior vice president, oncology services, RWJBarnabas Health. “Data from the NJSCR aids investigators at Rutgers Cancer Institute and beyond in research that helps us better describe cancer patterns, discover cancer causes and plan programs for those impacted by cancer – all leading to better outcomes for our populations.”
The funding will support ongoing cancer surveillance activities at the NJSCR, as well as support enhancements to New Jersey’s electronic reporting systems such as electronic pathology and medical claims data transmissions. This is in addition to other SEER registry informatics projects leveraging artificial intelligence to streamline case identification and reportability through machine learning and auto-coding important variables such as cancer site and histology based on pathology data.
“The NJSCR provides data on cancer trends that can be very useful for preventing and controlling cancer and improving treatment and care. These data are also used to address New Jersey residents’ concerns on cancer issues,” says state Department of Health Commissioner Judith M. Persichilli, RN, BSN, MA. “In addition, incidence rates from our diverse population are shared with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the NCI to help inform analyses comparing other states and the nation. We are pleased this support will help continue such important work conducted in partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute.”
“This award is exemplary of the work of cancer registrars across the State of New Jersey who contribute surveillance data to the SEER Program. As a result of rigorous data collection and quality control methods, NJSCR data is routinely included in national and international publications of cancer incidence, mortality and survival statistics,” notes NJSCR Director Antoinette Stroup, PhD, who is a resident member of Rutgers Cancer Institute and a professor of epidemiology at Rutgers School of Public Health. “This funding will help ensure timely and complete cancer reporting across the state of New Jersey.” Dr. Stroup will lead the NJ SEER Program along with the Deputy Director of the Cancer Surveillance Research Program, Lisa Paddock, PhD, MPH and the NJSCR Program Manager, Heather Stabinsky, MSEd, CTR.
Federal funds supporting this work in whole or in part are provided by the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. 75N91021D00009. The contract runs through April 2028.From Fred Goldstein at the Workers World Party website:
“The oppressed are allowed once every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing classes shall represent them and repress them in parliament.”
Karl Marx, “The Civil War in France”
The midterm elections in the U.S. have caused a stir because the Democratic Party lost control of the Senate and lost further ground in the House of Representatives. The record low turnout, 36 percent of the eligible electorate, has drawn much comment. There has been a torrent of analyses trying to explain the Democratic Party defeat.
Many point to the failure of the Democrats and the Barack Obama administration to put forward any program that deals with the real problems of the masses — jobs, poverty, racism, the plight of immigrants, closing of abortion clinics, etc. Others say that Obama was kept off the campaign trail and the Democrats ran away from him — especially in the racist South but in many other states, too. Others point to the Citizens United ruling and corporate money corrupting the political process — close to $4 billion was spent, mainly by big business and the rich during this election. And thousands were also kept from voting by voter suppression laws.
All of this and much more is certainly true. And there is much understandable demoralization over the Republican sweep. The temptation is to get drawn into the debate over what went wrong, what this means for 2016, and the related debate over how to fix the problems of the Democratic Party.
Struggle of the masses ignored
In the analyses by the bourgeois pundits, they leave out the fact that tens of thousands of people are fighting against police killings and harassment as well as mass incarceration. The campaign to stop voter suppression is widespread. Millions of immigrants have been struggling since 2006 to get rights and legalization.
Across the country low-wage workers have been demonstrating for a $15-an-hour minimum wage and the right to have a union. In September some 400,000 people demonstrated in New York City alone against climate change. Thousands are demonstrating against the Keystone pipeline and fracking by the oil company predators.
Above all, millions are unemployed, underemployed or have dropped out of the work force, yet there was not a word during the campaign about a true jobs program to put them back to work at a living wage.
None of this, or of many other popular and necessary struggles, was reflected in the national campaigns of the capitalist parties. That is because they are capitalist parties and these issues are issues of the workers!
For the working class and all the oppressed, trying to figure out how to fix the Democratic Party would be a useless diversion. What the workers need to get from this election is that it is another dramatic illustration of why they need their own political party. They need a party that will fight for their everyday needs, by methods of militant struggle. They need a party that will use the electoral process, not to promote electoral illusions, but to expose capitalism and the bankruptcy of the profit system.
And they need a party that will fight to overcome the capitalist nightmare altogether.
This problem did not start just now. Almost 145 years ago, as Karl Marx analyzed the struggle of the French workers during the Paris Commune, he put things as well as they can be put with regard to elections under capitalism: “The oppressed are allowed once every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing classes shall represent them and repress them in parliament.”
Rich in charge of Democratic Party
Marx was talking about how the elections decide who will run the capitalist government. Take a look at the officials chosen by Obama to run the top of the government.
Chuck Hagel, head of the Pentagon. Some sources give a conservative estimate of his net worth as $5 million. But, more importantly, he is on the board of Chevron, of Deutsche Bank and of the Wolfensohn Co., founded by the head of the World Bank. When he quit the Senate in 2009, he went to the board of Corsair Capital, which had holdings in financial institutions in Argentina, Brazil, Bermuda, Germany, Korea, Poland and Sweden.
Hagel is a banker/financier who now runs the U.S. war machine and is making decisions to escalate U.S. intervention in Iraq, deploy more forces to NATO to fight the Ukrainian resistance movement, send $3 billion a year to Israel, etc. (USA Today, Jan. 14, 2013)
Or take Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew. Lew is a multimillionaire. He came from Citibank’s Alternative Investment department and before that Citi’s Global Wealth Management department. Alternative Investment is a fancy name for financial derivatives and speculative gambling. Global Wealth Management handles the money of the wealthiest individuals in the world. Millionaires are barely considered. Lew was implicated in helping to cause the 2008 financial meltdown.
Then there is Secretary of State John Kerry, worth $300 million in trusts that come from his spouse Teresa Heinz Kerry, heir to the Heinz ketchup fortune. Kerry lives off a corporate empire that he defends, along with others, as head of the State Department. The secretaries of Defense, Treasury and State are the core of the capitalist government.
And what of the legislature? This is the first year that the income of the representatives in the House averaged over $1 million each. Some of the important Democratic Party congresspeople are among the 25 richest members in net worth, as of 2012. For example, Mark Warner of Virginia at $257 million; Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut at $103 million; Nancy Pelosi at $87 million; Dianne Feinstein at $68 million, Alan Grayson at $40 million, and so on. (Net Worth, 2012, at opensecrets.org, published by the Center for Responsiveness in Politics)
How can workers’ interests or concerns be heard, let alone dealt with, among this den of wealthy corporate thieves and Wall Street sharks? It is no small wonder that austerity, cutbacks and bailouts for the rich prevail over wiping out poverty and unemployment.
The very capitalists that the politicians are tied to are the ones who are downsizing, laying off, cutting hours, making money by paying low wages, slashing benefits, fracking, instituting charter schools and private prisons, engaging in overseas plunder and the plunder of cities like Detroit, etc.
Myth of ‘progressive’ Democratic Party
The Democratic Party mythology, which has existed since Franklin Roosevelt, must be demolished. In its place must come dedication to working-class independence and an exposure of capitalist democracy as a sham, a way to hold workers down.
The failures of the Obama administration with respect to workers are not new. Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were compelled to pass progressive legislation only because millions of people were in motion. The New Deal was considered “riot insurance” to save capitalism, which was under attack by sit-down strikes, general strikes and mass demonstrations during the 1930s.
Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the so-called Great Society because millions of African Americans and others were in the streets facing down the cops and the Ku Klux Klan during the 1950s and 1960s.
As soon as the struggle died down, however, the Democratic Party leadership shed its disguise as a friend of the people. The Jimmy Carter administration in the 1970s opened the attack on welfare. Carter said “life isn’t fair” when responding to a question about a prohibition put on funding abortions for poor women. He started a military build-up and planned the union-busting attack on the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Association, which Ronald Reagan later carried out.
Bill Clinton destroyed the welfare system altogether. He declared that “the era of big government is over” as millions of poor women, disproportionately African American and Latina, were thrown off the rolls. He put in the first “anti-terrorism” laws, passed the Effective Death Penalty Act and, in effect, deregulated Wall Street by destroying the Glass-Steagall Act, passed after the Great Depression to curb the banks.
So the Obama administration is following a long tradition of Democratic Party leadership attacks on the workers and oppressed. It is a capitalist party of big business now and has been for over 100 years. It serves the interests of the rich, the bankers and the bosses.
Of course, the Republican Party is more blatant in its pursuit of the extreme interests of the rich. They have nothing to hide because business is their base. The Democratic Party leadership is plagued by having to conceal their anti-working class, racist, reactionary maneuvers because their base is the unions, the African-American and Latino/a populations, women, lesbian-gay-bi-trans-queer people, the progressive middle class, students and so on. That is why the two parties have different appeals, two different images. But there is nothing essential on which they differ when it comes to serving the fundamental interests of capital.
Ferguson and bourgeois democracy
V.I. Lenin put things well when he quoted Frederick Engels saying that “the modern representative state is an instrument of exploitation of wage-labour by capital.” (Quoted in Lenin’s “The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky”)
Lenin added: .”
One only has to look at Ferguson, Mo., with its militarization of the police and violence against justice-seeking protesters, or the exclusion of millions of prisoners and former prisoners from the voter rolls, to see a verification of Lenin’s view.
Under these circumstances, the workers and the oppressed have no alternative but to declare their break with capitalist parties and capitalism and fight for their own independent party — one that speaks and fights openly for the workers, against the capitalist class, and for socialist revolution.

I was concerned that they would all be dead and worried that I should have opened them the day before.
As I cut open the packaging, the rustle of life grew. I panicked. Was I going to open the box to find struggling butterflies? Squeamishly, I pulled out three small boxes in which the 250 chrysalises stirred, packed ever-so-neatly like ammunition. After peaking into one box, I squealed and ran like a child to vent my concern to a volunteer in the sound booth that there was no way I would be able to drop these tiny alien-beings into 250 small cups for everyone to take home following our Easter service. But if it was going to happen, I knew I had better get on with it because time was short, just two hours before the service was about to begin. Hesitant to get too acquainted with the wriggling not-yet-butterflies, I gingerly handled each chrysalis. By at least the 100th, I was picking them up and talking to them, willing them to survive; I quickly placed them in their temporal homes, small plastic cups capped off with filter paper and lids by my daughter and another young volunteer willing to help with the endeavor.
Once everyone had claimed their butterfly-to-be, my kids and I took 7 remaining chrysalises home to hatch. Even the one in our bunch that wriggled early that morning became still, each one silently transforming beneath the thin shell that enveloped it. Everyday that week, we picked up the small plastic cups which housed them and wondered at their stillness. They looked dead. Certainly they had not survived. I emailed the butterfly farm where we had ordered them from to ask just how long this would take. Patience ensued. We must wait. Even still, I studied them each morning, looking for some sign of life.
Then, that Friday, over a week after they began their journey to Maryland in a cooler-packed box, my daughter discovered two of them fully emerged in their cups on our kitchen table. We sliced a clementine and placed the butterflies in their temporary make-shift home, the inside of our salad spinner turned upside down on itself to make a dome.
What appeared dead was now very much alive. Each butterfly began its own story–one with a bent wing seemed less courageous to leave the safety of it’s salad-spinner turned-home; another flew off immediately upon being released; one flew clumsily into our neighbor’s backyard; one died in the process of emerging from its shell; one disappeared after our cat knocked over the bowl in our kitchen, quite possibly enticed by the fluttering he observed in the container. I found half of him with a quarter of his wing left, dead at the top of my basement stairs.
The metaphor for life was blatant in the wonder and mystery that was their coming and the common narrative that was their going.
The following week I took a walk with a friend, a bit of a catch-up after months of not seeing each other. She is on her way across the pond to live and work with her husband in England for a spell; and, with a baby on the way, adventures of all sorts are in store. She referred to the momentous changes just ahead as a “defining moment” in the course of her life.
Just like those butterflies, we each emerge into our own stories. Yet, those butterflies know (or don’t know, depending on how philosophical you want to get) that they are butterflies. Their stories are packed with the metaphor of what was but now is, of being wholly transformed into something new. During their metamorphosis they literally shed their skin and liquefy. To become something new, whatever was solid becomes, to some extent, “mush” so that something completely new can form from the cells that are there. This is their defining moment.The St. Jerome's University logo is the official mark of the institution. You may not alter it. Horizontal logo is perferred.

September 23, 2009
THE TALK... | Materials & Components
You may have a new feature on your window lines soon. I’m at the AAMA meeting this week and one of the committees here is working on a standard for window opening control devices. Although not too many WOCDs, as they are now called, are out on the market yet, such devices would address the long-simmering problem of how to prevent a child from falling through an open window while still enabling that window to serve as a means of emergency egress.
More details on this subject are provided in a recent article in Window & Door written by Mike Fischer, a code consultant with The Kellen Co. In a nutshell, however, a WOCD, as defined in a new ASTM standard would allow a window to be opened a limited amount for ventilation, but prevent it from being opened further by a small child. At the same time, however, an adult with no special knowledge could open the window easily if need be.
It occurred to me as I sat in the meeting that while code officials and others have been working fairly vigorously on this concept for the past few years, I have not heard much reaction to the idea from window manufacturers and dealers. I’m not even sure how much of the industry is aware of this new development. So I’m asking in our question of the week. And, of course, I’d like to get your feedback. Is this hardware something you’d like to offer on your window? Do you think home and building owners will think it is a good idea? Will this be a complicated concept to sell? Email me and let me know what you think.
Post new commentBefore last August, when Graves met with teachers to discuss compensation issues, the last faculty meeting had been a November 2012 town hall, according to Chris Walz, a full-time faculty member since 1996. “If you’re interested in transparency and calling people together to have substantial dialogue that’s what you do,” Walz says. “But to have the years go on like that is indicative to not having that desire.”
The communication hole swallowed staff morale, which hit “rock bottom,” according to one former administrator.
All accounts during this time circle back to complaints that Graves unnecessarily divided his staff. The all-in-it-together camaraderie that drove the launch of the Lincoln Square campus nearly twenty years before was gone. What replaced it was a top-down corporate structure driven by secrecy and petty alliances. “We thought we were building something big and were willing to sacrifice for it. He undermined our very strong love for the school,” says one former administrator. Many suggested that Graves picked favorites among top administrators.
Information stopped flowing from the top. Graves pushed out long-standing staffers from the earlier regime. When the Lincoln Square campus opened, the staff took classes, attended concerts and was typically involved in activities that strengthened their commitment to the school. According to most accounts, the hires Graves picked were rarely seen outside office hours.
“It surprised me how much antagonism was there,” says one former top administrator. Program managers—staff members charged with programming according to their respective discipline—no longer felt empowered to make decisions, which sparked distrust among teachers. Making things worse was a culture that favored male staffers for promotions and respect. “Men would value the opinion of men more than they would women, where they were either discounted or ignored or given a polite acknowledgement,” says an administrator. In some cases, experienced women staffers resigned or were fired after watching men revolve into top positions. An attorney specializing in labor law told one exiled female staffer she had a solid grievance to take the school to court. She declined. “I didn’t want to be the one suing the Old Town School of Folk Music,” she says.
Graves says he has just recently learned of the grievances. In an interview, he says he never felt his relationship with the faculty and staff had “been anything but very collegial.”
“Obviously there were some cues I was missing,” Graves says. “It distresses me enormously and it obviously passed below my radar as long as I’ve been here.”
The tension was greatest among the teaching faculty, who were beginning to feel muzzled. This was particularly jarring since the Old Town School model was largely a collective one. Teachers served as the public faces of the school, and they were the ones who formed bonds with students over years.
Yet tuition increases didn’t translate to increased compensation. Teachers remained at-will employees. And stinging even more were pay freezes that Graves put in place in 2008 and 2013. Although 200 or so teachers have classes spanning the year’s six sessions, only about thirty are considered full-time. “Frank’s Faculty,” named after Hamilton, established those teachers as salaried employees, but in 2008 they reverted back to hourly workers. In order to maintain their health benefits each session, teachers have to have at least eighteen teaching hours. The new hourly structure tied their pay and health care directly to student enrollment. The result? The school’s most active teachers were now forced to exist “session by session,” says Walz. The fear of “having your insurance being taken away became something you have to think about every two months.”
“There aren’t any guarantees. The teachers know that it’s a numbers game,” says Walz. “If the teachers feel like there’s strong marketing and promotion behind us, we’d be much more willing to accept that, because we’d feel like everybody has given it their best shot. But we’re not feeling that as strongly as we did in the past.”
The compensation issue became particularly galling to faculty when they learned that Graves, while implementing budget cuts, pay freezes, layoffs, and in December, buyouts, was on track to becoming the Old Town School’s highest-ever earner.
According to the school’s financials, Graves earned $149,406 in 2008, his first full year of employment. By 2017, his salary increased nearly seventy percent to $253,554. Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor of philanthropy and public affairs at Indiana University in Bloomington, says that determining executive salaries is not an exact science. While non-profit boards dictate compensation, “they also need to assess not only what value the person brings to the organization, but also what similar organizations are paying their executive directors.”
A 2016-2017 study by the PNP Staffing Group, a recruiting firm that tracks non-profit salaries and staffing trends, reports that organizations earning between $10 million to $20 million in the greater New York City area pay their executive directors between $180,000 and $210,000 on average. With the Old Town School’s annual revenues averaging about $12 million, there is no organization that is directly comparable in the Chicago market, where non-profit salaries run lower than in New York. But there are close comparisons: Kathryn Lipuma, executive director of Writers Theater (revenues $8.4 million in 2016) earned an annual salary of $158,110 in 2016, for example.
Enduring a pay freeze while being asked to take on more work especially angered staffers earning the least. “Here’s a man standing onstage making speeches where he literally says we have to tighten our belts to people who are making minimum wage,” says Sarah Furniss, a former front desk manager. “That’s not the Old Town School I signed up for.”
So what about Graves’ background gave him value to justify an escalating salary? Or, perhaps the more important question to ask: What about that background made him an obvious lock for the job in the first place?
Before arriving in Chicago, James Willis Graves, whose childhood nickname is “Bau,” served as a big fish in a very small pond—Portland, Maine, population around 60,000. In 1987, he and wife Phyllis O’Neill co-founded Portland Performing Arts, a presenting organization that brought ethnic music to town. The organization floated around until 1997 when it moved into a small building it bought for $65,000, according to reporting by the Portland Press-Herald. Renovation cost an extra $800,000. Once finished, the capacity of the rebranded Center for Cultural Exchange was 220 seats.
Tax documents show that Graves and O’Neill were the only full-time employees. They were a good match. Jay Young, a Portland attorney who served as the center’s board president, says Graves dealt with the programming while O’Neill handled the books. “She was focused on the budgets and funding. He was freer to focus more on artistic stuff, which seemed to be his strong suit,” Young said in a telephone interview.
Graves wowed local audiences because he brought in programming from distant shores they might otherwise never hear. But the good times didn’t last because the Center could never get ahead of building costs. In December 2005, Graves and O’Neill resigned. The next year, the organization sold the building and folded. One of the chief problems, according to Young, was maintaining a mortgage while trying to fill a theater for performances by largely unknown artists. Graves “is more comfortable as a presenter. That’s clearly more his strong suit than maintaining real estate,” Young says. Ticket sales from the esoteric programming couldn’t cover costs for years. “It’s just a lot of work and you wind up spread too thin.”
According to reporting by the Portland Phoenix and by the Center’s tax documents, the organization spent more than it was earning during its final years. Between 2002 and 2004, spending increased twelve percent and the Center ran continual deficits. By 2004, the Center’s operating deficit totaled $188,390.
Graves told the Phoenix that shrinking government grants contributed to the shortfall. Speaking to Newcity, he says he left believing “the organization was in good hands and it was going to continue to thrive.”
He blamed his replacement for the Center shutting its doors: “The board hired someone else and unfortunately, they made a bad hire. It broke my heart to see it fall apart.”
Lisa DiFranza, who replaced Graves for less than a year until the Center shut its doors, told The Bollard, a local arts monthly, that “past debt accrued under the leadership” of Graves and O’Neill “contributed to the Center’s ongoing financial burden.”
After Portland, Graves and O’Neill moved to Roanoke, Virginia, where Graves headed the Jefferson Center, an organization that presents music in a former high-school auditorium. There he faced an organization with a far bigger annual budget: $1.8 million in 2006. That May, he told The Roanoke Times that the Center faced a $400,000 shortfall. He managed to shore up most of that money by end of the year.
But that job lasted fourteen months. The following March he told locals he couldn’t pass up a new opportunity in Chicago. It was, he said, “a plum job.”
It is easy to see why the Old Town School represented fruit on the vine. Graves had never shown tangible success growing an arts organization the size and scope of Old Town, had never run a school, had never managed a staff of more than a few people, had no experience overseeing a faculty in the hundreds and a student body in the thousands, had never overseen a budget of more than $2 million, had never grown an endowment, and had never worked in any of those capacities in a market as sophisticated and complex as the third largest city in the United States.
These shortcomings have been raised in recent months in an effort to examine the factors that led to the school’s chaotic state. How did Graves get into the running for the job when clearly there are arts-management professionals, in Chicago and beyond, who had longer résumés showing more positive results, or who have at least had experience that corresponds to the dynamics of running a community-based school?
Some have offered one clue: He brought his guitar.
People who were involved in the process, either on a committee that interviewed Graves or who met him during the hiring courtship, say Graves was impressive because the faculty saw their reflection in him. After all, he is a multi-instrumentalist with a master’s degree in ethnomusicology from Tufts University in Boston. He distributed copies of “Cultural Democracy,” his 2005 book published by the University of Illinois Press, and during a meet-and-greet he arrived with his guitar to jam.
The charm offensive was successful. Graves talked about growth and diversity, two issues the faculty supported. “There was a sense that he seemed to get the place in a way that we were hoping that an executive director would,” says Walz. “There was a grassroots movement amongst the teachers to get the message to the folks on the hiring committee that we liked him and that we wanted him there.”
But several women interviewed for this article say they sensed immediately Graves was a wrong fit.
Some observed that during a meet-and-greet with staff, Graves didn’t seem interested in asking questions, but brought the focus to himself. That turned off some of the women, who wrote letters to the board saying they recommended Gail Kalver, another candidate, who seemed far more qualified. By 2007, Kalver had been executive director of Hubbard Street Dance Chicago for twenty-three years, and before that served as an associate manager at the Ravinia Festival for seven years. She, too, was a musician, with a master’s degree from Roosevelt University.
“She had her chops running a large non-profit organization that was also a world-renowned dance company, had connections within the Chicago community, and knew how to fundraise,” says one former administrator. But within discussions among Frank’s Faculty, it became clear that none of that mattered for one reason: “She was a woman and the guitar culture at the Old Town School is a boy’s club. So no one was as impressed as they were with Bau Graves whipping out the guitar.”
There was slight awareness of his history in Portland, but it amounted to “a quiet whispering of what happened there,” says one former administrator. Walz admitted that instead of looking at Graves’ qualification as an arts administrator, they chose to focus solely on “the man and what he was saying and how he was relating to the school and all of us.”
“I don’t know if any of us were thinking we should go on the Internet and see what we could find,” he said. “We also trusted the folks who were in the decision-making roles to make the right decision.”
What members of Frank’s Faculty did not anticipate when they endorsed Graves was how much he was interested in disconnecting the school from its past, which didn’t just mean pruning and replacing staff. Instead, following ideas he articulated in his book, Graves became interested in experimenting with cultural programming in marginalized neighborhoods—a noble ambition, that to him meant working with people different than those he sees every day.
“We have to recruit a new core of teaching artists who live in their communities, understand what their aesthetic interests are and cater to those desires,” he said. “And we have to make those program costs free or very low cost so there are few barriers for people to be involved.”
In Portland, Graves had created programs for the large African refugee community there. Between 2001 and 2003, the events—from a fashion show to a festival to a play—tried to bring dialogue to groups that were often in conflict with one another by making them key stakeholders in the activities themselves. While it successfully introduced African culture to the majority-white locals, the events largely failed because the Center found that the African groups mainly sustained those disagreements in the United States and didn’t want to associate with one another, onstage or off. “Bau had hoped to have a civil exchange between spokespersons of different factions, but by accident he may have created more friction than reducing friction,” says Jay Young, the board president. “I don’t fault him for trying to do it. It doesn’t always work.”
In Chicago, Graves resurrected those ideas in Englewood, a South Side neighborhood besieged by gun violence that became a focus of Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Graves sought to establish relationships with partners on the ground to create programming that people in the neighborhood would find valuable.
“If a piece of the legacy I leave at Old Town School is continuing to be active in seeking out and working with constituencies that are not a bunch of white guys playing the banjo, but African-Americans and Asian-Americans—different communities that we’re just never going to serve in Lincoln Square,” he said, “then I’m proud of having made us do that.”
Former administrators say that when Graves uses phrases like “white guys playing the banjo” or throws around highly charged phrases like “systemic racism” to describe a school composed of a teaching faculty that is largely liberal and committed to diversity issues, he may not understand how his words ring as offensive to the people he was hired to lead.
“How can you talk about healing a community with the arts when you have such a disdain for the community you are a part of?” one recently departed administrator asks.
But Graves also seems to dismiss another obvious reality: that the Old Town School has already been doing the work he describes for many years.
Since its first year of operation, the Old Town School made outreach to marginalized communities in Chicago a core part of its mission. Benefit concerts and fund drives were common at its first two locations. For students who couldn’t buy their own instruments, the school gave them away or rented them at bargain prices. The school also conducted classes inside Chicago schools and hospitals. Co-founder Win Stracke created “Project Outreach” 1969, a scholarship program for schoolchildren from nearby housing projects. The school also gave free lessons to children in Uptown, a neighborhood stricken by poverty and populated substantially by Native Americans and Appalachian transplants. In 1965, co-founder Dawn Greening said the purpose was to make the music of their home region a point of pride: “We should let people know that the culture they bring to the city is truly worthwhile, and encourage them to recognize their own traditions.”
The sentiment is one that has powered programs that continue to today. The Old Town School serves 4,000 children in about twenty-six CPS and other schools like Rush Day School, which serves students with special needs, throughout the year and throughout the city, including Englewood. The program has been running for decades.
Yet those interviewed who worked closely with the Old Town School’s outreach efforts, say that Graves was laser-focused only on “Music Moves,” the Englewood program designed much like his African outreach in Portland—to encourage dialogue through cultural programming that originates from within the community rather than projected from the outside. Graves admits that he approaches “Music Moves” as an ethnomusicologist: working with researchers from UIC, the program created a “simple emotional evaluation protocol” that children fill out so the school can “gauge what kind of impact [the programming has] on the emotional lives of the participants.” So far, the program has included hip-hop poetry events, African drumming classes and in September 2018 presented “Quantum Englewood,” a ninety-minute concert by Englewood-based composer Ernest Dawkins and Rahul Sharma.
Those close to outreach efforts say that Graves poured all his energy into a program that he started at the expense of marginalizing the ones that existed before his arrival. In remarks to the board last May, Graves championed “Music Moves” as “important and groundbreaking work supported by several foundations and philanthropists seeking for innovative solutions to urban challenges and strife. It holds a great deal of promise for our school community as it continues to expand.”
The CPS program was mentioned once. “Our CPS outreach programs are running annual deficits… fiscal responsibility demands that these facets of our operation either adapt themselves to change within existing frames, substantially shift focus to eliminate continuing deficit spending, or suspend operations.”
This incensed those who interpreted Graves’ comments as, yet again, denigrating another hallmark of the school. “Over the last couple of years, the citywide cultural and urban planning movements have focused on Englewood,” one says. “Bau was personally driven and also wanted to capitalize on that momentum. He really isn’t interested in running a folk school anymore.”
They add that, in the non-profit world, outreach programs are expected to run deficits. His intention in using that word, some claim, is to gain support for programming that started under him, which they worry could mean redirecting more than $130,000 in grant money—the amount the Polk Bros. Foundation pays every two years to support the CPS program—to “Music Moves.”
In terms of children served, the disparity between the initiatives is stark.
Graves says that since “Music Moves” started three years ago, it has primarily served between eighty and a hundred kids over the school year, and 300 children once a week in the summer months. “That’s a lot smaller than the students we are dealing with at CPS,” he admits. “But the program is just three years old and it’s continuing to expand.” By comparison, the CPS program reaches 4,000 schoolchildren a year. For any other non-profit, that would be considered a success.
“But it isn’t Bau Graves’ invention,” an insider says. “School kids are not as sexy as guns.”.Sporting Kansas City 0-3 D.C United (Photos)

Synopsis The Beta Test 2021 :
The Beta Test HdFlixer Full Movie Online for FreeAs if today couldn't get any worse for Ming Campbell, I've just had this week's New Statesman delivered, in which my friend Kevin Maguire alleges that aspirant leader Nick Clegg has been briefing against the merciless one. Here's what Mr Maguire writes...
Having torn Simon Hughes off a strip, Old Ming will now have to issue a bit of discipline to the young whippersnapper Clegg. Altogether now...There may be trouble ahead...
UPDATE 5.55pm: Predictably several LibDem supporters are rubbishing this story in the Comments section. I have just called Kevin Maguire to get the story from the horse's mouth. He stands by every word. Clegg had been on the phone talking to a journalist 'off the record'. Unfortunately for him he didn't realise the bloke standing next to him was the Man from the Mirror, Mr Maguire. Sadly for us all the Virgin train arrived early so Kevin didn't get quite as much as he might have done. Clegg has NOT issued a denial - instead he has accused Kevin Maguire of 'distorting' his remarks. Frankly, all he has done is to say what every other LibDem MP knows to be true. And to those in the Comments section who have accused Kevin of making the whole thing up, first of all look at Clegg's non-denial. Then consider the fact that I have known Kevin for nearly twenty years - he's not my politics - he's Old Labour. But there's one thing he doesn't do, and that's make stories up.

Could you ever imagine such a limp pussy being Home Secretary?
Lib Dems... Losing Control Here!
Thought you'd pick up on this innacurate story - kind of form for you I guess.
This is utter crap. Clegg has released a rebuttal.
Chris:
Could you imagine such a limp pussy such as Cameron being PM?
thankfully, I can't
Anonymous (typically you don't give your name), of course he has issued a rebuttal. He would wouldn't he? He could do little else. You think Maguire made the whole thing up? Cmon.
I think Maguire embellished (and probably down right lied...)
He's a journo after all...
Kevin Maguire may be a Brownite but he doesn't make up stories. I believe this 100pc. Furthermore I believe that Nick Clegg will challenge for the Lib Dem leadership before the next election once Ming the Meanderer has been despatched on "health grounds."
He won't have a walkover for the leadership though - the Huhnester will certainly stand again and will stand a much better chance now he is better-known.
Ming is Fucked, utterly so! Hughes' rightly picked up the scent of a weak prey and framed the debate about Ming’s leadership. The Orange bookers and the LibDem left are sizing themselves up for yet another leadership battle and poor incompetent (or should that be incontinent?) Ming is being ripped on from both sides...
Dear me, I bet the LibDems are regretting electing him now!
Gotta love the way leon phrased his comment. "Ming is fucked" followed by a reference to Simon Hughes.
Ouch
I hope you're not right Paul.
Recess aint far away, Ming wont have PMQs then!?
you know what's funniest about this though..
the majority of the general public have no idea (or dont care) about most of what's goin on.
It's mainly stuff for bloggers to salivate over.
If Ming is obviously "done in" by his lieutenants, even though it might be done more ingeniously than in the traditional "Ides of March" style, the public will see the Lib Dems for what they really are, which will be most damaging for them. He is going to have to carry on for quite a while until some "illness" can be conjured up enabling him to retire.
Come back Charlie all is forgiven.
I think Clegg needs more experience and to gain more support within his party before standing in a leadership election. Even so if Ming hangs on for 1 or 2 years he could appear to be the 'saviour' leading up to a general election.
Could we be about to see the second Lib Dem leader to be stabbed in the back within 6 months?
Politics is all about the timing...
What are we supposed to believe - that all and sundry in the LibDems think Ming is doing a good job and wouldn't dream of slagging him off behind his back?
It's not that they've not got 'previous' on this is it? Shall we ask Charles Kennedy what his perspective is here?
I'm with the journo on this one.
At some stage the LDs will have to have a civil war between the Liberals and the socialists and my money is on the lefties winning.
Outside parliament there's not too much support from the activists for right wing Liberalism. They can agree on civil liberties to a degree but not on economics.
Clegg though is overrated as is Laws, they can both do worthy dullness but nothing more. Huhne is like a provincial bank manager who's had a mid-life crisis and has decided he wants to save the world.
If Cable had any sense he'd leave them to it and come over to where he belongs, the tory backbenches.
Finally, can they actually afford another election? They're not cheap and HSBC will wat their money back at some stage.
I voted for Ming Campbell as leader but if I'd known then what I know now...

Nick Clegg will be good for the party, he has recognised the democratic deficit in England.
He has argued the case for an English Parliament,and this was reported in the Yorkshire Post last month."On April 21, the party said it was "to end decades of support for regional devolution, including elected regional assemblies. Senior figures in a party working group on devolution and local governance have conceded that the policy is outdated. This follows voters' rejection of a North East Assembly in 2004".
Party home affairs spokesman Nick Clegg said: "It was unrealistic to continue backing such an unpopular concept." LibDem senior figures did say this would cause a rift among members. Well done Nick Clegg.
Delicious. Positively delicious. I wish, I wish, that over-sensitive souls hadn't sought to have the Ming's Dynasty blog deleted.
OK, it's based on his feeble appearence on Question Time, but I think Clegg is a loser. Lib Dem hopes were built on a pretty face and a nice haircut. But when the guy opens his mouth.... Nah. I don't think so.
Unless Maguire wandered up unbeknownst to Clegg I find it a bit unusual that he was caught out in this way.
However since Clegg has the profile of Joe Bloggs, of Acacia Avenue, Sometown he strikes me as someone who is hardly a household name in his own household. He's not even known well amongst LibDems never mind the public.
Huhne has a better profile even if it may still be as "oh I recognise that face from somewhere..".
Clegg will be an even greater let down for the LibDems as they realise they've shot themselves in all limbs by getting rid of Charlie and replacing him with a duffer and a nobody.
If Clegg is now stabbing Ming in the back the way Ming did to Charlie this does not entirely inspire confidence. I didn't think he was more than adequate on Question Time (the Tory Indian woman was good & outstanding when she got the bit between her teeth on immigration which she has obviously thought about).
I have known Kevin for nearly twenty years - he's not my politics - he's Old Labour.
I am no Cameron luvvie, but Kevin Maguire's unhealthy obsession with Cameron and Osborne's toffness and his espousal of class war makes him an inverted snob I wouldn't care to be friends with.
I was back in York (my old University) this weekend, and I noticed that the campus LDYS were doing their bit to promote Campbell by... advertising an upcoming visit by Nick Clegg with the by-line "come and listen to a potential future leader of the Liberal Democrats"... bravo chaps!Emissions Trading

Why don’t you consider the best eating plan for most dogs? It is important to give the dog while using the the right diet, which implies that you need to have an understanding of where and how you will definitely buy it. There are several stores that stock options commercial dog food, but you must find the correct keep.
To start with, you have to know your doctor is able to help you choose the top food to your puppy. You could possibly have a hard time getting a veterinary that will say yes to do the eating plan for you personally, however. Simply because most veterinarians believe canines should be provided in line with their individual dietary requires. So, you’ll need to alter its diet plan.
If this sounds like the way it is then you need to visit an animal medical facility should your doggy includes a food allergic reaction. For the canine infirmary they may perform free elimination diet plan to suit your needs. A veterinarian believe that the treatment for your requirements. But generally, you’ll simply have to pay into your market to the food items allergic reaction that you have.
So i want to start with the free eradication eating plan. When you go to your local supermarket, you need to search for a “P-Mart Free Choice” or “Food items Alternative”. Web site inside the record includes the most common makes of canine. Most of them include Purina, Iams and Pedigree and Elegant Food.
Lover higher in price company then you need to try the “Artisan” or “Gourmet Silver” provides. You will see these brand names on your vet’s workplace. Another option is decreased dropped foodstuff such as the “Ce Creuset” which has a tremendous level of protein and vitamins. Then this vet’s may well offer you a top quality dry out commercial dog food such as “Wilton”, which utilizes a fixed compound eating habits. In case there are other choices in addition to the high quality dropped ingredients, needless to say, this approach costs you extra which is limited dried diet regime.
You now know your pet dog has a diet program containing reduced compound from lamb and brown rice, you are maybe wondering. Without a doubt! A veterinarian are often competent to recommend a no-high quality all-natural commercial dog food.
The most important step is determine if a veterinarian can recommend a natural and pure treatment diet regime for the canine. Occasionally those that have meals your allergies must modify their diets just after a basic strike. This is a vital step to take. The diet plan need to be made up of just one or two things that should really havevarious meats and greens, and sources of protein. Just in case you can’t make eating plan at your home, in that case your vet’s should be able to suggest a provider that can provide you with the important items for the pet.
The most suitable choice for people with adult pets with meals hypersensitivity is to really make the pup’s regular health professional prescribed diet program offered. These weight loss plans comprise a number of the similar things present in limited processed food items. This will ensure your puppy incorporates a healthy and safe meal. You need to focus on additional options for the health and welfare of your respective dog in advance of choosing to change to a new make of canine.
If diet regime improvements usually do not assist with your pet’s treatment hypersensitive reactions, then a vet’s may perhaps suggest a pharmaceutical drug diet, when you have got your pet dog clinically determined to have adult susceptible food items your allergies. Pharmaceutical drug diet plans are similar to the industrial options but you are better in health proteins and body fat. Some veterans might counsel next to this type of diet plan as it may result in joint pain in pets with time. Previous to is going to be puppie’s diet.
You can even utilize a prescriptive element diet plan puppy formula, normally focus on these issues with all your veterinary. The outcome could be extraordinary, even though this can demand a doctor pay a visit to. Your four-legged friend are going to tolerate many new meals, which could consist of rooster, rice, as well as meat. A vet might recommend a skin allergic reaction eating plan for ones furry friend if your puppy is demonstrating signs and symptoms of allergy symptoms to your particular ingredient located in the prescriptive substance diet regime. Such type of diet program will get rid of the allergen, generating your pet far healthier likewise.
Most a competent vet recommend a prescriptive diet regime for pets that have seasons food items allergy symptoms or another variety of nutritional insufficiencies. It is an productive way to cure saving commercial dog food allergies and it’s normally value the work. However, some pets are afflicted by significant allergies when with a prescriptive diet regime. Speak to your veterinarian about these possibilities. The healthiness of the dog is dependent upon you.

##plugins.themes.bootstrap3.article.main##
##plugins.themes.bootstrap3.article.sidebar##
Abstract
Reliability and supervision of autonomous systems and their corresponding subsystems, can be significantly improved using advanced methods of anomaly detection and fault diagnosis. A reliable fault detection module can improve the autonomy of the vehicle itself, by leading to efficient fault tolerant control designs and mission scheduling. This paper presents a fault detection framework for incipient faults that take place on the actuators of an autonomous-small scale hovercraft. The enabling technologies borrow from the fields of modeling, data processing, Bayesian estimation theory and in particular a technique called particle filtering. Condition indicators or features are derived based on first principles modeling of the actuator’s and the vehicle’s dynamics. The fault detection algorithm fuses information obtained from different subsystems of the vehicle that use distinct sets of sensors, producing a robust degree of confidence. In addition, the algorithm is decoupled from the control system. This achieves the goal of minimizing the fault masking, or the compensation of fault-induced navigational errors by the control system, and allows for early detection even for small fault conditions. The efficacy of the diagnostic approach is demonstrated via simulation results. The proposed fault detection methodology can be easily leveraged to other types of autonomous vehicles.

(Graphic by Ed Fischer)
By Mike Dunn and Tony Romeo
PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — The Nutter administration has extended the City of Philadelphia’s tax filing deadline by one day, until midnight tonight, because of some web site issues on Sunday caused by human error.
Meanwhile, taxpayers all across Pennsyvlania are also getting the extra day to file their state personal income tax returns.
The Philadelphia Revenue Department’s web site offers downloadable tax forms for certain city taxes, but the site was taken down Sunday — one day before the deadline — for routine maintenance.
If that wasn’t bad enough, human error in the city’s IT department caused the site to stay down until Monday morning.
“A series of errors occurred during the day (Sunday) and they couldn’t get the site back up,” explains Nutter spokesman Mark McDonald, who said he couldn’t elaborate on the nature of the errors.
After the site was finally restored yesterday, officials decided to extend the filing deadline until midnight tonight for the city’s business income and receipts tax (BIRT), the net profits tax (NPT), and the school income tax.
The spokesman said that going forward, officials will “look very seriously” at whether to defer routine maintenance one day before a filing deadline.
“It was not a stellar day for maintaining that system, the day before taxes are due,” McDonald says, “and I think the administration very clearly regrets the poor performance. And that’s why there’s a deadline extension.”
In an unrelated incident, Pennsylvania state government web sites -– including the Revenue Department’s web site -– were offline for several hours yesterday afternoon. For that reason, the state personal income tax filing deadline has been extended by one day. There will be no interest or penalties on returns filed by midnight tonight.

Answer:
x = 0, x = – 2
Step-by-step explanation:
Find g(f(x)) and f(g(x))
g(f(x)) = g(2x + 1) = (2x + 1)²
f(g(x)) = f(x²) = 2x² + 1
Thus
(2x + 1)² = 2x² + 1 ← expand left side using FOIL
4x² + 4x + 1 = 2x² + 1 ← subtract 2x² + 1 from both sides
2x² + 4x = 0 ← in standard form
2x(x + 2) = 0 ← in factored form
Equate each factor to zero and solve for x
2x = 0 ⇒ x = 0
x + 2 = 0 ⇒ x = – 2
WRONG ANSWER
I did not read fg(x) and gf(x) but only g(x) and f(x)!!!!
Answer:
x₁= 1-√2 and x₂=1+√2
Step-by-step explanation:
you need to find where the system of the two given equation has solutions
one equation is linear, the other one is a parabolic equation, there will be at most 2 points where they cross path (but there could be even 1 point or even none)
you need to find where 2x+1 = x^2 or x^2-2x -1 = 0
using the quadratic formula x=(−b±√b2−4ac)/2a
a=1 b=-2 c=-1
you will get two solutions x₁= 1-√2 and x₂=1+√2Industrial wave and over and above it is difficult
Excerpt by Term Daily news:
Industrial Revolution and Beyond
It is difficult for anyone right now alive to prefer the radical changes that the Commercial Revolution delivered to humanity. All of us imagine that we understand what it was just like before this kind of shift in economics, in culture, in society: We believe of farmers tilling domains and of youngsters piling hay into stacks for winter forage, or of trappers setting all their snares for the soft-pelted animals with the forests, or of fishers casting all their hand-woven and hand-knotted nets into the seas from the hand-sewn decks of ships. We all imagine the hard physical work that nearly every person in society once had to do inside the era ahead of machines replaced their labor for ours – and this exchange of human (and animal) labor for machine-driven labor should indeed be one of the important elements of the Industrial Revolution. But it is only one of the key elements. For with the shift to devices came essential shifts with the amount of operate that each person had to do but also in other areas of society too. Living as we all do in a world through which nearly anything is produced in higher quantities and so practically everything that we all come into contact with on any given day – in the clothes we wear towards the plates that we eat off to the prints on the wall space of doctors’ offices – is a copy of something different.
This was not usually the case: 100 years ago not many things were copies of each and every other. Certainly there were printing and reproductive system technologies that allowed lithographs and books to be reproduced by the ratings and even many (in the truth of books and newspapers), but nearly everything else was unique. The aesthetic qualities of each target in a person’s world had been individual: They will applied only to the object and nothing else. Individuals were surrounded by items that differed from one another and these types of differences – these examples of better and worse – marked every dress, every pair of reveals, each pan, each candle, each portrait as being the work of an individual who was experienced in some points and not in others. The metaphorical fingerprints of the person who created every single object were “written” in that thing.
But when machines began to make objects most such different versions were reduced if certainly not absolutely eliminated. One place-setting of Vacación ware – now recently popular once again – is practically precisely just like the next – or like the same place-settings produced 3 generations in the past. Many people were drawn to this precision afforded by machine-turned parts and machine-produced products: It was desirable to set a table from which all of the discs matched. It absolutely was convenient to manage to buy a dress in a particular size and to know that it could fit. It absolutely was gratifying in order to purchase a seat and know that the artisanship in it will meet some standard. And not only were there artistic attractions in each one of the recently standardized and suddenly standard objects nevertheless there was moreover the pain relief of devoid of had to slave over these items to make them. Beauty with no accompanying toil.
And yet, it was in fact not quite the case, of course , for while machines, once guided simply by skilled human being hands, are actually capable of developing many good things, much of what is manufactured by machines is actually of much less fine quality than that which individuals working with hand-tools can create. And even if it is of fine quality, there is still that problem of uniformity. Even within the first years after the Professional Revolution, a large number of people started out already to weary of objects that had been all the same and began to long for the time when an artisan’s certain skills were imprinted to each work.
This rebellion against the uniformity of machine-crafted items (and therefore perforce to some extent against the labor-saving elements of equipment work) was seen in such aesthetic, philosophical and cultural movements since the Arts Projects Movement. Nevertheless , as this citation suggests, once people acquired entered the equipment age there was no actual possibility of returning.
William Morris, one of the most imaginative geniuses in modern background, soon started to be the driving force behind the Arts Crafts activity. A Socialist in his governmental policies, he sincerely believed that society needed to return to pre-Industrial Revolution moments and that hand crafted objects to get daily living could hardly only regain beauty to functional items, but be affordable for the masses…. His efforts and those of his circle encompassed everything from bookbinding to picture. Their impact spread to architecture, fabric, furniture and pottery. Their very own results were stunning, and mesmerized both Euro and American buyers…. Regrettably, making these matters by hand caused them to become far too pricey for the reduced classes to get. The market contains the rich – and, of course , equipment became required to keep up with the need.
As the Movement pass on to the United states of america, fewer artists and designers disdained machinery, but seemed rather to embrace the very best qualities of manufacturing.

Artistry Crafts-style bungalows could be bought from the Target catalog.
As the artisans and philosophers of the Arts and Crafts Movement created many spectacularly fabulous things, they will neglected to consider sufficiently the truth that while the most amazing things which have been created by simply people have happened through handwork, the labor involved once machines will be eschewed (or before we were holding invented) ensures that such hand-crafted items simply cannot be provided by many people.
By the end of World Warfare I home repair and Designs Movement was at decline, supplanted by the two aesthetics of Modernism and by the growing desire from the middle classes and even the significant classes to get affordable consumer goods. The conclusion of the Arts and Projects Movement can be seen in many ways among the final volleys of the Industrial Revolution: It absolutely was the last sustained and coordinated effort produced against the ascendancy of the machine age as well as the aesthetics installed with it. When the quarter-sewn oak and locally quarried rock of Arts and Crafts homes were substituted by the decorated and lacquered aesthetic of Art Deco – so that as Frank Lloyd Wright helped to transform the structural and design aspects of Arts and Crafts constructions into their streamlined and slick mid-century variations, Modernism might become the personal unsecured of the Machine Age visual in the 20th century.
Modernism Arises from the appliance
Modernism is actually a complex amalgam of ideas and looks, and while the term is utilized across the range of creative products – including literature, painting, music, architecture and sculpture – it came to mean various things for these distinct media. Total there were links among these kinds of various varieties of Modernism: Whether on the crafted page or on the potter’s wheel, the Modernist founder celebrated the modern as well as the abstract, seeking to produce a type of act as well as being a relationship with all the audience that was completely distinct by traditional aesthetics and artworld social relations. It was a brave new world for founder and the founder, both in how that fine art looked and in the way it absolutely was consumed. The group for art (and design) ceased as the wealthy, noble patron to become the ordinary person – who also could spend the money for kind of artwork and decorated object that was created with the help of the equipment.
The machine cosmetic was believed by a number of objects. Gleaming metals, molded plastics, and mirrored goblet became important decorative products. The design of units and tea services resembled skyscrapers. Originally housed in enormous solid wood cabinets, radios became increasingly smaller and packaged in synthetic materials. The look of the appliance was not universally celebrated, yet it was popular nonetheless.
With the onset of the Depression, pilier of the arts, once the sphere of the chapel and the private collector, altered to organization. Industry forced design as well as the machine cosmetic was pushed into the typical citizen’s home through a wide range of consumer items. As financial hardship influenced the country, traditional luxury items were unfeasible. Yet, mass-produced replicas of such items were cost-effective. As the device aesthetic started to be more satisfactory, such models became more common. By 1934, as witnessed at Chicago’s Century of Progress Exposition, “the emphasis was about consumerism and labor-saving machines. In effect, the debate above modernism – its lifestyle, its appropriateness for America, and the value of its aesthetic characteristics – became secondary towards the need for monetary recovery…. It had been a modernism derived from Bauhaus functionalism, rather than the decorative People from france moderne design so popular in the preceding years. Functionalism – the thoughts and opinions that an object’s form and look should be based on its functions – was driving American design by theNew York, northeast US try to hold off second virus wave
New York and other parts of the northeastern United States, which have kept the coronavirus outbreak under control after being an early epicenter in the country, are now seeing a worrying rise in infections.
While the number of new cases is far from the high levels currently seen in Midwestern US states or Europe, they raise the prospect of a return of tight restrictions to prevent further spread.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday released figures showing a doubling of the test positivity rate in America's largest city, which has recorded more than 23,000 COVID-19 deaths since March.
After consistently holding the test positivity rate to around 1 percent, a spike to 2.7 percent on Wednesday and an average rate of about 2 percent over the past week was "very worrisome," de Blasio said.
"We cannot allow that number to keep growing. We're really going to have to double down," he said.
"It's really about keeping us safe and not letting a second wave in that would lead to huge restrictions on all of us," de Blasio said, urging people to avoid gatherings and traveling over the fall holiday season that includes Halloween and Thanksgiving.
New York's neighbors are experiencing even higher growth in virus cases.
New Jersey, the region's second worst-hit state in the spring, is now seeing more than 1,000 new cases every day, and the positivity rate has reached 6.5 percent, Governor Phil Murphy tweeted Thursday.
At least two cities in the state, including Newark—very close to New York city—have reinstated restrictions, such as a curfew on non-essential businesses.
Cases are also on the rise in Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts.
This increase poses a new problem for authorities who imposed self-quarantines on visitors from states with high testing positivity rates, with New York placing the requirement on those from places with positivity rates over 10 percent.
But the measure is difficult to enforce on neighboring states, with people regularly coming and going for work or leisure.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo recently gave up on adding New Jersey and Connecticut to his list of more than 40 restricted states, calling instead on people to avoid non-essential travel.

© 2020 AFPThe U.S. men’s national team will already be without one veteran centerback for October’s World Cup Qualifying schedule and now will be without a second.
John Brooks has been ruled out of this month’s trio of qualifiers due to a back injury suffered with German club Wolfsburg, U.S. Soccer announced on Monday. Brooks joins Tim Ream as the latest central defender out of action for Gregg Berhalter’s side this month. Ream withdrew from international duty due to family reasons.
The 28-year-old started the USMNT’s World Cup qualifiers against Canada and Honduras in September, but will remain in Germany for injury rehabilitation. Brooks was a second-half substitute for Mark Van Bommel’s side in Wolfsburg’s 3-1 Bundesliga loss to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.
Brooks has endured a difficult stretch, including his disappointing performances in the September qualifiers followed by some inconsistent play with Wolfsburg, which included Brooks being sent off in UEFA Champions League play. He has gone from being a lock starter for Wolfsburg to finding himself on the bench on multiple occasions in the past month, a product both of his own dip in form as well as Wolfsburg’s push to find playing time for a young core of central defenders.
With Brooks out, Miles Robinson enters camp as the leading candidate to fill one of the two starting central defender spots when the Americans take on Jamaica, with Mark McKenzie, Chris Richards and Walker Zimmerman in contention to start alongside the Atlanta Unite defender.
The USMNT opens its three-match schedule on Thursday in Austin, Texas against Jamaica before traveling to Panama on Sunday, and closing out the October qualifiers at home in Columbus, Ohio against Costa Rica.
This just means Richards will play a lot more this cycle! Richards, M.Robinson v Jamaica. M. Robinson, Zimmerman vs Panama away, w/ Richards as a sub, then Richards, McKenzie vs CR. Friendly reminder- GB called in 6 CBs, played 5 last window.
i think we have to make a distinction between the ability to use 27 rosterees as a cushion and arrive with 23 names for a 3rd game dress list, vs them be rested and healthy and be able to rotate players, which in practical terms last time required using more than 23 people. it’s not just showing up for the 3rd game with a team, it’s showing up rested and poised to do well. he seems to have forgotten last game 3 his roster had eroded, he ran out a significantly different lineup, he had a rotten first half, and then he had to go back to the well on players with some minutes on them, who it so happened set the world on fire second half at honduras. but one could argue the first half reflected how much of the attrition had gone unaddressed. kind of like gold cup group play and the slapped together teams we were running out. to me you need to not just burn the cushion but maintain it so that we can sub and squad rotate and not be just throwing bodies out there game 3. i agree he hasn’t learned the broader lesson, but nor has he really learned the lesson that honduras last time was kind of a lucky accident where i am sure the dress list was basically by default, and some people basically had to play.
in other words, it’s not just that you need an injury cushion to have enough people to dress, it’s that for strategic purposes such as rotation you might very well need more than 23 players for 3 games. which is how many people we used last 3 games — 23 — despite having 3 unused backup keepers and people who left injured. numerically this is only possible if you keep the numbers up.
maybe he didn’t like how game 3 began but burning through 23 players (22 field) suggests he has to rotate sometime and perhaps the error was his for picking honduras away to try it.
GB seems to have a high tolerance for risk in his roster or I guess it could be he doesn’t grasp the risk he is taking. Maybe he is the sort of guy who will eat gas station sushi for $hits and giggles or maybe he thinks gas station sushi is pretty good. Better Buckle up.
Nice
i feel like some of the pro-sands arguments repeat some of the gibberish last time about players needing to finalize transfers. last time some of the players were said to have been left off to finalize deadline day transfers. but we had ongoing roster attrition and kept playing games through september 8, and called yueill up “late.” now, the argument goes, we can only call upon domestic players to fill roster holes or add players now that UK has changed its quarantine rules. where does it say this? it makes a tiny bit of practical sense except we’ve needed some swaps for a few days now — and don’t play for another two days. a domestic flight is short, but a guy on an international plane tonight their time would be here tomorrow our time. and we games for the next 9 days. we carried pulisic on the call sheet to spend 2 games doing fitness but we can’t call an in-season european based player, if not for thursday, then for games 2 and 3? i get if we need a replacement for a game tomorrow they have to be domestic and on a plane about now. i don’t get a week and a half. does not compute.
and if you are scared about covid bubbles there are private planes. nothing says we have to run them through heathrow on commercial.
Lots of people are criticizing Berhalter for not calling in more players, but do we know for sure that it is his decision, or are there some bean counters at the USSF limiting the number of call ups? Inquiring minds want to know.
One thing that would be smart if GB had some latitude would be to call in a small group of worthy MLS players and have a mini camp in Columbus in to hedge against the likelihood that our team will be depleted when they arrive there for game 3.
flaw in your analysis is -ream + zimmermann nets out roughly even as either “man” or “money” accounting — one out, one in — but -brooks +0 nets out a man short and they perhaps save money. your argument is fair if the question is adding personnel beyond the original quota. but 27 down to 26, not so much. in theory they should have back in the budget one player’s worth of logistics at the cost of european travel from germany. that would cover anyone we could want short of perhaps turkey or poland. you change the name on brooks’ tickets. voila.
Good. Transfer that airline ticket to Joe Scally!
GOOD!!!! He falls asleep too much and is done
Besides Brooks ruled out of the October WCQ, I also noticed Larry Henry Jr. has been writing the articles the past couple days. Is Ives out, or just taking a short break?
I’m disappointed that Berhalter did not call in a replacement before the Jamaica game. Why not execute things proactively, instead of reactively waiting until after the Jamaica game? The fact that we only have 26 healthy bodies in camp, he can actually fly in 2-3 players and give them a head start to practice along with the current squad & understand the game plans, even though the 2-3 players will most likely not dress for the Jamaica game. This is totally poor management.
Apparently he hasn’t learned one goddamn thing from the last cycle.
neither domestic nor international. and it’s worth noting on that, that while some seem leery of calling someone from europe, the nature of the beast is they are routinely on a plane just days before the first game. in this case 3-4 days perhaps. we are 5 days to panama and 8 days to CR.
also, GB seems to not be considering the cumulative impact of such decisions. setting aside my wish for a bigger roster, if you let the smaller roster erode, and don’t respond, and more and more people fall out, we got down close to 23 last time by the end, and at the last game, yeah, you run out of options to do a thing about it. so if you want to stay “flush” you have to keep numbers up while you can control it.
last point, people are ignoring that historically we have had about 25 people or so in quali camps for the old 2 game windows. there may have been some contingency to that, but it was also used to have competition for the dress roster. like there would be “cuts.” if you don’t keep the numbers up you lose that bit of motivation.
IV I think your romanticizing the past. Yes, you’d have “cuts” before WC itself sometimes before GC but qualifying rosters weren’t tryouts. Any other long time fans remember it that way. You’d always take 24-26 in case of injuries or card accumulation but not as a tryout. If someone else can confirm IV on that I’ll gladly say I was wrong.
I can’t co-sign with IV on that JR. I don’t remember any US coaches using qualifying windows for tryouts. From Bora to Arena 2.0, they figured out their personnel before WCQ. At the same time, none of these coaches had to deal with a pandemic. Also Certainly not this deep of talent as GB has at his disposal. ..and we know with talent comes expectations. I think, WCQ is calculus (anti-derivatives & algorithms), not algebra, (linear equations), dealing in unknowns.
dude, i detest people who spin what you say. i think i pretty clearly said call about 30 and maybe 1-2 max would be trial players. and your argument about the “25 man” before now is wrong. if someone got hurt we called new people for game 2. so the point historically was not an injury cushion so much as roster competition and the ability to adjust to what shows up in camp. they would have cuts. people would sometimes get sent home. new people would show up game 2 and someone wasn’t even hurt. you’re spinning twice. don’t change history. don’t mislead about what i meant. how about we have an honest conversation?
i am not talking about deep “tryouts.” i am simply saying you can have a guy or two like pulisic or pepi who is special or who might address a bad need area. i made pretty freaking clear before that world cup is money on the table and that the use of noobs would be limited to practice fodder — for evaluation by the coaches — and playing at the end of blowout games in garbage time. you seem to be painting me as extreme when your favorite coach ran out pepi TO START HIS FIRST CAP. all i am saying is add roster player #27 or #28, you don’t even have to play them, but you can examine them in a controlled practice environment and begin developing an opinion.
i am sure we do some practice drills that are straight game prep. that would not be “when.” that time is for starters. i am also sure before we get there, that we do a little 5 or 11 a side, and the coach makes sure everyone can still run and kick a ball straight. i am sure we either rotate teams or sub in players. you give the rookie a few minutes in those drills. if they wow you, you fast track them. if not, they maybe don’t even dress. and they only play for real if a game is basically over.
i think one fallacy here is every bit of every practice must be game prep. i think not playing much actual soccer but instead doing situational work all practice would be bad. that might be the last practice or two the day before. before then you’d be getting the travel lead out and making sure they look fit and fluid, and let them get back used to each other.
IV: with your comment of cuts and no longer being that pressure you made it sound like guys who had been playing would get dropped for being poor in training. I don’t remember that ever happening. Maybe that’s not what you meant.
again, spinning. how many people do you really think are in danger of a cut when you call 27 people for a 23 man? not most. nor do i think starters should be in danger of the axe for practice play. but what it does create is roster-back-end pressure to be on form and show up serious. guys 20-27 might be fighting. you might see them as roughly equal on talent, you might have seen one player more than the other, and you liked them enough to call, but you feel like an actual choice exists. in which case one guy shows up shanking practice passes and the other guy looks ready. QED. you have your choice. i generally favor talent — and i am not saying turner or adams or aaronson should be subject to how practice goes. but if someone at the margins shows up rusty or unfit, a backup keeper can’t catch, or a noob looks exceptional, maybe you fiddle at the end of the 23 a little. i mean, when pulisic gets 10′ at the end of guatemala, it’s not as a pure tryout, it’s klinsi was already raving about him from practice. and some very average attacker who might have even missed a previous window gets cut so he can play. i’m not saying he gets dempsey’s job on 2 practices. i’m saying maybe he plays instead of mixx or nguyen, you know, OK players at the margins of being involved. that’s who you’re fighting for a slot and for sub minutes. you then maybe get 10′ when we win 4-0 if he loves you.
that being said, before you start spinning, if someone is sitting as much as steffen or horvath are then we should be kicking your tires at NT practices to make sure you can still catch. personally i think the smarter play is roster 4 keepers and see them in person than pick 3 on club form. hence 30 instead of 27. injury margin plus you can make edge-roster decisions based on how they look in front of you as opposed to form speculation from tape and spreadsheets. i mean, forest’s coach got fired and their results flipped like a switch. maybe they hated hughton and that one day you keep harping on horvath was a victim of them tanking the coach so he’d get fired. you then punish horvath because of how his team was giving up for a few weeks. btw what horvath did this summer wasn’t because bruges played him at all. y’all continue to go back to that well.
Well one thing is for sure…then bAckupsshoul d. E getting experience together cause chances are Brooks will be injured
I’m concerned about what Michail Antonio is going to do to our center backs. Panama was apparently successful at cutting off service to him; we’ll have to do the same or it could get ugly.
Confirmed Tuesday Antonio is not coming this window.
I wouldn’t say we still have 4 “good” center backs so we don’t need to call in one more just in case.
McKenzie looked like crap in the gold cup, and had one decent half against a team that was strung out, exhausted and no threat..
Not calling Miazga just in case is stupid
Miazga was pretty bad against Panama last fall as well. At least half responsible for both goals. I saw the Athletico match. They’re style really fits his game, sit deep and defend crosses. Not much danger of anyone running in behind if you never leave the box. I’d be happy if they brought him in but I’d be happy if it was Sands too. I wouldn’t even be sad about Kessler.
Yea I gotcha, even though Sands was garbage last month I know he’s better in the back. It just defies all logic – He brings in a replacement when Ream drops, but not now..stupid. Maybe he’s got Jackson Yuell waiting by the phone…
While Miazga has his weaknesses (who doesn’t), there is this. According to reports, Vincent Kompany, one of the best CB’s of his generation, wanted to buy Miazga for his Belgian team, but Man City declined, wanting to keep him and now he is playing in the Primera League. You know what, I think Kompany is probably a good judge of talent at CB.
When I made the roster for the Turkmenistan national teams, we always brought 30 players. It was no big deal.
Maybe US Soccer doesn’t have the resources that Turkmenistan has? Or not as much depth? I’m being sarcastic, this shows how idiotic Berhalter and USSSF have been. Earnie Stewart should force Berhalter to bring more players in, unless he agrees with this stupid policy.
Friendly reminder!! McKenzie didn’t participate in the GC! Try again, I’m confident there’s a CB who ‘fits the description!’
My bad I meant the Nations League
personally i think miazga = brooks and this is addition by subtraction. he would have eliminated everyone i see as a vulnerability from the CB pool this time. i do think it’s about 50/50 between him and sands who GB would likely call, neither of which i would trust. i would like to see CCV or EPB but that won’t happen.
in terms of your comment that we have 4, while i have been pimping richards, he hasn’t given him much chance — and none this summer. that is risky. he comes under my heading of “try in practice and for 10-30′ in a blowout.” 4 backs is kind of like you’re likely going to play. i’d have someone in i trusted to mark in a qualifier. then keep richards as a 5th option. so i’d add one. i’d agree with you if all 4 were veterans, but they’re not.
We should call Miazga. Not only is he the next best option, also has experience to help what is now a really young CB group.
We should’ve called in 30
Even 27 was doable but now 27 is 26. An injury or a card situation and now we’re playing a game with only 3 CBs. I understand that Sands and Kessler are a two plane ride away but why not have them there now or at least say they’ll arrive in camp Friday.
“Two hour”
AGAIN. Why doesn’t he have 30 on the roster called in. Just in case! Why take chances!
Same old same old GGG
Another CB out, this one a likely starter. The logical thing would be to bring in somebody like CCV, Matt Miazga or someone else who has been playing at a relatively level. Let’s see how stupid US soccer has become. Remember if someone says it’s too late, remember we want to rotate our players and if all the replacement does is play some minutes in the last of the 3 games, that can still help.
You need to see more Euro pixie dust? How is that working out so fat in central defense?
It’s easy to criticize. Who do you suggest instead?
Berhalter said what he learned last window was they needed to rotate players. What he missed was he was unable to rotate players because of injuries and suspensions. If he’d replaced Weah, he’d have had a wing to start instead of Sargent. If he had brought more RBs he wouldn’t have had play Adams at RB. Yes Dest can play both but when he got hurt we were short at both spots. This window we have the looming problem of yellow card accumulation too that will also take players. I really hope they’re just giving time for arrangements to be made and Sands will be in training Friday morning but I’m concerned.
I know. This is freaking insane, 101-level type basic stuff, and he keeps right on blowing it.
Why the #$%# would he self-impose limits when he doesn’t have to? This is just throwing points out the window, and there is zero good reason for it. At the very least, call up a US-based CB like Sands so you have the body if you need it.
What we should have learned about this manager is that he has learned how to SAY all the right things but he does not follow up on them or if he does it is only slowly and grudgingly.
He’s become a better BS artist in public.
He may have a point. He’s unlikely to have to suspend someone for breaking protocol this go around. As for injured wingers, I never understood his point about a lack of “verticality”, another buzzword.
His best bet for that is to deploy Dest and Antonee as real wingbacks. Of course that would mean he would need to find a decent back 3, something he hasn’t been able to do it seems.
vacqui — ironically, to me, reyna and pulisic are more “technical” of players and he actually gains “speed” and “verticality” starting the others. this time by default, he has no choice. if he’s saying losing them makes us less speedy he’s clueless. they are more half court players. weah was the one flying down his wing against costa rica. this is half the reason i want them converted to mids is i actually agree we could use a speed element wide, on at least one side. something where we can just burn downfield in a hurry and not have every possession be some 20-pass water torture. i appreciate keepaway but every possession need not be work. my favorite all time goal i assisted in men’s league the kickoff went to the LB. skip pass across to me as RB. i see the other team is narrow and hit a long ground pass like 70 yards to the forward, who rounds his man and scores. 3 passes, 15 seconds. like moore’s goal. this really doesn’t have to be this much work, not with this pool of players.
Imperative voice.
Apparently the trendy buzzword verticality means direct to goal.
No one does that better than Pusilic but that’s when he is with Chelsea where some one will give him the ball in a spot where he can run at goal. That’s not happening with the USMNT who can’t get him the ball so he has to get it himself.
When you put Gio in the wing what you get is a #10 playing on the wing. He does fine there but he’s better in the middle of the park. Which is why BVB have moved him there.
Weah has done well with his conversion to midfield at Lille. But he’s best at wing forward, think Marcus Rashford.
vacqui: to me pulisic after a point started trying to dribble everyone from the wing in NT games and that has not gone as well. he has a better supporting cast now than before, and just needs to beat one guy and then make his play. i also felt like relative to aaronson he’d gotten in a rut where for the US he gets the ball and pauses to dance like dempsey used to. what i want to see is him get that ball and (finger snap) right after them. when he holds it a second the defense gets back and he has to dribble 5 people. i think he has the ability but he got some mix of cute or selfish. he needs to get right after a defense and realize this is no longer 2017. with pepi and aaronson and mckennie etc. he doesn’t have to do it all alone. he can beat a guy, commit a second, then pass to someone else. he doesn’t have to fake 3 guys out and score it personally.
Miazga?
On such short notice and with travel overseas, Sands seems the most likely option if a replacement is called after Jamaica. Given the compressed schedule, injuries are to be expected. We are fortunate to have built up some depth.
“if a replacement is called ”
What do you mean if??
Vacqui: I would have called in 30. But, as things stand,we still have 4 good CBs on the roster for October. Should be enough for 3 games… unless we see an injury.
Agree with PN and Quaker Otis. Four is enough. If someone else is injured call in someone else most likely domestic and Sands makes sense to me,
US Soccer days no replacement will be named…

When you have never taken a day to read their book.
Why judge others and think they all put on a show?

Don’t judge others because you can’t see behind the closed door,

So if you want to help me, pray for me, but don’t judge me.
Matthew 7:1-2 “Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the same measure you use, it will be measured back to you.”

The German carmaker from Bavaria has made concerted efforts to showcase the global intentions of the brand, clearly pinpointing their mission statement. Equating to “sustainable vehicles and mobility solutions,” the brand is not only sexy, it’s innovative.
BMW also launched venture capital company BMW i Ventures in New York, which will invest up to $100 million to advance the project for a 2013 debut. New plant facilities will also be built to house the production of the vehicle. Devised as a plug-in hybrid, the i8 is the next evolution of BMW’s Vision EfficientDynamics concept. The company calls their new auto invention LifeDrive Architecture, comprised of an aluminium frame that houses the drive module, with electric motors at the front wheels, a lithium-ion battery to power those motors and an internal combustion engine placed over the rear axle. The passenger compartment is engineered from high-strength and lightweight carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). Incorporating ConnectedDrive forms their current product lineup, a range of advanced telematics and navigational features will enhance driver information with public transportation, parking availability and local entertainment.
Fisker Surf: Electric Fortitude
The Karma’s 22-inch designer wheels rotate with no hesitation and the Brembo brakes served their role well in the wet conditions.
There are only a select few oddities in society that make absolute sense. Manufacturing a luxurious and attractive sports wagon with plug-in hybrid technology is one of them. Introducing Fisker’s new Surf, the “flying carpet” of the automotive eco-friendly movement. Porsche pulled it off with the Panamera, Ferrari is making strides with its FF model, and now the Surf adds another performance utility option to the luxury elite class. It’s absolutely amazing that this American auto manufacturer was non-existent just 4 years ago, yet they continue to add to their cadre of fascinating green energy vehicles including vehicles such as the Karma. Sharing the same platform, design scheme and technologies, both the Surf and Karma have a 50-mile all-electric range (stealth mode) and a 250-mile gasoline range (sport mode) from the 265-horsepower and turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. With a single gear, there is no conventional transmission. The gasoline engine will continuously charge the electric battery, but no more than 50 percent, at which point one must plug in to attain full charge. Switching the thumb input on the steering wheel allows blipping between modes with only a very slight notice of transition. Sport mode automatically kicks in should the battery die.
The Karma’s 22-inch designer wheels rotate with no hesitation and the Brembo brakes served their role well in the wet conditions. In Stealth mode, a set of speakers set on the vehicle’s rear bumper engages the Pedestrian Warning System so it can be heard when approaching. A solar panel on the roof provides an additional source of charging and cockpit materials incorporate high-end natural ingredients such as wood from fire-damaged trees and not from the living forest for added eco-friendliness. Expect a price tag of $100,000 at one of 45 dealers in the United States for the Karma or Surf.
Jaguar C-X75: Immaculate Conception
Jaguar led a preemptive strike recently with the unveiling of their electric supercar concept. Forget the mandatory and celebratory mandates set forth for the British automaker’s 75th anniversary. The reflective moment at hand is that the C-X75 is the most ostentatious vehicle ever theorized and manifested by Jaguar since the XJ13. And the concept has been cleared for production, permitting the brand to attack with forceful ambition. The C-X75 features a 580kW propulsion system utilizing an electric motor at each of the wheels along with mini gas turbines. The futuristic vehicle is able to reach a top speed of 205 mph, travel a distance of 560 miles, while producing 778 horsepower and with 1,180 pound-feet of torque churning through its all-wheel drive system. An aerodynamic aluminium frame and staggered 21-inch front and 22-inch rear tires encasing aluminium rims with a “fan bladed” theme, allows the C-X75 to accelerate from 0-62 mph in a mere 3.4 seconds. Use Jaguar Sense to open the forward-hinged doors and take a seat inside while the touchscreen Jaguar Co-Pilot interface assists the journey by predicting all your wants and needs.Recent Acquisitions in History

Staffers said Trump could “stomach the story” from the inspector general that claims violations in Shulkin’s office. According to the inspector general, Shulkin’s former chief of staff, Viveca Wright Simpson, altered an email to allow the government to pay for Shulkin’s wife to join him on a trip to Europe. Simpson announced her intent to retire last week.
The Post’s source claims that Shulkin’s job could be on the line in the future. “If other stuff comes out, this could change, but for now, he’s safe,” the source said.
The trip in question included a veterans’ mental health conference, but also contained sightseeing and complimentary tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament. Shulkin says everything was above board and promised to pay back the cost of his wife’s airfare.
According to Shulkin, the email was doctored as part of a plan by other administration officials to force him out of office. In an apparent response to this allegation, the VA’s inspector general opened a separate investigation to determine if the former chief of staff’s email account was accessed by unauthorized people.
Trump has voiced strong support for Shulkin in the past, referring to him as “Our David” and telling him that he would never have to use his signature phrase, “You’re fired,” on him.

VA Secretary Shulkin to Keep Job, For NowSACRAMENTO, Calif. (KTXL) — California’s redistricting commission is working to redraw state maps for congressional, legislative and local officeholders.
The group wants to hear from Californians to make sure residents are represented fairly in the process that happens once a decade.
It’s a process that plays out following the census, and in the latest count, California lost a congressional seat.
In California, finalizing district maps is up to an independent 14-member citizen commission.
“We are doing the best we can; we are listening. We do have a united front to draw the best lines that draw the fairest representation for Californians,” said Alicia Fernandez, with the Citizens Redistricting Commission.
Over the next few days, the commission is welcoming public comment on how it should set new congressional, legislative and local boundaries.
“We want to hear from you. Please be involved, please see our maps because this is going to affect us for the next 10 years,” Fernandez said.
The commission will update maps to account for California’s lost seat, but commissioners could not say which region might be affected.
“It’s very early to say where that’s going to be lost because, the way we draw districts, they have to be equally populated or as close to that as possible,” Fernandez said. “It’s difficult to say if it will be a specific area or it’s going to be a combination of some areas, we really don’t know.”
The commission is set to release a draft map of newly drawn districts by Nov. 15. The map has to be finalized by Dec. 27.
“We want to be as equitable as possible, and we have the criteria,” Fernandez said. “And the good thing about the independent commission is that it is an independent commission. It is 14 Californians that aren’t legislators, aren’t in some sort of elected position, and we understand the importance of individuals wanting to have representatives that represent them.”
The commission has a meeting Wednesday starting at 11 a.m. where the public will start to see some of the submitted ideas for maps. Public comment will be allowed through Friday. coin is part of a New Zealand Mint series dedicated to characters and themes from famous movies, and features the Hogwarts Express from the Harry Potter books and films.

The word “internet” either didn’t exist or was possibly some sort of technical term known only to commercial fishermen.
Did the publishing industry actually exist in any meaningful form before 1995?
Cringe.
Certainly, the publishing landscape has changed dramatically in the last twenty years with online selling, digital printing, social media and e-books.
But while the surface changes, what is underneath is still driven by core principles, which have not changed. (And I am not talking about publisher entrenched processes which drive everyone crazy.)
If you understand the underlying core principles of something, you can make more sense of the seemingly ever-changing world. Here are the never-changing aspects of book publishing:
The Author
They still need to study writing, know grammar and proper spelling. Nothing will take the place of human creativity. Computer tools speed up the process, but writing 70,000 well-crafted words still takes time. A lot of time. Without the time investment, writing is simply words on a page.
Computer word processing changed the need for certain writing skills. Prior to computers, authors needed to spend more time outlining and pondering their work before they wrote. Cutting and pasting involved actual cutting and actual pasting, with all the toxic glue fumes accompanying the process. (Which probably explains some of the titles published in the 60’s and 70’s)
Some feel it is self-publishing which made book publishing available to all, but really it was the computer and word processing software, which made the writing of books accessible to more writers. Prior to word processors, the tedious manual requirements of writing by hand or typewriter sifted out the casual writer who found the process of creating a book downright withering.
Platform
The need for an author platform has always existed. This is not a new thing. I’ve stated this before, but 100 years ago, newspaper and magazine columnists held much of the power in the author community. There were millions of people reading their columns, so books were a natural extension. These were high-platform authors of an earlier era.
If you think the discussion of platform is a new thing, you would not be accurate. We discussed the same issue for authors in the 1980’s and actually used the term. We simply didn’t have Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. We had newspaper or magazine circulation numbers and radio/TV listener/viewer ratings.
High platform authors have always received preferential treatment over unknown writers. It is just the definition of what comprises a good platform, which has changed.
Discoverability
This is a hot term in publishing circles these days, but honestly, it is the publishing equivalent to calling a chef a “gastronomic artist.” It is a high-tech sounding term for the 21st century where we ride in self-driving cars and communicate with wrist phones.
How people really find out about a specific book and make a buying decision has always been the same no matter what era you investigate.
- Recommendation from a trusted source (friend, spouse, pastor).
- Review from a respected source.
- Written by a known author.
- Meets a felt need or desire of a reader.
- A great title/cover/package.
Everything I can think of falls into one of the above categories and all five of these existed long before computers gave the impression they didn’t matter any longer. Computers and everything, which followed, simply added new elements to the five foundational stones.
One of the most significant changes from 30 years ago is the one which allows readers to connect directly to authors. Thirty years ago, authors might get a half-dozen letters from readers. The process of publishing put a wall of mystery between the author and the reader. The publisher decided what got through to the author, usually nice things, shielding the author from angry comments and bad reviews, or the very least, re-framing the negative comments into positive action.
Now, the direct line from the reader to the author is not only the norm, but it is encouraged. And it is not always positive. Being directly exposed to reader comments and online reviews, both good and bad, is an emotional challenge for any author.
Today’s post was just an attempt to remind us everything new is not necessarily new, just renamed and reframed.
(Feel free to recall the Bible verse about new things and the sun.)
Treating highly sensitive topics regarding publishing with a dose of humor endears me to Dan Balow’s post. I’m always glad to visit the author, via the website.
BTW, would the above line make a huge review (assuming the writer was a best-selling author and Dan Balow was an upcoming one)?
Excellent and much needed reminder.
How true. Writing is so much more than “simply words on a page.”
Writing by hand downright withering, whaaaaaaat!
The tactile feel of the pencil and paper, the smell of fresh pencil wood left by the hand crank sharpener, the little bits of spent eraser littering your writing area. For me, this is time honored real deal writing. The tradition and history of making physically manual marks on medium transports one back centuries along an unbroken lineage into times and authors unknown.
The thought of humans pecking on a device that aligns electrons into a recognizable and coherent pattern is something that scribes of times not so distant found unbelievable and futuristic. They never thought they would live to see it. A number of them have, some still cling to their paper and pencil. Your expertly written blog elucidates the bridge that has been crossed. All too soon the torch will be passed. Great job Dan!
God Bless!
Your blog triggered memories, Dan. I started publishing professionally just before everyone had personal computers and wordprocessers. I wrote my Ph.D. thesis (all 250 pages) by hand. My husband typed it on a typewriter using white-out for every correction while I applied all the mathematical symbols as wax rub-ons.
I remember when the internet was born as milnet to help communication between defense organizations (and Al Gore really had nothing to do with inventing it). When I wrote my GaAs book on a computer, it was so easy to create outlines, generate figures and tables, and flip outlines into prose. My coauthor, Albert Baca, and I shipped drafts back and forth between us by email, polishing the manuscript until we felt it shone. Albert and I never thought about “platform” and “discoverability” since we were asked to write the book because we were already known in our field.
But how does a new author of fiction get the equivalent of invited talks at meetings and many other researchers citing your own work? I see mountains and canyons between me and discoverability in an internet world. This blog and others have taught me what needs to be done and, to some extent, how to do it using the internet. You’ve put me in a Jeep Wrangler instead of a Honda Civic for the journey, but there’s serious four-wheeling ahead. My first novel is about to come out, but my first internet marketing will be for my history website for teachers related to the time of my novel. Time will tell whether its links to my author blog and books lead to readers who care.
I can hardly wait to have personal contact with readers who found pleasure spending time with my characters as they struggled toward their goal. I may just frame my first fan letter (email?) as a reminder that it’s the people who count, not just the sales numbers. Of course, that assumes someone actually discovers my book and reads it! Deep ravine, lots of boulders in the path to that!
Dan, thanks for telling us “the way things were” back before today’s world of publishing……as a newbie, it’s interesting to get some new information about the days of yore.
Solomon wrote in Ecclesiastes 1:9 that “What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.” Amen.
(Feel free to recall the Bible verse about new things and the sun.)

(Feel free to recall the Bible verse about old things (wineskins) and new things (wine) and the sun.)

Because it is unplayable in its current state, unless you consider having to continually hold the top screen satisfactory.
1.) the springs in the shoulder buttons (they like to shoot out into oblivion) just make sure you're slow and careful with this step.
2.) the power switch (I managed to break this part while putting my ds back together) just make sure it lines up and you don't force anything back together.
3.) the ribbon cable for the screen (note how it's curled up around the hinge, it will make things a lot easier when putting the unit back together).
If you watch for the things mentioned above you should be fine.
4.) the rubber pads on the bottom (you will have to lift them up to get to screws behind them) put em on some wax paper or something and keep em in an easy to find place.
Anyway the first thing to do would to find a nice guide (with PICTURES!) through google or a good nintendo community (just find one you understand the best). Take a look at that and study it for a while and make sure you are comfortable with the process. Next thing you should do is get a triwing screwdriver (like a philips head but shaped like a "Y") you should be able to find them on certain game parts/repair sites or ebay (should cost around $1-2).
Also have a small philips head screw driver (doesn't have to be microscopic or anything, just small). Next is a replacement case. These should be easy to find (again CERTAIN websites should have them around $20) just make sure it's a decent one that looks closest to the original (reviews should be a good indication).
Alright, by now you should have everything you need and are ready to go. Just take it slow and follow the directions you have.

Cons are hard to come by with this product. The 15 grind settings are more than enough for most of us, nonetheless if we were burr grinder being totally picky, we’d say that perhaps a good finer setting for Turkish brewing strategies and extra choices could be welcome. In terms of cost, you’ll be able to actually discover cheaper grinders if you wish to, but these are unlikely to have so many options and likely will not have correct inbuilt scales.
Outfitted with a heavy-obligation motor, the Cuisinart Supreme Grind presents 18 completely different grind settings from advantageous to additional coarse. The machine options an eight-ounce hopper and a sliding dial able to producing sufficient grounds for as much coffee grinder as 18 cups of espresso. On a medium setting, the Cuisinart grinder will generate grounds for 18 cups of espresso in below a minute. This grinder tends to be reasonably noisy; nevertheless, it isn’t a major downside because it does grind shortly.
Gaggia comes with a protracted legacy of excellence and renowned sturdiness within the espresso regime. The MDF grinder is a strong, reliable, stepped grinder that will outlast you. The 120W motor comes with reduction gears for decrease speed, decrease temperature grinding, and 34 settings to offer a very good range of grinds. A pull-lever doser dispenses directly into espresso portafilters, although it makes dosing a slight challenge for home customers who wish to make different sorts of coffee. If this machine arrives in the field wanting dirty, don’t fret — Gaggia test-drives each one earlier than it ships.
Saying that Melitta knows its coffee would be an understatement. Melitta Bentz actually invented the first coffee filter in 1908. So it is protected to say it is aware of each beans and gear inside out. That is evident in this grinder, which is as practical as it’s inexpensive.
Now in case you are severe about your espresso as I or we are right here, you realize that one of the simplest ways to protect it’s freshness is to grind your personal coffee. So we love to try this ourselves and in doing so looked to seek out one of the best burr coffee grinder round.
Before diving into my evaluate of coffee grinders, I made a decision to explore this question just a little extra deeply. Static can sometimes be a problem, which can result in difficult decanting from the bin and some bean construct-up across the burrs. And there are three kinds of electric grinders.
With that in mind, you possibly can mess around and see what works finest for you, with the exception of espresso. When working with a portafilter you will have to know if it is pressurized or not. In case your portafilter is pressurized a normal espresso setting ought to work, however with a non-pressurized portafilter you will must be more careful as a result of it needs a more consistent grind measurement.
This makes some sense when you think about that the more deeply a coffee is roasted, the extra it loses its unique flavors and takes on a extra generic roasty profile. A dark roast isn’t unlike oak in wine or hops in beer—it is an equalizer of sorts, erasing a few of a bean’s pure taste, masking up flaws, and pushing the product’s general flavor in a single very particular route. That’s not essentially a foul thing, however it might lessen the impact that grind uniformity, and subsequently the grinder itself, can have.A simple and shinny staple.

Recent CommentsThe Boondocks Season 6 is a show that adults can watch. It’s a cartoon and it is based on a comic strip that the person who made the show, Aaron McGruder, had made. Produced by Sony Pictures Animation, it will be a show about a comic. The show will be on TV and air for a long time. It is the second show from the comic company. The series will be on HBO Max in 2022.
The show begins with a black family, the Freemans, who move to a neighborhood in a white neighborhood. They have trouble because the head of their community is Uncle Ruckus. In this show, you can see people from different cultures and backgrounds. These people have different lifestyles, social classes, stereotypes, and viewpoints. This is why the show has comedy and conflict.
What is the expected release date for The Boondocks Season 6?
The Boondocks Season 6 is coming out in the USA on HBO Max. It will be 2 years until you can watch it.
What is the plot of The Boondocks Season 6?
The original Boondocks Season 6 show is about two boys, Riley and Huey. They move in with their granddad when his mom dies. Then they fight rules that come from Uncle Ruckus and his government. In this story, the anime- and manga-inspired look of the series gets updated. The story also changes. Granddad and kids move to a suburb that is ruled by Uncle Ruckus. A story that is the same but with new things.
The comic strip “The Boondocks” has a new series coming out in 2019. It will be different from the first one because it is set more than 10 years later and there are more people.
The Boondocks is on HBO Max. The original series is not available anywhere else.
The series is about a family and their life. They live in a fictional city called Woodcrest County, Maryland. They fight against Uncle Ruckus’s government. The series shows the different perspectives of different cultures.
What are the characters of The Boondocks Season 6?
- Huey Freeman (voiced by Regina King) – 10-year-old Huey Freeman is the family’s moral compass and voice of reason. He is an intelligent, wise-beyond-his-years avid reader who is knowledgeable about a variety of subjects. He is heavily influenced by the theories of various left-wing social movements and social justice leaders. His brother and grandfather constantly ridicule and underestimate him, thinking he is a fool to have goals and values that aim higher than the expectations of mainstream American culture. It is mentioned that he has been declared a “domestic terrorist”. While he promotes various social causes, he is openly contemptuous of Urban Gangster Rap/Hip Hop as portrayed in mainstream media for glamorizing wasteful extravagance, self-defeating lifestyles, and ignorance. Huey, unlike the other characters, rarely smiles; in the episode “Let’s Nab Oprah” he smiles after his duel with Riley.
- Riley Freeman (voiced by Regina King) – Riley Freeman is Huey’s mischievous, rebellious 8-year-old brother, an enthusiastic follower of Urban Gangster Rap/Hip Hop. Though he is otherwise charming, clever, and artistically gifted, Riley maintains loyalty to those Gangster Rap ideals, even in the face of their self-destructive consequences. In “The Fundraiser” Huey tries to warn him directly about the foregone conclusions of his poor decisions, but Riley offhandedly rebuffs him. The bulk of the series focuses on Riley’s misadventures (most of which are fueled by his love of gangsta rap and a desire to emulate other people he admires) or on his various outlandish schemes, which his grandfather often endorses and aids. Despite his wild nature and attempts to appear tough, Riley occasionally shows a softer, innocent side. While his brother practices martial arts, Riley is skilled in street fighting, as shown in “Home Alone” and “Smokin’ with Cigarettes”.
- Robert Jebediah “Grandad” Freeman (voiced by John Witherspoon) – is the grandfather and legal guardian of Huey and Riley. While he loves his two grandsons, he sometimes explodes in tirades of angry frustration over their wisecracking observations, constant schemes, and misadventures, although he has his own moments; for instance, his eagerly misguided dating pursuits unwittingly attract bizarre or dangerous women. According to Season 3’s “It’s a Black President, Huey Freeman”, “Nobody knows exactly how old Robert Freeman is–not even himself.” Robert often threatens to discipline his grandsons, mainly Riley with Three Stooges-style corporal punishment and has developed a remarkable degree of speed and dexterity in wielding his belt for this purpose. He was an avid civil rights activist during his salad days.

Hungry for some news on games development?
Today we are ready to talk about our project named Virus.
The Virus has already been announced, but let’s remember what it is at large: a turn-based strategy that takes the player to the cruel world of viruses fighting for territory.
Everything is used in struggle for final victory: insidious methods, betrayals, weapons of mass destruction. And meanwhile, the numerous surprises that can turn the course of the battle, are waiting on the battlefield. Great warm-up for the brains of generals of any age.
We’ve put a huge amount of work to create a variety of mechanics for our game, and to make sure the final result looks exciting. Here are some examples:
The game has reached the testing and balancing stage, so we are going to cheer you up you with fresh news soon.
Do not be bored!I have talked before about how Content Management Systems(CMS) are getting so good, that it means they are doing more of the work so you don’t have too. Instead of doing the donkey work, you can be improving the whole application and doing the most advance features. However over my time of working with such a CMS called Kentico I have found some pro’s and con’s of this mode of working, so I wanted to share my thoughts of if it is a favourable idea to be working on these CMS’.
Kentico’s power
First off an overview of what Kentico is, in case you have not heard of it. Kentico is a C#.NET Swiss army knife of a CMS as it can do Content Management, E-commerce, Online Marketing and basically most of the work for a developer.
Some of the features are:
Kentico uses the name ‘Page Types’ for its content templates. In these you describe the format of how this content should be held, like a database table. You tell it what the field is called in the database, the size, the data format and things like the caption the Content Editor sees. When the Content Editor then adds new content and chooses that Page Type, they are presented with a form with these fields to enter the content. What it then means for the developer, is they have a standard format of how to pull different content from the CMS and not just get a blob of data. (Find out more)
As well as just getting well formatted content, you can use ‘Web Parts’. Web Parts are like functional modules that get used on a template. These can be things like a navigation bar that is on each page, but you can also have different types on each template. Also these can pull content from the database using the Page Type like a news feed or list of blog posts. (Find out more)
However the Web Parts are added by the developer and are only a single instance of the Web Parts. What we really want is the Content Editor to be able to choose what pages have what modules and for this there are ‘Widgets’. These are instances of the Web Parts, which means you create a Web Part and then the Widget references it. When the Content Editor uses the Widget it takes a copy of the Web Part that it stores on the Page. The control it gives is for the Content Editor to decide what module shows where, when and how. These can get very complex to give more control to the Content Editor or the Developer can keep some control by limiting the functionality of the module. (Find out more)
The other great content editor control is to build forms, yes full forms. With the CMS you can use a bit of a WYSIWYG to construct a form with various types of fields and then get them submitted to the database. These can also have customisation to send emails to the user or the administrator, create A/B split testing of forms and the editor can even customise the layout of the form. This will spare some hours building custom forms each time with the same validation, same submitting pattern and same design. (Find out more)
You can read more about all the features in depth and download a demo from the Kentico website. []
Tell me why?
Other than just showing you the brochure, I wanted to explain what makes using a full customisable CMS like Kentico brings.
In my opinion DevOps is all about empowering the next person to do more with less work, for example an Operations Engineer could make it easier for a Developer to spin up development environment. This kind of this means the Operations Engineer can keep doing other work and the Developer can get on with their work faster. This is the same thing with Kentico and the Content Editors. The more generic and bespoke Web Parts you make, the more the Content Editor can do without the assistance of the Developer, which then leaves the Developer to get on with other work like improving the systems.
When you have a bespoke website that you need to do all the changes within the code, then the Developer needs to do all the leg work for even the smallest change. If the Content Editor wants a box moved to another location of the page, then that’s a boring task for the Developer. However with a CMS like Kentico, the Content Editor will be able to move this by themselves.
I would rather this kind of work pattern as for both Front End and Back End development, as I want to be working on the next great and latest thing, while also looking to improve my code and the testing. This work pattern removes them small tasks that interrupt your work, plus also if you work in Scrum like myself then it takes up your sprint points working in the more Developer heavy pattern.
As mentioned above its not just moving Widgets and custom Web Parts that make this CMS great. It is also the fact that the Content Editors can create their own forms. I remember having to built every simple form from scratch each time, but this now puts the work in their hand, but also in a simple way. I also say simple forms, but it is as simple as you the Developer wants to make it. As you can customise or custom build the Form Controls that build up the form and the Form Web Part that is the base of loading plus saving the form, then you can make them as complex as you want. If you want the form to be in different style, then build different Form Widgets. If you want multiple fields that result in a single field of content, like an Address, then build a custom Form Control. The ideas are only limited by you the Developer or the Content Editors ideas.
The downsides I have seen are where the Content Editors have a lot of great simple ideas. I have been given tasks of adding a new type of button or adding a new content area to a Widget. Although we are empowering them, we also still need to provide the tools to them, which aren’t always the most inventive ones. There is also a balance between empowering them and giving them the code. You could expose all the customisable features of the Web Part, like a button so the colour, size, wording, features but then it’s a huge amount of work for one button. This would then put them off using it, however the other way of closing it down can then put more tasks on you.
Another challenge is what you can customise and what you should. Kentico’s recommendation for when you are customising anything, is if it is default to Kentico then clone it and customise the clone. This is so if or when you need to upgrade the CMS, you haven’t broken anything that the upgrade will use, plus it could get over written when the upgrade is then place. Even though Kentico is full customisable, the method in which it performs some task might not be how you like and at best practice you need to leave them how they are.
Final thoughts?
Although there are downsides to using a CMS like Kentico, I think any method of using a CMS will have its downsides. I feel with this set up I am more looking at improving the code, myself and the product, rather than doing the same task each time.

I have been asked whether getting the vaccine for the Covid virus is taking the mark of the beast as represented in Revelation 13:16-18.
Instead of taking a lot of time to explain the context and interpretation of Revelation, I thought I would just give you some bullet points for how we should respond to this question if you are asked.
We do have a series of teachings on what and who we believe the End Time Beast and what the Mark of the Beast is however for the sake of time and to address this subject we will not address this here at this time.
Here is why I do not believe getting the vaccine is taking the mark of the beast. I want to say up front that I readily admit that I am no medical expert on this subject matter, and I am not trying to solve whether it is wise for you to get vaccinated or not that is something that each person must decide to do on their own and with the consultation of the correct medical assistance.
What I am doing is trying to be open and sincere and objective with the text of Scripture. Sadly many take the scriptures out of context all the time.
- This is like taking any other vaccine. This argument is to say that if you have been vaccinated before, then this is no different than being vaccinated again. Yes, I do not pretend to understand where this virus came from or how pervasive and lethal it truly is or is not, but I do believe that Covid is a real virus. I believe that it is contagious and that for some, it has been life altering and for some fatal. I also have observed that for some who have been infected, their experience is like having the typical flu and for others, their experience is like having the common cold. Sadly I have also lost friends as a result of contracting this virus. I have no clear opinion as to where the virus came from and I am not meaning to underplay how this has affected whole families even within our fellowship. What I am saying, is that I understand Covid to be a real virus and I understand that there are vaccine options to combat it.
Finally, on this point, I want to reiterate that I am no expert on vaccines. So, answering when a vaccine is officially out of an experimental phase and “safe” is not for me to say. Someone taking a vaccine (like other medications) has to weigh their own health risks and then make a wise decision as to whether it is right for them. Still, in my best judgment this is still in the same ballpark as taking other vaccines.
- I do not believe that the Bible, in this case the book of Revelation, teaches that you can accidentally apostatize (leave and/or reject) the faith. When someone leaves the faith, they do it overtly, by saying with their lips or actions, they now are not trusting in Yahusha Ha Mashyach/Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord.
I want to be quick to answer someone’s objection who would say, “What about the fact the Satan is a liar and deceiver?” Isn’t the devil’s mission to dupe people into rejecting the true Christ by way of bait and switch? Okay, all this may be true, but if you are “in Christ” you need not fear that you will be tricked into rejecting Christ. Why? Christ has committed to keep you from being “snatched from the Father’s hand.” The Holy Spirit has “seal you until the day of redemption.”
Not to mention, the Holy Spirit gives you the power to discern between truth and error, so you should trust that you can discern with clarity when something is Anti-Christ or not. My point is that apostasy is overt.
When John wrote in his letter that “they went out from us because they were not of us” he is not speaking in mysteries. It is very clear when people leave and likewise clear when people do not. One of the titles for a Christian is being an “overcomer” or someone who perseveres in the faith.
When, faced with making a muddy choice like whether to take a vaccine or not, this is not the same as falling headlong into a false religion which openly rejects being saved by grace through faith alone. Nor is this like someone who claims to be a Christian who is living in hardhearted, unrepentant adultery.
- It is normal for believers to regularly disagree with each other on what they believe is the right thing to do or not and do so out of spirit deference and unity. In this case, the disagreement revolves around whether it is right or wrong to get the vaccine.
One of the chief reasons for disagreement on a decision like this is that believers on both side of the issue can follow their conscience by faith. I would go so far to say, this someone can get the vaccine by faith or not. Getting the vaccine is not to my knowledge, legally required on a national level (though it may be required on lesser levels), so I do not see this as a submission to government issue.
- Revelation 13:16-18 describes the mark of the beast in ways that clearly do not match getting the vaccine. I am sure someone will disagree with me here by arguing that Revelation is highly symbolic and so these verses can easily be applied to the vaccine. My caution to this kind of argument is that you can read anything you want to back into the Bible, making the Bible say whatever you need it to say.
For instance, back in the 80’s, in an attempt to make Ronald Reagan the Anti-Christ, people counted the letters for Ronald Wilson Reagan in a way that stood for 666. Ronnie’s first, middle, and last name each having six letters, meaning he was the one fulfilling the number signifying Anti-Christ (cf. Revelation 13:18).
Hopefully, you see that as ludicrous. I will grant that Revelation is highly symbolic but at the same time it should be read, understood, and applied within the most natural way it was written. If you do not read this book in a literal way, then you will be at the mercy of every guru prognosticator who will tell you whey they think it means.
In case of Revelation 13, John the writer, identifies the false prophet who will promote the Anti-Christ and who will convince the world to worship him as Christ. All unbelievers will follow Anti-Christ and believers will not!
Revelation 13:16 says, to avoid being put to death people will worship Anti-Christ and take a “mark” on their right hand or forehead. So, I am not saying, I understand anymore than you do in terms of what it will look like to take the “mark”, but I at least believe it will be something clearly associated with the right hand and forehead and readily recognizable to keep you from being executed.
Revelation 13:17 says someone will need this “mark” to “buy and sell” which is also explicitly attached with taking or rejecting the “mark.” Neither things I bring up are clearly associated with getting the vaccine. Even rumours about vaccine passports which would be required for people to enter restaurants are simply at this point rumours.
And even if they had vaccine passports and you could not enter a restaurant without it is no more then trying to travel internationally without a passport. No Passport, No travel nothing is any different.
Why do I bring these points up?
First of all, it makes for an interesting blog that someone might read but more importantly, I want to warn you not to be swept away by what I think could be a real Satanic distraction from the Truth. Conspiracy theories are like the soft drinks of nutrition.
They feel really good going down but are probably way more harmful to your spiritual health than you really even know. I know of people who are paralyzed by fear because they believe they are being duped by Satan to get the vaccine.
I also know people who have been paralyzed for fear that they will contract a virus that will kill them or their loved ones. Neither forms of paralysis are what God wants you to suffer.
2 Timothy 1:17 tells us "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind."
People believer or not who put fear into people about vaccines and spreading lies in the form of conspiracy theories have not the Spirit of Christ in them but the spirit of fear, confusion and unsound minds
So, what are you supposed to do?
Make an informed decision and do so by faith not judging others by what they do or do not do.Last weekend Daniel Cormier defended his light heavyweight title as he dispatched of top contender Volkan Oezdimir.

READ: A Bitcoin gadget geek buying guideOnce a technology only imagined in sci-fi, voice activated assistants are quickly growing in popularity. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Apple are continually developing the capabilities of the AI software behind them as people increasingly make them a part of their daily lives.
Voice assistant technology as we know it has been around since the early 2010’s. It started as a feature on smartphones and shortly after that in-home smart speakers were introduced. Smart speaker ownership has grown from 7% of the US population in 2017 to 33% in 2021. Consumers are using them for more than just listening to music these days. According to eMarketer, an estimated 73% of smart speaker owners used their devices for inquiries and 40% used it to shop.
Although the technology is fairly new and not exactly widely used yet, it is rapidly evolving. Innovative businesses will stay in front of this trend allowing them to capitalize on a solid foundation in the future. Here we will take a look at what voice search is, strategies for appearing in the results, and what industries will benefit from voice search optimization.
What is voice search?
Voice search is when a user speaks a command or question to a smartphone or smart speaker, rather than typing it out. To put it simply, the device transcribes the speech into text, analyzes it, searches for relevant information on the internet, and then translates it to fulfill the request.
Both Google and Siri, Apple’s voice assistant, pull their information from Google searches. Alexa, Amazon’s version, pulls search results from Bing as well as other sources like Wikipedia and IMBD.
How can my business appear in the results?
There isn’t a one-size-fits all implementation that automatically ensures a business will be in the results of a voice search. Just like with regular search engine optimization, many strategies need to be executed. However there are a few key things a business can do to give themselves a better chance of appearing.
Up-To-Date Directory and Review Listings
The first, which is a best practice for an effective online presence, is to make sure accurate business information is synced to relevant review and directory sites.
Search Engine Optimization
It is also necessary to implement traditional SEO tactics so that the business appears high on a search results page regardless of how the search is done. People speak differently than they type so long-tail keywords will need to be used in addition to one-word keywords.
Website Optimization
Finally, the business’s website needs to be optimized for voice search. This is done through content that is simple and succinctly answers the question posed. A website will also need a unique backend code that enables the voice assistant to easily translate the information on its pages.
What industries need to optimize for voice search?
Any business that has ecommerce on their site can benefit from being easily found using voice search. The number of people shopping with voice commands may be limited now but it is steadily rising.
Businesses that are frequently searched for like restaurants and bars, retailors, travel amenities, pet services, and home repair services are all likely to be searched for using a voice command.
Any business that has significant competition in their local area will do well to get in front of this trend in order to stand out.

"I totally understand nobody wants to be substituted before half-time.
"But purely from a tactical point of view, I had to change something, the way the game was at that stage, and that's my job.
"We don't hear about how disappointed Jack Collison was.
"So all players have to accept it if I bring them off, they have to accept it's my responsibility to change the way the team's playing, to get us back in the game.
"It's a difficult period but players show their true team spirit in situations like this.
"They show their true togetherness in situations like this, and that's what they've got to do, they've got to stick together.
"They can't fragment and think it's all about them, it's not just about them.

Is there any time like the sweltering month of July to start thinking about ice, snow, and what else? Christmas, that’s what. Ashton Green, a Canadian owned and operated company, has got you covered with up to 70% off select holiday essentials.
I don’t want to be a Grinch here, but I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around buying all the trimmings for a perfect Christmas while I’m sweating in my shorts, but a savings of 70% might make me change my tune. I love that this company is Canadian owned and operated, and that all prices on their site are listed in Canadian dollars. Shipping within Canada is a flat rate of $15, which I do find to be on the painful side.
If you’re an incredibly organized individual who wants to get a 6 month jump-start on Christmas shopping, I would encourage you to check out the Cranberry Scone Recipe Dishtowel, now $5.83 and was $8.99, and which offers a pretty yummy sounding recipe right on a dishtowel, something every Mother-in-law would love to find under the tree. Ashton Green’s Christmas in July section also offers quite a range of holiday themed lotions, soaps, and counter sprays in yummy scents like Vanilla Quince and Crimson Pear. Ho ho ho.
If you’re not like the person I described above, and the whole thought of Christmas right now makes you feel a little bit angry (like me), you may be more inclined to head over to some of the other areas of the Ashton Green website, like the Cocktail section! They carry the much sought after Corksicle, now $20.83 and was $28.99, a handy contraption that allows you to both cork and chill your wine all at the same time, keeping the bugs out and your wine nice and refreshing. This nifty gadget was one of Oprah’s Favorite Things for 2012 and something that has been on my wish list ever since.
Ashton Green’s website also boasts a plethora of lovely recipes, featuring tools and products available on their site. I’m confident that both the Bacon Jalapeno Cheese Ball and the Cucumber Mint Margarita Frozen Pops are going to make their way into my summer entertaining repertoire.

“In the last few months, our forces and the Army’s influence has been prominent, and they have been successful. This incident came as a setback to us and it’s a tragedy and a great loss, as eight personnel in total have died from both the Jammu and Kashmir Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Nevertheless, the action that we started to finish off militants will not end yet,” Rijiju told the reporters.
Rijiju asserted that the “militants operation will not be thwarted by the tragedy”.
“In this trying time, we stand with the families of slain forces personnel. I pray to god for their souls, but as I said, the operation will not stop,” he said.
With incremental attacks and cases of insurgency cropping up in the Kashmir valley, the MoS was also asked if the government had failed to take any “effective actions”.
“This is not a failure of the government because you have to take into account the accomplishments in the last months,” he answered.
He refused to divulge the details of further actions, and said that “you will get to know as and when it happens”.
Eight government forces personnel, including four CRPF soldiers and four policemen, were killed in the encounter with three Fidayeen Pulwama district yesterday.
The militants had stormed into District Police Lines Pulwama around 4 am yesterday. The attack was claimed by Jaish-e-Muhammad.Chicken and Broccoli in Phyllo

Vuelta Stage Report: Primoz Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) won the opening stage of the Vuelta a España. The Jumbo-Visma rider escaped on the descent of the Alto de Arrate in sight of the finish, and stayed ahead of what was left of the peloton. Richard Carapaz (INEOS Grenadiers) was second. Tom Dumoulin and Chris Froome both had to let go of the front runners on the final climb and lost time on the first day.
2019 Vuelta winner goes straight into the lead in 2020
After a minute silence for the victims of covid-19, the peloton left Irún for the last Grand Tour of the season.
2019 Vuelta a España winner – Primoz Roglič at the start
Stage 1. Irun – Arrate.Eibar – 173 Kilometres
This atypical 75th edition of La Vuelta begins on what originally was its 4th stage, a hilly stage in the heart of the Basque Country. The peloton will start from Irún, near the French border, and ride for almost 90 kilometres until reaching Legazpi, from which the real climbing will begin. Three category-3 climbs will precede the decisive, cat-1 Alto de Arrate, a holy climb for cycling – not only because of the sanctuary there is 2,5 kilometres from its top, where the stage’s finish line will be placed, but also because how often the peloton visits it. A yearly feature in the Tour of the Basque Country since its merger with the Euskal Bizikleta,
Fernando Escartín’s Comment: “The first stage and the first mountain contact for the peloton in La Vuelta 20. The final 25 km feature the succession of the Karabieta Mountain Pass (2nd category) and the Alto de Arrate (2nd category). Two climbs that, though not excessively difficult, could make early differences in the general classification.”
The last Grand Tour of the very different 2020 season rolled out of Irun
Five men went on the early attack on in this rainy opening stage. Rémi Cavagna (Deceuninck – Quick-Step), Jasha Sütterlin (Sunweb), Quentin Jauregui (AG2R-La Mondiale), Tim Wellens (Lotto Soudal) and Jetse Bol (Burgos-BH) were allowed to escape the peloton to take a maximum lead of 3:30. Aritz Bagües (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) had missed the break and tried to cross, but failed.
The start of another exciting Vuelta a España – Weather and covid-19 allowing
Jumbo-Visma and Movistar set the pace at the front of the peloton and did not let the five at the front get too far away. At 95 kilometres from the finish, Daniel Felipe Martínez crashed, but the Colombian was able to continue and was taken back into the peloton by his teammates. Mathias Frank and Ilan Van Wilder were less lucky. Frank had to leave the Vuelta, while debutant Van Wilder had to retire due to physical problems. Alexandre Geniez also gave up later in the stage, so AG2-La Mondiale has only six riders left.
More like the winter than ‘Sunny Spain’
On the Alto de Udana, Jauregui took all the KOM points ahead of Bol and Sütterlin. On the second climb of the day, the Frenchman was again the first to the top. The co-operation in the leading group came to an end when Cavagna thought it was not fast enough. The Frenchman was soon pulled back by his fellow escapees, who were being chased down by the peloton. The early break was caught one by one and at 25 kilometres out, the break was over.
The break was doomed
Bad crash for Martinez and Woods later
During the climb of the Alto de Elgata, EF Pro Cycling was again unlucky when Michael Woods crashed. On the penultimate climb of the day, Chris Froome and Thibaut Pinot had to let go of the peloton early on. Froome was able to return, but was in trouble again when his teammates increased the pace.
Chris Froome was in trouble
On the Alto de Arrate, the INEOS Grenadiers kept setting the pace. At the back of the peloton Vlasov, Martinez and Poels, among others, dropped off. Sepp Kuss put in a strong effort 4.5 kilometres before the finish. It was too fast for Tom Dumoulin and Alejandro Valverde.
Roglič had the jump
Nine riders remained at the front. Jumbo-Visma was well represented with three men (Kuss, Roglic and Bennett). A strong Kuss continued to set the pace, at the expense of teammate Bennett. On the descent, Carthy tried to escape, but his attempt was unsuccessful. Roglič then accelerated at the 1 kilometre banner. The Slovenian took enough lead to stay away for the opening stage and first leaders jersey. Carapaz was second.
Could Roglič lead all the way to Madrid?
Roglič has dealt a big blow to his competitors with his victory. Teammate Tom Dumoulin is already 1 minute behind. Martinez and Vlasov are at more than 4 minutes and seem to have to forget their classification ambitions. Chris Froome and Thibaut Pinot also face a significant loss after one day.
Stage winner and overall leader, Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma): “A victory is always nice. It was a difficult stage and on the last climb we really went up full speed. We were all suffering. The team was very strong again today. We also want to try to keep several guys as high as possible in the rankings. It is a special Vuelta. We do not know how long it will last and how the course will unfold. It’s just a matter of racing as well as possible. We really look at it day by day. Three weeks is and remains a long period. I will enjoy it now, tomorrow is a new day.”

Last week, Bachchan, who hosts the fifth edition of the reality game show Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), flagged off a van with a mock-up of the show, which will travel to 22 cities in India. KBC 5 will go on air on August 15.
"This van will travel to 22 cities of India. There are many audience and aspirant contestants who don't get the opportunity to come to Mumbai and play Kaun Banega Crorepati with me. They will get a chance to sit on the mock-up of the hot seat and click a picture with my statue," Bachchan said on the occasion.
Giving a preview of this edition of the show, Bachchan said: "There are very minute changes and the format of the game is intact. The changes have been made to make the game more thrilling. Even people watching the show at home can play the game. Their prize money will be less though."
He said that the previous season had shown that "contestants from small-town India came in large numbers and did what most metro town inhabitants could not achieve. The power of opportunity, the power of determination if the resources materialise, and the ultimate joy of disproving most others, is really the triumph of the common man."

articleA day shy of the one-year anniversary of his last game with the Islanders, Rick DiPietro is slated to start tonight for Bridgeport when the Isles’ AHL affiliate visits Providence.
DiPietro was removed from his last game with the Sound Tigers on Dec. 11 after two periods when he experienced stiffness in his leg that the team said was unrelated to the knee injury that has kept him out of action since last season.
It’s expected that DiPietro, who has played just four periods with Bridgeport this season, would need at least one full game before the Isles would consider playing him in an NHL game.2 BEDROOM Apartment in Gramercy Park (Midtown, NYC)

Description
Summary
The serverless test suite is currently run directly against Atlas proxies, as this allows drivers to run certain test against a single proxy if required (e.g. if a failpoint needs to be tripped) and target failpoints to individual proxies (e.g. for the mongos pinning tests). However, in the near future the proxies will be moving behind a load balancer, which makes both of these impossible.
The existing load balancer tests avoid this issue by spinning up two different load balancers, one that fronts a single mongos and one that fronts multiple, and conditionally uses each as necessary. We could consider doing something similar for serverless, though it would require changes Atlas side.
Motivation
Without a solution to this problem, drivers testing of serverless will be limited.
Does this ticket have a required timeline? What is it?
All serverless instances will be moving behind load balancers in ~1 month.
Is this ticket only for tests?
Yes
Notes for Language Authors
Drivers that already implemented Serverless testing before load balancing must opt in to testing load balanced Serverless instances.
- Pass LOADBALANCED=ON as an environment variable to .evergreen/serverless/create-instance.sh to create a load balanced AWS backed instance.
- Use the new expansions SINGLE_ATLASPROXY_LB_URI and MULTI_ATLASPROXY_LB_URI in place of SINGLE_MONGOS_LB_URI and MULTI_MONGOS_LB_URI in load balancer tests.
- See the Go POC for an example of updating existing Serverless.Fresh from the release of his Asahina Mikuru garage kit at Winter Wonder Festival 2007, veteran sculptor Polygo took a trip to China in early March to supervise the production of Wafuudou Ganguten’s Izumi PVC (from He Is My Master) that he designed. He documented the trip with an incredibly thorough photo log, which can be seen here; I’ve seen pictures of Chinese maker boardroom collections before, but never the production process at this hands-on a level. An eerie sight, and a real eye-opener into the PVC figure world. (no more)

A family business is, in my opinion, an enterprise that includes some measure of control by the younger generation of the family. There are two types of family businesses: one in which the founder or an elderly family figure retains some measure of control and one in which the younger generation has a higher degree of control.
There is a struggle within each family business regarding who calls the final shot. I believe that on the whole (although there are certainly a number of exceptions), family businesses in which the younger generation plays a bigger part are worse off as a result of the financial crisis than those businesses in which the older generation has more say.
There are many reasons for this deduction. For one, the younger generation (those 40 and under) grew up at a time of riches in the Gulf, taking such issues as food and water for granted. But for some of their parents, fruits and vegetables were a luxury – forget valuable imports from Europe and Japan.
This generation is generally less street smart than the older generation and can easily fall prey to the neuro-linguistic programming savvy banking executives who try to convince them of complicated investment products that neither seller nor buyer fully understand. I’ve seen them all before: derivatives, structured products, hedge funds and other so-called “opportunities of a lifetime.” I’ve turned them all down before and will turn them all down again in the future. The elder founders of family businesses are not likely to fall so easily for a product that requires a fancy power point presentation to win over the investor. If an individual doesn’t know where his money will be going even after a 20·minute show, despite the irresistible promised returns, then common sense dictates that he refrain from investing.
Typically, an elder person who has worked hard for his wealth will, indeed, refrain. But a younger person, often over-ambitious, eager to prove his prowess and armed with new ideas from his western education, will try to commit his father’s hard-earned liquidity to such get rich quick schemes.
Stick to what you know
There is also an issue of core competency that must be adhered to. If your strength is, say, automobile sales, then don’t venture into hotels or industrial production. That is the advice that Mohammed Abdul Jalil Al Fahim told a recent gathering I organized on family businesses. The Al Fahims sold their non-core-competency assets and concentrated on what they knew best. This is advice that all family businesses in the Gulf can make good use of.
The world is full of people who have wasted their fathers’ money by taking excessive risks and venturing out of their core competency safe zones. For the sake of being politically correct, I will refer to a non-GCC example: that of Donald Trump himself.
The high-flying, so-called investment genius is a prime example of the younger generation expending its parents’ money and seeking the limelight and celebrity status. Fred Trump, a name not common on all tongues, was the real person behind the wealth of his famous son. The older Trump started slow and steady with a target niche market of building for middle-income clients in New York City. By following this approach, he was able to amass a sizable wealth that was estimated to be US$ 300 million, most of which was used to bankroll his son’s high profile investments such as casinos and iconic towers in Manhattan. The flashy, camera-friendly celebrity mogul Donald Trump abandoned his father’s time tested approach and saw his policies lead him to declare bankruptcy on numerous occasions.
I will not be surprised if some fathers in the Gulf begin to take decision-making powers away from their sons as a direct result of this financial crisis, especially as they come to terms with the extent of what their sons have embroiled their enterprises in. Also, like Fred Trump in the early 1990s, some fathers in the Gulf may even have to bail out their more sophisticated sons’ flamboyant ventures.
Ultimately, it may all boil down to maintaining tried and tested investment strategies that have accumulated the wealth of the older generation. There is no need to reinvent the wheel of commerce. To use a popular idiom: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. This financial crisis might prove to be the real education these kids never got in their western universities.
This article originally appeared in the April 2009 issue of MoneyWORKS. (PDF Download)The owner of a Franklin Borough kickboxing studio has sued Gov. Phil Murphy, claiming the governor’s shutdown orders at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic requires businesses to be financially compensated while forced to be closed.
CKO Kickboxing owner Darlene Pallay says Murphy violated a portion of the state’s Disaster Control Act when the governor signed Executive Order 104 on March 19.
“(Murphy) did not follow the law, because he did not order that the affected property owners be compensated, forcing private owners to pay for a public benefit,” one of Pallay’s attorneys Robert W. Ferguson said. “In essence, the governor’s edicts, as he has ruled for the last six months, have been paid for by New Jersey’s small businesses.”
A spokesman for Murphy didn’t immediately return a message from NJ Advance Media seeking comment.
The suit claims that the Disaster Control Act requires Murphy to establish an emergency compensation board for each county whose job is to “award reasonable compensation” to anyone whose party has been “taken or used.” Murphy is supposed to appoint the three members of each board, according to the law.
Along with other non-essential businesses, CKO was ordered closed March 16. It was permitted to reopen Sept. 1 at 25% capacity after being allowed to hold outdoor classes starting in June.
CKO Kickboxing’s outdoor classes generated little revenue and operated at law capacity, according to the suit, which goes on to say Murphy violated the constitutions of the U.S and New Jersey.
“Private property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation,” according to the state’s constitution.
A spokesman for Murphy didn’t immediately return a message from NJ Advance Media seeking comment.
A new group — Rescue New Jersey — helped Pallay file the suit. The group is comprised of “Morris and Sussex County residents who were inspired by the concerns of state Sen, Joe Pennacchio, (R-26) of the impact of Murphy’s executive orders overall on the rights and quality of life of New Jersey’s families and businesses.”

Hello mates,
I am performing a cotransfection reaction for an effector and a reporter genes, and i want to test the effect of the effector gene on the expression of the reporter one, but the problem is that i am i have the same vector for both of them (pcDNA3.1).
previously, when i performed one construct transfections, i have used neomycin gene (in the pcDNA3.1 plasmid) for normalization, i dont know how i will normalize the qPCR results now for the expression of the reporter plasmid since i have neo in the effector and the reporter plasmid.
best regrads
Sorry, I am a little bit confused here...........
Why you're doing qPCR? What do you want do detect?
Are you supposed to do reporter assay such as lacZ or luciferase assay?
To start the story from the beginning, the reporter plasmid consists of a minigene construct (3 exons and a small part of there introns).
One of these exons (exon 2) is alternatively spliced, and i want to measure the expression levels of each isoform of the minigene( the full-length and the delta exon2).
For that, in this experiment i have the effector plasmid, that is differen splicing enhancers and silencer binding proteins.
After all, i want tto perform a cotransfection experiment to check the effect of each (splicing enhancers or silencers binding protein) on the expression levels of both isoforms by qPCR.
I dont have any reporter assay, i am performing a syber green qPCR, using gene specific primers.

Knob and tube wiring was commonly used in from 1880’s to the mid 1940’s. There are three main issues with this type of wiring. First, the wire is rated for 15 amps however, many newer appliances require a higher load to properly operate. The second & third reasons are safety concerns the outer sheathing of the wire is prone to deteriorate and once it does it exposes the bare wire and that is both a fire hazard and could electrocute someone. lastly, it the wire is not grounded and in the event of a short circuit, there is no ground to safely reroute the current. getting in front of this problem will save you a lot of headache down the road. Those who are able to get in front of the problem completely replace the Knob & Tube wiring with modern copper wiring. Although this process requires electricians behind walls and in ceilings, the temporary mess is not only responsible but costs a fraction of the price the potential damages would.
If you are unsure whether or not your home is using a K&T system, you will want to check around your furnace room.
IDENTIFY KNOB AND TUBE WIRING.
There are a few ways of identifying K&T wiring, the best way is visually inspecting it, K&T has distinct white ceramic knobs that attach the wiring to the studs/joists (pictured below). If you can’t see the wiring check what year your home was built, if your home was made between the 1880 – 1945, it’s at one point has had knob & Tube wiring and it may not have been replaced. we typically see this in the older neighborhoods of Toronto, ie Rosedale, Beaches, some parts of Downtown. If you find your home is running K&T wiring and wish to remove it, give Koala Electrical a call today for a free quote.
THE SOLUTION
The average cost to remove and replace the knob and tube wiring for an average home in Toronto is between $10,000.00 – $20,500.00. There are certain insurance companies that refuse to insure homes with knob & tube wiring as they are considered high risk. When looking to buy or sell a home with knob and tube wiring it tends to sell for significantly less than the cost of replacing the wiring.How to create an upload of a document to Excel via a form, then upload it to Google Disk and download it in PDF format
The operation is implemented through a chain of calls to External Actions.
Generate Excel - > Upload a file to google drive - > Export to PDF
1. Create a form with the settings of the upload parameters and call the external action generatedoc, also specify the spCallback for export after generating the document.
-- SELECT 2 в SaveItem -- SELECT 1 (Result, Msg, SuccessUrl, HideFormAfterSubmit, RefreshContainer) select 1 Result, ' ' Msg, '' SuccessUrl, 1 HideFormAfterSubmit, '.stageDocs' RefreshContainer -- SELECT 2 Calling an external action select 'generatedoc' type, 'stageAct' code, cast(@itemID as nvarchar) itemID, '{ "companyName" : "'+replace(isnull(@companyName, ''), '"', '')+'", "num" : "'+cast(isnull(@num, 0) as nvarchar)+'", "date" : "'+isnull(@pdate, '')+'", "parentDocName" : "'+isnull(@pparentDocName, '')+'", "sum" : "'+cast(isnull(@psum, '') as nvarchar)+'", "customerPost" : "'+isnull(@customerPost, '')+'", "customerFIO" : "'+isnull(@customerFIO, '')+'", "docID": '+cast(@docID as nvarchar)+' }' parameters, 'generatedoc_uploadGD' spCallback, cast(@docID as nvarchar) docID
2. Creating a procedure for uploading the created document to the server
In it, we extract the parameters we need and call upload to Google Drive via an external action, and also specify spCallback to process the incoming FileID.
The url and docID parameters are extracted from parameters (they get there from the external generatedoc action).
ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[outer_generatedoc_uploadGD] @parameters ExtendedDictionaryParameter readonly, @data nvarchar(128) = '', @username nvarchar(128) = '' AS BEGIN -- SELECT 1 ReesultModel select 1 Result, '' Msg declare @path nvarchar(256) select @path = Value2 from @parameters where lower([key]) = 'url' declare @docID nvarchar(256) select @docID = Value2 from @parameters where lower([key]) = 'docid' declare @folderId nvarchar(128) select top 1 @folderId = docFolderGoogleID from fin_contragents where id in (select contragentID from rudenas2x.dbo.doc_documents where id = @docID ) declare @s nvarchar(256) = 'outer_generatedoc_uploadGD = ' +isnull(@path, '') +' '+ isnull(@folderId, '') exec as_print @str = @s if(isnull(@path, '')<>'' and isnull(@folderId, '') <>'') begin -- SELECT 2 Outer actions select 'gd' type, 'upload' action, doc_getDocName(cast(@docID as int)) filename, @path filepath, @folderId folderId, 'generatedoc_uploadGD_saveFileID' spCallback, @docID docID end
3. We implement processing for saving the file and calling export to PDF
ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[outer_generatedoc_uploadGD_saveFileID] parameters ExtendedDictionaryParameter readonly, @data nvarchar(128) = '', @username nvarchar(128) = '' AS BEGIN -- SELECT 1 ReesultModel select 1 Result, '' Msg declare @fileId nvarchar(256) select @fileId = Value2 from @parameters where lower([key]) = 'fileid' declare @docID nvarchar(256) select @docID = Value2 from @parameters where lower([key]) = 'docid' declare @s nvarchar(256)= 's='+ isnull(@fileId, '') if(isnull(@fileId, '')<>'') begin update doc_documents set gdfileId = @fileId where id = @docID end @declare @path nvarchar(128) = '/uploads/e1.pdf' -- SELECT 2 External export action -- select 'gd' type, 'export' action, @fileId fileId, 'pdf' exportType, @path path END
4. On the JS side, in the callback of the saveItem form, you can optionally process the created @path (must be passed to data.additionalData)
as.formcallbacks.[formCode]_saveItem = function(data){ console.log(data) // location.href= ... }

Welcome to the Australian High Commission Website.Getting a little tired of going through hardware here. I know…my computers stay on around the clock and I’m on them 10 hours a day 6–7 days a week, what should I expect?
I just had to restart after a BSOD. Yes, blue screen of death. The error was at usbhub.exe, so kind of gives me a clue where the problem was. I was printing a file when it happened. From a printer that is attached to a Belkin 4–port USB 2.0 hub. I had been having trouble with that hub before. Couldn’t get ActiveSync to work right on my PDA.
I disconnected the hub and it was hot. Nearly too hot to touch. I have the exact same hub also attached to my Mac G5 and that one is warm, not hot. So goodbye to another hub. This is the 2nd that died on me (the other was on the Mac, so don’t go and blame the PC).
I’m trying to find what is considered the “best” USB hub and I’m not finding anything conclusive. USB hubs just aren’t sexy enough to review, I guess. No software to play with. Plug it in and it works. Or not.
Any recommendations?

I have a Belkin USB 2 hub with independent channels. It has four ports in the back and two that stick up in the middle. It was pricy, but worth it.
Oops, I guess it’s seven ports total:
The iPod works quickly in it, so it must be USB 2.0 despite having 1.1 devices plugged in.Browsing Tag

What’s this? I’m blogging about my work on a weekly basis – a simple way to track and archive whatever it is I spend my time on.
Last week on Monday, I finished my article on the Oculus Rift VR headset. It was published in nrc.next on Tuesday and is also available online (in Dutch): Oculus Rift en de comeback van virtual reality. During the week, the paper published my review of Thomas Was Alone and Harry Hol’s review of Far Cry: Blood Dragon, which I edited. I also edited Stefan Keerssemeeckers’ review of Metro: Last Light, which wasn’t published yet.
Tuesday marked another Ripple Effect session at Hubbub.
That evening, I watched Microsoft’s Xbox One announcement, which was interesting in a TV kind of way. It’s obvious that CEO Steve Ballmer is trying to use the success of Xbox to force Windows into the living room, a decade after the original Xbox team defeated the WebTV team in that famous internal battle. Putting it differently: Xbox was always, and is still, defined by the clash between the set-top box and the games console.
Wednesday morning, I visited Two Tribes for the first time in a while. We talked about their plans for the Steam version of Toki Tori 2 and beyond, and discussed my role there going forward.
That afternoon, I attended Herbert Blankesteijn’s tech radio show BNR Digitaal to talk about Xbox One, Ouya and Oculus Rift. The episode is available for download, too.
On Thursday, I published my latest contribution to the experimental writing game Your Daily Victory Boogie Woogie (in Dutch): Snuffelstage. The game is now in its final stretch, and in this piece I made sure that supporting character Lucia Labruyère will not be forgotten. The next day, I got together with the game’s editorial team to discuss the general progress.
Thursday night, I met with Hessel Bonenkamp for what’s intended to become a weekly game development hobby thing. I continued to fiddle with Game Maker tutorials (which I last did during Christmas 2011), while Hessel worked on a game in Unity. This ties in with my plan to have more hobbies, in other words: create structures that force me to work on interesting projects that won’t lead to fame and fortune in the near future.
On Friday and Saturday, I worked on the proposals for my next books, and finished the one for Sexy Sadie, the large-scale novel that’s been in the cards since 2005 (also known as ‘forever’). I had a discussion with my editor about whether having three dead main characters would translate to commercial suicide, a decision we’ve decided to postpone.
On Sunday, I celebrated my 33rd birthday and played Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine. My actual birthday is today.Today is the Women’s March on Washington; an enormous number of protestors have marched on the nation’s capital to protest the election of Donald Trump.

According to B. B. Warfield only "minute" traces of the Articles may be found in the Westminster Confession and its attendant catechetical literature. However, in his recent book, The Westminster Assembly: Reading its theology in historical context (P&R, 2009), Robert Letham challenges that view, detailing where the Westminster Confession was dependent upon material drawn from the Articles. His surprising conclusion is this,
I think that is what is meant by 'food for thought'.I think that is what is meant by 'food for thought'.The Thirty-Nine were a major source for the Assembly, if not the major source. The Assembly is solidly in line with the English Reformed tradition. If the Assembly documents are like a sumptuous cheesecake, the solid, crunchy crust is Cranmer. If we were to suppose them to be a succulent piece of deep-fried plaice, the chips, salt, and vinegar come from the earlier English Reformed tradition. (P. 81).

Advertisements have experienced some major milestones, all of them having a great influence on the way Advertising is practised. More changes can be witnessed in the past 20 years in advertising than in the previous 2,000 years. Here are a few of them:
Different Ad Formats
Advertisements have constantly adapted and changed to suit new mediums and an increasingly savvy audience. Over time, various ad formats have emerged. Each format has introduced a different platform and network.
In the pre-internet days, advertising was done via cheesy infomercials on radio, televisions, and billboards. The internet is one medium that has revolutionized advertising unlike any other, not only changing the way ads are broadcast, but the way consumers perceive them.
Product is no longer the centrepiece, solution to the consumer’s problem’s is.
The internet has brought a shift in the advertising world. Rather than the “sell mentality”, ads today are focused on community building and brand awareness.
The idea of emphasising a solution to consumer’s problems instead of the product is becoming increasingly common, forcing brands to work twice as hard to gain the trust of consumers in the internet world.
Check out this video by Sprint Business. It talks about the problems you face when you decide to move in to a new workspace. There is no forced selling of the product. We are introduced to Smart Business after we are aware of the solution they provide to our problem.
Consumers have moved on from their role as passive onlookers and have become a part of advertising.
There are plenty individuals who click on “skip” automatically when watching online video content. Which is why advertisers today are working on developing videos that will want you to share them with friends and family. More than 700 videos are shared by Twitter users every minute.
Video is also a more accessible format for advertisements. YouTube, the largest video platform, gets over 30 million visitors per day who watch almost 5 billion videos every single day.
Using video advertisements has now become an integral part of advertising. And the ROI on videos is great too!
The future of video ads
Videos have undoubtedly created an impact on Advertising. Dylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, has compiled a detailed report on U.S. digital media ad revenue.
Here are some key points from the report:
- US digital ad revenue is expected to reach nearly $100 billion by 2021, which represents compound annual growth of 8%.
- Mobile is positioned to become the top destination for digital ad spending.
- Social advertising in all formats is gaining traction and will be among the key drivers of digital ad growth in the next 5 years. Social ad revenue is poised to climb to $30.8 billion by 2021.
- Artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and sponsored content will help propel further digital ad growth in the next decade.
Here is how video advertisements will affect different industry sectors:
- The travel industry. Travel marketers consider videos as superior sales drivers because they can be personalized via behavioral targeting, making it work well at the top and bottom of the funnel.
- The automotive industry. Dealerships determine the success of marketing tactics by measuring how many people visit their locations, and automotive marketers see video ads as the primary way to drive traffic to showrooms.
- Retail. Video ads are great to build awareness and drive online sales. The only downside is that video ads have very little impact on offline sales when compared to other ad formats.
- Consumer packaged goods. Video is considered as a great branding tool for motivating shoppers and influencing them. An additional hurdle faced in this industry is the retailer that stands between them and their consumer, which complicates their marketing and measurement.
Video ads are here to stay, and the sooner you jump on this bandwagon, you will notice a bigger impact on your campaigns! and can be conveniently operated intuitively from the outside.

A little more Father Robot
You may recognize the line work of this one from another post or website. It’s one of my favorite Father Robot drawings from issue #1. I had this extra printout of it sitting near by drawing table, so I got out my Copics and took to the line work for a little coloring practice. I meant to try a new variation on FR’s standard design, but he actually ended up a little bit more muted than normal. I still had fun…
Do the Robot!
More time for sketching
I recently started a new job. This job is in an office, as opposed to my last job, which was mostly outdoors, trying not to get killed… Anyway, I really enjoy that the new setting provides me with more opportunities to get some drawing done. Here’s a little robot I sketched while I had some down time. I hope to get a lot more accomplished now.
Celebrate good times.
So, the first issue of Father Robot just cam back from being lettered and it looks awesome! Well, that may seem immodest, since I drew the line work. So, maybe I should say that Adam Pruett did an awesome job lettering. The next step is getting the book back from the printer, which will hopefully happen in time to get it on the table at Comicon…
In celebration of this momentous step, please enjoy this little head-shot of a robot with nostrils from my sketchbook.
Spending some time with the family.
The below line work from Father Robot #1 represents the last week or so for me, since we finished the artwork for the book. I’ve got a list of projects that need immediate attention, but I just can’t seem to keep the momentum going. I need a break. Maybe I’ll start up again today… or tomorrow.
Anyway, I may not have a cute little girl or giant robot at my picnic, but luckily I do get to spend my time with the wonderful woman.
Work lessons
Over the past few weeks I drew a lot of comic book pages, which required drawing the same characters over and over again. These two guys were featured again and again. One of them I felt really good about and the other I felt like I could never seem to get quite right. Can you guess which one is which?
I’ve always believed that when an artist is enjoying a drawing, that enjoyment comes through in the piece itself. So, I think you can tell when a character is fun for an artist to draw and when one’s a chore..
A little time off
I haven’t posted in over in month, but it’s not for lack of something to post. The comic I’m collaborating on with Kristopher White for Comicon, Father Robot, is ready to go, and that’s because I’ve been doing little else but work on it since the beginning of May. I even quit my day job to focus on it entirely for a while. Well, it’s done. I hired a colorist (the wonderful Jenny Gosk) and Kristopher hired a letterer and now the book is going out to the printer. So, I should have some time off to work on a few other projects. While I get some artwork together for such promised things, check out some line work from Father Robot #1.Lecture: "Perceived automation threat, populism and vote choice: evidence from 14 European democracies"
Professor Peter Loewen, Department of Political Science,
The Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy,
University of Toronto, Canada
Professor Peter Loewen is 2021/2022 IAS Distinguished Scholars of the Mortimer and Raymond Sackler Institute of Advanced Studies.
Abstract:
The political consequences of Automation and Artificial Intelligence has become the focus of some populism and nationalism literature. We contribute to this literature by drawing from a data set of over 15,000 respondents from 14 European countries to estimate how respondents’ egotropic and sociotropic fears about automation and job loss relate to party support. We find a positive relationship between personal automation risk and left voting, but a negative relationship between personal automation risk and support for populist right parties. We find that nativism suppresses the overall negative relationship between personal automation fear and populist right party support. We also find that perceptions of collective threat increase intentions to vote for populist right parties, but not other party families. Overall, our analysis suggests that both non-populist and populist left parties could be positioned to make substantial gains when citizens feel more personally exposed to automation and AI.Well, it's been nearly a week since I last posted here.

Have the network installation module finished. This is a good thing.
After having the basic medical paid for me by the company I worked for for the past year or two, I've recently needed to go and get it set up on my own. They bill you via mail, and have no option for direct withdrawl this year. They tell me maybe next year.
Why did I need to go set that up again? I think I'm getting a very bad cold, in that I've had difficulty hearing for the past two days, and was apparently wandering around like a zombie, although I don't remember droning on about needing brains. Maybe I just needed a parent to wait for me.
While wandering like a zombie, I managed to find three dead NIC cards around the network, and remove some 10Mbit hubs. With all of that plugged into the network, it seems to affect everyone and drop connections that should be 9MB/s down to 300KB/s. Everything seems much happier in the network, now.
I just realized that the game of nethack I started on the full moon that I left in a detached screen died in a power outage over the weekend! fsck!

Dear Crabby, Why Should I Care About the Suez Canal?
March 31, 2021 by Leave a CommentMichael Salla, Robert O’Harrow Jr, and Steven Rich (The Washington Post) have written an interesting series on asset forfeiture (see the teaser “Civil asset forfeitures more than double under Obama,” by Christopher Ingraham on Wonkblog). The basic presumption of asset forfeiture is simple: you are guilty until proven innocent. If you are the target of “stop and seize,” you bear the burden of proving that your assets were not involved in criminal activity. Even if charges are never filed, you may not get your assets back. And due to the Equitable Sharing Program, state and local authorities have strong financial incentives to take asset forfeiture seriously. What could possibly go wrong?
A few striking facts from the first installment:
-.
According to the Post, asset forfeiture and the incentives created by the Equitable Sharing Program have contributed to more aggressive forms of policing and the use of private security networks. And there is good evidence that the same racial and ethnic biases that are intrinsic to the war on drugs come into play on a routine basis.
NSA collection of data, militarization of police forces, the wide scale practice of “stop and seize”… One does not have to be a cynic to discern a pattern here.
4 thoughts on “The Presumption of Guilt and the Glories of “Stop and Seize””
Unfortunately, one DOES have to be a cynic to see the pattern. Too many people, even if they don’t care for Obama, choose to keep their eyes closed, remaining ignorantly bliss and subscribing to the NIMBY fallacy, convinced it’s not happening to you or me, just the guy behind the tree.
Its amazing how America has slipped back in time to the feudal age. This age occurred when the state,led by the aristocracy,had total control over the property and the fruits of labor of the multitude. They,the feudal aristocracy,under cover of law could take,by force if necessary,what they wanted of the people’s hard earned wealth whenever the state wanted it. In today’s modern America the number of people in the Political Class dependent on the state for their livelihood and existence outnumber,and therefore outvote,the productive Americans in the Economic Class. When either through taxes,borrowing and or money printing the collected revenue is not sufficient to feed the needs of the Political Class the state,who controls the law, now legalizes outright theft to satisfy said needs. Forfeiture laws and Rico Statutes originally designed to go after the ill gained assets of proven criminals are now used to take the property of the average law abiding citizen. This misuse of and misapplication of the law breeds disrespect for the law by the law abiding population and in the end is an important factor in the decline and fall of the American Republic. As the legal process is controlled,by and large, by courts and judges that are part of the Political Class I doubt that there will be much repealing and or reforming of these draconian laws in the near future. Once property rights are destroyed so is your civilized society.

Oxford, Mississippi joined that list in 2017, and Texas A&M coach Jo Evans is on a mission to add College Station to the list sooner rather than later.
“I think we can make a run [at a conference championship],” Evans said. “The SEC will always have us ready to make a great run against the best teams in the postseason, and that’s what is most important to me… this year, we are a year older and stronger, and we have every bit of talent and skill necessary to finish in the upper tier of our conference. Why not win it?!”
Evans’ club reached the Women’s College World Series in 2017, and despite an early elimination from the tournament, the longtime Aggies head coach says that playing on the game’s biggest stage had a lot of benefits for her players.
“We did a great job with our backs against the wall,” Evans said. “I thought we were pretty fearless. I thought we really showed a lot of strong character during the World Series… the takeaway for me is that the first step to winning it all is just to get there. When I look over our season, I think of all of the ups and downs, that led to us having the confidence to manage some challenges. Really solid defense, pitching staff, and scored runs when we needed to score runs.”
“This next season, I see us getting better and I think defensively, we were a good ball club last year,” Evans said of her outlook on the 2018 campaign. “Defense was certainly one of our strengths. I see us getting stronger and better this year…. When you have a core of a team that understands exactly what it takes to get to the Women’s College World Series, that means a lot. We keep the focus on the hard work that it takes to be successful at this level and trying to impart that onto our freshmen and help them understand the hard work it requires, the talent and skill set that you have to have, and the sacrifices you have to make.”
The 2017 Aggie pitching staff saw three hurlers – Lexi Smith, Trinity Harrington, and Samantha Show – reach the 100-innings pitched mark. Evans expects more of the same in the circle in 2018: “I expect them to be even more proficient on the mound, to even have a better command of the strike zone. Show had some really bright spots for us last year. I can see her maturing on the mound and growing in her poise and presence. Harrington is continuing to refine her pitches and she has certainly shown that she has what it takes. Payton McBride gave us some really quality innings and we wouldn’t have been where we were without her. Lexi Smith, as well, and we return all of those pitchers. We have a deep pitching staff.”
On the offensive side of the ball, 2016 all-American Tori Vidales and Keeli Milligan are two players that Evans expects to lead her team’s batting order. “Vidales is very key for us,” Evans said. “Milligan has really had a great fall. She’s as quick as she has ever been and looks very good at the plate. She’s been a spark plug for us. [Kaitlyn] Alderink is so steady and is one of those players who is always on base… [Riley] Sartain had a breakout year last year and hit the long ball for us.”
“A player that I’ve seen breaking through this fall is [Sarah] Hudek,” Evans told us of the former converted baseball pitcher who joined the Aggies as a freshman outfielder in 2017. “She is stroking the ball very well.”
When asked to describe how she would describe a successful 2018 season, Evans was thoughtful. “It can’t just be about the WCWS, or you miss all the qualities of things that happen in the season that make it the season it is,” she said. “For it to be a success, I think it would be my team getting itself to the point where the players run the team. I show up and I put in that lineup and our players put in and understand what it takes and what they need to do… Obviously, our expectation is to be playing in the WCWS and make a run. We think that we have the talent to do that and we understand that lots of things have to fall into place. That’s my expectation. If that didn’t happen, I still won’t feel like we didn’t have a successful season if we play fearlessly. If we play at all times to win. If we play with great confidence. Those are the things that I expect. It will not be a successful season if our ball club is looking over its shoulder and worrying about getting back to the WCWS and being worried about having anxiety about that expectation.”Insurance.

Rosberg is becoming something of a master in second practice, although the fact that his car seemed to run out of fuel on his last lap of the day shows how light he was running.
His teammate Kazuki Nakajima might have been similarly low on gas, finishing the day in second, marginally ahead of Renault’s fast-improving car at the hands of Fernando Alonso.
All three set quicker lap times than Button’s morning run, however, which basically means no one outside of the teams themselves has any real idea who’s got proper pace for qualifying tomorrow.
All we do know is that the teams are carrying huge updates, and none more so than BMW, who have revised their car so heavily that it looks like an all-new machine.
It’s not however carrying a ‘B’ suffix to it’s F1.09 moniker – would that be admitting a weakness about the previous car?
Their upgrades appear to be paying dividends too, with both Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld setting times fast enough for third and fourth respectively in the morning.
They ran slower and so finished lower down the field in the afternoon, although if they’d kept their morning pace that would still only have been good enough for eighth and 13th in the second session.
Even though Kimi Raikkonen managed to claw into the top ten after lunch, Ferrari – and McLaren – appear to still be struggling for pace.
Of course, this could all change come tomorrow, as we don’t know what test programs they’re running, but Lewis Hamilton, when asked how the modifications worked today, simply replied: “They didn’t.” It’s not going well for big Macca then.
In a turn of events very nearly as surprising as that scene at the end of Fight Club, Nelson Piquet actually went well in both sessions, Renault allowing him to run lighter fuel loads in order to improve his qualifying performance.
This didn’t stop Nelsinho spearing off into the gravel in session two however, only to make it back to the garage, get his car sorted, head out of the pits… and straight off the circuit again on his next flying lap. Oops.
As much as it used to amuse me how rubbish he is, I’m actually now starting to feel sorry for him. Surely he’s not long for the F1 world is he?Punching Back

Revolution’s products were voted best in all three flower categories, as well as best among pre-rolls, concentrates, and vape pens. Toffee Chocolate bar manufactured by Bhang was named best in the cup’s edibles category, where Revolution placed third.
The High Times Cannabis Cup usually features a panel of expert and celebrity judges in the process of naming the best weed strains and products. However, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the largely-virtual event this year featured the general public in its selection of the finest weed products in Illinois.
A limited number of testing kits were available for purchase throughout the state, while enthusiasts, most of which have been facing limited options to pass time amid the pandemic, lined up in front of dispensaries for a chance to snatch one of the kits and participate in the judging process.
The testing kits cost between $80 and $300 dollars for the September 27 event, while up to 220 judges were allowed to participate in the voting for each category.
Dustin Shroyer, chief operating officer at Revolution Brands, said he was “blown away” by the results of the Cannabis Cup.
“Our staff’s heart and passion is second to none in the industry,” he added.
“Humbled is an understatement. Everything we do, we do it for you – to receive this kind of appreciation means the world to us,” Revolution shared on Twitter following the results.
Meanwhile, Vice president of content for High Times Jon Cappetta said that although one brand has never quite swept the competition as Revolution Brands did this year, the company’s big win “speaks to the quality of the product.”
Revolution Brands’ Florida Orange strain was named Best Indica Flower, while the brand’s Gorilla’d Cheese won in the category of Best Hybrid Flower.

Remember.
Then we’ll visit a museum exhibit that features one of the most important documents of the 19th century. And we’ll spend an Academic Minute trying to find out if resistance really is futile.That an Humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, That she will be graciously pleased to give directions that there be laid before this House a Return of the Report from Right Honourable Sir David Hirst, Chairman of the Spoliation Advisory Panel, dated 15 December 2010, in respect of an oil sketch by Sir Peter Paul Rubens, The Coronation of the Virgin, now in the possession of the Samuel Courtauld Trust.- ( Angela Watkinson .)
1. Mr Gregory Campbell (East Londonderry) (DUP): What recent discussions he has had on steps to deal with the past in Northern Ireland. [29910]
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr Owen Paterson): My hon. Friend the Minister of State and I have met with political parties, community organisations, academics and victims groups from across the community to discuss dealing with the past. We will continue to listen to the views of people in Northern Ireland to find a way forward on this sensitive and contentious issue.
Mr Campbell: The Secretary of State made a commitment, which he repeated several times, that there would be no more costly, open-ended inquiries. Any decision by him to hold a further, restricted inquiry-for example, into the Pat Finucane incident-would be opposed on the one hand by nationalists and republicans, but regarded by others as a prerequisite for long-standing grievances, against the Irish Republic's Government, for example, to be inquired into. Is it not more sensible and consistent for the Secretary of State to say, "We've reached the end of the inquiry road"?
Mr Paterson:
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his question. He is quite right: our stated policy is that we do not want to see any more costly and open-ended inquiries. However, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said during the debate on the Saville statement that we would look at individual cases. Our position on
the Finucane case-a contentious case, as the hon. Gentleman knows-was laid out clearly in my written ministerial statement on 11 November.
Peter Bottomley (Worthing West) (Con): At the risk of broadening the question from the previous exchange, let me say to the Secretary of State that coming to terms with history is the responsibility of us all. Those who are British, those who are Irish and those who are both welcome the progress that has been made over the past few years and recognise that many have contributed to it.
Mr Paterson: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We want to bring as broad a range of people as possible into the process of negotiation, so that when we arrive at a means of going forward, as many people as possible have bought into it.
Paul Goggins (Wythenshawe and Sale East) (Lab): The Secretary of State will know that the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland is in the process of reopening a large number of historical inquests, which will place significant additional financial burdens on the Courts Service and the police service. Given the Government's responsibilities in relation to the past, how does the Secretary of State intend to approach the sharing of those costs?
Mr Paterson: The right hon. Gentleman played a key role in seeing those powers devolved. He will know that the administration of inquests is a devolved matter that is entirely in the hands of the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland. It would not be for us to interfere in the mechanics and financing of his Department, which are entirely down to the local Executive.
Mr Shaun Woodward (St Helens South and Whiston) (Lab): Given the commitments by the British and Irish Governments at Weston Park, and the commitment by those Governments to an inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane, does the Secretary of State recognise that it would be unwise for the British Government to act unilaterally?
Mr Paterson: The right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that this is not an easy case, as he had three years to resolve the matter, as the real Secretary of State. He effectively ended up with a Mexican stand-off, where the family wanted one thing and he wanted them to have an inquiry, as I understand it, under the Inquiries Act 2005. He knows that this is not an easy matter to resolve, and that is why I had a helpful meeting with Mrs Finucane and her son. I laid out the process that we intend to follow in my written ministerial statement of 11 November.
Mr Woodward: The right hon. Gentleman will know that I have also met with Geraldine Finucane. I pay tribute to the way in which she has conducted herself, as I know he has too. However, notwithstanding his remarks about future inquiries, now that he is the real Secretary of State-as he described it-is he beginning to understand the damage that could be done to community support for the devolved institutions and to the British Government if he were to renege on existing undertakings, made by a previous Government and supported by his party in opposition, to independently investigate the past?
Mr Paterson: I cannot fail to point out that the right hon. Gentleman did not meet Mrs Finucane when he was the Secretary of State. I wrote to her in June, and I had a meeting in November, which was the time that the family chose, and we had a very sensible discussion. He knows that this is not an easy issue to resolve, and I laid out very clearly in the written ministerial statement that a number of issues have to be considered. We are quite open-minded about this, and we are determined to try to find a resolution that is satisfactory to all sides.
2. Bill Esterson (Sefton Central) (Lab): What recent assessment he has made of the likely effect of proposed changes to public expenditure in Northern Ireland on policing the threat to security from dissident groups. [29911]
3. Gregg McClymont (Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East) (Lab): what discussions he has had with the Northern Ireland Executive on the likely effect of proposed changes to public expenditure in Northern Ireland on policing the threat to security from dissident groups. [29912]
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr Owen Paterson): I meet the Justice Minister regularly to discuss the policing of the terrorist threat and related expenditure. I welcome the publication this morning of the Northern Ireland Executive's draft budget, with its significant allocation to the Department of Justice. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that this Government will ensure that adequate resources are available to meet the threat.
Bill Esterson: Does the Secretary of State understand the very real public concern, not just in Northern Ireland but elsewhere in the United Kingdom, about any cuts in front-line policing in Northern Ireland and the impact that they would have on security and public safety?
Mr Paterson: I am fully aware of the concern that the small number of terrorists presents. That is why the Government have made a fair settlement on the Executive, and I am very pleased today that they have agreed a draft budget with a substantial allocation to the Police Service of Northern Ireland. We have made it absolutely clear that, should the security position deteriorate, we will be open to further discussions with the Executive, as was agreed by the previous Government.
Gregg McClymont: The Minister will be aware that the issue of fleet renewal is causing considerable concern. Will he support any request for additional funds from the PSNI to meet the case for fleet renewal?
Mr Paterson: I think that I alluded to that a second ago. We are quite clear that, should the security position deteriorate, and should a good case be made by the Justice Minister and the Chief Constable-one of whom I talked to this morning; I spoke to the other yesterday-we will be prepared to consider going to the contingency reserve for extra funds in order to bear down on the terrorist threat.
Mr Laurence Robertson (Tewkesbury) (Con): Can the Secretary of State confirm that, if the situation were, regrettably, to get worse in Northern Ireland, either immediately or over the course of the next few years, those extra resources would come from the UK Government, rather than from the money already allocated to Northern Ireland?
Mr Paterson: We are absolutely clear about that. It was part of the settlement made by the previous Government that, should there be a deterioration in the security position in Northern Ireland, the Government of the United Kingdom would be prepared to accept a bid, on security grounds, for resources from the contingency reserve. I repeat that emphatically today. I said that to the Justice Minister when I spoke to him this morning.
Mr Nigel Dodds (Belfast North) (DUP): In view of the recent revelations on the WikiLeaks website-which were confirmed by the former Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern-that Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams had prior knowledge of the Northern bank robbery in 2003, can the Secretary of State confirm that co-operation will take place between the Garda and the PSNI, that a full investigation will take place, that no stone will be left unturned, and that the Historical Enquiries Team will be allowed to pursue this matter in the way that it is pursuing other cases in Northern Ireland?
Mr Paterson: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his question. I think that the answer was well put by the party leader at the British-Irish Council in the Isle of Man earlier this week. We are quite clear that those who have a past can explain for themselves. For the present, however, we are content for those who adhere to the Mitchell principles and pursue their legitimate political aims by peaceful democratic means to play a part in the process. The other issues that the right hon. Gentleman raised are matters of law and order; they are matters not for elected Members but for the police and the prosecuting authorities.
Mr Dodds: I am grateful for that answer, as far as it goes. Of course, no one in the Chamber today was at the BIC meeting in the Isle of Man, so I would be grateful if the Secretary of State could elaborate on that point. Will he also make it clear that any resources that the Historical Enquiries Team needs to pursue these particular allegations will be forthcoming, and that the community in Northern Ireland can be assured of an equality of pursuit of allegations in Northern Ireland against dissident republicans and mainstream republicans if they were involved in terrorist activities, such as have been alleged not just by WikiLeaks but by the former Irish Prime Minister?
Mr Paterson: We are strong supporters of the work of the Historical Enquiries Team, who are looking at every one of the 3,268 deaths over the course of the troubles, and we are satisfied that they are absolutely colour-blind in approaching every one of these dreadful incidents. They have also been accredited with neutrality by European institutions, and we are happy that they should pursue their work, which is in the hands of the devolved Administration and financed locally. The Prime Minister and I have been on the record on many occasions, supporting the neutral work of the HET, because we know it does bring significant satisfaction to the families who have so far received reports.
David Simpson (Upper Bann) (DUP): The Secretary of State will be aware that it has been announced that individuals from my constituency will stand trial next year for the murder of the soldiers in Antrim. Does the Secretary of State agree with me that the full rigour of the law needs to be applied and that the sentencing needs to fit the crime?
Mr Paterson: I think that is a sub judice issue. We support the rule of law and it should be pursued by the legitimate people in authority in the legal sphere and the judicial sphere. It is not for us as elected politicians to interfere.
Stephen Pound (Ealing North) (Lab): I am grateful to the real Secretary of State for the comments he made earlier, but members of the PSNI tell me that two of their principal anxieties are the dissident threat and, obviously, financial uncertainty. On 10 November, the Secretary of State said that should the situation become worse, the PSNI would
"have the right to approach the Government"-[ Official Report, 10 November 2010; Vol. 518, c. 276.]
-something which I think we all have. Today, he has gone a little bit further. Will he today stand four-square with the PSNI and say that, should the situation become more grave-which we hope it will not-he will support the PSNI in an application to the contingency reserve?
Mr Paterson: I welcome the hon. Gentleman to his new role. I will say emphatically, for the third time during this Question Time-and I said it to the Chief Constable yesterday and to the Justice Minister this morning-that should the security position in Northern Ireland deteriorate, we will adhere to the arrangements, which we have conceded were fixed by the previous Government, that given a deteriorating security position, the Justice Minister and the Chief Constable can come to the UK Government with a security case for funds from the contingency reserve.
4. Mr Jeffrey M. Donaldson (Lagan Valley) (DUP): What discussions he has had with the Irish Government on arrangements for the proposed visit by Her Majesty the Queen to the Irish Republic. [29913]
The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr Hugo Swire): Responsibility for any visit by Her Majesty the Queen lies with my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with Buckingham Palace. I know that the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, and the President, Mary McAleese, have expressed their support for a visit by Her Majesty and I very much hope that such a visit will be possible.
Mr Donaldson: In light of the debate that will take place in this House this afternoon and the valuable assistance that we are providing to the Republic of Ireland in its time of need, is it not past time that we had a visit by the sovereign to the Republic of Ireland? After all, the President of the Republic of Ireland has visited the United Kingdom on many occasions and I think it is time now for a degree of maturity and for this issue to be addressed.
Mr Swire: I completely agree with the right hon. Gentleman. There has been no formal invitation yet, but he is absolutely right to draw attention to the matter. The UK and Ireland have an entwined relationship: 870,000 Irish-born people live here in the UK and over 90,000 UK citizens live in Ireland, and I hope they will join us in hoping that this visit can go ahead.
Mel Stride (Central Devon) (Con): Does my hon. Friend have any concerns about security issues in respect of the Queen's proposed visit to the Irish Republic?
Mr Swire: I do not think it would be very responsible of me to comment on that, save to say that we work extremely closely with the Garda, they work extremely closely with the PSNI and I have complete faith that they would be able to see that a visit of that sort went off without any trouble whatsoever.
5. Mr Stephen Hepburn (Jarrow) (Lab): What recent discussions he has had with the Northern Ireland Executive on future provision of prisons in Northern Ireland. [29914]
The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr Hugo Swire): The provision of prisons is now entirely a matter for the devolved Administration. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's statement to the House of 4 November outlined the discussions he has had with Justice Minister David Ford on the recommendations in the Billy Wright inquiry report.
Mr Hepburn: Will the Government's spending decisions have any impact on potential new capital projects such as Magilligan prison and the new police training college?
Mr Swire: The hon. Gentleman raises a good point. As we have said before in the House, we are committed to standing by the terms of the policing and justice financial settlement, which will enable the Executive to come to their own view about new capital expenditure, including on Magilligan prison, and we are closer to that with the announcement of the draft budget today, in respect of which we are very grateful to all the parties.
Jim Shannon (Strangford) (DUP): In the last couple of days the Prison Service has received some adverse publicity from certain sections of the Northern Ireland media. The Prison Officers Association has stated that it accepts that some degree of change is needed. What discussions has the Minister had with the POA to bring the service forward and to get a balance, which is clearly what we need?
Mr Swire: I have, of course, followed those comments and seen the various interviews with the Justice Minister, David Ford. These are devolved matters: prisons are the responsibility of the Department of Justice. We follow these matters closely, but they are best left to those properly in charge of them.
6. Mark Reckless (Rochester and Strood) (Con): What assessment his Department has made of assets held by the Republic of Ireland's National Asset Management Agency in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement. [29915]
The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr Hugo Swire): We are not in a position to make a detailed assessment of these assets. The Northern Ireland Executive are in touch with the authorities in Dublin and NAMA's Northern Ireland Advisory Committee, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State raised Northern Ireland interests in relation to NAMA with the Taoiseach on Monday.
Mark Reckless: Given the difficulty NAMA is having in managing these assets and the Republic's already over-indebted situation, would it not make sense for us to take some of those assets off its hands, as consideration for financial support we may give?
Mr Swire: My hon. Friend will have an opportunity to make those and other points in the debate on the Loans to Ireland Bill-no doubt he will wish to take part in that. I think he should be proud of what we are doing, however. We are now part of the solution rather than the problem, and we believe it is right that we, as a country that has so much trade with the Republic of Ireland, should come to its support at this time, with no conditions.
Mark Durkan (Foyle) (SDLP): The Minister has indicated that the Northern Ireland Office is not in a position to make an assessment. Does he believe that the Treasury is in a position to make an assessment, and has it done so?
Mr Swire: That is a good question. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury has said that discussions continue with the Government in Dublin about NAMA and the way forward, so they are clearly in regular discussions. Again, no doubt my hon. Friend will inform the House about that in the debate this afternoon, and discuss it with those who wish to take part in that debate.
7. Dr Alasdair McDonnell (Belfast South) (SDLP): What discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Transport and the Northern Ireland Executive on the development of an air transport strategy for Northern Ireland. [29916]
The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr Hugo Swire): The Government fully recognise the importance to Northern Ireland of a suitable framework for air travel, particularly for the economy and export trade. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I will continue to engage with colleagues in Government and the Northern Ireland Executive as the new aviation policy framework is developed in the new year.
Dr McDonnell:
I thank the Minister for his answer, and endorse the point he makes about an air transport strategy and framework being essential to our economic recovery, particularly in respect of tourism. [Interruption.]
Can he assure me, however, that he will do all in his power to work with those responsible-both the Secretary of State for Transport and the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland-to ensure that we get a functioning strategy that provides air links to Europe, Canada and the United States? [Interruption.]
Mr Speaker: Order. I wish to hear the Minister's reply, and I am sure the House wants to hear it as well.
Mr Swire: I am most grateful to you, Mr Speaker.
The hon. Gentleman is right, and I know he represents his constituents well in these matters. A balance has to be struck between extending the amount of flights that are available and the environmental consequences of doing that. I should declare that I have had meetings with Flybe, which operates out of Belfast City, and which is based in my constituency. It does an excellent job, and I know it is always looking for new routes. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: in order to grow tourism and exports, which we have to do to rebalance Northern Ireland's economy, we have to make sure that we have transport links that are as good as any other part of the United Kingdom.
8. Robert Halfon (Harlow) (Con): What recent discussions he has had on the threat to security in Northern Ireland from residual terrorist groups. [29917]
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr Owen Paterson): I meet regularly with my security advisers and David Ford to discuss the terrorist threat in Northern Ireland. The threat level in Northern Ireland stands at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. So far this year there have been 206 arrests, both in Northern Ireland and the Republic, for acts of terrorism and serious criminal incidents related to terrorism.
Robert Halfon: I thank my right hon. Friend for his reply. How is he working with the Republic of Ireland to facilitate the cross-border strategy for dealing with dissident violence?
Mr Paterson: I am very grateful for that question. Co-operation with the Republic of Ireland on this issue is at an unprecedented level. I pay tribute to the outgoing commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, who has done a tremendous job, and I am delighted that Martin Callinan has been appointed as his successor. [ Interruption. ] A symbol of that was the cross-border strategy announced this week, showing the unprecedented collaboration between the PSNI and the Garda. [ Interruption. ]
Mr Speaker: Order. There are far too many noisy private conversations taking place in the Chamber. I call the Rev. William McCrea.
Dr William McCrea (South Antrim) (DUP): Thank you, Mr Speaker. In the discussions held concerning the serious threat from republican dissidents, has the issue of police manpower been raised? Has due consideration been given to the representation made by the Police Federation concerning police numbers, especially the police reserve, and in light of the relevant extra financial resources that would be necessary?
Mr Paterson: I am delighted to see the hon. Gentleman back in his place following his illness, as always asking pertinent questions. He will know that police levels in Northern Ireland are the highest in the United Kingdom at 4.2 per 1,000. The numbers of police are for the Chief Constable to decide-it is an operational matter-but as I have said on several occasions already in this Session, we will stand by Northern Ireland and if the Chief Constable and the Justice Minister make a good security case, we will consider access to the contingency fund.
9. Mr Philip Hollobone (Kettering) (Con): What recent assessment he has made of the effects on the Northern Ireland economy of recent financial developments in the Republic of Ireland. [29918]
The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr Hugo Swire): We are concerned about the risk that the current economic difficulties in the Republic of Ireland might have on Northern Ireland. We will continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive on these issues. The Financial Secretary and the Secretary of State met the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on 24 November to discuss these matters.
Mr Hollobone: What steps can my hon. Friend the Minister take to do his best to protect the Northern Ireland economy from the worst effects of the financial crisis in the south?
Mr Swire: As I said before, we should be proud of being part of the solution, rather than the problem, and it is right to stress the interdependence of the two economies. Ireland accounts for 5% of the UK's total exports. We export more to Ireland than to Brazil, Russia, India and China together, and it is incredibly important-40% of Northern Ireland's exports go there as well. So a healthy economy in Dublin is important to a healthy economy in Belfast.
10. Steve Rotheram (Liverpool, Walton) (Lab): What recent discussions he has had with the Northern Ireland Executive on the provision of resources to the Police Service of Northern Ireland to address security threats from dissident activity. [29919]
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr Owen Paterson): PSNI resources are primarily a matter for the devolved Administration. I am delighted that the Executive have agreed a draft budget. This Government will work to support the PSNI where exceptional security pressures exist.
Steve Rotheram: Can the Secretary of State tell the House whether he has given the Chief Constable of the PSNI a specific assurance that he will continue to have access to additional funds from the reserve, so that vital community-based policing does not suffer from a lack of resource?
Mr Paterson:
I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his question. Of course, in Northern Ireland, community policing is an absolutely vital part of moving the process
forward. The Chief Constable has been allocated significant resources in the draft budget today, and it is up to him how to apportion those significant sums of money.
11. Jack Lopresti (Filton and Bradley Stoke) (Con): What plans he has to make Northern Ireland an enterprise zone. [29920]
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr Owen Paterson): My hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary is writing to the Northern Ireland Executive this week with a draft consultation paper on rebalancing the Northern Ireland economy. He and I will be meeting Executive Ministers in the new year to discuss the paper before publishing it for consultation.
Jack Lopresti: Does my right hon. Friend agree that Northern Ireland's high dependence on the public sector is simply untenable, and that it is more important than ever that private sector innovation be promoted in the Province, in order to rebalance the Northern Ireland economy?
Mr Paterson: My hon. Friend is absolutely right on this, and I am very pleased to see his continued interest in Northern Ireland matters. We have been saying for three years now that an economy that depends for 77.6% of its GDP on state spending is wholly unsustainable. It will need rebalancing. That will take time. To do nothing is irresponsible; to move too fast is irresponsible, and I estimate that it will take, probably, 25 years. This week, we will be sending a paper to the Executive for discussion, looking at ways of turning the whole of Northern Ireland into an enterprise zone.
Q1. [30541] Heidi Alexander (Lewisham East) (Lab): If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 15 December.
The Prime Minister (Mr David Cameron): This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others, and, in addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
Heidi Alexander: Time and time again, the Prime Minister has said that he wants to protect the poorest and most vulnerable while reducing the budget deficit, so can he explain to me and to residents of my Lewisham East constituency why he is heaping huge cuts on local councils, which tend to spend half their overall budget on child protection, care for the elderly and services for the disabled?
The Prime Minister:
Let me tell the hon. Lady what we are doing in Lewisham to protect the most vulnerable. The per pupil funding in our schools in Lewisham will be maintained at £6,951 per pupil-that is the 10th highest
in the country, recognising the level of deprivation. On top of that, for the first time in our history we will be adding a pupil premium of £430 per child. That is an excellent policy.
Q2. [30542] Mark Reckless (Rochester and Strood) (Con): The BBC reports that the German Finance Minister wants to set an interest rate to punish Ireland. Will the Prime Minister confirm that this country wants to help Ireland?
The Prime Minister: My right hon.. If we had listened to the Labour party, we would still be in a hole.
Edward Miliband (Doncaster North) (Lab): May I start by paying tribute to our troops serving in Afghanistan? We owe them a huge debt of gratitude for everything that they are doing for us, and our thoughts will be with them and with their families, who will be apart from them at this time of year.
Does the Prime Minister recognise the concern that there will be about the rise in unemployment of 35,000 that we saw this morning? Does he understand that for all those families around the country, his confidence and indeed his restatement today that Britain "is out of the danger zone" will seem very hollow?
The Prime Minister: First, let me join the right hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to our forces in Afghanistan, whom I visited last week, and to all their families, who will be missing them at Christmas time. To be fair, under the Government of whom he was a part and under this Government we are making big improvements on their contact home-on fax time, telephone time and all the contact that they need-and that is absolutely right.
On the unemployment figures, of course everyone should be concerned-and I am concerned-by a rise in unemployment. When anyone loses a job it is a tragedy for that person, and we must do everything we can to help people into work. With the Work programme we will be launching the biggest back-to-work programme in this country for 70 years. To be accurate, although part of the figures are disappointing, they are mixed because we see that the claimant count has come down in the unemployment figures and we are also seeing an increase in the number of vacancies in our economy-every day there are another 10,000 vacancies. So, yes, we have to get the private sector going and increase the number of jobs available. Over the past six months, we have seen 300,000 new private sector jobs. We need more of them, and keeping our economy out of the danger zone is the way to get them.
Edward Miliband: The Prime Minister slightly sounds as though he paints himself as an innocent bystander in relation to the unemployment figures. He should not be pressing ahead with a rise in VAT on 4 January and £20 billion of public spending cuts.
I want to turn to another aspect of the Prime Minister's financial plans. Can he confirm that the Government are now set to break the promise made in the coalition agreement:
"We will guarantee that health spending increases in real terms in each year of the Parliament"?
The Prime Minister: Being a bystander would mean having no plans to deal with our economic problems. This Government are cutting corporation tax, abolishing Labour's jobs tax, reducing national insurance and increasing our jobs programme. No one should be complacent; complacency is having no answers. No one should be complacent, but we do see retail sales up, exports up, manufacturing up, interest rates coming down since the election and growth higher than expected. I am not in the slightest bit complacent about what we need to do, but let us not talk down the performance of our economy.
Turning to the NHS, we have increased the NHS budget by £10 billion in this Parliament. I must say to the right hon. Gentleman that only one party stood at the election on saving the NHS and its spending and that was this party right here. I am confident that we will fulfil our goal of real-terms increases every year in the NHS.
Edward Miliband: It is very interesting that the right hon. Gentleman says that he is confident. He should listen to what the Conservative-led Health Committee said only on Monday. It said that with inflation now higher,
"the Government's commitment to a real terms increase in health funding...will not be met."
We all remember those posters during the election and we all remember his face, airbrushed, on those posters. Will he now admit that he is breaking that promise?
The Prime Minister: We are not breaking that promise. We want to see NHS spending increase by more than inflation every year. Let me be clear about who supports this policy. The shadow Chancellor-this is not vague, but pretty clear-said, when asked whether it is right to protect NHS spending:
"There is no logic, sense or rationality to it at all."
Let us be clear: on this side of the House, we want real-terms increases in health spending to ensure that we improve the health of our nation; the Opposition are committed to cutting the NHS.
Edward Miliband: I know that the right hon. Gentleman is good at the broad brush, that he is good at the airbrush and that he does not do detail, but he should read the report, which says that health service spending will be cut next year in real terms.
Let me turn to his next broken promise on the NHS. He pledged, and the coalition agreement says:
"We will stop the top-down reorganisations of the NHS that have got in the way of patient care",
but that is exactly what the Government are forcing on the health service. Fewer than one in four doctors think that it will improve patient services and independent experts say that it will cost £3 billion. After six months, is not an old truth being confirmed? When it comes to the NHS, you cannot trust the Tories.
The Prime Minister: There are moments when I think I am up against Basil Brush. When it comes to protecting the NHS, only one side of this House is committed to protecting NHS spending and that is this side.
Now we come on to reforming the NHS. We are not reorganising the bureaucracy of the NHS; we are cutting and abolishing it. Because we are making a 45% saving in the bureaucracy of the NHS, that will save £1.9 billion. Because we are increasing the spending on the NHS, that money will go into hospitals, beds, nurses and doctors. All those things would be cut if it was up to the Opposition because they do not have a commitment to maintaining NHS spending.
Edward Miliband: The Prime Minister is breaking his promise and he does not want to admit it. What does he want to do? He wants to leave it to the back end of the pantomime horse, the Deputy Prime Minister, to break the promises. It is time that the front end of the pantomime horse took some responsibility.
I want to ask the Prime Minister about another broken promise, on the education maintenance allowances. Why does he not go a couple of miles away from here-I know that he does not talk to students, or only to those in China-to Southwark college and talk to the students and teachers there? The business teacher there wrote to me and said- [ Interruption. ] I would have thought that Government Members would want to listen to the fate of students and young people up and down this country. The teacher said:
"I see the benefits that the EMA provides for many of my learners. I see how they struggle to pay for transport...books and other essentials. How can we expect them to aspire to a better life if we deny them the means?"
The Prime Minister: The right hon. Gentleman wants to talk pantomime. I am afraid it will not be long before he is thinking, "Look behind you!"
The problem with the education maintenance allowance is that research shows that 90% of those who receive it would stay on at school anyway. As we are raising the school participation age to 18, it is right that we replace the education maintenance allowance with something that is better targeted. The right hon. Gentleman has to look at the bigger picture, which is that we inherited a completely wrecked set of public finances. His questions are always about this cut or that cut; we know which cuts he is against, but he has not made one single suggestion about how to dig the country out of the pit of debt that he left us in.
Edward Miliband: The truth is that the right hon. Gentleman began the year making promises and now he is breaking them. The promise on NHS spending-broken; the promise on the education maintenance allowance-broken; the promise on universal child benefit-broken; the promise on knife crime-broken; and the promise on new politics-broken. Should not his new year's resolution for 2011 be to keep the promises he made in 2010?
The Prime Minister: It can be put quite simply: Labour started the year with a leader who was dithering and had no answers on the economy and it has ended the year with a leader who is dithering and has no answers on the economy. I suppose, in Labour terms, that is what passes for progress.
Q3. [30543] Iain Stewart (Milton Keynes South) (Con): The Bletchley Park Trust in my constituency hopes to buy for the nation the personal papers of Alan Turing, the heroic wartime code breaker. It is confident of raising the funds to buy the papers, but there is a danger that the auction might take place before it has the chance to do so. Will my right hon. Friend do all he can to give Bletchley Park a fair chance to secure those important documents for the nation?
The Prime Minister: I would certainly like to do that, because I think my hon. Friend is entirely right-Alan Turing was a remarkable man. Many of the people who worked on cracking the enigma code at Bletchley Park during the war are still alive and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude. They made a decisive difference in winning the second world war and we should praise all of them. Of course I hope that private donors will generously support the fundraising campaign and I am very happy to work with my hon. Friend and do anything I can to make that happen.
Joan Ruddock (Lewisham, Deptford) (Lab): Earlier, the Prime Minister expressed concern about unemployment. Unemployment in his constituency is 1.5% whereas in my constituency it is 7.3%. A full Jobcentre Plus service is available in Witney, but he has decided to close down the Deptford jobcentre. That cannot meet any test of fairness, so will he personally review that disastrous decision?
The Prime Minister: I will very happily look at the distribution of jobcentres, but the fact is that, through local government and other spending, we put a lot more money into deprived areas in our country. [ Interruption. ] Yes, we do. I had a little check before coming to Question Time and if we look at what is happening to grant changes-for instance, comparing my constituency with that of the right hon. Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband)-the cut in grant in my constituency is 27% greater than in his. I simply do not accept that the Government are not being fair and helping those who need help the most.
Q4. [30544] Nadhim Zahawi (Stratford-on-Avon) (Con): All of us in the Chamber will have had tragic cases of late diagnoses of cervical and breast cancer in our constituencies-cancers that should and can be survived. The Prime Minister promised to do more when he was in opposition. Now that we are in government, what is he doing about the unacceptably low survival rates?
The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely right to raise this issue. The first thing we did was to make good on our promise of a cancer drugs fund. We put money into that fund so that thousands of people who were without the drugs they needed can now get them. We want to see further improvements on cancer screening and much more focus on cancer outcomes, and unlike the Labour party we are prepared to put the money in to make sure it happens.
John McDonnell (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):
According to the latest statistics, children of asylum seekers have been placed in detention centres on 665 occasions in the past year, which means that it is highly likely that there will be children in our detention
centres this Christmas. This is not a party-political point. May I ask the Prime Minister, on behalf of the whole House, to give a commitment that by next Christmas, in 2012, there will be no children of asylum seekers in detention centres, and that there never will be again?
The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman has made an important point. In our coalition agreement we made a commitment to address the issue, and the Deputy Prime Minister will make a statement tomorrow about how we will end this scandal.
Q5. [30545] Mr Edward Leigh (Gainsborough) (Con): As naval aviation celebrates its centenary, will my right hon. Friend guarantee that the promised transfer of 20 Merlin helicopters from the RAF to the Fleet Air Arm will indeed take place? Otherwise critical mass may well be lost, and the first 100 years of a service that has defended us in peace and war may be the last 100 years.
The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend is absolutely right to raise that point. Of course I will look into the issue of the Merlin transfer. However, we should be clear about the fact that Britain will still have the fourth largest defence budget anywhere in the world. The Navy will have seven Astute class submarines, 19 destroyers and frigates, 14 minesweepers and other vessels, the Royal Marines-obviously-and our nuclear deterrent. We will have a large and fit-for-purpose Navy of which the country can rightly be proud.
Mr David Lammy (Tottenham) (Lab): The Prime Minister will be aware that there are two great football clubs in north London, Tottenham Hotspur and Enfield Town. He will also be aware that Spurs are considering moving across London to the east end-to the Olympic park. Will he join me, and the Spurs fans who signed a petition entitled "Say NO to 'Stratford Hotspur'", in urging the Spurs chairman to put the club and its history before shareholder value?
The Prime Minister: My recent experience has taught me to stay out of international football management. While paying tribute to the right hon. Gentleman's club, to Enfield Town and, of course, to Arsenal as well-I think it right to do that-I will let the club make the decision. However, it is true to say that on the Olympic site there will be a fantastic stadium of which I hope one football club will take advantage.
Q6. [30546] Malcolm Bruce (Gordon) (LD): Will the Prime Minister join me in thanking and expressing appreciation to the postal service workers across the United Kingdom-including those whom I visited in Inverurie, Dyce and Ellen-who are struggling through snow and ice to make their deliveries? Does he agree that the mail order firms that are cancelling Christmas in Scotland by refusing to accept orders should recognise that they cannot and do not match the universal postal service, and that for that reason it should be secured and protected?
The Prime Minister:
The right hon. Gentleman has made an extremely good point. I am sure that all Members in all parts of the House-many of whom will take the opportunity to visit sorting offices this Christmas-will want to record our support and thanks for the very good work that postal workers do throughout the country in ensuring that everything is delivered in
time for Christmas. I know that they are having a particularly difficult time in Scotland. Additional air and rail services have been laid on to speed the movement of mail in and out of Scotland, and Royal Mail itself has made a big investment-of £20 million-to try to deal with the most severe weather that it has faced for 30 years.
Again, let us all pay tribute to those who will ensure that cards and presents are delivered on time.
Q7. [30547] Mr David Hamilton (Midlothian) (Lab): The right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce) is right. The situation has been horrendous in Scotland, and indeed in the north of England. The only people who are delivering are those in Royal Mail, as the private companies have offloaded their commitments on to it. The £20 million invested by Royal Mail is important. Will the Prime Minister give a straight answer to this question? Will he guarantee that universal service, and will he and his friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is sitting next to him, review Royal Mail's privatisation and step back from it?
The Prime Minister: The whole point of trying to get private capital and management involved in Royal Mail is to make the service better, and to ensure that it can go on doing all the things that we want it to do. Opposition Members-including the Leader of the Opposition-shake their heads, but the fact is that they were going to present plans in the last Parliament, because even they realised that this needs to be done.
Mary Macleod (Brentford and Isleworth) (Con): Will the Prime Minister join me in paying tribute to the service of the Gurkhas and, especially, to my Chiswick constituent, Havildar Lachhiman Gurung, who died on 12 December aged 92? He won the Victoria cross while serving with the Gurkha Rifles in Burma in 1945, where he demonstrated
"outstanding gallantry and extreme devotion to duty, in the face of almost overwhelming odds".
The Prime Minister: I certainly join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to the Gurkhas both past and present. Anyone who goes to Afghanistan and sees how many Gurkhas there are not just in the Gurkha Rifles but in some of the logistic regiments, serving our country extremely well, will know that we owe them the greatest debt of gratitude, and we must always make sure that it is paid in full.
Q8. [30548] Mr Ronnie Campbell (Blyth Valley) (Lab): This has been a momentous week, with the trebling of tuition fees for students and the average decrease of 10% in grants for local councils. We have also been told this week that the Chancellor has to build up a war chest of £50 billion just in time for the general election-paid for by working people and their families. [ Interruption. ] That is right; that is the question.
The Prime Minister: I am not quite sure what the question is. Let me just answer the point about fees by putting this point on the record. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has looked carefully at our plans, and it finds:
."
I say to the Opposition, including the hon. Gentleman, if they want a progressive system for tuition fee reform, that is what we offer. In terms of dealing with the deficit, it is absolutely vital that we get on top of it. That is good for everyone in this country, his constituents included.
Q9. [30549] Miss Anne McIntosh (Thirsk and Malton) (Con): Will the Prime Minister ensure that primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and all NHS bureaucracies serve patients, not their own interests? Will he further ensure that the Secretary of State for Health intervenes to stamp out any excessive failures caused by that unnecessary bureaucracy?
The Prime Minister: I agree with my hon. Friend, but the key is to try to get rid of so much of that bureaucracy. Under the previous Government, the number of managers went up faster than the number of nurses, and our aim is to reduce that bureaucracy, get rid of that bureaucracy and put power in the hands of GPs and their patients, so that the decisions taken in our constituencies about hospitals and services are driven by the choices our constituents make, rather than by bureaucrats. That is the key to those reforms and why I hope everyone in the House will support them.
Q10. [30550] Chris Ruane (Vale of Clwyd) (Lab): Is there any truth in the rumour that tomorrow the Liberal Democrats will move the writ for the Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election for 13 January, thus denying the good people of Oldham a politician-free Christmas and new year? Is that unseemly haste over the festive season a cynical attempt by the Government to avoid the wrath of the public and especially students on tuition fees, school cuts and police cuts?
Mr Speaker: We have got the message. The Prime Minister can give an answer.
The Prime Minister: Do I gather that the Opposition are frightened of having an election? I would put the question the other way: why should the people of that constituency put up with not having a Member of Parliament, and what have you lot got to be frightened of?
Andrew Bridgen (North West Leicestershire) (Con): Will the Prime Minister outline to the House the steps that the Government are taking to cut through the legacy of red tape and bureaucracy that we inherited from the previous Government in order to deliver real value-for-money front-line services?
The Prime Minister: There is no doubt that regulation has got out of control in this country. That is why my right hon. Friend the Business Secretary is introducing a new one-in, one-out rule-so that any time the Government want to legislate or regulate they have to remove a regulation first. That sort of discipline can make a real difference.
Q11. [30551] Dr Alasdair McDonnell (Belfast South) (SDLP):
May I put on the record my appreciation, and the appreciation of many, of the goodwill and practical neighbourly support that the Prime Minister and Chancellor have shown to Ireland at this difficult time? It makes
very good sense, because the Irish economy, the Northern Ireland economy and the British economy are closely intertwined. But the economic indications are that Northern Ireland is still in decline and the economy is in serious need of a boost. May I ask the Prime Minister for his assessment of the possibility of a boost to the Northern Ireland economy by reducing corporation tax to 12.5%?
The Prime Minister: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the economy in Northern Ireland. We want to see it recover and grow, but everyone in Northern Ireland knows that the size of the state-the size of government-in Northern Ireland has become too big, and we have to see a private sector recovery. We are looking at all sorts of ideas, including the enterprise zone to which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland referred. I should also like to put on record my thanks to those Northern Irish Members who are going to support what we are doing to help the Republic of Ireland in its time of need.
Q12. [30552] Sajid Javid (Bromsgrove) (Con): The people of Bromsgrove are immensely proud of our brave servicemen and women. That is why Bromsgrove district council has decided to give the freedom of the district to the Mercian Regiment next month. Will the Prime Minister join me in congratulating the decision of the council, and does he believe that we can all do more to honour our heroes?
The Prime Minister: I certainly join my hon. Friend in doing that. Bromsgrove is absolutely right to honour the Mercian Regiment in that way. He brings out an important point. Yes, we have responsibility, as a Government and as a House of Commons, to deliver on the military covenant for our personnel in the armed services, but there is a broader responsibility on businesses, on the media, on us as individuals and on the whole country to work out what more we can do to recognise the bravery of these people who do so much on our behalf.
Q13. [30553] Hugh Bayley (York Central) (Lab): There are 1,238 students at York college who come from families poor enough to qualify for a full education maintenance allowance. That is one in three at the college. The chair of governors describes the Government's plans for EMAs as "totally unacceptable" and the replacement funding as "woefully inadequate." I know that the Prime Minister visits North Yorkshire from time to time, will he show that he cares about social mobility and that he really is a one-nation Tory by meeting people from the college to discuss-
Mr Speaker: Order. I think we have got the thrust of it.
The Prime Minister:
I absolutely accept that we have got to do more to help people to get from the very bottom to the very top. That is why we have saved the per pupil funding and why we are increasing the pupil premium. When we look at what happened over the last few years, since 2004, child poverty rose by 100,000, inequality reached the highest level since 1961, and 5 million people were stuck on out-of-work benefits.
That is why we need to change the way that we help people to get on in life, and that is exactly what we are committed to doing.
Q14. [30554] Mike Freer (Finchley and Golders Green) (Con): As we approach Holocaust memorial day, will the Prime Minister confirm that the Government will generously donate to the Auschwitz-Birkenau restoration fund?
The Prime Minister: I can do that. Auschwitz-Birkenau is a very powerful reminder of the ultimate consequences of intolerance, and it is only right that it should be preserved to bear witness to the deaths of the millions of victims who perished there and to act as a stark reminder of man's inhumanity to man. The director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation has recently visited the UK to discuss funding with a number of Government Departments, and we are also involved in EU discussions. I think everyone in this House knows how important it is to maintain these memorials. We obviously remember the holocaust, but we must also remember that there have been other acts of gross inhumanity more recently. We have to go on remembering to stop that happening again.
Mr Kevin Barron (Rother Valley) (Lab): Will the Prime Minister tell the House whether, when he appointed the ex-Member for Arundel and South Downs to the other place, he knew his thoughts on state benefits being an incentive to breed? Is that another example of the new politics the Prime Minister promised the country?
The Prime Minister: I do not know how long that one took to think up. The former hon. Member, who is now a Member of the House of Lords, completely withdrew those comments and apologised for what he said, which was completely unacceptable. I am prepared to leave it at that..
Alison McGovern (Wirral South) (Lab):
Students in Wirral tell me that they need their education maintenance
allowance for travel to go to the sixth form or college of their choice. Catherine McCormack, the head of South Wirral high school, says:
"Without EMA, choice and diversity are not supported."
Does the Prime Minister think that a choice of courses is only for those who can afford it?
The Prime Minister: I have to say to the hon. Lady that we looked very carefully at the study that was completed under the Government of the Labour party and it showed that nine out of 10 of those people receiving education maintenance allowance would have stayed on at school anyway. This is why the Labour party landed us in such a mess over the economy. We have to ask the question about value for money and whether we are spending money in the correct way. We are not abolishing EMAs: we are replacing EMAs with something more effective. At a time- [ Interruption. ]
Mr Speaker: Order. Members ask the question; they must listen to the Prime Minister's answer.
The Prime Minister: At a time when we are legislating to raise the participation age to 18, we have to ask whether it is it is right to spend so much money on asking people to do something that by law they will be asked to do anyway.
Robert Halfon (Harlow) (Con): Time and time again, we seem to be exporting extreme Islamist terrorists and suicide bombers to Afghanistan, Israel and now Sweden. What steps is my right hon. Friend taking to drain the poison of extreme Islamism from our country?
The Prime Minister: My hon. Friend raises an incredibly important point.. Yes, we have got to have the policing in place; yes, we have got to make sure that we invest in our intelligence services; yes, we have got to co-operate with other countries-but we have also got to ask why it is that so many young men in our own country get radicalised in this completely unacceptable way.
Mr Speaker: We come now to the 10-minute rule motion. I call Nadhim Zahawi. [ Interruption. ] If the hon. Gentleman would just wait for a moment, may I, as always, appeal to right hon. and hon. Members who are leaving the Chamber to do so quickly and quietly so that the same courtesy is extended to the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon as they would want to be extended to them? [ Interruption. ] I hope that Members are on their way out, but large numbers of Members will of course be staying to listen to the hon. Gentleman.
Motion for leave to bring in a Bill (Standing Order No. 23)
Nadhim Zahawi (Stratford-on-Avon) (Con): I beg to move,
That leave be given to bring in a Bill to designate St George's Day, or the nearest working day, as an annual public holiday in England with effect from 2012; to designate St David's Day, or the nearest working day, as an annual public holiday in Wales with effect from 2012; and for connected purposes.
In all three primary party manifestos, we vowed to promote national integration. One of the most effective ways of achieving that is to make the saints' days of St George and St David bank holidays in England and Wales respectively. This is a subject that means a lot to me and to many of my constituents in Stratford-on-Avon. I stood up and promised the people of Stratford-on-Avon that I would not add to the legislative burden that they already face and that I would take away from it. I promised that if I had the chance, I would introduce this Bill.
Unlike our neighbours in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, England and Wales do not currently celebrate our saints' days as bank holidays, which is something that I wish to change. It is quite right that in 2011 there should be a special one-off bank holiday to celebrate the royal wedding, but from 2012 onwards, the royal wedding bank holiday should be replaced by bank holidays that celebrate our two countries' patron saints.
We all know St George as the famous dragon slayer whose bravery freed a town from the tyranny of a vicious dragon and eventually led the townsfolk to Christianity. I have to point out, however, that St George was an immigrant to this country. St George is widely believed to have been born in Turkey and served in the Roman army before being taken into English hearts. My hon. Friend the Father of the House, who is an expert on that region, tells me that he may even have been of Kurdish origin-I speculate further that his skin may have been my shade of tan. St David is remembered not only for his miracles and for his close affinity to nature, but as a great unifying force for Christianity and for Wales. Both saints had a huge impact on the culture of their respective countries. What they stood for is just as relevant today as it was way back then.
We all know our patron saints, but why is it important to celebrate them? The best answer is simple: it is through national days that we can celebrate what makes our nation so great. On such days, we can be yet more proud of the best aspects of English and Welsh culture and society, such as our history of tolerance, acceptance and scientific innovation, and the huge impact that we have had on the history of the world. There is so much to be proud of in our past and so much that our children can learn from, both in our successes and our mistakes.
In recent years, I have been saddened to see the symbols of our patriotism hijacked by the fringe right-wing of our country. Today, this House can go a long way towards reclaiming them. We can ensure that all who live in Britain, whatever their background, can join
together and celebrate all that makes Britain great. I am a firm believer in the supreme value of our culture and history, and we should never let anyone tell us not to celebrate them.
I will now put to bed the one argument against such a change, which I have heard time and again, that an extra bank holiday would be bad for our economy. As a businessman and entrepreneur who has built strong and enduring businesses, I reject the idea that one extra bank holiday will affect productivity. The working people of this country will do the work that they need to do regardless of a new bank holiday. We must remember that the whole concept of work has changed. Work is no longer just about turning up at a particular place at a particular time and then leaving at a fixed time. One beneficiary of the proposal would be small shops and businesses in our town centres, which would benefit from extra custom during the holiday. Our local pubs will undoubtedly attract many people who wish to toast St George or St David. Through the creation of special events for those days, our leisure and tourism industries will do well.
To further put the proposal in context, we should consider the relatively few bank holidays that we receive compared with our European and north American neighbours. We are 16th in Europe with only eight bank holidays, whereas France has 11, Sweden has 11 and Germany has 12. Even our notoriously hard-working American friends have 13 bank holidays a year, although I accept that they take less vacation time overall.
Interestingly, and by a strange coincidence, YouGov recently commissioned a survey into the British public's attitude on this issue. It discovered strong public support for an increase in the number of bank holidays. More than two thirds of adults-68%-think that it would be appropriate for Great Britain to have at least nine days of public holiday a year. Of the calendar occasions that are candidates for the extra bank holiday, YouGov found that St George's day is the most popular with 22% of support. That is just ahead of Remembrance day on 21%, which is the other clear favourite. The battle of Trafalgar and the summer solstice came third and fourth respectively.
I am delighted that the Prime Minister heard my call for the flag of St George to be flown over Downing street in the summer. It is high time that the flag was taken back from those groups that are not worthy of it. Today could be a huge step in the right direction. If passed, the Bill could be of real benefit to social cohesion in England and Wales, and I hope that colleagues will join me in supporting it and making it a reality. It would be a very fine wedding present to both nations. I commend the Bill to the House.
Question put and agreed to.
That Nadhim Zahawi, Claire Perry, Nick Boles, Keith Vaz, Brandon Lewis, Andrew Rosindell, Jonathan Edwards, Simon Hughes, Sajid Javid, Mr Robert Buckland, Mr Brian Binley and Robert Halfon present the Bill.
Nadhim Zahawi accordingly presented the Bill.
Bill read the First time; to be read a Second time on Friday 13 May and to be printed (Bill 128).
Chris Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab): On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Yesterday, as noted at column 814 of the Official Report, the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)-I have notified her that I would raise the matter today-effectively said that I had misled the House in the previous Parliament on whether the Americans would be able to maintain cluster munitions on British territory, for instance in Diego Garcia. The Foreign Secretary wisely said that he had no evidence that the House had been misled, but that he had not been able to see the papers of the previous Government. For the complete avoidance of doubt, may I make it clear that it was our complete intention that there would be no American cluster munitions on British territories anywhere in the world? Can you advise me of how I can put that on the record?
Mr Speaker: The answer is that the hon. Gentleman has just done so, as he well knows.
Mr Speaker: The amendment has not been selected, but there will be an opportunity for a debate, and if necessary a vote, on the main motion.
The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr Mark Hoban): I beg to move,
That the following provisions shall apply to the proceedings on the Loans to Ireland Bill:
Timetable
1.-(1) Proceedings on Second Reading, in Committee, on consideration and on Third Reading shall be completed at today's sitting in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph.
(2) Proceedings on Second Reading shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a conclusion three and a half hours after the commencement of proceedings on the Motion for this Order.
(3) Proceedings in Committee, on consideration and on Third Reading shall (so far as not previously concluded) be brought to a conclusion at the moment of interruption or six hours after the commencement of proceedings on the Motion for this Order, whichever is the later.) proceedings on the Bill shall stand postponed while the Question is put, in accordance with paragraph (1) of Standing Order No. 52 .-(1) On the conclusion of proceedings in Committee, the Chair Chair or Speaker shall put only the Question that the Clause or Schedule be added to the Bill.
6. If two or more Questions would fall to be put under paragraph 4(c) on successive amendments moved or Motions made by a Minister of the Crown, the Chair shall instead put a single question in relation to those amendments or Motions.
7. If two or more Questions would fall to be put under paragraph 4(d) in relation to successive provisions of the Bill, the Chair shall instead put a single question in relation to those provisions.
Miscellaneous
8. Paragraph (1) of Standing Order No. 15 (Exempted business) shall apply so far as necessary for the purposes of this Order.
9.-..
(2) The Question on any such Motion shall be put forthwith.
12.-(1) No dilatory Motion shall be made in relation to proceedings to which this Order applies except by a Minister of the Crown.
(2) The Question on any such Motion shall be put forthwith.
13. The Speaker may not arrange for a debate to be held in accordance with Standing Order No. 24 (Emergency debates) at today's sitting before the conclusion of any proceedings to which this Order applies.
14.-.
15. Proceedings to which this Order applies shall not be interrupted under any Standing Order relating to the sittings of the House.
16.-(1) Any private business which has been set down for consideration at 4 pm at today's sitting shall, instead of being considered as provided by Standing Orders, be considered at the conclusion of the proceedings on the Bill today.
 4 pm and the conclusion of those proceedings.
I do not wish to detain the House too long in moving the motion. It seeks the approval of the House to consider all stages of this important Bill in a single day. With the co-operation of the House, the Bill will make a major contribution to the United Kingdom's declared international commitments.
Why do we need to expedite the Bill? The loan to Ireland is novel and large, and the Bill is needed to give the Treasury the necessary authority to advance funds to Ireland. The loan agreement will require the Government to obtain all necessary authorisations before the first draw-down on the loan can be made. The international package is to be discussed at the International Monetary Fund tomorrow, and it is important that the Government, the IMF and the other lenders can be sure that legislation will be passed so that they can assess the adequacy of the total support package, hence the desire to proceed as quickly as possible today. Passing the Bill will also provide certainty to financial markets that the UK's funding package will be in place. It is in no one's interest to create further instability.
Mr Bernard Jenkin (Harwich and North Essex) (Con):
I do not think that anybody wants to waste time on the timetable motion unless necessary, but if my hon. Friend were to provide an assurance that the Bill can and will
be used only for a single bilateral loan to Ireland, and that it will not be used for any other purpose, that might help it on its way.
Mr Hoban: I do not wish to pre-empt the remarks that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will make on Second Reading, but I can provide that assurance to my hon. Friend.
The Bill is needed to provide statutory authority for the Treasury to pay out the funds involved. Any loan agreement is contingent on obtaining that necessary authority. In improving the overall package of financial assistance to Ireland, our international partners need to be sure that the UK will have the necessary legislation in place to allow it to fulfil its part.
Lady Hermon (North Down) (Ind): Will the Minister clarify one point that confuses me? The Bill is entitled the Loans to Ireland Bill, but the explanatory notes, which I know are not binding, keep referring to, and imply that there is, a single loan. How many loans will there be to Ireland? Is there a limit?
Mr Hoban: As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will say in his speech, the loan will be disbursed in eight tranches, if called on by the Irish Government. That is the reason why the title is in the plural rather than in the singular.
Chris Bryant (Rhondda) (Lab) rose -
Mr Hoban: I was drawing my remarks to a close, because I am very conscious that every minute I spend at the Dispatch Box in this debate means a minute less on Second Reading, but I shall take one final intervention.
Chris Bryant: I, too, do not want overly to delay the House, but we are using an emergency procedure on a Bill that will not go through the same processes as other Bills. It is therefore all the more important that we ensure that we rarely use such a procedure. Will the Minister ensure that the Government do not use this procedure on future occasions, if similar arrangements have to be made for other countries?
Mr Hoban: It is important that there is proper parliamentary scrutiny of measures such as this. That is why we sought to agree the timetable through the usual channels, and to ensure that there is time to debate amendments and that the Bill goes through the normal process of scrutiny. Given that the Bill is shorter, it can be scrutinised in a shorter period of time without compromising scrutiny. That is why I believe that we can deal with it today. I urge the House to support the programme motion.
Mr Peter Bone (Wellingborough) (Con): I have a lot of respect for the Minister; he is one of the most able in the House. [Hon. Members: " Hear, hear."] However, it was not his best speech.
The hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) made a point about emergency measures, but the Minister did not call the Bill an emergency measure-he just said that it is an important Bill and that it be would rather nice to get it through quickly. It is absolutely true that the Bill is not an emergency measure and there is no such urgency for it. However, it is not the duty of the
House to say to the Executive, "It will be jolly nice to get the Bill through quickly." We are here to scrutinise the Bill. It matters not what team Back Benchers are on: they are here to hold the Government to account. I said that as an Opposition Member and I shall say it as a Government Member. The Minister remarked that the longer he spoke, the more he would eat into time on Second Reading, but the Government designed the allocation of time motion in that way. When we were in opposition, we said that that such remarks were appalling, and they are also appalling in government.
This motion contains one of the most draconian guillotines we have ever seen in Parliament. It contains 16 separate restrictions on debate, it is longer and has more words than the Bill itself, and it is designed purely to restrict debate and to remove the right to vote on amendments in Committee. I am afraid that it is as bad as those we used to see under the previous Government. It is rubber-stamping at its finest. The motion proposes to rush through legislation at a speed that would win approval in North Korea and to take Parliament for granted.
This is not my first time scrutinising a Government who are trying to rush a Bill through Parliament. Coincidentally, the circumstances of a debate on a Northern Ireland Bill on 4 March 2009 were very much the same, in so far as the Government tried to rush through a Bill in one day when, as now, it was not necessary to do so. Therefore, I feel that we have come full circle. Here we are with a different Government-a coalition Government-who are trying to rush through another Bill.
As a trained chartered accountant, I am rather partial to my numbers. Therefore, I would like to read out a few. Three and a half hours is the amount of time that Parliament is being given for the Second Reading debate of the Bill; £3.25 billion is the minimum amount that the Bill proposes to give the Republic of Ireland; and zero is the probable chance that the House of Lords will be able to scrutinise it, because it will most likely be certified as a money Bill. Let me expand on those three figures. Three and a half hours for Parliament to debate a Bill on Second Reading-actually, I should have said that three and a half hours is the maximum time that we are being given, because the time starts from the moment that the allocation of time debate starts. If the allocation of time debate runs its full course and there is a Division, the time for a Second Reading debate on a Bill that proposes spending £3.25 billion will be a maximum of 15 minutes. The Chancellor will not have cleared his throat in 15 minutes. In other words, we will be spending £216 million a minute during that debate.
One could argue that none of these things matters-we saw it all the time in the previous Parliament-because we have the backstop of the other place, which cannot limit debates, and Members can scrutinise the Bill clause by clause and vote on amendments. Unfortunately, that is not the case with this Bill: because it will be certified as a money Bill, there will be limited time for debate in the other place. We therefore do not have the backstop, so it is up to this House to scrutinise the Bill properly. This is a most draconian guillotine motion and is entirely unnecessary, and I intend to try to divide the House on this most important matter. Whether one is for or
against the principle of the Bill-or, indeed, whether one is indifferent to it-we as parliamentarians must demand proper time for debate.
It is important to set out the reasons why all stages of the Loans to Ireland Bill should not take place on one day. Let us consider the circumstances under which the Government can legitimately push their legislation through all its stages in one day. I understand that in national emergencies, such as those relating to terrorism, the swift progression of a Bill through Parliament is needed. However, the Loans to Ireland Bill is not one of those Bills. Since 1997, only a handful of Bills have been pushed through the Commons in one day alone. The last one was the Northern Ireland Bill in 2009, which I referred to a few moments ago, but let us look at the typical Bill that has gone through in one day and the precedents that this motion creates.
On 4 April 2001, the Elections Bill went through all its stages in one day, owing to the national crisis caused by the foot and mouth epidemic. Clearly that is not a reason for the Loans to Ireland Bill to go through in one day. On 2 September 1998, Parliament was recalled from its summer recess to pass all stages of the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Bill, as an urgent response to the terrible Omagh bombing. Again, that does not apply to today's Bill. On 19 February 2008, the Banking (Special Provisions) Bill was passed in relation to Northern Rock, and therefore needed to be rushed through the Commons. The House sat until midnight on that day, which I understand was because of market sensitivity. Again, that does not apply to today's Bill. None of those exceptional circumstances applies to the Loans to Ireland Bill. If this guillotine motion goes through, the Government will have set a dangerous precedent for curtailing debate and excluding proper parliamentary scrutiny on controversial issues.
Jim McGovern (Dundee West) (Lab): I was intrigued to hear the hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin) say in his intervention on the Minister that we should not waste any more time on the motion than is necessary. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with his hon. Friend, and is he as intrigued as I am to know under what circumstances time wasting would indeed be necessary?
Mr Bone: This Government have put us in a Catch-22 situation, which the previous Government used to put us in too: time for debating guillotine motions is taken out of time on Second Reading. That never used to happen; it was something that the previous Government got into the habit of doing. That means that all these people on the Government Benches want me to shut up, so that we can get on with Second Reading. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Well, my colleagues behind me are going to be disappointed. The newer Members of this Parliament are going to learn-I know that they are keen on this, because they want parliamentary scrutiny, not rubber-stamping-that there is a simple way for all my colleagues on the Government Benches and for Opposition Members to get into the debate, which is to defeat the guillotine motion in a vote.
Mark Reckless (Rochester and Strood) (Con):
We may have heard one or two "Hear, hears", and I am certainly someone who wants to speak on Second Reading,
but let me make clear my appreciation for what my hon. Friend is doing. Any responsibility for the curtailment of time for Back Benchers should rest squarely where it belongs, which is with those on the Treasury Bench.
Mr Bone: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support. If we do not get it right today, this coalition Government and future Governments will use the same trick again and again.
What I am doing is not a wrecking manoeuvre; nor is it about stopping the Bill from making progress. All we need to do is defeat the guillotine motion now, and then there will be a full Second Reading debate, followed by the Committee stage and Third Reading. The current situation is an abuse of Parliament and its democracy. Normal rules are being abandoned so that the Government can get things through on the nod. Surely I am not mistaken that the only possible reason for proceeding today would be if the Minister had written a cheque for £3.25 billion last night and handed it to the Irish Government. Then I might be inclined to agree that we should get on with things today. However, the Minister does not seem to be leaping to the Dispatch Box to confirm that.
One argument for pushing the Bill through could be the lack of space in the parliamentary calendar and an inability to spare any more time to debate it, but we all know that that is not true. Even with recess upon us, we could have abandoned the Backbench Business Committee debate tomorrow-Thursday-and had the Committee stage and Third Reading instead. However, if that was not the flavour of the will of the House, we could have used Monday, for which a general debate is listed. If the general debate were abandoned, Government business would not be lost, and the debate could be rescheduled for another time. Alternatively, if there really is an emergency and the Bill really does need to be progressed now, let the House sit this Friday until the business is complete.
Parliament could be allowed a full day on Second Reading, which would occur after the allocation of time motion were defeated, and the Government could then choose Thursday, Friday or Monday for Committee and Third Reading. That would in no way hold up progress; nor could it be interpreted as letting our friends in Europe down. Indeed, the idea that they do not take our word for it that the Government are serious is also, I have to say, not believable. If the Government say that they are going to give £3.25 billion to Ireland in a loan, they know that that is what will happen, so that argument is just an excuse to push the Bill through in one day.
Mark Hendrick (Preston) (Lab/Co-op):?
Mr Bone: Mr Speaker, you would rightly tick me off if I answered that question. That is a matter for the Second Reading debate, because it is to do with the issues in the Bill. I am expressing no view on that at the moment. However, unless we have adequate time to discuss those issues, the hon. Gentleman's point might not be clarified.
Lack of parliamentary time cannot be an excuse for this motion. The advantage of splitting the debate over two days is that it would allow a proper debate on Second Reading today. I believe that many Members would like to take part in such a debate. It would also allow amendments to be tabled in the normal way, and enable us to have a proper debate in Committee, with time for a debate and votes on each of the amendments. There would also be time for a Third Reading debate.
I understand that the Government have tabled a manuscript amendment today, although I have not seen it. That amendment has been tabled without allowing Members the time to consider it. That just shows the weakness of this procedure. If the allocation of time motion were defeated, we would have a full Second Reading debate and the Government would have to rearrange their business to provide for the Committee stage and Third Reading. The loan would still go through, but the Bill would have been properly debated and, if necessary, amended. Defeating the allocation of time motion would not wreck the Bill; it would simply give more time for proper scrutiny so that the Bill could be improved. We have already seen that the Government have tabled a manuscript amendment. What will happen if, during the 15 minutes of the Second Reading debate, a Member decides that they want to table an amendment? They just will not have time to do it.
How does the motion fit in with the principles behind parliamentary sittings? The present timetabling of our sittings is broadly based on the Jopling reforms and encompasses three principles. It is against those three principles that we should judge the Bill today. The first is that the Government must be able to get their business through, and, within that principle, ultimately control the time of the House. Secondly, the Opposition must have the opportunity to scrutinise the actions of the Government and to improve or oppose legislation as they think fit. Thirdly-this is of more interest to me-Back-Bench Members on both sides of the Chamber should have reasonable opportunities to raise matters of concern from their constituents. A number of my constituents have contacted me with concerns about this Bill.
A major role of Members of Parliament is to scrutinise and review legislation. It is a well-known fact-I doubt that anyone in the House would disagree with this-that the better the scrutiny, the better the Bill. It is also a major role of Members of Parliament who are not members of the Executive to hold the Executive to account, whichever party or parties make up that Executive. That is one the most important roles we have as Members of Parliament. This motion removes that role. It is appalling that the coalition Government should try to stifle that essential function. I have long campaigned for more transparency and debate in Parliament. I strongly believe in strengthening the role of the Back Bencher. The erosion of parliamentary power to scrutinise legislation has been a long-adopted approach by successive Governments. This motion, I am afraid, is a step too far. Individual Members of Parliament attach a great deal of importance to scrutiny and accountability, and problems arise when the Executive try to deny us that right.
The Government have declared that amendments must be tabled before Second Reading, which is ludicrous. They ask MPs to table amendments before we have had
a chance to hear what the Minister has to say. How can MPs properly table amendments when they have not heard the details and the arguments? Despite that difficulty, 11 amendments have already been tabled. The Government were forced to produce a three-page document-I have it with me-of amendments, and another five-page document on their justification for rushing the Bill through. These documents were produced only in the last few days. How can they, and the amendments, realistically be scrutinised if the Bill goes through all its stages today? It is just not possible.
The House of Lords got rather fed up with the Commons bouncing it, so it has now come up with a procedure whereby the Government have to answer a number of questions-I think it is eight-before they can get a Bill such as this through. Those questions are printed in the explanatory notes to the Bill. Let us look at some of them for a minute, and see whether the answers hold up to scrutiny.
The first question is: "Why is fast-tracking necessary?" The notes go on to explain that the proposal is for a bilateral loan, and that the timing of the UK's proposed loan is currently unclear. They state:
"It is necessary to fast-track the Bill so that the UK's international partners can be confident that the bilateral loan will be implemented."
That is an absolutely hopeless answer to the question. It does not tell us why the Bill is being fast-tracked. It is ridiculous to suggest that our international partners would think that, because we had not taken another day or two to debate the Bill, the Government were not going to proceed with the loan.
"What is the justification for fast-tracking each element of the Bill?"
Again, there does not seem to be an answer. The notes state:
"The Bill is a short Bill, with few substantive provisions other than to provide for sums required by the Treasury".
Yes, the Bill is short because many of the provisions deal with statutory instruments and affirmative resolutions. It is an important Bill, but it is short because many of the provisions do not go into detail. That is exactly why we need a proper Second Reading debate. I do not think that the Government have answered that question either.
The next question is a good one:
"What efforts have been made to ensure the amount of time made available for parliamentary scrutiny has been maximised?"
"The Bill is being published on the same day it is introduced and arrangements are being made for amendments to be accepted in advance of second reading in the House of Commons."
How on earth does that answer the question about making time available for parliamentary scrutiny? It is like the Prime Minister being asked a question at Prime Minister's questions and giving an answer to a completely different one. It might be a good answer, but it is not the answer to the question that was asked.
The next thing that the Lords want to know is this:
"To what extent have interested parties and outside groups been given an opportunity to influence the policy proposal?"
The answer talks about our European Union colleagues, but the key is in the last sentence, which states that
"there has been limited opportunity to give interested parties and outside groups an opportunity to influence."
By the Government's own admission, they have failed in regard to that question.
The next question asks whether the Bill includes a sunset clause. The Government can argue, with some justification, that it does, because it stipulates a period of five years. It does not tell us when the loans are to be repaid, but it places a five-year limit on the period in which they can be made. That is not what is normally understood by a sunset clause, however. Sunset clauses normally stipulate that in, say, a year's time, Parliament will look again at the legislation to see whether it is correct.
"Are mechanisms for effective post legislative scrutiny and review in place? If not, why do the Government judge that their inclusion is not appropriate?"
"The Bill provides for regular reports".
On that one, I will give the Government a tick. So far, they have passed one of the six tests. The next question is:
"Has an assessment been made as to whether existing legislation is sufficient to deal with any or all the issues in question?"
The Government do not really answer that one. They say:
"Statutory authority for such expenditure is required in accordance with the Concordat of 1932 between the Government and the Public Accounts Committee."
I am unclear as to what that means, but it does not seem to answer the question that has been asked. The final question is:
"Has the relevant Parliamentary committees been given to opportunity to scrutinise the legislation?"
The explanatory notes were drawn up in such haste that the spelling of the question was incorrect, but the simple answer to it, as I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr Cash) might confirm, is that no such scrutiny has taken place.. The House of Commons' historic functions were to vote money for Governments to spend, and to scrutinise laws. It now barely bothers with the first, and does the second extremely badly. There was a time when legislation that had been formulated after months of civil service and ministerial deliberation was sent to the House of Commons which would pore over it, shape it?
Mr Bone: My hon. Friend is tempting me to enter the debate, which I am not going to do, and as time is short, I shall conclude my remarks.
Time is all we have as Back Benchers, and if that is taken away from us, so is power. I urge all parliamentarians in the House to vote against the guillotine motion.
Mr Nigel Dodds (Belfast North) (DUP): I shall be brief. I want to commend the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) for his absolute consistency. The speech that he has just delivered is one that he would have delivered, and perhaps did deliver-certainly the gist of it-many times when he sat on the Opposition Benches. The points that he raises are extremely important in the general context of how Parliament operates.
I do not want to say a great deal about the Bill because we shall come to Second Reading shortly, but I will say this. We are used to having Northern Ireland business rushed through-sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for not so good reasons. I have had various discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and others relating to important matters that we believe require legislation, not least an issue that was extremely important during the run-up to the general election-the fact that Members of this House who do
not take their seats continue to claim lots of money for parliamentary purposes-and we were told that time would be made available to debate that, and for the House to have its say. We were also told that legislation on the issue of dual mandates would appear. Yet I am now told that the Government cannot do any of that because "there isn't any time".
The only point that I want to raise is this. The hon. Member for Wellingborough has spoken at great length, but the bottom line is that the Government will do what it wills. The notion that "there isn't any time" to do the necessary things and important things that have been laid out by the Government in relation to Northern Ireland is simply not tenable, given the fact that here we are today, setting time aside to rush through all stages of a Bill-I will not get into the merits of it; we will come to those-in one day. I say to the Government, especially the senior Members on the Treasury Bench, that they should reflect on the fact that we are being told that other important things cannot be done. It is clear that they can be done and should be done, and I urge the Government to take action as soon as possible.
Mr Christopher Chope (Christchurch) (Con): There is one element of the guillotine motion that I particularly resent. That is the provision that if a group of amendments is being discussed when the guillotine falls, it will not be possible to vote on any more than the question that was before the House at that time, whereas under a traditional programme motion it would be possible, with the leave of the Chair, to vote on more than one of the amendments in the group.
My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury says he thinks it is reasonable that we should have the opportunity to give the Bill proper scrutiny. In my submission, scrutiny includes having the opportunity to test the view of the House on amendments before the House. My concern is that if all the amendments are grouped together, and if the debate on that group carries on until the guillotine falls, it will only be possible to vote on one narrow amendment-amendment 3-although of course the guillotine motion allows the Government amendment to be voted on as well, because those are the biased terms in which the motion has been drafted.
The Bill is a very significant measure. I have had letters from constituents asking, "How is it that we can we afford to lend £3.25 billion to Ireland when the Government are saying that they cannot do anything to make more money go to small businesses that are crying out for loans?" That is the sort of question that our constituents are asking, and I would have hoped that the Government would be more co-operative with the House by providing a bit more detail in the Bill.
We have heard that the Chancellor will be telling us in due course about the terms of the loan, the interest rate and the repayment schedule. Why could not those details have been included on the face of the Bill, to enable us to make an assessment and decide whether to table amendments? If the Government are really saying, "This is so desperately urgent that we need to do it straight away," why were they not prepared to co-operate with the House a bit more and give us the maximum amount of information to enable us to deal with it in a constructive way today?
I am very concerned, and my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) has articulated the wider constitutional implications. We know that the other place was very concerned about the fact that the Government were taking forward a lot of emergency measures without giving the opportunity for proper debate and consideration-and that applied not just to money Bills but to other Bills too. This is a money Bill, so it will not be possible for the other place to consider it in detail. That responsibility falls fairly and squarely with this House.
We got a guarantee from the Government that if there was going to be fast-tracking or emergency legislation, the justification for it would be set out in the explanatory notes. I do not think the justification given in these explanatory notes is a justification for what the Government are trying to do today.
If this Bill were to be considered tomorrow or on Monday, we would have more time to debate it. Incidentally, we would also be able to consider what the Members of the Irish Parliament are saying on this very subject in their House today. If, for example, many of them were to say that they would not wish to repay the loan given to them by the United Kingdom, I would have thought that would be a very material consideration in our debate on the matter, but this motion denies us the opportunity to consider the implications of what transpires today in the Irish Parliament. I suspect that is not an accident; I suspect that is by design. That is why I will vote against this guillotine motion.
Mr Bernard Jenkin (Harwich and North Essex) (Con): I wanted to intervene on my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to ask for a further assurance. I am minded to support my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) by voting against this motion in the Lobby if there is a Division. However, I might refrain from doing so if my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary were to rise to his feet and assure me that the measures in the Bill could not be used to lend to Ireland through another international institution, such as the European Union. I would be grateful for that assurance.
Mr Speaker: No further Members are standing to show that they wish to speak.
[Relevant document: The uncorrected oral evidence taken before the Treasury Committee on Wednesday 8 December 2010, on Autumn Forecast, HC 664-ii.]
The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr George Osborne):.
Let me directly address the question of why we are taking this legislation through today, and why we are seeking to do it rapidly. The reason is that this week we expect the International Monetary Fund board to meet and agree the assistance package, the eurozone to sign off on its contribution, and the Irish Parliament to accept the international help that is offered. Let me say this to hon. Members in reference to the previous debate. I actually have the authority to make, under common law, a loan to Ireland and to seek at a much later date retrospective authority from Parliament. I decided- [ Interruption. ] Let me say that I decided that that was a wholly inappropriate thing to do, and that I should come to Parliament to seek its authority before signing the loan agreement. The loan agreement may be signed at any moment.
Mr Bone: (Wellingborough) (Con): I am grateful to the Chancellor for giving way, but has he not let the cat out of the bag? He has just said that there is no urgency, because he had the power to do this anyway. If that had been said in the previous debate the result of the vote might been different.
Mr Osborne: From what I could tell from what my hon. Friend was saying in the previous debate, he thought it important to have parliamentary scrutiny. It is true that I could have issued the loan under the common-law powers available to me, and come back at a later point to seek parliamentary approval. I thought the House would prefer me to seek parliamentary approval first, before making the loan-but there we go; you can't please everyone.
Mr Douglas Carswell (Clacton) (Con): The Chancellor suggested that it is at his discretion that he has brought forward this Bill. Is it not the case that the 1932 convention requires him to do so-and does not that, rather than his discretion, explain why this legislation is before the House?
Nadhim Zahawi (Stratford-on-Avon) (Con) rose-
Mr Speaker: Order. We cannot have an intervention on an intervention. We will hear from the Chancellor.
Mr Osborne: Let me take the other intervention and I will answer both.
Nadhim Zahawi: I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way. Setting aside the technicalities of why we are debating this measure and how long we shall do so, and getting down to the substantive issue of the loan, can the Chancellor share with the House what the fees and the interest to the UK Government will be over the period of the loan if the Irish Government draw down the whole of the loan?
Mr Osborne: The second intervention draws me back into the rest of my speech, but in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Clacton (Mr Carswell), I have common-law powers to issue the loan and sign the loan agreement. I then have to seek statutory authority, but that could be done retrospectively. I thought it more appropriate to seek parliamentary approval first, and that was a discretionary choice that I had.
I will answer my hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim Zahawi) directly a bit later in my remarks, when I get on to the terms of the loan that we are going to consider.
Mr Christopher Chope (Christchurch) (Con): Will my right hon. Friend give way on that point?
Mr Osborne: I will give way to my hon. Friend, and then I really must make some progress.
Mr Chope: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. If the point that he is making is such a good one-it may well be-why did he not include it in paragraph 14 of the explanatory notes, making a virtue of the fact that he was bringing this matter before the House now rather than seeking retrospective approval?
Mr Osborne: I said in an earlier statement to the House that I was seeking to do that, and I had hoped that hon. Members were paying attention to what I said at the time.
The legislation that we shall pass today will allow the UK to be ready in the new year to meet its commitments to one of our closest international partners. As has been noted, the legislation before the House is narrow in scope-it is explicitly a Loans to Ireland Bill-but it is still enabling legislation. It sits alongside the actual loan agreement, which sets out in detail what we will offer Ireland. To ensure that Members have as much information as possible available to them for today's discussion, a summary of the key terms of the loan agreement, which was agreed with the Irish Government only this morning, has been available in the Vote Office for more than an hour now.
Mr William Cash (Stone) (Con): Will my right hon. Friend give way?
Mr Osborne: If my hon. Friend will allow me, I will make a bit of progress and then of course take some further interventions.
In my remarks today, I intend to address both the substance of the legislation and the loan agreement, but before that let me briefly say something about how we got here. Over the course of this year, it became increasingly clear that the situation in the Irish economy was
unsustainable. Their sovereign debt markets had effectively closed and had little prospect of re-opening. Ireland's market interest rates had risen to record levels, and Irish banks had become almost wholly reliant on central bank funding to maintain their operations, with no obvious prospect that that was going to change. This situation simply could not go on. We had been monitoring the situation for many months and had engaged in confidential discussions with our partners in the G7 and at ECOFIN about possible solutions.
Over the weekend of 20 November, Ireland's Prime Minister made a formal request for international financial assistance. The UK, alongside the International Monetary Fund, the EU, the eurozone and some other member states-Sweden and Denmark-made an agreement in principle to take part in putting together an assistance package for Ireland. Since then, the various interested parties have been working round the clock with the Irish authorities to put together a package. Officials from the British Treasury have been in Dublin in recent days ensuring that our interests and concerns were represented, and I want to thank them for their hard work. At the end of November, Ireland agreed with the IMF and the EU a three-year financial assistance package worth €85 billion.
Mr Cash: The document to which my right hon. Friend just referred is "for information purposes only" and is clearly not intended to be construed as part and parcel of the Bill. So can he explain why in the document the "conditions precedent" to the arrangements interweave the so-called "bilateral loan" with the European financial stability mechanism, and why an attempt is then made to bypass that by referring to the "Governing law" as "English law"?
Mr Osborne: I am going to discuss some of the conditions attached to the loan. The particular condition that my hon. Friend refers to ensures that the UK is protected if other parties to this international agreement change their arrangement with Ireland in some way that materially affects our ability to be repaid. That condition gives us an ability at that point to step in.
Mr Cash: My right hon. Friend is perhaps confirming my concern, which is that the interweaving of the conditions between the so-called "bilateral loan" and the mechanism is such that they are, in effect, inseparable, so European Community law could well apply.
Mr Osborne: I know that my hon. Friend is assiduous on these points, but I think that on this occasion he is not correct. This is simply a fall-back mechanism for us to say that if Ireland in some way renegotiates its loan from the eurozone, from the EU or from the IMF, it is a condition of our loan to Ireland that we can step in at that point and examine our situation. That protects the British taxpayer and has absolutely nothing to do with European law or anything else; it is simply there to make sure that other parties to this international agreement must have due regard to what they are doing, and how that might have an impact on the ability of the British taxpayer to be repaid.One block off Bourbon Street, this is a perfect location to see and get in all the action.

Read the following information to learn about 10 table foods that you should never feed your cat or dog.
Keep Your Pet Healthy: 10 Table Foods You Should Never Feed Your Pet
Bones
Even though it may seem natural for a dog or a cat to chew on bones, think twice about this. Bones can splinter, and this action can cause tears or blockages in the intestines, or cause the animal to choke. What causes problems are not the bones found in pet stores, but the cooked bones from your meals. Don’t feed your pets bones that have been cooked.
Caffeinated Foods and Beverages
Chocolate, coffee and tea are all examples of caffeinated foods and beverages that you should not feed to pets. Not only do they contain caffeine, which is a stimulant, but they also contain theobromine. Both substances can be toxic to your pet’s nervous system, heart and digestive tract.
Dairy Products
Dogs and cats do not tolerate dairy products well, as their digestive tracts are unable to digest lactose in the proper manner. While the probiotics in yogurt may be healthy for you, your pet won’t get the same benefits. If your dog is experiencing diarrhea, you can get them a different kind of probiotic at your local vet instead.
Garlic and Onions
Garlic and onions can irritate the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and cats. Cats are a bit more sensitive to these foods than dogs, but both types of animals should avoid eating garlic and onions.
Grapes and Raisins
Grapes and their dried counterparts, raisins, cause sudden kidney failure in dogs and cats. Research has yet to prove which substances in the grapes and raisins cause this serious health issue. For small treats and snacks, consider something instead, like apples.
Macadamia Nuts
These nuts cause a toxic reaction in both cats and dogs for an unknown reason. Symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, abdominal pain, tremors and stiff joints.
Persimmons
The seeds of persimmons can cause an obstruction to occur in the intestinal tract of cats and dogs. They also can be the reason your pet develops enteritis, which is an inflammation of the small intestines.
Raw Eggs
While hard-boiled eggs are an ideal source of protein for cats and dogs, uncooked eggs can pose certain issues. For one thing, raw eggs contain avidin, and this can prevent the absorption of biotin in dogs and cats. They also can contain Salmonella along with E. coli both of which could cause diarrhea and vomiting.
Uncooked Dough
Bread dough that is uncooked is not safe to eat for pets, mainly due to the live yeast. This can cause problems like vomiting. Cookie dough can also be problematic, again because of the uncooked eggs. Be sure to closely monitor pets that may have ingested uncooked dough.
Avocado
All parts of the avocado tree from the fruit to the bark can be toxic to your cat or dog since they contain Persin. Symptoms of toxicity from this food include diarrhea and vomiting. On top of that, the pit is too large to safely ingest, and many breeds of dogs may try to, resulting in problems.
If you feel there is an issue with any food you have fed your pets, the safest route is to consult with a veterinarian, say the experts at Chester Valley Veterinary Hospital. After all, you want your pet to stay healthy and live a long, happy life.
I keep trying to tell my son’s girlfriend not to give her dogs chocolate and she still insists it is ok in very small amounts. Some people are too stubborn for their own good.
I am a firm believer in not feeding any table scraps to any of my pets ever.
Very welcome advices. Thank you!
So awesome of you to do this topic! SO many people are unaware of the dangers of feeding dogs the wrong foods! These are great tips and info to live by, thank you for this 🙂
Thank you for sharing this. I never knew that you should not feed your dog these foods. I had always heard chocolate, but never anything else. I will keep this list hand so everyone in the family knows. Thank you again!!
This article is a great reminder for pet owners that foods we eat are sometimes not good for them!
I am glad to know what not to feed my little doggy
This is very good information; I hadn’t heard of a few of these before.
I didn’t know about avocados and dogs. It makes sense about cookie dough though. Raw cookie dough isn’t good for people either. The eggs….
this dog is so cute
Very helpful advice!. I never knew that you should not feed your dog these foods
I didn’t know about some of these. Thanks for sharing!
Just Like you, I liked & love dog also, I always feed them 3 times a day and sometimes 4 times a day, I just want my pet to be healthy. But this time, I want to thank you for sharing this to me, I learn a lot. God bless!
Thank you for posting this. Everyone needs reminding!
Very interesting and helpful piece. I think there’s often a lot of confusion about what foods dogs can or cannot eat, but at the end of the day, it’s better to be safe than sorry!
I did not know about this dairy thing. My vet tells me to give my dog a pill wrapped in a little piece of cheese. It doesn’t seem to bother him. What up with that I wonder?
interesting – i never knew about some of these foods to avoid giving your dog
I do not give my dogs table food; however, this is good to know. Thank you for sharing.
I never give my pets scraps/our food. Not only can it be dangerous but then they take up the annoying habit of begging everytime they see you eating. Drives me crazy. This is a great post.This Week : “A-Team” movie cranking up
. Ah, if only I was as literary as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Or even Conan, the talk show guy. (Not the Governating Repub Conan!) It was Doyle’s birthday on May 22nd. You may have seen it on Google the other day. They’re a good bunch, those Google folks.
I turned into Shermonk Holmes this week, investigating and inspecting, quite closely, Princess Lady Monkey’s very own google. She had set me a challenge. I felt as though my eyes were blind and my monkey paws bound. Okay, okay they were! However, what I was instructed to seek was clearly right there, in my face!
Lady Monkey was being aided by her Mother the other day, in the unpacking business. You know, crockery and whatnot. My Princess widened her eyes with embarrassment shock in a ‘did she see it or not?’ kinda way, when Mommy dearest uncovered the box containing her pink banana tick tocker!
So, we’ve finally acquired another residence someplace. A nice comfortable abode for the two of us to rustle around in. She can ride on my tire and I can play with her pink banana tick tocker. Lady Monkey, being the Princess she is, has not only requested I make her tea each morning, but play find the google too, whilst being Shermonk Holmes! She insists, when I do something correct, that she is the one who yells “Elementary, my dear Monkton. Elementary!”
Willis and Besson re-teaming?
Talking of Elements.. Are Bruce Willis and Luc Besson teaming up for something again or was it just Cannes whispers? Sure he said to some journos before getting splashed by a surprising wave, that “Die Hard 4″ is closer than ever, but won’t be called “Die Hard 4″. Mr. Rifkin, Mr. Wiat, that former stuntman at Fox who was dealing with it all yesteryear.. Don’t “Casino Royale” this up, guys! You’ve had some good scripts and the top writers and even “Die Hard” fanatics who are good scribes, penning stuff for this. If you think you’re ready to roll with this, well, there are people on the Vine who doubt that very much. Anyway, I digress. The Besson connection. I’ll swing round some Vines and listen some more on that.
I would’ve liked Wolverine
This one time, at Bond Camp. Dougray Scott has said he was offered Bond at the “Die Another Day” stage and then Brosnan decided he’d do it. I’m sure I’m correct in thinking that was Pierce’s ‘option to do a fourth’. Hey, write to me if you so wish, but I seriously believe this new addition to the neighborhood here, Robbie Williams, would have made a good Bond. “How can you say that without seeing him act!?” Most will say. “He’s a ******* pop star!” He acts all the time! Anyway, didn’t some casting chick allegedly say he will never be Bond because she had the hots for him and he told the press? Anyways, those Bondians are stating more snooping pictures have appeared on the net of various sets and scenes. Damn those ‘snooping’ paps. I know this pop star who has her own pap guy who snaps her ‘unaware’ and sells the pics to those certain magazines. It just reminded me. Not saying that happens at all! Actually, forget the Robbie thing. Hugh Jackman all the way. Sigh.. So, what else? I hear Tom Stoppard is now penning the 22nd official Bond movie. Now, Stoppard is also on board the “Bourne Ultimatum”. Those Broccoli folk just don’t give up, do they? They’re going more and more down the “Hey didn’t we tell you to do this?” said Brosnan path than ever!
More 80s TV shows turning movies!
So I hear the “A-Team” is cranking up a pace. Cranking up a pace-maker, but still a pace at that, with their former Bond writer doing something or other on it. What with “Knight Rider” also stepping up on the development front and word that CHIPS is also in line for a movie, I’m getting excited. Bruce whatsit Bond scribe has tackled the “A-Team” script, damnit. I wanna get my paws on that one, I can tell you. See if I don’t! (cue echoed evil laughter). It’s a real 80’s comeback show here right now and we’re set to turn animated favorites into live action movies. “Transformers” is sounding good. “He-Man” and “Thunder Cats” are still in the works too. Warners have “Thunder Cats” I believe, though two or three separate producers and managers with very different Treatments and screenplays are having their own battle. One is set up like a real “X-Men”, leaving the Thunder Cat’s home planet as it is destroyed by those crazy ass Mutants. Another has the birth of Lion-O.. yawwwn and a ‘how Jaga’ got to be Jaga crud.
Up Ramsay’s Street
What a surprise! The BBC has inked a deal with director Lynne Ramsay. She’ll helm a movie of the book ‘We need to talk about Kevin’. It’s about a Mom who raises a kid she never really wanted.
Stone for President
I hear Oliver Stone is getting back to what he should be doing. (You know if I get started on 9/11, I wont stop), so I won’t.) Anyway, Stoner – hehe – is doing a movie on Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan President, who seems to be getting all too close to the Mayor in London, UK, right now. Don’t get me started on that guy!
Vote 1 ‘Borat’
Sacha Baron Cohen’s ‘Borat’ movie is gonna be a hoot! It’s my must see comedy of the year and a much needed break from the now out-of-steam Ali G character. Kazakhstani TV journo Borat travels the US in search of what can make Kazakhstan er.. great! A scene which features Borat wrestling his best pal, naked, from a room to a hotel elevator and so on is gonna be a classic. Those who are unfamiliar with this character, get out there and buy a DVD of Cohen’s now damnit!
Da Stupidity
Da Vinci Code made money then. It had to, didn’t it? Did people really think it would bomb? (I hear Tom Hanks is playing hardball and might not return for “Angels and Demons” – they might be casting ‘younger’, doing an Affleck/Jack Ryan move).
OK, this Shermonk is getting his investigative ass outta here.

This wasn’t just any group of stars, this was the creme de la creme of stars — Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, Jean Hersholt, Lewis Stone. In 1932 few names were bigger — and the top three are still legendary. And for the most part, you’ll never see them any better than they are here. And in this rare big screen showing, you’ll likely never see them as they were meant to be seen — and in a magnificent new restoration. Frankly, I’ve never seen the film look this good — and this is coming from someone who has even owned a gorgeous 16mm original of the film.
Here is what I wrote about the film for a screening of the unrestored version about a year-and-a-half back and I don’t think I could say it any better:

It has rebalanced its portfolio by divesting noncore assets in order to focus on what it believes are its highest-value opportunities: Texas' Permian Basin and Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin. Let's take a closer look at where the company sees opportunity this year and in the years ahead.

Where Apache will spend its money this year
Apache announced late last month that it will reduce its exploration and production budget to $8.5 billion this year, down from $10 billion last year. Once again, the bulk of its spending -- about 64% -- will be directed toward its operations in the Permian Basin and the Anadarko Basin, while the remainder will go toward projects in Egypt, the U.K. North Sea, and elsewhere.
Specifically, the single largest portion of Apache's exploration and production budget -- about 31% -- will be directed toward the Permian Basin, while the next largest portion -- 20% -- will be spent in the Anadarko Basin. The remaining 13% of its North American budget will be divided up fairly evenly between Canada (7%) and Gulf Coast Onshore (6%), while international E&P spending will be focused primarily in Egypt (11%), the North Sea (11%), Australia (9%), and the Gulf of Mexico (6%).
Apache also plans to spend an additional $1.4 billion not included in its E&P budget to develop the Chevron-operated (NYSE: CVX) Wheatstone LNG project in Australia. It will also spend money on the Kitimat LNG project, though plans to reduce its 50% stake in the project because it says it can't afford the $1 billion it initially planned to spend on the project this year.
Key drivers of Apache's future growth
In my view, investors should welcome Apache's capital allocation plans for 2014 since they are a perfect reflection of the company's new strategy, which seeks to deliver stronger growth from its U.S. onshore assets in the Permian and Anadarko Basins, while using its international assets primarily for cash flow generation.
Last year, Apache's Apache's Permian and Anadarko assets fueled a 34% year-over-year increase in Apache's onshore North American liquids production, which drove 15% year-over-year growth in operating cash flow. This year, Apache is guiding for 15%-18% growth in North American onshore liquids growth.
Given the highly competitive rates of return Apache is seeing from the Permian and Anadarko basin, currently in excess of 30% after tax, this should drive stronger cash flow growth in the years ahead. Major efficiency gains through greater use of multi-well-pad drilling, which helped the company slash completion costs by more than 25% last year, should also boost returns and cash flow.
Cash flow generation from abroad
While its Permian and Anadarko assets will remain the centerpiece of its growth strategy in the years ahead, Apache's foreign assets will be used mainly for cash flow generation to fund domestic drilling, dividend payments, and share buybacks. The company's assets in Egypt and the North Sea generate free cash flows in excess of $1 billion annually thanks to a large production base and Brent-linked pricing.
Apache's two LNG projects -- Wheatstone and Kitimat -- will also be significant contributors to cash flow when they come online. Because their production will remain constant for an extremely long period of time and is linked to oil prices through long-term contracts, they should be a reliable source of cash flow generation for a long, long time.
For instance, 85% of Wheatstone's capacity has already been contracted out through 20-year contracts at Brent-linked pricing. Assuming $100 per barrel Brent oil prices, the project is expected to generate $1 billion in annual free cash flow for decades to come, while requiring very little capital investment after it comes online in 2016.
Why Apache may be a long-term buy
Though Apache's $8 billion of asset sales over the past year will weigh on its near-term production and profits, likely limiting major share price gains this year, I think the company's long-term outlook is highly promising and may not be fully appreciated by the market, which values its shares at just over 11x forward earnings -- a meaningful discount to its peer group.
Given the company's massive and highly economic inventory of drilling locations in the Permian and Anadarko basins and its consistent track record of execution, I think it should command a higher multiple in line with other major Permian and Anadarko basin-focused operators.

Complaints like like that can be leveled at Games Workshop (GW) games, Privateer Press’ (PP) WarmaHordes and Flames of War The Only Historical Game Laypeople Know. However, game developers seem to be grasping idea that smaller games are more attractive to people if not for their price than for their short playtime. And currently, we’re being spoiled for choice.
The most recent release from the big players is the Company of Iron ruleset from PP. A usual game of WarmaHordes involves at least one named wizard character, several stompy robots or beasts for them to push around and several units of chaff. Buying an army for it can set you back some. However, CoI does away with the named characters (hooray) and most of the big monsters (you can still manage to squeeze in a light a warjack). Instead, it gives an opportunity for regular grunts to shine in a game designed for them.
In my humble opinion, the Menoth bundle is the best Company of Iron bundle.
The game features alternating activations I move a dude, you move a dude, I move a dude as well as rolls to see whether a downed trooper is really down, commander traits that can be chosen while building and army as well as a deck of cards of assets and abilities to use while playing. So far, so good: with named characters taking a step back, and the ability to give your commander an ability of your choosing, you can finally get the My Dudes feeling that the game had been lacking. And with 20-25 point limit, the army will hardly ever be over 10 miniatures. Currently, PP’s own 25 packs range from $70+ dollars to over a $100. This is not super cheap, but it’s still miles above the usual price. Oh, and the rules are totally free to download, while the Company of Iron two player box is a bargain.
Now, when I first started moaning and groaning about the lack of skirmish games, it was because GW was languishing under the thrall of Tom Kirby, a cartoon caricature of capitalist come to life. After GW unceremoniously abandoned all Specialist Games (they didn’t involve buying buckets of Space Marines) other companies filled the void left by Necromunda (my Infinity partner specifically pointed out that the game scratches that NM itch) and others. GW did have several half-heated attempts to show that they give a damn the lukewarm release of Kill Team some time ago being a shining example but times, they are a-changing.
While Shadow War: Armageddon was dropped into the world and promptly forgotten and Age of Sigmar Skirmish was stated to just be some rules bashed together for fun the release can now be seen as GW testing the waters a bit. SW:A was basically “Necromunda With Tabletop Races”. And since people loved, Necromunda: Hive Wars box with newly sculpted Escher and Goliath gangs will be released at of November, with more gangs to follow.
Not a bad looking pile of stuff!
Sure, the release could be more user friendly: the main box will only provide the rules for playing on 2D cardboard terrain that it comes with while a separate Gang Wars book will contain 3D and campaign rules, as well as things like Juvies (inexperienced pledges in the gang). It’s similar to the Blood Bowl publishing model, where a league game now involves checking three rulebooks. However, Necromunda will now have alternating activations and an update of the 2nd edition rules that worked in SW:A. Since Blood Bowl release caught the company with its pants down and showed that there is still support from both hardcore long-time fans and from people who played either the official PC games or things like FMBBL, we can expected full-throated support for the game.
Age of Sigmar players aren’t left out either, because they already received Shadespire. This is a completely new game with completely new miniatures. And while it is sad that it’s not a new Mordheim, it’s probably the cheapest of the games to play. With beautiful warbands costing around $20 and the best skeleton sculpts in the market, it’s a great game that it’s quick to grasp, fast to play and probably not too hard to master. And with the smallest team being only three models (that’s the Stormcast Eternal one), there’s not that much painting to do, either.
In Shadespire, Mr. Bones searches for a way for his Wild Ride to end.
But while one, say, Ork team will be usingt he exact same model composition as the other, the players will be able to use cards to make their team special. Some of them are team and even model specific, others can be used freely. So even if you and your opponent are playing the same four named ork- excuse me, IRONJAWZ, you can still have a very different tactical set. That is, unless you both read the same internet guide on cards of something. With a match of Shadespire rumored to last less than an hour and maybe as little as thirty minutes, it’s probably the most blisteringly fast game in the market.
As a surprising twist, the GW’s Lord of the Rings game (now called The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Strategy Battle Game, but nobody has time for that or all the trademarks GW puts on every other proper noun) will be getting the Battle Companies skirmish ruleset some time this December. It’s based on the rules of the same name that had been published in White Dwarf some time in 2004.
This game will focus on small bands 6 to 10 or more miniatures depending on faction of regular soldiers acting individually. It seems to be geared towards being a campaign game, with random rolls for band reinforcement and experience points that will eventually lift up your survivors to be heroes. If the game comes out with rules for Easterling or Haradrim warbands, I will be all over it.
But what do you if you want something more historically oriented, yet are unwilling to buy one of bazillion games that Osprey publishes? Well, Warlord Games, the guys behind Bolt Action The Cheaper and Better WWII Game have recently released Test of Honour. It’s a samurai skirmish game, not unlike Warbands: Bushido that I had the honor to review! The proprietary dice even look similar!
All samurai, no pizza cats!
The game is played with warbands of 10-20 miniatures, centered around a samurai hero, maybe a strong buddy or two, and some ashigaru that will probably be sorry to be there. The warbands cost around $30, while main box will set you back $50 and will leave you with 35 miniatures enough for two bands of Japanese warriors.
Each miniature in game provides one or more command chits (of either commoner or samurai type). Both players pour their chits into one cup, add some fate tokens and take turns drawing chits and activating soldiers. So, unlike in Bolt Action, you’re both guaranteed to act every other turn, and you can activate some units (samurai) several times. And, of course, there are cards aplenty to modify your game including Dishonor cards for dastardly deeds.
If you want something more modern, yet still historical, Warlord Games really wishes for you to try out Blood Red Skies. To the chagrin of Cold War gamers transforming drain cleaners into Sidewinder smoke plumes, this game is set in WWII. It feels very much inspired by X-Wing, which isn’t a bad thing, and features such innovations as tiltable flight stands that will show if the plane is in Advantage (either flying higher or having more kinetic energy), Neutral or Disadvantage (climbing, being lower) in a neat abstraction of the dogfight furball. Again, your planes and pilots will be modified by cards.
The game features great designs and awesome excuses to make “pheeew” and “budda-budda-budda” sounds with your mouth while playing.
So you might have noticed that cards that strongly modify the small model counts armies seem to be a prominent feature of most of the games mentioned. If you put two and two together, you can clearly state that the flood of skirmish games seems to be taking the good lessons from X-Wing, where one TIE Fighter can be radically different from another TIE Fighter because of the pilot and equipment cards that add a layer of abilities on top of their stats. A lot of the games seem to targeted at the tournament scene, with notable exceptions of Necromunda and Battle Companies. It’s also good to know what most companies aren’t doing the X-Wing trick of packing cards you might need with models you don’t need at all!
All in all, this is a great time to get into miniatures. There are games aplenty to choose from, companies are focusing on clear, easy rules that don’t need 4 FAQ’s in three months. You also don’t need to commit that much time to either playing or getting ready to play, as the armies are fairly small. One can only wonder how established small model number games like Infinity and Malifaux will react!New Hampshire’s best kept secret for 27 our most spectacular season, peak foliage.

Originally geared for the use of Harvard students and later of several major universities, by 2006 it was available to users over 13 years old by the name “Facebook.” On that day, social media changed forever. Many competing and contemporary social networking platforms would fold even as Facebook expanded and acquired other social media services under its umbrella. Despite sometimes-grave controversy, Facebook has endured and expanded even further. To reflect this, the company running the service is contemplating a major shift: a name change.
The Verge tells us that Facebook Inc. will be changing its name as an indicator of its planned direction towards the future. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees it, the company plans to officially reveal its new name next, around the time of the Facebook Connect conference this coming October 28. Considering the possibility of leaks however, the name change could be publicized earlier than that. The new name would encompass the fact that the Facebook platform is just one of the company’s many services, which now include other social media networks like WhatsApp and Instagram, and the VR platform Oculus.
But there is also a pragmatic angle in the proposed name change of Facebook Inc. Over the past few years the concept of social media has become more predominantly known for their negative effects rather than their positive benefits. Facebook and its associated platforms might only blame themselves, if a former company employee-turned-whistleblower has the right of it. Earlier this month the whistleblower alleged that Facebook has been letting hate-speech content by, as they apparently drew more users which equaled to more profit. Instagram was also slammed for exacerbating body issues with young female users.
Facebook Inc. for its part puts a positive spin on its impending name change. In fact, one reason might hint as to what the new name might be like. The company positions itself as one of the pioneers in the conceptualization and development of the “metaverse,” a proposed future version of the internet that could be explored as a collection of linked 3D virtual spaces. Facebook even recently announced plans for a metaverse development team with no less than 10,000 employees to be hired. This only serves to build hype for just what Facebook Inc. will call itself in future.

The gold-focused company bought assets covering 1800 square kilometres in Mali earlier in 2010 after acquiring control of two local companies. Its tenements are located in the prolific gold bearing belts of Mali and include close to surface resource of 650,000 ounces of gold at a grade of 3.17 grams a tonne – a relatively high grade for West African standards.
Papillon shares have dropped by 14 per cent over the past two weeks but investors are still sitting pretty for the year so far, up over 800 per cent.
The emerging company is aiming to ramp up exploration work in the short-term to increase the resource base beyond 1 million ounces, while maintaining or improving the resource grade. A resource upgrade is expected early in calendar 2011.
Larger goldminer
OceanaGold shares slipped by 3.7 per cent after announcing output would be between 260,000 ounces to 280,000 ounces for 2011 at a cash cost of between $US645 and $685 per ounce. The cash costs are moderately higher to account for increased material movements consistent with the strategy to extend mine life in New Zealand, the company said.
African gold explorer
Resources for all projects now stand at 159 million tonnes for 5.7 million ounces and reserves at 97 million tonnes for 3.9 million ounces.

The funding is close to half of the company’s current market value and the notes convertible at 30¢ which is a 42 per cent premium to the 30-day VWAP (volume weighted average pricing) of Poseidon shares.

hi my name is sally and i have a soon to be 6 year old that i just took out of a montessori school. I have continued to do "at home school work" with keeley while she was in this school. This would be my problem: how do you make your child realize that it is okay to miss one or even two math problems when you got 24 correct!! Keeley loves to see check marks beside the correct problems, but oh boy if she gets one wrong then she totally melts down and says that she is no good or that she cant get anything right! i give tons of praise for everything she does and i have explained 10 different ways that she has still done a wonderful job, even if one was wrong. i have tried to not check any of them and she assumes then that they are all wrong. Has anyone had to deal with this and if so i could use some examples, PLEASE. my child loves to learn and i dont want her to get discouraged for any reason. any and all help welcomed---sallyr in nc). If you had some way to know for sure that the user is not currently editing a cell, you could just intercept the SEL_KEYPRESS message and handle it yourself, e.g. table.connect(SEL_KEYPRESS) do |sender, sel, event| if event.code == KEY_Escape && (we're not editing a cell) true else false end end The problem I'm running into is that the information that you need to make that determination (namely, whether or not an editor window has been constructed) isn't currently exposed to FXRuby.

When your car is a little less sexy than a little bit sexy
by […]What does Samalla do?
This is a one woman workshop in historical clothing (antiquity to medieval European) and costuming. I strife to use only authentic or natural materials. Samalla also resells crafting supplies and jewellery from fair trade and/or organic sources. No mass production sweatshop and polluting items here. I believe in fair pay and love for our planet.
Who is Samalla?
The serious passion for handwork started at the early age of six, when my mother thought it was a good idea to store her sewing machine in my room. I’ve always made tiny clothes for my stuffed toys and dolls, but when I was in high school, there wasn’t much support for this kind of craft. Being creative, I tried the Art Academy and later, more in my discipline, the Fashion Academy. Floating between art and fashion, I didn’t really fit in anywhere. I started my own business officially in 2010, after not being happy in non-creative jobs.
My love for historical garment started early. I have done quite a lot of LARP and was more interested in the garments on the pictures of my history books. I have dived in medieval, Grecian, fantasy, corsets, hoopskirts and Vikings. I did a fair amount of COSplay items. With age comes wisdom and now I really like to sort out if something was actually found, written about or drawn up as historical clothing. I like to work with the actual materials used, but I don’t mind adding a bit of fantasy to the designs I make.
I don’t LARP any more and I’m leaning towards re-enactment. I’m also very keen on sustainability in my work and private. I’m also very keen on my health, so I am a seasonal worker. Most of the work is done in the warmer and lighter days, while I do easy work in the shorter and colder days.
Why Samalla?
Samalla is a Finnish word for simultaneous. This sums up my personality and my work. I’m always doing too many things at the same time.

The answer? No!
Instagram has changed a lot over the past few years. It used to be a place where you posted every photo with the most horrendous filters (Valencia, anyone?). Then it became a hub for all things beautiful with perfectly curated feeds. Now, it’s changed again!
Instagram in 2020 is all about building an engaged community and being authentic. This is important for personal accounts and businesses because your audience, clients and customers want to see what really happens behind the scenes.
Here are the 3 things you need to grow your Instagram with an engaged audience:
1. Post quality content #
We’re not talking about content that you think your audience will like or posting photos that you think look nice and work well with your feed.
We’re talking about posts that are highly specific and really speak to your audience.
All great content comes from market research!
To find out what kinds of content your audience wants to see - ask them!
The easiest way is to use a poll or quiz sticker on your stories to directly ask your audience what they want to see.
Share a few ideas to your stories and let your audience choose which one they want to see. This is also great for building your community because your audience feels like they’re involved in making your account.
2. Use Instagram Stories #
Instagram stories came out in 2016 and they are one of the most powerful tools to help you nurture your audience and build that trust factor!
Think of your audience as flies on the wall who want to know EVERYTHING!
Here are a few examples of GREAT Instagram story ideas for you:
PERSONAL ACCOUNT:
- Share snippets of what your day looks like
- Share a few things that you’re loving right now and why
- Get ready with me stories where your audience can pick your outfit, food, activities etc.
- Q&A using question stickers
PRODUCT BASED BUSINESS:
- Share the best selling products of the week
- Post a poll and let your audience choose their favourite products
- Post product reviews
- Do an Instagram story takeover with someone using your product
- Show the behind the scenes of production, packing, marketing etc
- Do a Q&A
SERVICE BASED BUSINESS:
- Share a quote that you love
- Share a few business accounts you love
- Share a behind the scenes of what you’re doing
- Share tips and tricks
- Do mini trainings on a certain topic on Instagram
- Do a Q&A
- Share what your typical day looks like
You don’t need to post to your feed every day when you’re posting to your Instagram stories instead.
Stories take a lot less time and your audience expects them to be raw. They don’t want to see polished content, they want to see real and authentic stories that let them connect with the real you!
3. Invite engagement #
You need to give in order to receive, right? The same thing applies to social media!
Building an engaged community comes with having genuine connections and conversations -- so go out there and start making them.
Comment on other people’s posts, reply to their stories and send a DM to a few people. These small outwardly actions have a huge return on your page. It shows that you (as a personal account or a business) and invested in them, in what they’re doing and what they’re talking about.
You’ll find, they’ll then go and check out your page, engage back and potentially even follow you (if they aren’t following you already)
But, you can’t just do it once and expect a huge return. Instagram is a slow game so you need to invest some time in nurturing your audience.
Another way you can invite engagement is by putting a call to action (CTA) at the end of your post.
These don’t always have to be sales-y like ‘Go to the website to purchase X.’ They can be conversation starters like ‘Did you find this tip helpful?’ or ‘How are you planning on making time for yourself this weekend?’
Having these three key elements in your Instagram strategy will really be a game-changer for you in 2020!.9.0 2021-11-09

Friction is very important to the operation of the tool and you will notice a loss of power should lubrication make its way into the driver blade and flywheel especially. If these parts have been lubricated, you should take the tool into your local service agent to have the tool disassembled and the lubricant removed.

Here’s the way to get personal loans.
It is possible to get usecured bank loans in case you have a bad credit score.

Should you have a security (like a property), even though, the bank may necessitate a greater percentage pace than usual so that you can secure the financing. Also, if you confirm type of stable employment, then loan companies will be less probable to provide you with a personal unsecured loan. Recall, a lending institution could be additional prepared to give you money should you present that you are a practical paying customer.

Probably the most astonishing options for personal loans is credit debt, it is crucial, nevertheless, that you keep up with the installments.

Credit cards that you simply cope with in order to early on typically transport really low mortgage rates.

But it’s not just a game for students trying to get in. It’s also a game for colleges trying to preserve their rank and reputation. As a result, some schools invoke policies in the admissions process to leverage themselves and gain advantages over other institutions, even if these policies hurt or inconvenience the students these universities serve.
As a college consultant, over the years I’ve become aware of some of these policies through stories of my students. I’m going to share some of them with you today.
Much of these tactics come down to protecting something called yield. To maintain rank in lists like the one released by US News or Forbes, colleges are judged on a variety of metrics. One of these is called yield, which is essentially the percentage of students who enroll who have been offered admission. If a high percentage of those who get in, go, that would logically mean that this school is probably popular with students and thus deserves a higher rank, right?
Though the most prestigious colleges, such as Harvard or Stanford, may enjoy such a high yield that they don’t have to worry about too many strategic policies to increase yield, most colleges vying for position in the top 20 top 50 top 100 may play more games to hold onto that yield statistic.
Another motive of many colleges is maintain a donor base or financial solvency. We’ll also talk about some of the tactics employed with this motive in mind.
1. Guaranteed Transfer Programs… to Freshman Applicants
Most students believe that when they apply to college they’ll get one of two decisions from a college: accept or reject. But it’s not that simple.
Some schools, such as Cornell and even USC, offer students “guaranteed transfer” programs to students.
Essentially, students accepted for these programs get a letter that says hey we like you we’ll let you in, but go somewhere else for a year, get a particular GPA and then you can start next semester or sophomore year.
Why would schools do this?
Because it protects yield and other statistical elements of their freshman admission profile. When colleges offer you a guaranteed transfer spot, this is not a spot in the freshman class, so when that college reports the number of students admitted, or even their average SAT scores, they don’t have to include you.
This enables these colleges effectively to fill their classrooms with students but maintain the appearance of selectivity that will help them climb to the top of the rankings.
USC Also has a “Trojan Transfer” program that is essentially a way the school gives a leg up to legacies.
What it also does is put prospective freshman in a difficult situation. You’re forced to go somewhere else for a year, where you feel like you can’t really put down roots, you miss out on the freshman bonding experience, but at the same time it’s better than rejection, right?
But you get to go to a higher ranked school. Yeah.
2. Admitting Huge Numbers from the Waitlist
Yet another tactic some colleges employ, which keep their yield and general statistics up is creating huge waitlists and filling large swaths of their class from that waitlist.
Colleges have to report how many offers of admission they give, but statistically, the waitlist doesn’t play into the yield equation. Assuming waitlisted candidates have lower scores and grades, if colleges only offer spots to those on the waitlist that write letters of continued interest, they can skip over the kids who wouldn’t have accepted their admission offer anyhow, and keep their statistics in check.
If students are “too good” colleges could also use this tactic to weed out the ones who won’t be attending.
UC Berkeley, for example, filled nearly 1/3 of its freshman class from waitlisted candidates, with nearly 1/2 of students on the waitlist being offered a chance of admission.
3. Large Transfer Programs
Another way schools protect their statistics is by creating large transfer programs in general.
Some schools have dramatically higher transfer admission rates than regular ones, and again this protects those freshman statistics which are viewed heavily in ranking analysis.
However, that’s not necessarily the full story for many schools. Some schools may have multiple motivations for these practices, and others may be motivated for different reasons.
While some schools may be protecting freshman admission rates, others may be trying to open opportunities to those who’ve attended community college with the idea that often students who didn’t succeed in the first round of college admissions with all the test scores and everything may still be very promising candidates. Historically, students from underrepresented and lower income backgrounds also often choose community college for financial reasons, so offering transfer positions can help boost diversity at colleges, while still offering the potential to find well qualified candidates who are already succeeding in a college environment.
4. Using Test Scores as a Proxy for Wealth
Some colleges have pressure from their administration to bring in more students who can pay their own way.
Some of these schools also want to advertise that they meet the demonstrated need of all or most of their applicants.
One way some schools have manipulated this situation…
While early action helps colleges understand whether they are your first choice, early decision is binding. It protects their yield in a clear way.JAKARTA, KOMPAS.com – Indonesian President Joko ‘Jokowi’ Widodo is set to give his maiden speech to the United Nations General Assembly, more than five years after his first term as the country’s head of state.
Unlike other heads of state who made their way through New York's Manhattan traffic to the UN headquarters to deliver their speech, Jokowi’s oration is determined by the Covid-19 pandemic ravaging Indonesia and the rest of the world.
“[The Presidential Secretariat] will be tapping [sic] Jokowi’s speech beforehand, as it will be delivered virtually in line with Covid-19 [health protocols],” said Presidential Secretariat Head Heru Budi Hartono on September 22.

“It will be played on the UN General Assembly at 8.30pm on September 22 in New York, or 7.30am, September 23 Jakarta time.”
Heru added that President Jokowi will make his speech for the Assembly’s Open Debate session, where he and other heads of state will convey their visions and policies. Heru declined to say what the President will highlight on his speech.
Aside from Jokowi, Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, Environment and Forestry Ministry Siti Nurbaya, and Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection I Gusti Ayu Bintang Darmawati will also address the UN General Assembly.

Jokowi has yet to address the UN General Assembly, since he was inaugurated as Indonesia’s seventh President after he won the 2014 presidential elections.
From then until 2019, then-Vice President Jusuf Kalla has gone to New York to deliver the speech to the annual UN General Assembly on Jokowi’s behalf.Additional Information

Abstract
Three experiments investigate the effects of mixing items of different types in the same list. Experiments I and 2 compare the immediate serial recall of high- and low-frequency words in pure and alternating lists. In pure lists high-frequency words are better recalled, but in alternating lists the two types of words are recalled at intermediate, and identical, levels. Experiment 3 compares the recall of words and nonwords. In pure lists nonwords are recalled substantially less well than words. In alternating lists nonwords gain a substantial recall advantage compared to pure lists but are still less well recalled than words, which are recalled at identical levels in both mixed and alternating lists. The results refute item-based redintegration accounts of frequency effects in immediate serial recall and provide evidence for the importance of inter-item associative mechanisms.

U.S. Shipping Partners rethinks ATB plans
U.S. Shipping Partners L.P. (NYSE: USS) is rethinking its ATB newbuilding plans--and is buying a Jones Act chemical tanker.
In reporting its results of operations for its third quarter ended September 30, 2005, the partnership notes that In August 2004 it entered into a contract with Southern New England Shipyard Company (SENESCO) to build a 19,999 dwt articulated tug barge (ATB at a fixed price of $45.4 million to be delivered in early 2006.
The agreement also provided for options to build up to an additional three ATB's.
U.S. Shipping Partners says SENESCO has indicated it is "not able to complete the first ATB on the contract terms due to infrastructure problems and production line issues, and that the completion of the barge will be delayed."
The partnership says it "has entered into a revised agreement with SENESCO regarding completion of the ATB at another facility which SENESCO will operate. The total cost of completion of the ATB pursuant to the revised agreement will be approximately $53.0 million with a contracted delivery date of December 2006."
The revised agreement includes "substantial penalties for late delivery."
The partnership and SENESCO have "mutually agreed to cancel the options to have SENESCO build up to three additional ATBs at a fixed price."
While the partnership says it "believes that it can contract with other shipyards to deliver additional ATBs, no assurance can be given that the partnership will be successful contracting with other shipyards to build additional ATBs on terms acceptable to the partnership."
TANKER ACQUISITIONS
Elsewhere in today's announcement, the partnership notes that on September 9, 2005, it took delivery of the Houston, a 240,000 bbl Jones Act double-hulled product tanker. The purchase pricel, including legal, survey and other acquisition costs, was $25.3 million. The vessel was drydocked at a cost of $3.5 million and placed into service on October 13, 2005.
On November 2, 2005, the partnership entered into a memorandum of agreement to purchase the Sea Venture, a 19,000 dwt double-bottomed chemical/product tanker. This vessel was re-built in 1983 and is capable of carrying twenty different grades of product in independent cargo tanks.
The partnership says it expects to close the purchase of the Sea Venture in late November 2005 and immediately drydock the vessel. It estimates that the total cost to purchase and drydock the vessel will be approximately $12.0 million and plans to finance it with available cash or its current credit facility. The vessel is expected to join the partnership's fleet in April 2006.
The partnership says it "feels that the Sea Venture will provide valuable flexibility to its current and future customer base" and notes that "with the addition of the Sea Venture to its fleet, the Partnership will own three of the five Jones Act parcel tankers with twenty or more independent tank segregations and will further reinforce its position as the leading U.S. Jones Act owner of chemical-capable specialized tankers."
Paul Gridley, Chairman and CEO, stated, "The acquisition of the Houston is consistent with the partnership's strategy and has been integrated seamlessly into our existing operation. The Sea Venture will further strengthen our position in the Jones Act chemical trades when it enters service early next year. In addition, the third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength and stability of our business."
For the three months ended September 30, 2005, the partnership reported net income of $4.5 million as compared to $6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004. The decrease of $2.0 million resulted from a decrease of $3.3 million in operating income, partially offset by reduced interest expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, net income increased to $17.0 million from $7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The increase of $9.5 million resulted primarily from an increase in operating income of $1.9 million and reductions in interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment of $3.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Net income per basic limited partnership unit was $0.32 for the three months ended September 30, 2005, as compared to $0.83 per unit for the three months ended September 30, 2004. Net income per basic limited partnership unit increased to $1.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2005, as compared to $0.96 for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The average number of basic limited partnership units outstanding increased to 13.8 million in the three and nine months ended 2005 from 7.8 million in the comparable 2004 periods as a result of the partnership's November 2004 initial public offering.
For the three months ended September 30, 2005, operating income was $6.0 million, compared to $9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004. Increases in general and administrative expenses of $1.2 million coupled with a reduction in revenue of $3.1 million were partially offset by decreases in vessel operating expenses of $0.8 million and voyage expenses of $0.2 million. The decrease in revenue is partially attributable to scheduled drydock offhire days coupled with a slight decrease in time charter equivalent rates which was primarily the result of weather delays caused by the hurricanes. The remaining decreases in revenue, vessel operating expenses and voyage expenses were primarily attributable to the absence of a chartered-in vessel during the third quarter 2005. During the third quarter 2004, the partnership chartered-in a vessel to fulfill its obligations under contracts of affreightment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, operating income was $20.4 million, compared to $18.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The increase of $1.9 million resulted primarily from the addition of the Charleston, which was delivered in April 2004.

A piece of paper, 15 minutes and 12 questions—those three things may be all it takes to determine whether an aging adult is showing signs of cognitive impairment, according to researchers from The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.
In an effort to diagnose dementia in its earliest stages, Douglas Scharre, director of the Division of Cognitive Neurology for Ohio State, and his colleagues developed the Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination—nicknamed SAGE—an at-home mental functioning test that older adults can give themselves.
"Current treatments for dementia conditions like Alzheimer's disease work better the earlier you start them," says Scharre. "But people are waiting an average of three to four years after family members notice significant memory or thinking changes before they would see their primary care physician for the first time."
SAGE aims to eliminate the need for an elder to go to their doctor to receive a preliminary cognitive evaluation, and thus hopefully identify more individuals who are still in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
Diagnosing dementia is a multi-step endeavor
For a doctor to determine whether a senior is suffering from full-blown dementia they typically must conduct a series of diagnostic evaluations, including so-called "mental functioning tests," a full physical workup, a neurological exam and brain imaging scans.
SAGE falls into the mental functioning test category, which also includes the mini-cog test and the mini-mental state exam.
The mini-cog test involves completing two tasks: drawing a clock face with the hands pointing to a particular time and all 12 numbers in their proper places, and remembering the names of three objects and being able to recall them a few minutes later.
The mini-mental state exam is comprised of around a dozen questions and problems designed to test an individual's mental functioning. These questions range from "What is today's date?" to asking a person to spell the word "world" both normally and backwards.
How accurate is it?
SAGE is similar in design to its predecessors, with one major difference.
While both the mini-cog and the mini-mental state exam must be given by a specially-trained administrator, one of SAGE's primary selling points is that it can be taken by adults in their own homes, without anyone else present, and still offer accurate results.
"The test's self-administered features allows it to be taken virtually anywhere," says Scharre. This can be especially appealing for seniors whose cognitive health seems questionable, but who are reluctant to go to the doctor.
A recent scientific evaluation of SAGE's precision found that it was 95 percent accurate in determining when an individual was cognitively healthy and 80 percent accurate in determining when an individual was exhibiting signs of mental decline.
What do the results mean, and who should take it?
SAGE cannot diagnose dementia, it can only detect whether an older adult's brain isn't working as well as it should. A doctor follow-up is crucial for anyone who decides to take the exam, especially if they receive a low score by missing six out of a possible 22 points.
Test takers should keep in mind that results should always be taken with a grain of salt. Everyone's baseline brain functioning is different, so a low score on SAGE isn't automatically a cause for concern, according to Scharre. "Everyone has different cognitive levels and some have had previous brain issues such as mini-strokes or head trauma. If their score is a bit low, their physician may conclude that it is normal, given their medical history, and no further workup is necessary." Even if an individual's results come back as normal, they should still present it to their doctor to use as a baseline to help detect future cognitive concerns.
When asked who should take the test, Scharre says anyone experiencing problems with their memory or thinking ability might want to consider setting aside 15 minutes for the evaluation. He also suggests using the test as a baseline for anyone 65 or older, regardless of whether they have signs of dementia.
"I hope that individuals taking SAGE will present it to their doctors to start the conversation and be evaluated to diagnose brain conditions at a much earlier stage than is currently being done," he says. "In that way, needed treatments and supervision can be instituted earlier, which could improve quality of life for patients and caregivers."

By the time the two leaders sat down in front of their video screens, the summit had been downgraded to a “meeting” and the White House made clear that little concrete agreement, and no breakthrough, was to be expected.
The meeting lived down to expectations, uneasily combining a more sober and realistic US assessment of the parlous state of bilateral ties with what seems a return to a pre-2017 model of surface bonhomie and references to the “the long-term work that we need to do together,” according to a senior US official. Despite the assurances that Biden wants meaningful and substantive discussions, from Taiwan to AI to hypersonic missiles, the flashpoints between Beijing and Washington continue to grow with little indication that the conflictual trajectory can be altered. The challenge facing Biden and his team is how to deliver on their stated goal of “outperforming” the Chinese while preventing an open clash between the two.
Beyond Xi ironically calling Biden his “old friend,” given Biden’s previous assertion that they are not, the three-and-a-half hour meeting did little to reduce any tension between Washington and Beijing. The sparse readout from the White House instead revealed two sides with largely irreconcilable differences over everything from Taiwan to trade. As a senior administration official noted just before the meeting, the administration is “not trying to change China through bilateral engagement [because] we don’t think that’s realistic.” Xi’s own rhetoric makes clear that the CCP sees itself in a continuous struggle with America and the liberal West, and that not only rejects, but seeks to undermine liberal norms abroad.
Biden and his team seem to be embracing the reality that the days of cooperative engagement with China are long gone. The mantra now is “managing the competition” and installing “common sense guardrails” to avoid armed conflict. Given Beijing’s repeated refusal to discuss crisis management or confidence building measures to improve maritime security, or to engage in discussion over nuclear weapons, calling for guardrails appears to be little more than wishful thinking.
More importantly, one must compete in a competition, and after Monday’s videoconference and contentious, if not failed meetings between administration officials and Chinese in Alaska and Beijing, the administration must come up with a realistic plan of not simply holding the line, but actually advancing American interests. That starts with a serious examination of the greatest risks in the US-China relationship, and honestly assessing what the US can and will do about them.
At the top of the list is Taiwan, where it seems the height of folly for Beijing to abandon its policy of long-term patience and instead risk an armed conflict with Taipei and Washington. Yet, Xi warned Biden yet again over increased US support for Taiwan. Beijing also is not willing to sit by and watch as other nations in Asia and around the globe pledge support for Taipei, thereby raising the costs of any potential Chinese intervention. Of particular concern to the CCP is Japan’s seeming willingness to get involved in a Taiwan crisis. For Biden, he must decide how far to push Beijing on Taiwan and whether he will seriously risk war with the world’s second largest military.
On AI, hypersonics, 5G and the like, Biden needs to come up with a serious plan to ensure American and allied industrial and technological competitiveness over the next generation. Here, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s inclusion of the US Innovation and Competition Act in the annual defense bill, is a step in the right direction, and far better than the pork-laden $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that Biden signed just before his meeting with Xi (none of which should benefit Chinese construction companies).
Biden’s new rhetorical realism is welcome, and he is right to focus on developing American domestic strength. Yet he, and those leaders who come after him, must embrace the uncomfortable reality that Beijing and Washington are not merely competing, but are in an increasingly adversarial relationship, as acknowledged recently by CIA director Bill Burns. Beijing aims at neutralizing the US position in Asia, weakening countries it considers adversaries, dominating the global economy so as to add further to Chinese wealth, and ensuring the survival of its authoritarian, Leninist model of control inside China.
American policymakers are just beginning to break a half-century habit of seeing “win-win” outcomes (as the Chinese would put it) from US-China ties. Avoiding self-delusion is hard enough, but the real work is just beginning. Monday’s Biden-Xi meeting will soon be forgotten as tensions once again rise. The question is whether America has a serious plan to meet the most critical test of its abilities since the 1940s, and possibly since the 1860s.

Terra Nova Robotics (FIRST Tech Challenge team 6002, Basilisks) continued their march to their fifth straight appearance at the World Championships by taking the Robot Design Award at the Western US Championships last week.
The Western US Super-Regionals is one of the five regional tournaments across the globe that advance to the World Championships, so their Robot Design victory ranks them amongst the favorites to repeat Terra Nova's (all-girl team Antipodes) accomplishment two years ago, becoming FTC Robot Design World Champions.
This year's road to the World Championships began long before the official start of the FTC season. The Basilisks spent the entire summer working on an advanced swerve drive system (four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering),
and were fortunate it was compatible with the new game rules revealed in September. The swerve drive is extremely complicated and requires considerable maintenance, so they've been holding back on using it during the driver-controlled portion of their matches. At the World Championships, however, they plan to unleash the swerve's full potential.
FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Tech Challenge (FTC) is a high school robotics league that begins each season in early September with the revelation of a new challenge, demanding completely different design solutions from previous years. This year's challenge involves robots picking two-inch blocks off the field floor and scoring them in baskets, then lifting themselves off the floor on pull-up bars in the last few seconds of each match.
The Tribune's Jane Northrop put the following questions to the team:
What's unique about the design the judges noticed?
Senior Tim Hagen, 17, -- "Our swerve drive has six motors, 40 sprockets and 11 sets of chains on four levels. That could easily have become an impenetrable wall of metal. I think the judges were impressed we had the foresight to configure it so big systems could pass through it before we even knew what this year's challenge would require.
What has been the most challenging thing about this competition year?
Senior Bryce Chadwick, 17 -- The most challenging part has been adapting our designs between tournaments, and adjusting our strategies around them. There's not a lot of time and a lot of pressure because they HAVE to work.
How much time per week do you spend on robotics?
Junior Andy Snitovsky, 16 -- I have put in more than 800 hours this season, so that works out to around 20 hours a week basically year round. Robotics takes such a long time because the design process requires a lot of iteration. On the other hand, we used Computer Aided Design (CAD) extensively this year, and that saved us from a lot of rework.
What did you learn this season?
Junior Ashley Fryslie, 16 -- I'd never been in a position where I had to lead people for so long, and it was honestly quite scary. But in retrospect, I realize that being team leader really helped me mature and I'm happy I did it.
What's been the most rewarding part of the season?
Senior Matt James, 17 -- The most rewarding part was being able to apply many of the things I've learned in Trigonometry and Calculus. Learning those things in class is cool, but using polar coordinates, integrals and derivatives in our programs and seeing them work is amazing.
For a team like Terra Nova that struggles to raise more than $10,000 for robot parts each year, doubling their budget with a month's notice is challenging, but they're hoping the Pacifica community will rally to their cause so they can attend the championships. They've set up a GoFundMe page: "Terra Nova Robotics: World Championships" to make it easy for Pacificans to sponsor their trip. You can access that directly from the link, search for it through the GoFundMe website, or click the DONATE button on the Terra Nova Robotics home page:. Even the smallest donation will gain you entrance to a sendoff reception (or you could make a donation during the event) in a few weeks at the Oceana Gallery on an evening to be determined.
If you'd like to learn more about Terra Nova Robotics or FIRST, Google "Terra Nova Robotics" (or call 650-350-9132). There you'll be able to see photos and videos from last year's tournaments. Unfortunately, this year's robot is still under wraps, unless you had the good fortune to see it in person or in this newspaper.
--Terra Nova Robotics and Jane NorthropHave you ever noticed how many novels are about white guys who can’t get their life in order? SO MANY. I mean, Tom Perrotta built an entire career out of them (which didn’t work out so well in his last novel). They’re so abundant that they even manage to sneak up on you. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve picked up a book that sounded fascinating only to discover that the promised narrative is secondary to how the white male protagonist just can’t stop screwing up his life. Take Fourth of July Creek, which shifted the promised story of a reclusive anarchist to the background in favor of a white male social worker so inept and self-destructive it’s a wonder he survived as long as he has.
Obviously, each of these books should be weighed on its own merits, but the sheer volume of books featuring this type of character has made my tolerance for their stories incredibly low. If it’s going to grab my interest, it has to be either really good or come at the character from a slightly different perspective. Unfortunately, these hurdles (which shouldn’t be that hard to clear) are rarely met–even as publishers continue to churn them out into the marketplace.
I also realize that I’m essentially complaining about an entire genre–I might as well say that I’ve developed an intolerance for cozy mysteries where the female protagonist owns a quirky shop and romances the seemingly cold-hearted detective. But here’s the thing: these novels aren’t treated like a genre. They’re treated with grave respect.
This is the case with Nathan Hill’s The Nix, which received near-universal acclaim upon its release. It portends to be about the relationship between a mother and son. This relationship is complicated not only because she abandoned him when he was a child (believing she would one day cause him great pain), but because in the present she has been arrested for throwing stones at a presidential candidate with an unsettling resemblance to Donald Trump (even though this was published before he ran for President in 2016). It promises to be a whirlwind story about America’s tumultuous political century, the stifling expectations of motherhood in the not-too-distant past, and the story of a family. But it’s not.
Instead, The Nix spends its first two hundred pages barely even touching on those plotlines. Instead, we hear all about how Samuel, our protagonist, wastes away his time on a World of Warcraft-esque video game called Elfscape. Like, we hear about it a lot, with in-depth descriptions of the game, the world it portrays, and the characters Samuel hangs with while he plays instead of focusing on his work as a professor. We also take a detour into a confrontation between Samuel and a plagiarizing student handled so ineptly by Samuel that you know it’s going to snowball into a conflict that may cost him his job. Then we go into Samuel’s childhood and his friendship with his school’s bad boy (and his intense crush on that friend’s sister).
Throughout all this, we barely get any glimpses of the mother, even though the parts we do get are the only interesting parts of the book. Hill seems a capable writer, but his debut novel is far too sprawling, far too enamored of its own ideas to come to any relevant, cohesive points. Like so many books before it, it focused on an uninteresting white male character at the expense of what would have been a fascinating story. I gave up at the halfway point and I feel comfortable not knowing how Samuel’s life shakes out.

partyon my body, and this caused a reaction in my body and I’m now allergic to bees.
- I had two chicken pets. The first one is super dumb and eats whatever. The next one is very smart. She refused to eat anywhere but the plate I gave her.
- I prefer to receive
wildflowersover roses.
- Telling people about myself is one of the hardest things to think about.

How does one go from hearing the just declaration of God’s universal wrath (1:18) to exulting in God’s gracious love (8:38-39)? Paul established that every man without distinction is condemned in sin and under God’s wrath (Rom 1:18-3:20), and that justification is by faith alone in Christ alone (3:21-5:21).
1. The Christian’s Responsibility with Regard to Sin, 6
→Each section teaches a fact with corresponding command
1) Christians are dead to sin and alive to Christ, and so must live that way, 6:1-14.
• The possible charge: “Since the gospel teaches believers’ every sin is covered by grace, this promotes the idea that they will sin with gusto so there’s more grace!”
• FACT: Believers are united with Christ so that sin’s power is broken and they will live for righteousness, 6:1-10.
• COMMAND: Therefore, Christians must live out this truth! Don’t be controlled by sin, serve God and righteousness, 6:11-14.
2) Christians are freed from sin and enslaved to Christ, and so must serve righteousness, 6:15-23.
• The possible charge: “Since the gospel teaches that believers aren’t under the Law (v. 14) this promotes the idea that they can sin all they want.”
• FACT: Being in Christ doesn’t give believers the freedom to sin, it frees them from sin and enslaves them to righteousness! 6:15-18
• COMMAND: Believers must zealously serve the Lord, their new master, 6:19-23
→The Christian’s responsibility with regard to sin is to stop sinning and serve the Lord.
2. The Christian’s Relationship to the Law, 7
→This section is about the Mosaic Law. Paul said that Christians are “not under law but under grace” (6:14). How is this? What does that mean? Does this mean the Law is sinful?
1) One must die to the Law to be joined to Christ to bear fruit for God, 7:1-6.
• This is illustrated by marriage: A woman who’s married can’t marry another man unless her husband dies, 7:1-3.
• One must die to the law to be joined to Christ, 7:4-6.
• Unbelievers’ life in the Law bears the fruit of death; believers’ life in the Spirit bears fruit for God.
2) Though the Law declares God’s holiness, justice, and goodness, it is the unwitting tool of sin, 7:7-12.
• The Law declares what is right and therefore identifies and condemns transgression.
• Sinners must be delivered from the Law, not because it is evil, but because it can’t justify or sanctify them.
• The only thing the Law can do for sinners is point out their sin and condemn
3) The Law is not to blame for sin, sinners are to blame for sin, 7:13-25.
• The struggle and failure to do good isn’t the fault of the Law but the sin nature. The problem isn’t the Law, it’s the sin nature.
• Sinners who depend on the Law for deliverance will always be frustrated and fail.
• Whoever relies on himself is without hope; whoever relies on Christ has victory.→
→ Despite the Law’s perfections it is powerless to justify and sanctify sinners. It always successfully discovers and prosecutes sin. The more one sins, the more the Law “works.” The problem isn’t the Law, it’s the sin nature.
→ Jesus, however, died on the cross for your sin, fully satisfying the Law’s judgment against it. The Law’s righteous demands have been fully satisfied by Jesus, not you. Because you died with Christ and rose with him and your sin has been forgiven, you are “dead” to the Law—it has no power or jurisdiction over you, you are free from the Law (Acts 13:39; Rom 7:3; 8:2; cf. also “under the Law,” Rom 2:12; 3:19; 6:14; Gal 3:10; 3:23; 4:21; 5:18).
→ The Christian’s relationship to the Law is therefore “dead” because his sin is forgiven and Christ’s righteousness is imputed. He is not justified or sanctified by the Law but by Christ.
3. The Christian’s Rest in Jesus Christ, 8
→ Every transgression the Law identified and condemned is “paid in full” by Jesus Christ, so that “there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.”
1) Through the Spirit believers enjoy justification, 8:1-11
• Believers in Christ through the Spirit are freed from the Law’s condemnation of sin, being justified on the basis of Christ’s sacrifice, 8:1-4
• Unbelievers cannot please God because the sin nature controls them and they are enemies of God, 8:5-8.
• Through the Spirit Christians are alive in Christ because of His righteousness, 8:9-11
2) Believers must participate in the Spirit’s sanctifying work, as He confirms they are God’s children, 8:12-17
3) The Spirit guarantees believers’ glorification in fulfillment of God’s gracious purpose, 8:18-30
• No matter what trouble believers experience now, through the Spirit their hope/yearning expectation is not for this world/life/now, but for eternity, 8:28-27
• Believers’ confidence in eternal glory despite present troubles lies with God’s sovereign, gracious purpose to save them, 8:28-30
4) Believers have absolute confidence in God through Jesus Christ, 8:31-39
• No charge can be made to “stick” against believers, 8:31-34
• Nothing can separate believers from the love of God in the Lord Jesus Christ, 8:35-39CKF just posted their year in review video which you can watch right here:
Derek and I are excited to start doing more outreach by sharing our story with others. In February we’re going to Derek’s high school to talk to two classes for two hours (!). The two classes are the anatomy and physiology class and the biology class. Being able to share what we’ve learned about the super cool organ that is the liver will be fun and a challenge. Luckily we’re kind of experts in the field of Derek’s liver. In the next few weeks we’ll put together our presentation and when it’s complete, maybe we’ll share it here.

Finnegan's Point is a small campground with limited space. Located 2-3 hours from the trailhead it is a good choice for those who will be getting a late start. It is also a popular first night destination for large groups as it allows them the opportunity to camp with few other parties competing for facilities. As space is limited you must be booked into Finnegan's Point if you wish to stay here. From Finnegan's Point it is 12.6 km / 7.8 miles to Sheep Camp.
Trail Mileage: kilometer 12.1 / mile 7.5Elevation: 76 meters / 250 feetSetting: Coastal forest, near riverUTM Coordinates: 8V 481571 6608342(NAD 83)

Canyon City is generally the first night stop for those spending 2 nights on the U.S. side of the trail. Staying here means a short (8.2 kilometer / 5.1 mile) second day hike to Sheep Camp, giving you an easier day before the more arduous push over the Pass. There is an interesting side trail just north of the campground that takes you to an historic steam boiler that powered a tramway from Canyon City over Chilkoot Pass during the gold rush.

Pleasant Camp is a good campsite to use as a staging area for a return trip to Chilkoot Pass for those who will be remaining on the U.S. side. The one way distance to Chilkoot Pass is 9.7 km / 6 miles. For experienced hikers who are accustomed to hiking longer distances Pleasant Camp offers a quieter alternative to Sheep Camp the night before going over Chilkoot Pass. From Pleasant Camp it is 16.1 km / 10 miles to Happy Camp.
Note: In the early season it is not recommended to stay at Pleasant Camp the night before going over Chilkoot Pass due to avalanche hazard.
Trail Mileage: kilometer 20.3 / mile 12.6Elevation: 305 meters / 1000 feetSetting: Treeline, next to creek UTM Coordinates: 8V 484957 6613515(NAD 83)

Sheep Camp is the last campground before Chilkoot Pass, making it the ideal staging area for the hike over Chilkoot Pass. From Sheep Camp it is 12.7 kilometers / 7.9 miles to Happy Camp; and, 16.7 kilometers / 10.4 miles to Deep Lake. Don't miss the Ranger Talk at 7:00 pm each evening.
Note: Early season hikers, regardless of ability, are strongly encouraged to stay at Sheep Camp the night before going over Chilkoot Pass due to avalanche hazard. An early departure from Sheep Camp (on the trail before 6:00 am) is essential to ensure safer travel through the avalanche zones early in the day when avalanche hazard is lower.

Happy Camp is the first campground after Chilkoot Pass, making it the most popular destination on “summit day”. Located in the high country, above treeline, the tent sites are exposed and the weather often severe. Spring hikers should be prepared to camp on snow. From Happy Camp it is 8.8 kilometers / 5.5 miles to Lindeman City; and 13.7 kilometers / 8.5 miles to Bare Loon Lake.
Trail mileage: kilometer 37 / mile 23Elevation: 884 meters / 2900 feetSetting: Treeline, overlooking lake near creek mouthUTM Coordinates: 8V 492132 6625233(NAD 83)

Smaller than Happy Camp, Deep Lake is a potential “summit day” destination for experienced hikers who are used to hiking longer distances and camping with fewer facilities. Though there is no cooking shelter here the weather is often better; and, located at treeline the tent sites are more sheltered. From Deep Lake it is 9.7 kilometers / 6 miles to Bare Loon Lake; and, 16.1 kilometers / 10 miles to Bennett.

Lindeman City is located in a beautiful, historic setting on the shores of Lindeman Lake. Today’s tranquil ambience stands in stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of 1898 evident in the relict landscape.
Lindeman is a camping place of choice for those spending 3 nights on the Canadian side of the trail. If spending only 1 or 2 nights on the Canadian side of the trail, Lindeman is within striking distance (11.3 kilometers / 7 miles) of Bennett by train time. With two campgrounds to choose from it offers a quieter camping experience.
The main base of operations for Parks Canada patrol staff is located at Lindeman: don’t forget to visit the exhibit in the interpretive tent at the Warden Camp and pick up your trail completion certificate.
Trail Mileage: kilometer 46.7 / mile 29Elevation: 747 meters / 2450 feetSetting: Open forest, on rocky outcrop overlooking lake. UTM Coordinates: 8V 497876 6628630(NAD 83)

Within easy striking distance of Bennett by train time, Bare Loon is a popular – though sometimes crowded – final night destination. As space is limited you must be booked into Bare Loon if you wish to stay here. From Bare Loon it is 6.4 kilometers / 4 miles to Bennett.
Trail Mileage: kilometer 53.1 / mile 33Elevation: 670 meters / 2200 feetSetting: Forest edge, at river mouth near lakeshoreUTM Coordinates: 8V 500079 6634157(NAD 83)

Once a bustling tent city, Bennet is located on the shore of Lake Bennett at the northern terminus of the Chilkoot Trail. Of historic interest is St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church – the last remaining gold rush era building along the Chilkoot Trail. The scenic campground at Bennett is located in what was once the heart of the historic townsite.
Bennett is generally the final night destination for those spending 5 nights on the trail. Accessible by train, or floatplane, it is also a potential overnight destination for campers who do not wish to hike the entire trail, or those wanting to rendezvous with a party who has hiked over the trail. A Camping Permit is required for overnight camping at Bennett. Fees apply (for those hiking the Chilkoot Trail the Bennett camping fee is included in your Trip Permit).
Note: Lunch is available at the WP&YR depot from 10:00 am – 2:00 pm (Alaska Daylight Time) on train days – making a reservation before your hike is strongly recommended. The depot is closed at all other times.
Return to Choosing Your CampgroundsSalka Valka thinks back on her life one sleepless night and tries to decide weather to let go of the love of her life Arnaldur. She has lived through hardship and a lonely childhood and defied the limitations of rank and gender by becoming a boat owner and a sailor. But when it comes to her lover she puts his interest above her own.
“The spacious stage is dimmed. To the right a woman looking out a window of a small room. We hear a ships bell signaling departure. In the far the magnificent mountains but close to us the small towns pier. It is raining heavily. This first image in the play Salka – a love story in the old fish factory in Hafnafjörður is unforgettable so powerful was it and again and again in this play moments like this appeared where drama, visuals and sound brought one to a heightened state..” Silja Aðalsteinsdóttir DV October 25th 1999

Besides religion - which is the most successful method for scams - fraudsters are adept at coming up with methods seemingly "ripped from the headlines" in order to bilk funds from those who listen, Borg said.
"The fraud level in the United States is somewhere over $20 to $25 billion a year," Borg said.
Here are a few more examples:
Natural disasters. For two years after Hurricane Katrina, Borg said, investigators found dozens of frauds related to real estate, redevelopment and recovery-related businesses offering promises of big returns on just a little invested.
Gas prices. "When gas was over $3.50 a gallon, we opened up one or two oil and gas scams a week," Borg said. "Everybody knows gas is going up. So they promise they've found oil in places with new technology to get it out, or new technology that can find oil where it hasn't been seen before."
Small business fraud. An entrepreneur has an idea for a business, but cannot get capital because of tight credit. That leads them to go to other, non-traditional sources besides banks for their start-up costs.
Overseas credit documents. These usually involve paying money up-front on the promise of more money later.
Regardless of the avenue a scammer uses, they find willing investors because many are looking to turn their money worries over to someone else, Borg said.
Besides the elderly who fear outliving their savings, there are the middle-aged, who have seen investments shrivel in the economic downturn and have little saved for retirement.
"They're desperate for some safe and relatively easy way to make money," he said. "That makes them susceptible."
And there's the young, maybe with lingering student debt and skepticism about the stock market and traditional investments following the slow-motion crash of 2008.
"They want to know what else is out there," he said. "What makes con artists good is their understanding of human psychology."
Anyone looking for information about investment frauds or wishing to report suspicious activity can find information at the commission website.I’ve only been to one fashion show…but it was a good one!

I don’t fully believe the report…….I think it is all already here, and it is destroying everything. We have no Autumn, the trees are dying, and any rain we get (not that we get much) is radioactive as hell. Our water stinks, and I cannot fully describe how bad it has gotten here. The trees are starting to get that gray look that the pine trees in the rain forest had three years ago when health issues forced me to move closer to town.
They just lie. The truth is far worse. Young pets are dying of cancer at age 2-3. I am grateful my cats are advanced in age (like me) they live inside, and are somewhat protected from the outdoor rays. If I were to get another pet, it would be older.
Pets don’t usually die at that young age, but the radiation is hitting them. It is usually dogs who need to go outside every day.
Hmmm. Concentrations as high as 100 Bq/m3. Lets see, the Canadian drinking water standard its 10 Bq/l. That would be 10,000 Bq/m3.
I guess”high concentrations” is a relative term.Workers Reveal Plans to Release New Jobs in 2017, According to CareerBuilder Survey

It’s easy to picture the relaxing, feel of Mediterranean home decor in your mind’s eye. Whether you’ve spent a week or a few months living in one of the many Mediterranean cities, or if you’re just visiting, it can be hard to resist the comfort of this distinctive style. Let’s look at some of the ways that Mediterranean design has shaped our own homes.
One of the most striking features of the Mediterranean home decor style is the use of colors that are soft and airy. For example, a deep green shade might be used on the walls in order to create a warm and comforting atmosphere, while a pale blue hue might be used as an accent color against a beige wall to evoke a soothing sea breeze. Soft rugs can be used on the floor to set off the color palette, as well as a number of furniture pieces that are inspired by the region such as tables, mosaic tiles, and vases.
One of the most obvious influences of the Mediterranean style in Mediterranean homes is furniture. Many of the pieces you’ll find are shaped like oases or geometrical shapes, which give the impression of long, relaxing baths. For those who want to add the feeling of being lost in the landscape, an oasis table, with its beautiful intricately cut crystal top and wicker accents, is a perfect addition to a room. The focus on texture and material in this type of Mediterranean home decor is on relaxation, rather than presenting an image of wealthy comfort.
Furniture in the Mediterranean is also free of ornamentation, clutter, or needless frills. The focus on practicality and the natural beauty of the materials used helps to create a calm and organic atmosphere. In many cases, the pieces you see have never been touched by a human hand. This is part of the reason that the appearance of the tables in a modern Mediterranean home can look so antique, even though they are made of durable wood. In addition, the materials used are also free of sharp edges and corners that can damage the image source if not properly protected. This often results in the extra attention that is required when dealing with the Mediterranean look – in order to make sure that the pieces do not end up permanently damaged, as a result of people inadvertently bumping into them.
One of the best ways to bring the Mediterranean home decor style into your interior design is to use it in exterior design. A unique feature of the architecture of many of the Mediterranean countries is their emphasis on simple lines. In many cases, the houses are quite similar, despite the fact that the elevations and streets differ. However, the great thing about using the simple geometric forms in exterior design is that they work extremely well with the large variety of textures and colors available in the Mediterranean. This can be used to great effect to accent the various features of the outside environment, including the color of the tiles used in the garden, the various plants and flowers, and the landscape design and decorative items such as statues and wall decorations.
In addition to using the borders as decorative patterns, you may want to think about integrating soft rugs into the exterior design scheme of your Mediterranean home. The warm tones and colors of the rugs will help to bring the colors and patterns of the Mediterranean to life, while the softness of the rug will help to soften the appearance of the hard lines of the architecture. When integrating the soft rugs, you should remember to choose a design that has a slightly softer top color than the bottom color. This is to balance out the appearance of the hard surfaces that are so common in the typical Mediterranean architecture.
As you are looking at the different colors and textures available in a typical section of the Mediterranean, you will also want to pay close attention to the details. One of the things that you may find with the more intricate detailing is that they tend to stand out more against the background of the area. For this reason, you may want to look for more muted designs that can be accented with the more detailed tile work and patterns. If you choose the right soft rugs, you will find that the mosaic tiles that you have used to create the image source of your Mediterranean home will blend perfectly with the various plants and flowers that you have chosen. In most cases, the images that you will find in your Mediterranean will be those that are created by using the mosaic tile techniques, rather than ceramic or granite tiles.
While Mediterranean interior design offers many choices, it is important to remember that the exact colors and patterns that you use for your Mediterranean home decor should be very close to the colors and patterns that you would normally use in your own interior design. If you try to use very sophisticated materials that are far removed from what you would normally use, you may end up having a very odd look. Instead, stick with materials that are very close to what you would usually associate with the Mediterranean, and you will be able to use the unique style of mosaics and soft furnishings that make up this type of interior design to give you the look you are after.
If you’re looking for Mediterranean home decor
you have a wide variety of possibilities. Traditionally, the Mediterranean is one of the hottest destinations in terms of travel and vacation. This is true not only because of the many attractions it offers, but also because of the welcoming culture that’s evident from the many tourist destinations it pulls into its path. If you’re looking to create the Mediterranean feel in your own back yard, there are plenty of things you can do to turn your backyard or patio into an extension of your home. From subtle landscaping to decorative touches, there are endless ways to make your back yard Mediterranean style.
The first thing you need to do with any Mediterranean decor is to determine what form your Mediterranean homes take. There are two basic forms: classic and modern. In Mediterranean decor, the classic style is characterized by muted hues, mostly shades of brown and terracotta. These are accompanied by a sense of stability, often coming from the sturdiness of the stucco and the earthy tones found in the pavers. Examples of this are the flagstone borders on stucco homes and the terracotta arches found on some balconies. Common Mediterranean furniture pieces that feature earthy tones include the hammock, the curved sword and the plump pottery.
A Mediterranean home is most easily recognized as it features light colors, particularly white. Unlike the heavy, dark colors common in other styles, such as French, the palette of Mediterranean colors tend to be softer and more elegant. Common colors include pastel pinks, creams and sky blue. These colors combine together in complimentary shades such as soft greens, lilacs and beiges, which impart a sense of peace and tranquility to your Mediterranean home.
To complete the look of your Mediterranean house, you’ll want to add some accessories. One of the easiest and most inexpensive ways to do so is with hand-carved wooden plaques. Plaques can also be purchased in different materials, such as aluminum or wrought iron. You can purchase Mediterranean-style doors, such as those that feature an interior stone or metal door with a wooden trim, or you can select exterior windows that have hand-carved wooden siding. Exterior windows with siding are the perfect way to bring the beauty of the outdoors inside your Mediterranean house.
When integrating hand-carved wooden plaques into your Mediterranean home interior design, consider using the Mediterranean style as your inspiration. By following the lines of the art, you will be able to incorporate the aesthetic motif into your interiors. For instance, if the wood is intricately carved, you can use this same motif to create staircases, a patio or even a back porch.
A final consideration in your Mediterranean home decor is the use of ceramic tile, tiles and other soft rugs. Soft rugs are a great accessory to any room in your home because they help break up the blank walls. They can serve as an image source when using images like the Mediterranean landscape or Mediterranean sea. The soft rugs and ceramic tile that you find available today are truly some of the most beautiful items you will find. If you want to add a rustic look to your interiors, consider using an old-fashioned washbasin and dish towels on your ceramic tiles.
Colors are one of the most important components of creating an elegant look, and there are several colors that you should use in your Mediterranean home decor interior design. Neutral colors that you can use on all of the walls and ceilings are very effective. However, if you want to break up the space, opt for bolder colors that will provide contrast. For example, red walls and ceilings will tend to make a room seem more dramatic than a color scheme consisting of gray, blue, black and white. For a bolder look, go with blues, greens and violets.
One element that is often overlooked in an oriental design is the focal point. Focal points can either be a work of art or a unique item that draws the eye to a specific area of the room. For instance, many people use mirrors in their Mediterranean kitchens and bathrooms. A well-placed mirror in your kitchen can serve as a focal point that adds beauty to the room. For a unique item, you might want to use a wooden chess board as a focus in your bathroom.- Rank20

Express Scripts shot up this list after a 2012 merger with rival Medco Health Solutions more than doubled the company’s sales. Last year, the prescription drug plan manager’s revenues continued to increase on the whole — up 10.8% — while profits jumped 40.8% to $1.9 billion. Still, sales fell in both the third and fourth quarters as the company contended with losing the business of insurer — and former Medco customer — UnitedHealth Group, which started handling its medical and pharmacy benefit plans in-house in early 2013. Looking ahead, Express Scripts expects its earnings per share to increase between 10% and 20% annually for the next several years thanks to expected growth from its mail order and specialty drug businesses.Re-edit of an earlier image I thought looked a little flat.

- Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.
By Erwin Seba
HOUSTON (Reuters) -.
"This has not changed, and anything said to the contrary is untrue. Additionally, if employees were to decertify, the company would return employees to work."
Decertification is the process to remove a union from representing employees at a given location. The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is reviewing a petition signed by at least 30% of the locked-out workers that could lead to a vote to decertify USW Local 13-243 in Beaumont as their representative. No date for a vote has been set.
Workers at the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont refinery and adjoining lubricant oil plant, which makes Mobil 1 motor oil, are scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the company's contract offer.
Bryan Gross, USW international representative, said the company chose to begin the lockout on May 1.
"The company asked, 'What has the union done?' The union has helped with groceries, assisted with bills, and is now providing health insurance for all of the 'world-class employees' at a multi-billion dollar oil company put on the street instead of bargaining in good faith for a fair contract," Gross said on Sunday.
The USW has urged workers at the refinery to reject the contract offer in Tuesday's vote.
The union filled a complaint with the NLRB in June alleging the purpose of the lockout was to remove the union.
Exxon said it began the lockout to prevent the disruption of a possible strike.

Just wondering if anyone have any ideas on how to allow the catera to run cooler? Is there any threads with previous recomendations or ideas. I see my car running kind of warm. With it mainley running on the notch after half. Is there a certain coolant/water mix that is recomended, any after-market radiaters? Any ideas would be great. Thanks

You could try running a cooler thermostat. For the radiator, try cleaning out the fins. Some people swear by "water wetter" products, RedLine makes one, but I've never notice much of a difference with them. Aftermarket oil coolers with larger capacity will help. It's also winter, so running your heating system should also help.

Running it cooler will lower your MPG and if your car is in good shape it should be able to hold a steady temp... mine sits around 200 and on the highway it drops to about 192... and only in the summer with AC blasting I've seen it up aroudn 210.. and thats that for me...
BTW your game may be inacurate... you need to change your sensor... and that may fix random oscilations of the gauge on the dash... I got the scan gauge and that moves up and down by 10deg and the gauge on the car just sits there...
Also it doesnt start to rise until about 130ish ..

I saw a tip on this board to get the cooling system flushed and filled and it will lower the running temp. I tried it, and it definitely works. Before, I was slightly above the halfway mark most of the time, now I am below the halfway mark most of the time. Before, I could get close to the 3/4 mark when stuck in traffic on a hot day, now it never happens.

When OSHA set quantity requirements for annual refresher training without setting stringent quality requirements, safety training began a never-ending downward spiral. The vast majority of ALL safety training, OSHA required and otherwise, is low-quality training that has little to no impact on performance in the workplace. This was certainly not the intention or the fault of OSHA, but they started the movement and have yet to do anything to stop it.
After interviewing tens of thousands of workers, we seldom find any who truly value safety training. There are exceptions, and some are quite innovative and effective; but they are in the minority. Most safety training is boring and repetitious. It is to be endured rather than relished. It is demotivating and sometimes even demeaning.
But this is not a characteristic of training in general; only of safety training. It does not have to be so. Safety training can be stimulating and thought expanding. It can establish focus and help to address specific issues. It can build effective cultures and foster teamwork. Often, the amount of effort and resources needed to turn boring training into dynamic training is well worth the effort. Organizations should seek to maximize the impact of their safety training rather than just keeping the organization in minimum regulatory compliance.

Edited by Martha K. Raymond
Alexander Rutman
Lead Stress Engineer
Joseph Bales-Kogan
Stress Analyst
Boeing Commercial Airplane Group
Wichita, Kans.
In most designs, load-distribution calculations can literally make or break the part. Distributing loads through a structure typically depends not only on the mechanical properties and dimensions of materials but also on the stiffness of the fasteners connecting components. Traditionally, engineers have used analysis based on single spring rate calculations to model fastened joints. The methods determine joint flexibility for a particular combination of fastener and plate properties. This approach is adequate for one or two dimensional joint models, but can’t describe 3D joint models when fasteners and joints don’t share the same reference plane.
However, a finite-element model provides more realistic load distribution between components of the model. The new approach considers the effect of independent components on joint flexibility and represent assemblies with a complete platefastener system of the joint.
In 3D joint representation, structural components are modeled by plates with membrane, transverse shear, and bending stiffness. The plates are positioned at the components respective midplanes without offset. Fasteners are modeled with the actual properties. A coordinate system with one of the axes parallel to fastener axial direction must exist to orient modeling elements. Using this coordinate system, fastener- plate interaction is modeled by spring elements representing bearing stiffness of the joint. Each plate is connected rigidly to the fastener in its axial and both bending directions.
When beginning a fastener joint-stiffness analysis, there are three basic stiffness components to consider: plate-bearing stiffness, fastener-bearing stiffness, and fastener shear and bending stiffnesses. Plate i bearing flexibility is calculated as:
where Ecpi is the plate i material compression modulus and tpi is the plate i thickness. The fastener bearing flexibility at plate i is also included and calculated by:
where Ecb is the fastener material compression modulus.
The combined fastener and plate bearing flexibility at plate i is Cbi = Cbpi + Cbbi and the combined bearing stiffness at plate i is:
The fastener shear flexibility between mid planes of plates i and i + 1 is determined by:
where Gb is the fastener material shear modulus; tpi, tp(i + 1) is the thickness of plates i and i + 1 in the joint and Ab is the fastener cross-sectional area described by:
where Dbis the fastener diameter.
The fastener shear stiffness between mid planes of plates i and i + 1 is calculated as
FASTENER-JOINT MODELING
The new approach to fastener joint modeling improves fastener behavior in a joint and generates easily readable output that doesn’t require a lot of postprocessing.
A plate-fastener system takes into account three parameters including: elastic bearing deformations of the plate and fastener at the contact surface; bending and shear deformations of fastener shanks; and joint-displacement compatibility between fastener and connected plates.
The modeling process includes two basic steps. The first one models fasteners separately and then models the interaction between the fastener and plates.
In MSC/Nastran by MacNeal- Schwendler, a finite value of fastener shear rigidity AbGb is created by entering the appropriate value of Gb for the fastener material, calculation of the actual cross-sectional properties, and giving area factors for shear value of K = 1.
A fastener is modeled by beam elements with cross-sectional properties calculated as:
where Db is the fastener diameter and I1 and I2 are moments of inertia of the fastener.
Then the required fastener shear flexibility Cs (i,i + 1) is determined by:
To define a fastener shear plane and axial direction correctly, you must have a coordinate system with one of its axes parallel to the fastener axis. Points defining connectivity between plates and fasteners with the same orientation reference this coordinate system.
Verify compatibility of fastener-plate system displacements using the following rules of thumb: A plate can’t slide along a fastener, and a plate and fastener have the same slope under bending. Then, the fastener is connected to each plate of the joint by spring elements with stiffness:
The software program called FEM joint analyzes fastener joint stiffness and generates grid points and elements for modeling fasteners and by automatically determining interface conditions between fasteners and plates, for integration into MSC/Nastran FEM.
The approach can be applied to different types of models, by changing values that affect joint flexibility. However, it doesn’t account for fastener pretension and fit.
© 2010 Penton Media, Inc.Selling a tangible product is a little easier than selling digital services, because at least people can see face to face what it’s all about.
So how do you go about selling your ‘intangible’ digital services to small businesses?
1. Find the pain points.
The first thing you want to do is find out their pain points and offer a solution for them. We covered how to find out a business owners pain points in this previous post.
The reason you want to do this is because the first thing you want to present to a business owner is the outcome. In other word, you want the business owner to start visualizing the solution in their minds.
And you can successfully do this by getting them to imagine their business without these pain points.
2. Focus on the outcome.
This is what business owners are most interested in. “What da heck can you do for me? Why am I talking to you?” And they don’t have much time. This is why you go straight to the outcome.
This creates “positive expectancy” for them. And it’s a very good mindset to have in general. Focused on the result, living the result, enjoying that result. You want to present yourself as the source of all this.
If they hire you for Facebook or Google ads, show them how much they can expect their conversion rates to increase. Show them how much more revenue it is going to drive for them. In other words, here is their current profit margin, this is what they can expect.
You’ll find that the more specific you get, the easier it will be to close the deal. This, of course, makes sense if you are offering a solution to their pain point and not something they don’t have an issue with.
So, if you go into details, it will be easier for you to seal the deal versus being general.
Why?
Because it shows you’ve done your research and understand their marketplace and issues that their particular business is facing. This builds more trust that you can actually solve their problems.
3. Emphasize the features and benefits.
Only after you got them interested by showing them the outcome will you actually market your product or service directly by mentioning the features and benefits.
If you do this first, you will most likely bore and annoy them, and it’s hard to come back from that. Start with getting them excited because they’ve found out you can make their pain points disappear.
The idea now is to get them even more excited about the actual tool and/or emphasize the additional benefits they are not yet aware that they’ll receive.
“So you’re telling me I can collapse that entire building that’s in my way just by knocking down that one single wall??
“Yes, and you can do it just by clicking a few buttons here.
“Seriously?? Where do I sign.”
That’s a very crude way of explaining the point of this step, but I’m sure you grasp the concept.
4. Show the value.
A lot of businesses are understaffed, and there are many that would hire you just because they don’t have enough time. So they are basically purchasing your solution, your time AND their time as well.
So if you can do the job better than them, save them time in the process, and increase their bottom line…that’s a huge value added to their business.
Keep in mind that this too is a pain point.
More often than not, business owners can’t hire good talent. That’s why they use consultants and contractors. This is why it is so important to figure out their pain points first, which can also be a lack of time in their business.
If you can use that in your sales meeting, you’ll be much more likely to close the deal.
5. Anchoring.
You never want to talk bad about your competition. However, if you can show why you are a better choice, they will hire you over the competition.
This is the time to present how efficient you are, as well as everything else that they’re getting with you, that they won’t get with the competition.
This is a good time to mention previous satisfied customers by using testimonials.
Keep in mind that you do not have to have lower prices. We talked previously about how to price your services in this post.
What you need to emphasize are better results and not lower prices. Lower prices attract lower-quality clients.
You can even find out about your competition straight from the business owner by asking about their previous experiences and what went wrong. This way, you won’t make the same mistake.
Pro Tips
1. Choose your prospects wisely.
What does this mean? It means to go after those clients that fit your services the best.
The ones you know you can make a difference in their business if they become your client. Ideally, their worst pain points are the easiest for you to solve.
2. Stop developing products and services and start setting up systems.
What is a system? Think of it like building a car, for example. If it goes through the factory once and everything works, it means it can be built the same way, over and over again.
So let’s say you help local gyms, you have a system that helps them get clients, and you know that it works every time.
That system could involve Facebook lead ads or whatever it may be… now you have a system in place that you can replicate over and over again.
That’s all well and good, but here’s the problem. If you start taking on a whole bunch of different types of clients, that means you’ll have to come up with a whole bunch of different systems.
So you might have SEO clients, website clients, Facebook ads clients… If you offer all of these different services, for all of these different types of clients, guess what?
It becomes extremely hard to be consistent, as well as get consistent results, for those clients.
Think about it long term. If you have one core type of client, and one core type of system, you can bring on a team, or even develop a software that automates the whole process, so you continue to deliver great results, over and over again.
And you can still charge higher prices. Charge premium prices in order to attract higher-quality clients. Choose the clients that you’re going to work with, and then start selling systems in order to continuously get them results.
3. Speaking of results.
When you find a client, you’ve identified their pain points without even contacting them first, and you have a system in place, you can offer them a solution as the first contact. “Hey, I saw you have this problem, so I fixed it for you. It’s a 14-day free trial, let me know if you’d like to continue.”
I’m sure you get the idea here. This is called “a foot in the door” technique. It sets you apart from the crowd and presents you as their problem solver.
CONCLUSION
Once you understand where a business owner is coming from, selling your services to them is not hard at all. Just make sure you go through the list above to set you up the right way, and you’ll find closing clients a lot easier. inform [1]. At present, there are no established therapies which have been shown to delay onset or alter progression of this disease. In addition to cognitive impairment and a wide variety of psychiatric features, HD is characterized by a combination of complex hyper-and hypokinetic motor syndromes that vary among affected individuals, and change over the stages of disease within a single individual. Hyperkinetic motor signs include involuntary chorea movements, which peak in early and mid-stage disease in adult onset individuals, and subsequently decline as the disease progresses. Dystonia is another involuntary motor disorder which occurs predominantly in later stage disease. Bradykinesia, or paucity of movement, is a voluntary motor impairment that is present very early in the course of disease and progresses steadily to end-stage akinetic rigidity. Except for the use of Botox for isolated dystonic reactions, chorea is the only motor symptom for which there are therapeutic options.
Age of onset in HD can vary from early childhood [2] to advanced age [3], but most commonly occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years. After onset the disease follows a progressive degenerative course with an average duration of approximately 20 years, when age of onset is between 20 and 50 years of age [4]. Chorea is an early and highly visible sign of the disease in approximately 90% of adult-onset HD patients, peaking at about 10 years after first emergence of this symptom, then gradually abating as the disease progresses. Chorea is mild or absent in juvenile onset disease and in 10% of adult onset patients. The pattern of choreic movements differs among individuals and can include facial pouting, grimacing, and lifting of alternate eyebrows; forward, backward, and rotational neck and trunk movements, upper and lower extremity asymmetric flexion or extension of both small and larger muscle groups, and frequent crossing of the arms and legs [5]. The gold standard definition for onset of HD remains an open debate (plos) Although it is now known that cognitive and behavioral symptoms may predate onset of motor signs in many patients [6], onset, as defined in PREDICT-HD is that point in time when the investigator is confident in the diagnosis of unequivocal motor signs. However, in clinical practice, due to its high visibility. chorea is the motor sign most often used as the clinical marker that defines onset of the disease in adults [7].
It is generally agreed that drugs are available in clinical practice that can improve chorea [8],[9],[10]. However, as summarized in the 2009 Cochrane review “Therapeutic intervention for symptomatic treatment in Huntington’s disease,” there is a lack of sufficient efficacy studies for individual drugs, and lack of drug comparison studies to obtain clear clinical guidance regarding drug choice. The authors cite TBZ as the antichoreic medication with best available clinical evidence; but they were unable to give any specific recommendation about best medical practices for treating chorea [11]. Lacking an adequate evidence base, we surveyed an international group of HD experts to ascertain practice-based preferences. Within the limits of expert opinion, and with the expectation that future clinical research will provide better information, we present survey results, and propose an algorithm to guide the clinical management of chorea in HD. The goal of the algorithm is to concisely deliver relevant and expert knowledge to point-of-care medical providers, and to update when evidence-based recommendations emerge. [12],[13]..
Treatment indications: Respondents were first queried about factors that would warrant drug treatment of HD chorea. The most noted indications were stigma factors of patient embarrassment and social isolation, physical injury, loss of balance, and interference with employment or sleep. Interference with caregiver tasks rated highly, but family stigma factors of embarrassment and social isolation were not considered as compelling as treatment indications.
Table 1. Percentage of respondents choosing specific indications for drug treatment of chorea. chorea in Huntington’s disease?” In iterative manner for each separate query on drug or drug class, respondents were asked to choose either (1) first choice, (2) alternative monotherapy, (3) adjunctive therapy, or (4) inappropriate, (5) insufficient experience. Interpretation of results for this set of questions was complicated by limitations inherent in survey software, which allowed the respondent to check more than one first choice, or to check no first choice. An additional complicating factor for this set of questions was that respondents were asked to consider chorea as an isolated symptom, which is an uncommon situation in real-world clinical practice, where comorbid symptoms strongly influence choice of chorea drug. See figures 1-3 and table 2.
Table 2. Choice of drug for treating chorea across all geographic regions. N is number of responses. Percentages are relative to N. See box 1 for abbreviations..
Perceived effectiveness of drug choice: Ratings for the perceived effectiveness of APD and TBZ for HD chorea were similar for these two treatment options. Experts rated APDs for the treatment of chorea as follows: “very effective” (20%), “effective” (64%), or “somewhat effective” (16%). No respondent perceived APDs as ineffective. Experts rated the perceived effectiveness of TBZ as follows: “very effective” (20%), “effective” (48%), and “somewhat effective” (28%). In contrast, most respondents who used either BZD or amantadine rated both medications as only “somewhat” or “minimally” effective as monotherapy.
Preferred APD monotherapy for HD chorea: There was wide variation in APD choice. Olanzapine and risperidone were most preferred. Tiapride, a first generation neuroleptic not available in North America, was preferred by 50% of European respondents. Again, due to survey software limitations, several respondents checked more than one first choice. Regarding APD dosing for chorea, though specific dose range for individual drugs was not addressed, 92% of respondents preferred APD dosing lower than manufacturer recommended recommendations for treating psychosis.
Table 3. APD of first choice (all geographic areas). APD listed only if chosen by more than two respondents.
Preferred BZD for adjunctive therapy: Clonazepam was the preferred BZD for adjunctive treatment of chorea by 79.5% of respondents, with several citing its lower addictive potential compared to other BZDs. Lorazepam was chosen by a minority (12.5%) of respondents.
TBZ specific practice: Several questions focused specifically on TBZ, including contraindications, interval titration of dosage, frequency of depression as a side effect, and treatment strategy for TBZ-associated depression. Regarding contraindications: the great majority of respondents (90%) would not use TBZ with concurrent active depression, but indicated that past or treated depression was not a contraindication for use (88%). Given a past history of suicidal gesture, 24% would not use TBZ, while a larger fraction (48%) would not use the drug if a suicide attempt had been made at any time in the past. Regarding dose titration intervals: the minority of respondents (16%) chose the 1-2 week titration interval recommended by Lundbeck Inc., distributor of the drug in the United States. More respondents (50%) chose a 2-4 week titration interval, and 26.5% chose an interval of more than 4 weeks. Regarding TBZ-associated depression: respondents reported the perceived frequency of occurrence as follows: “very frequently” (4%), “frequently” (14%), “somewhat frequently” (36%), and “infrequently” (38%). When depression occurred with TBZ, 26% of respondents decreased TBZ dosage, while 10.2% added or increased dosage of an antidepressant without changing TBZ dosage. A larger number of respondents (34.7%) did both: decreased TBZ dosage and added or increased antidepressant therapy. A minority of respondents (20%) discontinued TBZ. When depression occurred, most respondents (69.5%) reported that it was more likely to occur in the first two months of TBZ therapy, but many cited lack of long-term experience with TBZ.
Frequency of perceived side effects due to APDs or TBZ: Respondents rated the frequency of observed side effects associated with APDs and TBZ (Table 4). When comparing APDs and TBZ, experts reported that sedation and cognitive decline appeared to occur at similar frequencies (less than a 3% difference). Apathy, Parkinsonism, metabolic syndrome, and tardive dyskinesia side effects were perceived to be higher for APDs than for TBZ. However, depression was frequently cited as a side effect of TBZ. Akathisia (motor or psychic restlessness) was reported as a side effect for both types of agent at similar frequencies. Due to an error of omission in the survey queries, swallowing disorder associated with APDs and TBZ could not be compared.
Table 4. Side effects reported as occurring "very frequently" or "frequently" with APDs and TBZ. See box 1 for abbreviations.
First choice of drug when comorbid symptoms are present: Though the majority of survey questions concerned the treatment of chorea as an isolated symptom, it is more common for HD patients to present with multiple symptoms that may influence choice of drug. APDs were the universal first-choice drug for treating chorea when it occurs in the setting of comorbid symptoms of psychotic or aggressive behaviors, and active depression. If poor compliance was suspected, APD was preferred over TBZ.
Combining APDs and TBZ: Following the original survey, additional information was solicited about the clinical practice experience of combining APDs with TBZ. Though a smaller number (32) of the original {49) respondents who cited experience with treating chorea responded to the appended question, most of this subset (75%) had experience combining APDs and TBZ. The majority of those who had used the combination (80%) cited the need to control chorea and concurrent comorbid symptoms. A smaller fraction (40%) had used the combination to treat severe chorea not adequately controlled by a single drug. As for each agent independently, experts combining APDs and TBZ reported Parkinsonism, apathy, and akathisia as the most common side effects.
Indications for drug treatment: Drug treatment decisions for HD chorea have the goal of improving quality of life. However in practice, assessing the benefit of treatment on quality of life is difficult because there have been no chorea studies that have used quality of life as a measure, and lack of studies on chorea’s impact on stigma or motor dysfunction. Further, assessing side effects of chorea drugs, which include apathy, Parkinsonism, and worsening cognition are difficult to separate from signs of disease progression. There has also been general disagreement about the impact of chorea, citing the lack of patient awareness [14] as a rationale to forgo treatment. However, subsequent studies have shown that lack of self-awareness occurs more broadly across the spectrum of HD symptoms including dyskinesia [15] as well as cognitive, social, emotional and functional abilities [16], for which lack of awareness would not influence treatment decisions.
Impact of chorea on motor dysfunction: Studies have shown that chorea negatively impacts motor function for accuracy of movement, reaction time, and gait regulation [17],[18],[19]. However, HD is a mixed movement disorder with hypokinetic components that also negatively impact function. So it is difficult to assess the relative contribution of chorea and hypokinetic components in total motor dysfunction, particularly in early or middle stages of adult onset disease when chorea is more prominent [20]. In contrast, bradykinesia begins early in adult onset disease [21], and correlates with decline in functional capacity over the entire course of disease [22]. Bradykinesia and rigidity are the dominant motor impairments in juvenile onset [23] and late-stage adult onset patients. Late stage bradykinesia is a strong predictor of nursing home placement [24].
Although direct clinical research is lacking on chorea’s functional impact as an isolated symptom, even in those with severe chorea, there are several studies suggesting that chorea may play an independent role in functional disability. The suppression of chorea improved writing speeds by 50% [25]. Chorea score was a major factor in impairment of motor tracking, or of accurately completing a motor task [20]. In a retrospective analysis of CARE-HD study participants, severity of chorea independently correlated with functional disability among a subgroup least affected by non-chorea symptoms [26]. In very-early-disease subjects in the TRACK-HD study, motor scores were more highly associated with earliest functional decline in HD than cognitive or behavioral scores. Among the separate motor components, chorea scores showed the highest correlation with loss of function [27]. In later-disease subjects, severity of chorea was an independent predictor of fall frequency and gait disturbance in HD, and more highly correlated to number of falls than voluntary motor impairment [28].
Survey results support a trial of drug treatment for motor component dysfunction when HD chorea causes difficulty performing motor tasks at the workplace, causes imbalance and falls, results in physical injury, or interferes with sleep.
Impact of chorea on HD stigma: Though multiple factors are involved in HD stigma, chorea’s high visibility likely contributes to embarrassment and the social isolation of affected individuals and families. While there are no studies that have included quality of life measures in HD, related studies in other diseases suggest that stigma is high across the spectrum of chronic neurological disorders, particularly those that include visible motor components. Studies in epilepsy [29], multiple sclerosis [30], and Parkinson’s disease [31], indicate that stigma impacts quality of life in these disorders. Studies of the high stigma which occurs in Tourette Syndrome (TS) and related motor tics may more closely approximate the stigma related to chorea in HD [32]. Further, in both HD and TS , the movement disorders are often mistaken for alcohol intoxication which in turn may further increase the level of stigma [33].
Stigma in HD can likely be assessed by use of a scale validated for use in other chronic neurologic disease [34], which suggests the type of interview question that might be asked: “Because of my illness: (1) I feel embarrassed in social situations, (2) people avoid me, (3) strangers tend to stare at me, (4) people seem to be uncomfortable with me.” The high frequency of stigma and discriminatory events that occur in individuals with a positive HD family history who have no symptoms has been documented in RESPOND-HD study [35]. It is unclear how substantially chorea of the affected family member contributes to stigmatization of unaffected family members. However, it may be a factor to consider in treatment decisions..
Chorea drug treatments: For the indications listed, this survey supports the use of drugs for the treatment of chorea with the goal of reducing symptom severity. Though not addressed specifically in the survey, there is general agreement that pushing therapy to eliminate chorea will cause unacceptable levels of side effects. Because each drug alternative has significant side effects, a careful evaluation of risk-benefit must be assessed for each individual prior to initiating drug therapy, and reassessed frequently both during drug titration and over the course of treatment. Because chorea severity decreases with later progression of disease, the need for chorea treatment should be reassessed over time. Further, the presence of comorbid symptoms should greatly influence the choice of drug for treating chorea.
Antipsychotic drug treatment for HD chorea: Though it is an off-label use, the first choice of most international respondents for treatment of chorea is an APD. Importantly, APD use is strongly preferred when psychosis, depression, aggressive behaviors, or poor compliance are comorbid factors. Although the use of second generation APDs was generally preferred, tiapride a first generation APD was a frequent European choice, and the lower cost of haloperidol, a first generation APD was a factor in treatment choice for several respondents in all geographic areas. The choice of a specific APD was quite varied, which reflects the lack of evidence base to guide drug choice.
Only small studies and case reports are available; there are no large placebo-controlled or head-to-head comparison studies of APDs for treatment of HD chorea. Chorea benefit was demonstrated in a small placebo-controlled trial of haloperidol [36]. Olanzapine has been used in small open label studies with variable benefit [37],[38],[39]. A few reports note benefit with risperidone [40],[41], and quetiapine [42]. Benefit was shown in small open label [43] and placebo-controlled [44] trials of tiapride, available in most countries in Europe. A study with clozapine suggested minimal benefit, and significant side effects [45]. Studies with aripiprazole, a third generation APD, found a reduction in chorea similar to that observed with TBZ [46]. In the only study to compare functional capacity differences between a second generation APD (clotiapine) and TBZ for treatment of chorea [47], 38 participants were followed for a minimum of 2 years. Loss of functional capacity was greater in the APD group (N=10) than that in the TBZ group (N=28). However this study is retrospective and assignment to APD or TBZ was not randomized. This points out the important need to study and compare potential treatment-related functional losses in a prospective and randomized manner..
Table 5. Side effect profiles for APDs used for HD chorea.
Tetrabenazine treatment for HD chorea: In North America, when choice was not influenced by other factors, TBZ was preferred almost as highly as APDs for chorea treatment. In both North America and Europe, TBZ was a consistent alternative monotherapy choice. TBZ is the only drug that the U.S. Federal Drug Administration has approved for the treatment of HD chorea. TBZ is also available in Canada, Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK. The efficacy of this drug was shown in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study conducted by the HSG, in which drug was given as tolerated up to 100 mg/day [48]. A 3.5 point change in chorea score, or a 23.5% reduction from baseline was demonstrated in the treated group (chorea score range is 0 to 28), with about 50% of the treated group achieving a 6-point or greater improvement compared to 7% showing this level of response in the placebo group. Importantly, however, more adverse events occurred in the treated group, including somnolence, insomnia, depressed mood, agitation, akathisia, and one suicide. However, after stable dosing was achieved, there was no significant difference in adverse events between the treated and placebo groups. During the 80-week open-label extension phase of this study, a similar side effect profile emerged [49]. No quality of life issues were measured in this or any other TBZ chorea drug trial. In the present survey, the perceived frequency of TBZ side effects, except for depression, was similar to or slightly lower than those perceived for APDs in treating chorea. For HD in general, and particularly with the use of TBZ for HD chorea, it is imperative to have heightened caution regarding depression and suicide risk. While studies suggest that risk of depression with TBZ is more likely to occur in those with pre-existing depression, it can also occur in those with no history of depression prior to TBZ [50]. As in the placebo controlled trial, survey responders reported more depression during the titration phase and first 2 months of stable dose TBZ treatment. However, functional capacity appeared to be better preserved in a small number of patients treated with TBZ than in those treated by an APD over a 2 year time period [47]..
Benzodiazepine treatment for HD chorea: In a single study, high doses of clonazepam (up to 5.5 mg/day) were required to suppress chorea [51]. Survey respondents did not endorse use of BZDs as monotherapy, but thought BZDs an adjuctive therapy.
Amantadine treatment for HD chorea: Two small placebo-controlled studies of amantadine for HD chorea provide conflicting results [52],[53]. When a meta-analysis of the combined trials was performed as part of the Cochrane review [11], the differences between treated and placebo groups did not reach significance. Similarly, survey respondents disagreed about the use of this drug. When chosen, amantadine’s most frequent use was as adjunctive therapy, though others thought its use inappropriate.
Based on the results of this international expert survey, a clinical practice algorithm for the treatment of chorea..
Limitations: Survey results are not a substitute for evidence-based study. Instead, these results present treatment options based on a synthesis of opinions from a large group of experts. As shown in this survey, practice patterns are influenced by the practice experience learned in subspecialty training and/or geographic location. And although Lundbeck Inc, has created mechanisms for mitigating TBZ cost for low-income and non-insured individuals in the U.S, practice decisions were influenced by the cost and complexity of prescribing this drug in the United States. Recall bias may also have occurred, with survey results limited by the accuracy of respondents’ recall, with potential for over- or underestimation of both drug efficacy and drug side effects.. Though we believe the survey questions were comprehensive, they did not cover every possibility and may have omitted other useful queries. Further, selection of experts surveyed was not systematic, but included those active in clinical research known to the authors.

Author rolesTrading a lack of significant lineup holes to address, have prompted speculation that the Honda West Division-leading club might keep quiet ahead of April 12. That would certainly buck the trend of recent seasons, in which Vegas has come in just under the deadline on deals for Robin Lehner, Nick Cousins, Alec Martinez, and even captain Mark Stone.
Even if a deal matching the size and scope of adding a Lehner or a Stone is highly unlikely to materialize, general manager Kelly McCrimmon wouldn’t be doing his job properly if he didn’t at least prepare for the possibility of such a move. That requires checking in on what’s out there and who might be available that can help your team, but it also involves knowing what you have to offer. The Golden Knights’ solid prospect pool and fairly stable collection of draft picks ensure McCrimmon possesses the tools to be trade-ready should an opportunity arise.
Here is a ranking of the organization’s best trade assets (note: I’m only including plausible ones – Vegas isn’t offering up a Shea Theodore, for instance):
1) Peyton Krebs
I considered placing Cody Glass here, but I can’t see any possible trade target who would interest Vegas enough to dangle an already-productive 21-year-old center with No. 1 potential on a cheap contract that lasts through next season. Much of that description applies to Peyton Krebs, Vegas’ top prospect, as well.
Krebs may not be producing at the NHL level right now as Glass is, but there’s little doubt that the 20-year-old, a point-per-game player across stops in the AHL and WHL this season, is ready to make the jump. However, as his demotion from Henderson to the WHL’s Winnipeg ICE highlights, finding space with the big club won’t be easy. Of Vegas’ options down the middle, Glass is a future building block, while William Karlsson is signed through 2027 and Chandler Stephenson through 2024.
You’d hate to lose a future star in Krebs, but the club’s depth at the center spot allows them to at least entertain the possibility of using their best prospect as a highly coveted trade chip.
2) The Young Blue Liners (Zach Whitecloud, Nic Hague, Dylan Coghlan)
As with Glass, it’s hard to see the Golden Knights being eager to part with young, cost-controlled contributors to the big club. After all, the trio of Zach Whitecloud, Nic Hague, and Dylan Coghlan have logged big minutes on the back end, all while each counting for less than $800,000 against the cap. That combination of solid productivity on bargain, rookie-scale contracts seems like manna from heaven for a cap-crunched team like Vegas, so why would they unload these guys?
Well, McCrimmon will have some tough decisions forthcoming as these entry-level deals expire. Hague will be in need of a new contract at season’s end, while Whitecloud and Coghlan will be restricted free agents after next season, at the same time as Glass. In all likelihood, Vegas can’t afford all of them, so it might be time to sell off one or two while they still have enough term left to retain trade value.
3) Secondary Prospects
Krebs isn’t the only player in the Vegas organization with a bright future in the league. Ivan Morozov, Brendan Brisson, Kaedan Korczak, and Pavel Dorofeyev all possess the raw skills to play in the NHL for a long time. Although Nick Suzuki (Montreal) and Erik Brannstrom (Ottawa) still have the chance to develop into stars, the club has – to date – demonstrated a keen understanding of which young prospects they can part ways with in trades without living to regret it.
While all four prospects have considerable potential, none seem particularly close to the big leagues just yet. Morozov is turning heads in the KHL for St. Petersburg SKA, Brisson is starring with the Michigan Wolverines of the NCAA, and Korczak and Dorofeyev are getting their feet wet with the Henderson Silver Knights. In short, these are precisely the type of future assets that you sacrifice for a run at the Cup.
4) Draft Capital
Perhaps the most impressive part of the Golden Knights’ Stanley Cup-caliber roster is that it hasn’t left the organization’s draft pick cache barren. While the benefits of their expansion draft stockpiling are largely over, Vegas has maintained their own first and second-rounders moving forward while also adding the New Jersey Devils’ 2021 second-round pick (along with QMJHL standout blueliner Lukas Cormier) in the Nikita Gusev trade.
The funny thing is the Devils’ pick might be of similar value to Vegas’ own first this summer. While the Golden Knights expect to pick near the back of the draft’s first 32 selections, New Jersey will surely be among the first teams to pick each round, owing to their 9-13-4 mark in the MassMutual East Division. Neither selection will land a sure-thing prospect, and the trade value attached to the pick will surely reflect that. But what will likely be two picks among the top 40 can only help in pursuit of trade deadline reinforcements.
McCrimmon has done a nice job of creating options for Vegas. They have a deep enough developmental system that could potentially prolong their success even as some of the team’s current established veterans begin to decline. On the other hand, they have a strong combination of assets to entice a trade partner should the right deal come along. Maybe that won’t happen before April 12, but if it does, McCrimmon’s front office should be ready to strike.
.Broke government defaults on rent, civil servants locked out
Hundreds of civil servants have been loitering in the city centre this week after their offices were locked out by a landlord because the government defaulted paying rent estimated to run into millions of shillings.
The civil servants, attached to the the Ministry of Sports, Culture and the Arts, have been locked out of their offices in Uchumi House since Monday.
Doors to their offices have been locked by chains and padlocks by the landlord who has refused to grant them assess until all arrears are settled.
NO EXPLANATION
No explanation has been forthcoming from ministry officials.
The Sports Ministry occupies the third and eleventh floors of the building located on Aga Khan Walk. The two floors house the department of library services.
The Minister Hassan Wario and his Principal Secretary Patrick Omutia operate from the neighbouring Kencom house.
A visit by Nairobi News to Uchumi House confirmed that the landlord has locked out the civil servants.
Guards manning the building have been strictly instructed not to allow anyone access the affected offices.
“There is nobody in those offices. The workers have been locked out after government failed to pay rent,” one of the guards told our team.
Our team took the lifts to third floor and found doors leading to the offices locked with chains and padlocks.
PICTURES AND VIDEOS
We even had time to take a couple of photos and a video of the locked doors!
One of the affected civil servants confirmed to us that the workers have not been working since Monday.
“We are just loitering here since Monday. There is no word from anyone on the way forward,” he said.
A spokesman at the Ministry of Sports confirmed the stalemate.
“I am just back in the country at the moment and I have not been briefed properly on the update, but the time I left, we were trying to process monies to reduce the arrears,” he said.I just got more tea in today! I’m kinda overwhelmed now. I definitely wasn’t expecting it all at once! If anybody wants to try any of my teas, please let me know and I would be more than happy to send you a sample.
This tea smells like some kind of soda in the bag. I made it to hopefully help me through the Genetics and Evolution test I have to take in an hour. I didn’t get much of the grenadine or vanilla flavor, mostly just the tea itself. I’ll have to try this in different ways and see what works best.Canberra-based rider Andy Blair has triumphed at the Enduro for the second year in a row

After five days of gruelling mountain bike around Alice Springs, Andy Blair has taken out the crown in the annual Mountain Bike Enduro.
It's the first back-to-back overall title in the event's five-year history.
"I'm fairly relieved to get through safely and not have any mechanicals all week," says Andy.
"I didn't pay quite as much attention this year to pre-riding sections but I did do a little bit, and there were a couple of crucial moments on the first couple of stages where I was able to use that to get a gap on the young boys," he says.
Ben Hogarth came in second, while third place was taken out by 36 year-old Chris Hansen, the first Northern Territorian resident to hold an overall podium position.
Victorian Melissa Ansett took out the women's title, saying she was surprised to win with such a strong field of competitors.
"Naomi Hansen's a very strong rider...there's lots of strong riders out there so I was quite surprised that I did so well," she says.
"Kind of weird in a way as I just enjoy riding, and do a few local races in my area, so to win a big event like this is pretty huge."

How To Start A Podcast - Quick & Easy: Video, PDF´sMobile app internationalization (I18n) is the process of customizing your code so that it’s ready for localization and able to be modified and released in multiple languages. Mobile app internationalization needs to come one step ahead of the mobile app localization process as your code needs to be ready to handle the localized content when it’s created. Think of localization as customizing the content and internationalization as customizing the code.
Below, we’ll take you through the mobile app internationalization journey and discuss the different steps and most important aspects that you need to focus on during the process.
Planning For Mobile App Internationalization
Plan Ahead
While localization doesn’t necessarily need to be planned ahead of the development process, mobile app internationalization does because in most cases, it’s harder to modify the code for internationalization after it has been created.
Not A “One Size Fits All”
While the internationalization process helps you modify your code in a way to accommodate any future additions of new locales, you need to keep in mind that there are no standards for this. There’s no one archetype that will perfectly adapt to every locale out there and you will have to make changes as you go along to suit the different needs of different locales.
Don’t Over-Internationalize
Believe it or not, over-internationalization is a thing. You might think that the more your code is adapted to more locales, the better it is. And while that might be true in some cases, you don’t need to support languages and locales that you won’t be using as this will just end up being a waste of your time, effort, and resources with no return whatsoever.
For example, if you’re developing an app to be used internally in a company that requires all of its employees to speak English or Spanish, then you probably don’t need to create support for other languages and locales.
Legal Considerations
When releasing your app in a different market, country, or even state, you need to make sure that your app complies with all of the local laws. Whether you’re distributing your app through the App Store or Google Play, you’ll still be the one held responsible and accountable for any legal issues that arise with your app.
You need to make sure that your app complies with local laws and regulations, and if it doesn’t, you might have to change some parts or aspects of it to adapt to different markets. For example, gambling games are modified for different markets in terms of payment systems, in-game currency, and randomized gaming elements to comply with the gambling laws of each market.
You also need to keep in mind that legal issues might arise depending on how your app is actually being used and not just the intent of how it was supposed to be used. This might mean that you won’t be able to release your app in certain countries. For example, gambling is illegal in countries like Korea and Taiwan. So releasing a gambling mobile game there would be illegal, no matter how hard you try to modify it.
Data Restrictions
Another thing to be mindful of when it comes to legal considerations is data restrictions. Different countries have different laws in terms of data storage, sharing, security, and more. These laws and legislations differ in terms of needing a permit to obtain users’ data, what data you can obtain, and how you can use it, including personal information (e.g. name, email address, social security number, etc.) as well as any user activities or behaviors.
One way to solve this is by using Practical Law’s Country Q&A Guide. Select the desired country and it’ll give you a high-level overview of data protection rules and principles, including obligations of the data controller and the consent of data subjects, rights to access personal data or object to its collection, and security requirements.
Code Modifications
The whole point of mobile app internationalization is to modify your code to pave the way for localization. This means that the code is able to load content from multiple files representing the supported locales, toggle between different content and settings depending on which locale is chosen, as well as support and display content of different locales with different lengths and formats.
Mobile App Internationalization For Text
Separate Content From Code
The first and most important thing that you need to do in terms of mobile app internationalization is separating your content from your code base. None of your app’s content can be static within the code in order to allow you to create different versions of that content, which is dynamically loaded and adapted for each locale.
This is different from code forking because you won’t be creating different copies of your code for each locale, instead, you’ll be collecting and storing your content in a central repository to be able to easily create different versions of that content for any new locales that you want to add and have it loaded in your app without affecting your code. This makes it easier for the development team to work on developing the app while the translators or team members handling the localization process can work separately.
The content includes:
Text
Images
Video
Audio
Date Format
Numbers
Currency
Text
You might think that you need to separate all of the text in your code, but that’s not the case. Not all text will need to be localized, just what appears in your app to your user.
There are many types of text in your code that never appears to your user and therefore doesn’t need to be extracted or localized. The types of text that you’ll need to add to your repository include:
Static strings of texts within the code.
Statically defined strings.
Text appearing in user interface, menus, buttons, etc.
Text loaded from external files (e.g. a Terms Of Service document or an End-User License Agreement).
String Interpolation
When you’re creating a multilingual mobile app, you need to keep in mind that languages aren’t just different words, and that the way sentences are structured can differ from one language to another and therefore mess up the sentences if you’re doing word-by-word translations or concatenating different strings and text variables together.
A way to solve this and create natural language sentences is through string interpolation. String interpolation allows you to insert variables directly into a string without concatenating multiple strings together. This allows the translator to see the full sentence and adapt it as or if needed, changing the order of any of the strings or variables accordingly.
For example, this C# code below where the strings are concatenated will result in the translator receiving different pieces of the sentence and translating them separately, which would cause an issue in the way the full sentence is formed when it’s put back together at the end.
string str = name + " has " + number + " friends.";
However, with string interpolation, the translator will receive the full sentence with the variables included in it, so they’ll be able to change the order of the sentence as needed.
string str = $"{name} has {number} friends.";
Context Matters
While reusing strings in different parts of your app can save you time and effort when localizing, this might end up causing you more problems than it saves you if you overdo it. The same string can be translated differently in different languages depending on the context of the text, which is why it doesn’t always make sense to just translate a string once and apply that translation to all of the different parts of your app.
You should only interpolate a string if you absolutely necessarily have to, but keep in mind that just because it makes sense in one language doesn’t mean it automatically will in other ones, and you won’t be able to predict the different contexts in those languages. Also, keep in mind that using a localization system with translation memory will eliminate your worries about inefficiency when you’re not reusing strings.
For example, “The high building” in Spanish translates to “El edificio alto”, while “The high tower” translates to “La torre alta”. Which shows that you can’t just translate the word “high” to either “alto” or “alta” because it will depend on the context of the text.
Numbers and Plural Forms
When including numbers in your text, you might think that you’ll always only have two cases of either singular or plural, but different languages have different numbering systems and different plural forms. Some languages have singular, dual, and plural nouns, while others have even more specific rules regarding few or many nouns and even the definitions of “few” and “many” differ.
Since this is a common issue, most systems nowadays offer support for localizing plurals across different languages. You can check out Unicode’s Language Plural Rules for more information when doing research about your target locales.
Mobile App Internationalization For Media
Media Localization
You might think that pictures and videos are universal, and in some cases they are, but in other cases, it would be preferred or sometimes even necessary to localize your media as well. For example, you have a taxi booking application that shows a picture of a yellow cab. Users in the US and other countries that have yellow cabs will recognize the reference, while others from countries like France and Italy that have white cabs might not, and they might even wonder what a yellow car has to do with your app.
You don’t want people to feel like your app is targeted towards just one set of users. Instead, give them a feeling that the app is universal by customizing the media, which needs to be easily recognizable regardless of your app’s different languages, locales, markets, and cultures.
Media Management
While some of your media might work perfectly internationally, once again, some just won’t and will need to be tailored accordingly. Which is why you need to ensure that the process of swapping media won’t be a hassle and that your localization system allows you to do so, just as easily as it would be with text translation.
For example, if you’re showing a sequential comic in your app, you would have to change the order of the panels according to the locales depending on whether the users there are used to reading comics from left to right or from right to left. Otherwise, you’ll leave the user confused or you might even send them a wrong message.
You can check out The Ultimate Guide To Mobile App Localization for a list of translation/localization management systems with media support.
Keep Original Assets
Make sure to always keep your source files for all of your media as this will be extremely useful later on whenever you want to make any edits or adjustments to them during the localization process.
Media Context
The same way context matters in terms of text and how it changes from one country and one culture to another, the same applies to media. Make sure to do your research beforehand whenever you’re entering a new market to avoid offending anyone or pushing anything that might be deemed inappropriate or unsuitable for your target market.
For example, in many countries, a pig’s snorting sound is considered offensive. So you’ll either have to modify that in your app or at least have the option to mute the sound to avoid putting the users in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Media Layering
When creating media for your app, it doesn’t make sense to make a hundred versions of each picture that contains text to translate that text to a different locale. Especially with mobile apps, this would be extremely inefficient and would drastically increase the size of your app. Instead, you need to separate your media in different layers.
Splitting your assets into different components can be a great approach if you have a lot of media to be localized. So you’d have the base image in one layer and then the text in another separate layer on top of that, which then would be loaded according to the selected locale.
Video Localization
When preparing for video localization, there are two main routes to go: either creating subtitles for the videos or dubbing them in a new language. Creating subtitles for videos is usually a lot faster and cheaper than creating new audio and redubbing your videos. And while it may be an okay option for some users, dubbing the videos in the locale’s language is definitely a lot more preferred as it delivers the full experience to the user.
In case you choose to go with subtitles for your videos, make sure that your app supports them, otherwise, you’ll have to create many different versions of the video with the subtitles hardcoded into them, which would be inefficient and defeats the entire purpose.
Mobile App Internationalization For GUI
Text Support
Unlike earlier text encoding standards, Unicode has the ability to represent all the different language out there. It’s not mandatory to use Unicode for mobile app internationalization, but it is highly recommended as it will make the process a whole lot easier instead of having to worry about multiple possible encodings of your text. This also allows you to have multiple languages present within the same view or even line of text within your app.
So you need to make sure that everything you’re using within your mobile app, including the inputs, functions, libraries, storage formats, and fonts, are all Unicode-compliant. Almost all high-level programming languages support Unicode by default, so this concern is only really raised if you’re coding in a low-level language or an older language with no Unicode support.
Font Support
Let’s establish something: There are 136,755 characters defined in Unicode 10.0, which was released in June 2017, and there’s no font or font family out there that covers all of those characters. So you’ll need to either use a font that supports all of the characters of the languages in your app or use multiple fonts.
However, Google has started an initiative to create a font family called Noto Fonts comprising of over a hundred individual fonts, which are together designed to cover all the scripts encoded in Unicode while achieving visual harmony across multiple languages and scripts. Even then, Noto Fonts as of now cover nearly 64,000 characters, which is under half of the total number of characters defined in Unicode, and collectively have a total size of 1.1 GB. So you need to be smart about which fonts to include in your app and to only include the ones you need.
Also, just because a font supports the characters for the languages that you’re using doesn’t mean that it will look the same across all of the languages. So you also need to make sure that the font being used looks good in whichever script or language you’re applying it on.
Text Direction
When preparing to translate your text into different languages, you need to consider how it’ll be presented in those languages and how it would affect your mobile app and even your entire user experience. If you’re localizing your app for languages that are written and read from right-to-left as opposed to the default left-to-right — like Arabic, Hebrew, and Farsi — you might have to adjust your user interface to accommodate for those languages. One of the best practices, in that case, is to mirror your mobile app views (e.g. moving the menus, buttons, tabs, etc. from the left to the right for those locales) so that it gives it a natural feel and provides the user with a seamless experience.
Another issue you might face is what’s referred to as BiDi or bi-directional text, which is a problem you’ll face when mixing between left-to-right and right-to-left scripts within the same text. In that case, you’ll need to clearly define how you want the text to appear using Unicode. You can check out Unicode’s control characters for more information about how to do so.
Don’t Format Programmatically
Believe it or not, formatting also differs from one language to another. Whether you’re emphasizing a piece of text by making it italic, bold, or underlining it or you’re adding punctuation, this can differ drastically across your different locales.
Some languages do not have the concept of bold or italic characters and have other ways of emphasizing the text, which is why you should also send the formatting to your translators instead of just sending them the text separately so that they can take the necessary action to format the translation when necessary based on their expertise.
Another thing is to never programmatically define your formatting, like creating a loop to add commas between a set of items that you’re listing, because other languages might have different formatting standards (e.g. in Chinese, you don’t separate words with spaces or commas). Also, punctuation marks (e.g. commas, quotation marks, semicolons, etc.) can look different and even be used differently from one language to another.
Create A Dynamic Interface
Having a dynamic and responsive mobile app interface is a must when you’re localizing your app. Some languages will have more characters than others when the text is translated, so your interface needs to adapt and accommodate such changes. Whether the text appears in a paragraph, menu, buttons, or any other UI objects, it needs to fit and to not look odd or disrupt the user experience.
If the translated text is still too long to accommodate for, one solution is to decrease the font size to fit the area it’s in, while still maintaining consistency across all of the other elements in the app. Another option would be to enforce a limit on the allowed number of characters for the translations, but try to keep this as a last resort and only do it when it’s extremely necessary, as you don’t want to limit your translators and you want them to provide you with the best possible translations without being restricted.
Numbers And Dates
Number and date formats are other things that you’ll have to customize based on the locale. For dates, some countries and regions use a month/date/year format, while others use a day/month/year format, so you’ll need to tailor accordingly to avoid any confusion.
For numbers, it’s mainly about the decimal and thousand separators, where some countries use the period and commas respectively, while others do it the other way around. Other countries, like India for example, use a unique separator system for numbers different from the international norm, where they group the numbers in a repeating pattern of 3,2,2 (from least significant digits). So instead of writing 121,212,123 or 67,890,000,000,000, it would be 12,12,12,123 and 67,89,000,00,00,000.
Luckily for developers, since these standards are set internationally and are always needed in the development process, almost all operating systems already have systems that take care of these things for different locales. Just make sure to double check that everything is working and appearing as it should be.
After Mobile App Internationalization
Pseudolocalization
Pseduolocalization is the stage you should do right after you’re done with mobile app internationalization as a testing method to make sure that everything has been set up properly and that your app is ready for localization. In this stage, you’re making sure that everything that needs to be translated has been taken out of your code and has been replaced with dynamic variables that will be changed based on the locale.
You will need to create a localization file with placeholder values for both the text and media in the new locale you’re introducing and test out how it will be displayed, making sure that all of the new locale or language’s characters are being displayed correctly as well as any different media, GUI elements, or user interface changes. Also, make sure to try out different characters in different parts of the app as well as different lengths of strings to test out how your app and interface will adapt and respond to these changes.
Localization
The entire point of mobile app internationalization is to prepare your app for localization. So once you’re done with internationalization, you’ve tested your app, and everything seems to be fine, it’s time to move on to an entirely new process, which is the localization process.
Localization (l10n) is the process of customizing your app to work in other languages other than the default. Mobile app localization allows you to go beyond your user base and access a global market. This helps you increase your downloads, have an edge over the competition, and expand sales. A study by Distomo showed that localizing apps resulted in 128% more downloads per country and a 26% increase in revenue for each country added via app localization. What’s even more incredible is that these results were achieved within just one week from the release of the localized app.

Internationalize As You Go
Internationalization isn’t a one-time thing because as you update your app and it gets more modified with time, you will have to keep in mind how those modifications affect your different locales and make the necessary internationalization changes.If you would like to receive future articles, please click on the SUBSCRIBE button.
Before putting YOUR home on the market to sell, your agent will present a comparative market analysis, also referred to in the industry as a CMA. It’s basically an estimated value of your home. A CMA is calculated by looking at recent comparable sales in your neighborhood within the last 3 months. Three months is used as a timeframe because the market prices change so fast, any homes sold before then would not be supportive of today’s prices.
Homes that have similar square feet and lot size are evaluated first. Differences such as number of bedrooms and bathrooms, remodeling, views, pools and spas, busy street are taken into consideration and adjustments are made. Sometimes pending sales can be used if the listing agent will reveal the price at which it will eventually sell. An active or pending listing cannot be used as a comparative sale if we don’t know the final sales price.
This is the real estate "principle of substitution" which states that a buyer will not pay more for a property than the cost of an equally desirable alternative property.
This method is the best estimate of value. Of course, in a fluctuating market, an estimate of value is JUST THAT, an estimate. The final sales price is whatever a buyer is willing to pay.

Last month, Uber released its official API to developers world-wide.
“Apps can pass a destination address to the Uber app, display pickup times, provide fare estimates, access trip history and more.”, the company said on its blog. To request a ride, the API will allow apps to send a destination address across to the Uber app; however, the ability to request rides from inside other apps is being released “in a more controlled fashion,” beginning with a select set of partners.
Uber also opened up an API Affiliate Program, where developers (US only) can earn Uber credits ($5/new rider) for themselves, and their users. And (more exciting) cash rewards were stated to be coming soon.
Top brands are already using the API. Starbucks, TripAdviser, Hyatt, Hinge, United Airlines, and OpenTable, to name a few.
For example, users can request a ride directly from OpenTable to their booked restaurant of choice; reserve a room with Hyatt and schedule an Uber ride to the hotel right from the reservations screen; and obtain ETAs for closest drivers and fare estimates to secure a reliable ride to your United flight.
Naturally, there are Terms around use of this API – specifically, exclusivity from integrating with any competing services – which isn’t much of a surprise, however read carefully before unintentionally blocking out integration points with other company APIs available or in the pipeline.

The Red Scare was the rounding up and deportation of hundreds of immigrants of radical political views by the federal government in The United States of America.
The word ‘Red’ came from the color of the soviet union flag, and the fact that communism would come to the United States.
The first red scare – the first red scare occurred after the First world war following the Bolshevik Russian Revolution of 1917 lead by Vladimir Lenin.
The Bolsheviks crushed the Romanov dynasty and inspired the fear of the anarchists.
Labor strikes at this time were on a huge rise in the U.S and the American media and government sensationalized them as being caused by immigrants.
when the WWI Armistice was executed in 1918, 9 million people worked in the war industries while 4 million served in the Army.
But once the war ended many people were left without jobs. Economic difficulties were on a rise and one of the first major strikes after the war called the Seattle strike of 1919 had 60,000 workers strike on February 6.
These strikers were labeled as REDS and were seen as a threat.
After this strike, all of the srikes were called as ”crimes against society” and ”conspiracies against the government”.
Because of the fear among the citizens, the strikers were branded as ”REDS”” and unpatriotics.
Hysteria took over and ”red hunting’ became popular.
colleges were called the ‘hot beds of Bolshevism’ and professors were labelled as radicals.
The second red scare came after the second world war from the last 1940’s through 1950’s.
This was called MsCarthyism and could be defined as making accusations of subversions or treasons related to mostly communists.
American leaders in the 1950’s then asked the citizens to be wary of the communists. This paranoia reached its max when a right winged republican called Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, launched highly publicized probes into alleged communist penetration of the State Department, the White house, the Treasury and the US army.
Many thousands of americans faces congressional committee hearings, were deported, improsioned, loss of passport or long term unemployment.
Around 300 communists were found guilty of passing information to the soviets during WWII.
Changed in the composition of the Supreme court also resulted in the ending of the red scare.
Under Chief Justice Earl Warren the court limited the mechanisms designed to identify and punish communists, due to all of this the Red Scare lost its power.Abstract
War destroyed the communities and families in Europe and disrupted the
developments of the social and economic fabric. But there were countries/regions
which were not directly involved in these wars, had to face the same impact. For
example, Kashmir situated on the fringes of the Indian sub-continent was equally
affected by these International Crises. With the completion of Jehlum Valley
Cart Road in 1890, trade increased manifold with Europe. But unfortunately, the
involvement of European countries in war from 1870-1945 A.D, reduced the demand
of highly praised luxurious items of Kashmir viz. Shawl, carpets, papier-mache,
woodcarving, embroidery, woolens, silver item etc. Engagement of these governments
in the gigantic war efforts: in which the whole economic activity was directed
towards war industries, Kashmir while heavily relying on the foreign countries
for its trade had to suffer.

1. Introduction
The state of Jammu and Kashmir is situated at a place on the globe where the borders of half a dozen countries meet (Bazaz, 2003). From the immemorial times, the state people had established trade relations with their entire neighbouring world and were driving great benefit from them. Routes connecting trade centers of the state with those of the bordering countries had been opened. Before any roads for wheeled traffic were constructed, canals and rivers were also used for carrying merchandise from one place to another. It was natural that the people of Kashmir should have greater business intercourse with the country, which was connected with the state through these waterways. The main big rivers of Jammu and Kashmir are/were Sind, Vitasta, (Cunningham, 1977), Chenab and Ravi. The source of these rivers is/was the big mountain ranges of Himalayas lying to the North and East of Kashmir and all of them flow into the West Punjab., 1892-1893). It was the opening of the Jehlum valley Cart Road which helped to diminish the isolation of the city from outside influences (Khan, 1999) plus Journeys to Srinagar by the English officers, travelers and missionaries became faster and more frequent (Census of India, 1941).
Jhelum valley road being the shortest line of communication between the valley, Hazara and the Indus, the route through the Jhelum valley below Baramula was used from ancient times. Hieun Tsang and Ou-Kong coming from Gandhara and Hazara followed this route on their way to Kashmir, and it was well known to Alberuni.
But on the other hand, the same road also brought the threat of competition. Srinagar’s artisans were now faced with great competition outside. It came even more directly connected to the foreign as well as Indian markets. Kashmir that was heavily relying on the foreign countries for its manufacture of goods had to suffer. During the War periods the main exports of Kashmir especially shawls, Carpets Silk, woollens, papier mache, silver-ware, wood-carving and numdas etc. did not receive a good demand. The below discussion will help us in understanding that how these wars in Europe had direct bearing on the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which was neither the direct participant in the war nor ally of any European power during these wars.
1) Franco-Prussian war 1870-1871 A.D:
The First war which directly affected the shawl industry (Vigne, 1842) of Kashmir was Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871 A.D; it resulted in the decline of this beautiful and classic industry of Kashmir. Shawl manufacturing industry is said to be “as old as the hills of Kashmir” (Census of India, 1921a) but it had practically died during the later Hindu period. Its revival towards the close of the 14th century A.D is attributed to Sayyid Ali Hamdani (Hassan, 1959) who visited Kashmir in 1379 A.D He left for Turkistan via Ladakh after a stay of two years i.e. in 1381 A.D, on his way along snowy mountains of Ladakh, he was provided with socks made of pashmina wool or pashm. The soft and warm wool attracted his attention and therefore, on his return he took some wool to Srinagar where he presented it to the Sultan Qutab-ud-Din (1374-1389 A.D) who got it manufactured into a shawl (Jammu and Kashmir publication, 1954). However, the use of the word, “shawl” to represent woolen garment became popular during the reign of Mirza Hyder Doughlat (1540-1550 A.D) (Hussnain, 2004). It was not until the Mughal period (1585-1758 A.D) (Bamzai, 1980), that the industry achieved its full potential (Bernier, 1826). On the eve of the Mughal occupation of Kashmir in 1586 A.D. shawl industry had not only been extensively established but the industry had attained a high degree of perfection. According to Mughal chronicler, there were two hundred factories for making shawls (Wani Mohammad, 1998) and were exported to various countries of the world. The shawls of Kashmir were given the name of Param Naram by Emperor Akbar. Jahangir says that they are so excellent that there is no need to praise them (Hajat Ba Tariff Naist). He also made shawls one of favorite components of dress. The delicate texture, softness and durability had made Kashmiri shawls unrivalled in the whole world making them extensive article of trade. To quote Abul Fazl “the Kashmiri shawls are exported to ever clime” (Fazl, 1974).
Bernier, who visited Kashmir in the company of Aurangzeb in 1665 wrote:
“What may be considered peculiar to Kachemira, and the staple commodity that which particularly promotes the trade of the country and fills it with wealth, is the prodigious quality of shawls which they manufacture and which gave occupation even to the little children”.
In 1796 A.D. during the time of Abdullah Khan, an Afghan Governor of Kashmir, a blind man, named Sayid Yahaya, had come from Baghdad as a visitor to Kashmir, and when he took leave from Abdullah Khan to return, the latter gave a present of orange-coloured shawl. The Sayid, having gone to Egypt gave it as a present to its Khedive there. Soon after, Napoleon Bonaparte came to Egypt with his famous fleet with the object of harassing the English in India, but he was smashed up by Nelson on the Nile. The Khedive gave him this shawl as a present. Napoleon sent it to France and it attracted the fashionable people there. French traders soon came to Kashmir to indulge in the trading activities of shawl and exported shawls of various designs to France.
In-fact France became the major consumer of this pride product of Kashmir, as is evident from the following Table 1:

Besides, the Indian sub-continent shawls exported to Armenia, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Russia at the time of Moorcroft’s visit (1823). The trade was mostly in the hands of the merchants from Turkey, Armenia, Persia, and Afghanistan. At the time of Moorcroft, much of the shawl trade was carried with Russia through Turkistan where shawls were in considerable demand. Persia was another important country which exercised considerable demand of Kashmir shawls. While visiting Persia Mohan Lal Kashmiri found the ruler of Persia desirous to conquer Kashmir simply because he was overwhelmed by the gracious art of its embroidered shawls (Maskiell, 2002). Andelphinstone, says “the king of Persia forbade the use of Kashmir shawls with a view to promote the shawl industry of his own country”.
According to Young Husband: from 1862-1870, the export of shawls averaged 25 to 28 lakhs of rupees per annum, or over a quarter of a million sterling, and when the trade was at its zenith 25,000 to 28,000 persons were engaged in its manufacturing. In-fact France was the major importer of this pride product of Kashmir. This amounted simply to the high cost for the Kashmiri shawls, even a single piece of shawl was sold even at a fabulous price of Rs.12,500 in those days.
Simultaneously, Europe witnessed some drastic changes that not only left their impact on Europe but on the whole world. The foundation of the German Empire was the most important event in the European history during 19th century (Roopshikha, 2008). The result of the unification was creation of German empire that enabled Prussia to control all the German states and European politics as well. The birth of Germany created an entirely new centre of gravity in international affairs and represents as complete a break with the Europe (1815-1871) as that Era represents a break with the ancient regime of Pre-French revolutionary days. Fundamentally, the cause of the Franco-Prussian conflict was the deep rivalry between the two countries which had revealed it in 1866. There were bitter memories left by the first Napoleon; and there was the long historical grudge demanding satisfaction against Gallic neighbor who had kept Germany weak and divided for her own aggrandizement. France had long enough withheld from Germany her national right to development, and asserted outrageous and intolerable claim to interference. The startling growth of Prussian power and the unexpected demonstration of her strength had given to Europe and more especially to France, an unmistakable challenge (Grant and Temperely, 1927).
On 19th July 1870, the French Emperor declared war to Prussian kingdom Napoleon III lead the Army. France weakened by its preceding wars (Crimea, Italy, Mexico) had an army of hardly two hundred thousand men on frontier against five hundred thousand men of Germany. Without any obstacle on their way, the German army invaded the region of champagne and finally reached Paris (Marriot, 1945).
It was because of this war France lost nearly 17,000 “communes” whole Alsace and part of Lorraine. It represented the loss of 1,600,000 men: moreover, under the terms of the Treaty of Frankfurt, France had to pay an indemnity of 5 billion gold francs plus the interests of 567 million francs to the German winner. To guarantee that payment, the enemy stationed troops and occupied some French departments for two years. During this period the French army got the right to station in the Loire. France cried over 138,000 killed people, prestige in the world and on her economy, which shattered completely by this war.
This war had come with misfortunes not only for people of France, or shattered its economy completely, but also had a deep impact upon the social and economic conditions of the people of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir situated quite far away from her, as France alone accounted for the 80% of shawl exports from Kashmir by that time. The impact of this war had its adverse effect on the Kashmiri shawl as is evident from the fact that there remained only 5148 shawl bafs against 28,000 as per the Census Report of 1891.
2) Russian Expansion in Central Asia:
Kashmir had been the meeting place of the three Greatest Empires (Yasin, 2002) of the East—the British, the Russians and the Chinese (Kapur, 1992). It was her strategic location which helped her in developing its trade relations with China, Central-Asia, Tibet, Yarkand, Kashgar and Russia etc. and it was carried on by the Treaty Highway Road. This road gave a unique commercial importance to the state which was recognized by the Government of India. The road connected the British India with Yarkand by the Karakoram pass (Knight, 1986) and formed an important trade route between India and Central Asia. The Genesis of this branch of trade lay in a Treaty (1842) signed between the Government of Tibet and Ladakh, represented by Raja Gulab Singh. Sometimes before the latter was conquered by the Sikhs in 1834. Kashmir assumed considerable significance as an enterpot of transit trade owing to its geographical contiguities with Central Asia and its linkage with the “Old Silk Route”. The passes leading to the Central Asian plains through the Kabul valley also formed important lines of communication with Kashmir. The road from the valley followed closely the course of the Jehlum and after crossing the Urusha (Hazara) District, joined the caravan route from India. It was over this route, which makes the “Western Gate of Kashmir” that Hieun Tsiang and Ou’kung travelled to reach the valley. No doubt the External trade of Kashmir was largely carried through the aforementioned trade route network, but, owing to various political and other reasons the road from Srinagar to distant Yarkand and Lhasa was often blocked by snow resulting in the severance of the life-lines of commerce though temporarily. However, the demand of Kashmiri products was so strong and intimate that the merchants took roundabout and difficult tracks to reach Tibet or Central Asia (Kapur, 1992).
It is important to mention here that since the nature (composition) of Kashmir’s External trade was largely determined by volume-value ratio (as these were snow bound areas so products which were less in weight, but high in demand were preferred by merchants to carry on these routes) of the commodities, therefore, Kashmir shawl became a preferable item of this trade. It is also important to put it here that the commerce of Ladakh was yet not of any value as far as her local production was concerned. The Foreign Trade of the area was confined to five natural productions, such as Wool (Bates, 1980) Salt, Dry fruits (apricots), Borax and Sulphur. But its importance consisted mainly in its being the entre pot of International trade. The Central Asian merchandise was housed in Ladakh and then supplied to Indian and Kashmiri merchants. Likewise most of the Central Asian traders received Indian and Kashmiri trading commodities through the merchants of these countries stationed in Ladakh. Cunningham, who visited that territory, gives a detailed list of articles imported and exported to China via Ladakh.
Imports:
Shawl-wool, Charas, Sliver, Felts, Tea, Russian Leather, Velvets, Coarse silk, Gold, Turquoises, Carpets from Khotan, Rewand-i-Chini, Coral Musk, Tobacco, Raisins and other Dry Fruits, Badam-i-Kitai, Mamira, Ponies and Salt.
Exports:
Cotton, Chintzes, Silk, Shawls, Jamiwars, Brocades, Opium, Heron-Plumes, Turmeric and other Indian Spices.
Times sometimes move fast than expected. It was in the second half of the Nineteenth century that Tsarist Russia and Britain found themselves in the state of rivalry in Central Asia, they had conflicting interests in the Balkan region of Europe. Each country tried to check the other extensions of power and influence in that direction. Russia had an alternate field to compensate her setbacks in the Balkan region, viz., Central Asia. In fact, she had been advancing towards Central Asia since the beginning of 19th century. In this regard, William Moorcroft had written a warning in 1822 that trade with Russia via Turkestan was increasing. It was in 1832, the British East India Company Board of Control had sent Burnes to Central Asia to investigate the possibility of British commerce to counter a possible Russian threat to India. It was during this period, according to C. Karpinski “Russia imported more than two million rubles worth of Turkish and Kashmir shawls in 1825-1826”. These moves of British in Central Asia affected the supply of shawl wool to valley. In the time of the Dogras, the average import of wool amounted to nearly 300 maunds. The following Table 2 shows the gradual decrease of the shawl wool.
Table 2. Shawl wool from central Asia to Kashmir.
Source: Bates, 1980. A Gazetteer of Kashmir, Kishtwar, Badrawar, Jammu, Naoshera, Punch and the Valley of the Kishen Ganga, Light and Life Publishers, New Delhi, p 89.
As shown in the table, from 1658-1753, 6000 maunds of shawl wool were imported by state for the manufacturing of shawls. From 1753-1872, a declining trend was seen in the import of shawl wool, from 1752-1819, 4000 maunds were imported, it further reduced to 3200 maunds in 1819-1847, in 1867-1868, only 408 maunds of shawl wool was imported, from 1868-1869, a slight increase was seen from 408 maunds, it rose to 707 maunds, but it fell again in 1869-1870 to 548 maunds. From 1870-1872 only 300 maunds were imported to the valley for its shawls.
The decrease in the imports was mainly due to:
1) Epidemics amongst the shawl wool goats in Turfan, Khotan, Yarkand and Kirghiz herds (Moorcroft & Trebeck, 1841).
2) The heavy taxes levied on import of pashmina.
3) Sudden price rise of wool owing to its purchase by the British trading Company in India.
4) Increasing demand for wool from Delhi, Lucknow, Amritsar, Ludhiana and Rampur.
5) Emergence of Nurpur, Simla and Hosharpur as new centers of pashmina Trade.
6) The beginning of the shawl wool trade by the British merchants stationed at Darjeeling.
7) Impediment caused by the border conflicts between Kashmir and China on account of disturbed conditions in Sinkiang.
8) Last but not the least, tax exemption and other trade concessions granted to the Russians merchants by the Chinese government.
Moreover, Russia also made all efforts to consolidate its position in Western Turkistan. The rivalry between these two powers reached to the extent that British goods could not find its market in Russian dominated areas, including goods from Kashmir. Consequently, there was an urgent need to strengthen the British defenses on the North West of India. And the strategic position of Kashmir in the defense of the North West frontiers gave it a great importance. According to Wakefield:
In its relation to our rule in India the position of this kingdom, its physical and other characters, have an importance which its extent and general barrenness would scarcely warrant, for it constitutes a formidable defense, A Rocky Bulwark to our Empire on its Northern Frontier, a natural obstacle against any foe proceeding that quarter (Wakefield, 1879).
By watching these happenings, The British government took effective steps in the consolidation of the “Scientific Frontier” of the Indian empire. They extended railway lines up to Quetta and the Khyber passes. A policy of reconciliation with the Amir of Afghanistan was enunciated so as to secure safe North Western frontier. Having done this, they desired to seal two other doors from outside influence i.e. Gilgit and Leh (Kapur, 1992).
But these measures did not give a fruitful result as Russians also took a number of measures in 1880 to exclude British-Indian commodities from Central Asian market (Hamilton, 1906). In 1888, the Russians established a consulate in Bukhara, which among other things, was to deal with matters relating to Afghanistan and by 1892 the Russian customs frontier was extended to the Afghanistan-Bukhara border. British used to give much importance to trade with Central Asia. Nothing a considerable increase in this trade was from 1894-1895. By 1895, the flow of British Indian goods into Central Asia through Afghanistan and Bukhara had declined by 80% severely damaging the position of Afghanistan in the transit trade (Hamilton, 1906).
It is pertinent to mention here that the balance of trade between Kashmir and Central Asia was heavily in favour of Central Asia. A little amount of woolen articles like Shawls, Gabbas and Carpets were seldom export. Iron and a few article of merchandise of daily use formed the exports. The annual Trade Report of 1900-1901 shows a surprising amoint of export trade from Kashmir to central asia which amounted to 16,697 maunds valuing Rs. 636,108. Thereafter the records available present a very low and poor profile of the same trade which is clear from the following Table 3 (Trade Report, 1907-1914).
Table 3. Export from Kashmir to Central Asia.
Source: Trade Reports of 1907-1914.
The trade between Kashmir and Central Asia was mostly an import trade, there is no export trade worth the name (Administrative Report, 1912-1913). The Central Asian traders who brought their articles to sell in Kashmir took off certain articles when they returned home (Trade Report, 1908-1909). Rations and personal luggage of the traders and travelers were registered under this head (Trade Report, 1911-1912).
With the Russian expansion in Central Asia and their constant rivalry with British, the trade relations between Kashmir and Central Asia, China got a setback. The Imperial designs of the two competing powers left the Kashmir on adverse receiving end, as a result of the closer of its trade routes.
3) First and Second World War:
The consequences of the First and Second World Wars resulted in mass destruction of cities and long lasting impact on both victorious and defeated countries. But for those countries that were not directly involved in the war were also affected. Same was case with the state of Jammu and Kashmir which was quite far away from the war zone and was equally or even more affected by these wars. We see during this period the main exports of Kashmir especially Carpets Silk, woollens, papier mache, silver-ware, wood-carving and numdas etc. enjoyed a mixed demand. The below discussion will give us an idea of the same.
The carpet industry (Sufi, 1948-1849) is said to have flourished for a long time after Sultan Zain’l-Abidin’s reign. The carpets of Kashmir, however, soon deteriorated. The modern craze for cheapness spoiled this as well as other works of art. An endeavour was made in time of Maharaja Ranbir Singh to improve the industry by involving Europeans. The contribution of C.M Hadow to the carpet trade was great. He sent Kashmir carpets for being exhibit in the big Chicago World Fair of 1890 A.D. The trade prospered and flourished. The year 1914 A.D, saw a great pressure on the carpet industry and as a result it expanded. Due to the availability of cheap labour and better technical guidance by the European entrepreneurs, the carpet industry prospered a lot. According to the Census Report of 1921, the six carpet industries located in the city of Srinagar gave employment to 1342 persons (Census Report, 1921). Women were not employed in the carpet factories. But a good number of women were employed as spinners for these factories who worked in their homes and were paid wages on contract basis.
Simultaneously, Silk (Khan, 1999) was also in great demand in foreign as well as in Indian markets. In 1901, sales in Europe amounted to Rs. 256,215 whereas in local market sales amounted to Rs. 8698 (Administrative Report, 1957). In 1902, the total European sales amounted to Rs. 266,215 and local sales amounted to Rs. 3763. During the following two years, the prices realized in England were 13 shillings and 14 shillings for first and second quality silk or (No. 1 and No. 2) (Ganju, 1945). In 1904, the factory came to have 10 filatures which contained 1864 reeling basins. In the same year, silk weaving was taken up on an experimental basis. Although the quality of cloth produced was satisfactory and found to compare favourably with the average products of the looms of Japan, but unfortunately, in 1907, a fire occurred in the Srinagar silk factory and almost all the stocks of silk were destroyed, as such nothing was exported out of the year’s production (Administrative Report, 1969). It was also seen that new venture of experimentation did not prove successful from the financial point of view. Consequently, it was abandoned in 1909-1910. In the year 1912-1913, 1739 bales of Kashmir silk were sold in England during the year (Administrative Report, 1970). But in the year 1913-1914 there was a decrease in the out lays and the sales were confined to 1314 bales only (Administrative Report, 1971). In the year 1914-1915, the working of the department was seriously affected by the outbreak of First World War. The Europeans markets almost closed and the efforts to increase sales in India did not meet with much success. For this purpose some enquiries were made by Professor H. Maxwell, Imperial silk specialist, and E.C Ansorage, I.C.S, on behalf of the government of India to make complete survey of the position of the silk trade in India. Steps were also taken to make direct sales in the American markets.
Other industries like embroidered numdas got a great boost during the First World War. The export of numda after being embroidered in Kashmir ran into lakhs in the First World War. The demand for Kashmir woollens increased and decreased in the following manner. The demand of woollens in fact increased due to the ongoing “Swadeshi Movement.” According to the available estimates, Kashmir by the years 1904-1905, 1905-1906 and 1906-1907 managed to export woolen (Ganju, 1945) weighing in total 5146, maunds 5819 maunds and 5339 maunds respectively. Once the movement petered out, the export figure came down to only 2977 maunds in and around the years 1913-1914. The position of the woollens fabrics exported during the different years of ongoing war becomes crystal clear through the information given in the below Table 4 and Table 5 (Trade Report, 1913-1918).
Table 4. Details of woolen exported between the years 1913-1918.
Source: Trade Reports, 1913-1918.
The woollen exports retained its propitious marketing character up to the later part of the War, we see from 1913 to 1918 woollens showed increasing trend, because of the decline of the imports thence from, however they markedly fell which in turn bore considerable declining imprints on the prices as well. With this the imports swelled (Ganju, 1945). After the First World War, we find imports again increasing and exports decreasing. The extra labour which had found employment in the industry during the War period was thrown out there by the production had to be decreased. This adjustment took time. In the meantime goods were produced in excess of the demand and had to be sold at a lower price. This had its effects on the whole economy of the woollen industry, and the prices have gone down to a much lower level then they would have. If the production had been adjusted to the falling demand, immediately after the fall started. For want of adequate capital, labour and skill, the shawl industry could not take full use of the short lived effects of Swadeshi Movement of 1905. When the momentum of Swadeshi movement receded, the manufacture foreign goods again flooded the market and the demand for the handicrafts of Kashmir in general and the woollen goods in particular fell to low levels.
Table 5. Details of woolen from 1918 to 1941.
Source Trade Reports 1918-1941.
From 1918-1919, woolens contributed to Rs. 890,577 to state economy. But again there was declining trend in the sale of woollens from Rs. 890,577 it reduced to Rs. 695,959. From 1923-1925, a slight increase was seen from Rs. 695,959 to Rs. 1,766,365 in the value of woollens but fell again to Rs. 365,274 in 1930-1931. After 1931-1937, woollens faced fluctuations in value because of low response of people to the boycott of British goods. In 1937-1938, woollens again shown revival in demand from Rs. 365,274 it reached to Rs. 721,753. Afterwards, the contribution of woollens to state economy was meager only Rs. 15,080 in 1941. No official records are available after 1941 till independence.
While as, on the other side, in 1939-1940, the total sales amounted to 191.584 lbs. of raw silk and 101,486 lbs. of silk wastes. Total receipts from the sale came to Rs. 1,125,430 (Administrative Report, 1995). The year opened with somewhat a depressed state of market and closed with distinctly hopeful prospects. The effects of the abnormal decline in the prices during the latter half of the preceding year continued to be felt in the early part of the year. But during closing months especially since the declaration of war improvements in the situation were substantially enough to counter balance the efforts of earlier depression (Administrative Report, 1995).
Handloom silks mostly depended on home markets. The War, therefore, did not interfere with its steady growth. More so because of the innovations of certain enterprising firms during the year 1939-1940, large quantities of Georgettes were produced. They swelled the volume of trade. Silk products were in great demand in the Indian cities, especially Lahore, Amritsar and Delhi. During 1940-1941, Bedsheets, Teapoy covers and Silk Sarees, particularly in embroidery form were in great demand. Of course, war did create a problem with respect to improvement in dyes and chemicals. Those who already possessed the stocks, indulged in profiteering. With all these difficulties the handloom industry was considered to be the biggest cottage industry in the state during 1943. Embroidery was also done on woolens and silks in Kashmir. It was an auxiliary of Woollens and Silk industries. Amlikar shawls had become famous all over the world because of the attractive work done on Pashmina or Raffal. Silk Saries, Teapoy covers, and Bedsheets were in great demand in 1941 because of the colourful designs in embroidery. Though, the price of Pashmina wool had gone up in 1942-1943. Yet the popularity of excellent embroidery motivated artisans to do more work and produce very beautiful pieces which could be acceptable even on higher cost. About 17,000 persons worked in this industry during 1940-1941. In 1942 the total production of carpets was estimated to 40,000 sq.ft valued at Rs. 1,200,000. Soon after the close of the Second World War the American demand shifted back from “numdas” to carpets and this increased the annual output. The home demand also increased. The restoration of normalcy in the state and the rapidly increasing tourist traffic increased the demand for carpets. The increasing demand of carpets helped the Kashmir in developing its economy.
Yet another active art of Kashmir during this period was papier-mache. During the period of War, the number of visitors to the valley showed a marked increase due to influx of army personal, who spent their holidays in Kashmir, the papier-mache industry, therefore made brisk sales and the total value of goods produced increased from Rs. 2 lakhs (Administrative Report, 1940-1941) in the year 1940-1941 to Rs. 2.5 lakhs in the year 1941-1943, about 600, people were employed in the industry during the year 1940-1941.
Inspite of the rise in the price of silver the turnover of the silverware industry increased tremendously. Because of the excellent finish and workmanship of the craftsmen, the demand for the silver-ware increased to the extent that it became difficult for the leading firms to cope with the demand with the existing workforce (Administrative Report, 1941-1943). The industry employed 1100 workers in the year 1941-1943 on the other hand; the brass and metal ware industry did not do well because the price of brass and another connected material had increased due to War.
Wooden furniture and wood carving (Census of India, 1921b) a well-known cottage industry of Kashmir continued to be popular during the War. The industry was able to meet the total requirement of the entire state. The toys produced in some of the towns of Kashmir were famous for their excellent shape, finish and colour. Improvement in the designs of the toys was under the considerations of the government at the end of 1943. Wood-caving also was popular and made brisk business at the annual exhibition at Srinagar among the tourists throughout the tourist season in Kashmir.
During the year 1940-1941, there was a marketed improvement in the prices of raw silk and silk wastes. All products of silk factories including the silk wastes remained in great demand. The market of raw silk improved owing to International Situation (Administrative Report, 1997-1998). In 1941-1942, as a result of the World War II, the prices of silk and wastes soared higher and higher. The demand for the products of silk factories rose to unexpected figures; simultaneously the prices of all silk supplies and services required by the department also rose considerably (Administrative Report, 1941-1943). The War condition greatly influenced the export trade of Kashmir silk during the year 1942-1943 A.D and 1943-1944. A.D (Administrative Report, 1945-1946). Major proportion of silk was supplied to the government of India for defense purposes during the period of International turmoil. This was done in response to an order placed by the British government of India with the Kashmir government for 125,000 lbs. of raw silks for parachute cloth. The price at which the silk was supplied was 16-3 per lbs. Total sales for Kashmir amounted to Rs. 184,950 during the second half of the year 1942 and 33,970 during 1943.
During the year 1944-1945 A.D, and 1945-1946 A.D, war conditions continued to influence the working of the industry in all respects. The department continued to supply to the government of India for defence purposes practically the whole of it’s out-turned (Administrative Report, 1944-1945). Thus to give impetus to the local weaving industry local manufactures were also supplied with raw-silks at prices much below the markets rates. The outturn of superior silks was booked by His Majesty government and the inferior silks were sold in India markets. The sales of silk and it’s by products effected by the department during the year 1945 totaled 241,759 pounds and the amount received was Rs. 38,339,415 (Administrative Report, 1998-1999).
We see the ups and downs in the market continued till the Second World War was over except silk; no product of Kashmir was used for war purposes.
4) Closure of Jehlum valley road:, 1923-1924). It was the opening of the Jehlum valley road which helped to diminish the isolation of the city from outside influences plus Journeys to Srinagar by the English officers, travelers and missionaries became faster and more frequent (Census of India, 1941).
The Jhelum valley road below Baramula is confined between two ranges of mountains—the one to the south being a branch of the Pir-panjal and the other to the north of Kajinag. These two ranges accompany the course of the river with gradually lessening height for about 80 miles to a point near Muzaffarabad where the Jhelum makes its sudden bend to the south. The valley is throughout narrow and the rout leading along it must have always been troublesome and risky in olden times. It is perhaps due to this reason that we hear comparatively little about it in the Rajatarangni of Kalhana. The military and commercial importance of this route are lesser than that of Pir-panjal and Tosamaidan routes. It is only in modern times that this western route has attained a real prominence. This originated in the time of the Afghan rule over Kashmir, when the route along the Vitasta to Muzaffarbad and hence through Hazara afforded the shortest and least exposed line of communication between Kashmir and Peshawar (Stein, 2007). Subsequently, after the annexation of the Punjab, the establishment of the hill station of the Muree naturally drew traffic in this direction. The construction of the Tonga road from Muree to Baramulla finally assured to this route its present supremacy.
By the end of the 19th century, Kashmir was hit by a severe famine in 1877-1879 (Civil and Military Gazette, 1878), which made it necessary to have a good road which could connect the valley with the Punjab, from where the grains for relief could be imported (Younghusband, 1996). The plan took a practical shape, when the construction of the said road was undertaken in 1881, for a cart road from Baramulla (Neve, 2003) to Kohala by the state government. Its
length was about
97
1
2
miles of which only 25 miles were nearly completed in
1885. In other words, the work was being executed at the average rate of about 6 miles a year. At this rate, about 11 more years were needed to construct the whole road. The chief reason for such a slow progress was stated to be the lack of funds with the state government (Kapur, 1992).
Another reason which made the construction of road important was at this time, the British government of India was greatly alarmed by the Russian advance in Central Asia. In the words of col. Algernon Durand:
She had advanced practically to the Hindukush; it was necessary to see that she did not cross it (Tyndale Biscoe, 2004).
Such then became the determination of the government of India. And to facilitate the achievement of that objective, they decided that, not only the construction of a road from India to Kashmir, whose borders touched those of the Russian Turkistan, should be completed (Knight, 1986), but a road even beyond up to Gilgit and Chitral should be speedily improved.
Consequently, in 1888, col. Parry Nisbet was sent to Kashmir as British Resident and he assisted the state in accomplishing the desired end. It was pushed forward with greater zeal, when the contract was made over to a British firm of contractors, Spedding Mitchel and Co; who brought the work to a completion in a record time. The road was opened for wheeled traffic in 1890, when Maharaja Pratap Singh was driven through from Baramulla to Kohala on the borders of his state. But it was not yet completed (Administrative Report, 1891-1892). The road was further extended from Baramulla to Srinagar in 1893, and was completed at the end of 1895 (Administrative Report, 1894-1895). It touched the city of Srinagar at Amira Kadal. Its length from Srinagar to Kohala was 132 miles. Thereafter, it led to Rawalpindi while crossing over the Muree Hills. The travel became very comfortable and easier for passengers in Tongas, Ekkas and then by the Motorcars. The distance of months was covered in a day to six days i.e. one day by motorcar, two days by Tongas and six days by Ekkas. From Srinagar to Rawalpindi its distance was 196 miles. The road was spoken of as a masterpiece of mountain engineering and was recognized by some as “the most beautiful Motorable road in the whole world”. This road costs Rs. 2,178,780 which was a huge sum. But as a trade route the Jehlum valley road did not prove of any considerable importance until it was made fit for wheeled traffic (Ahmad, 2007). The road was one of the main trade routes of the state and almost whole of the trade between Kashmir and British India was carried on by this route (Trade Report, 1900-1901). It was then the border town of the Punjab province of the then British Indian territories was constructed. The significance of this road was highlighted by Ernest, F Neve in these words:
According to him the chief exports are fruits, consisting largely of apples, pears, and walnuts. Of this over, 100,000 maunds, or about 3500 tons are exported annually. Rice and maize vary between one thousand and three thousand tons, according to the existence of scarcity in the North of India. Linseed, ghee, potatoes, hides wool, woolen cloth are all exported in large quantities. The value of the silk sent out of Kashmir annually amounted alone to over 100,000 sterling’s and the timber which is floated down the river to the Punjab represents fifty to eighty thousand pounds sterling a year (Neve, 2003) (Table 6).

Additional employment was also generated in bakeries, laundries, entertainment places, retailing trade, hotels, restaurants, cooks, bearers and other servants required to man theses places.etc. Considerable additional demand for food stuffs, vegetables, fruits, eggs, meat and milk was created which was met from local products. The visitors also bought local products which supported a large number of cottage and small scale industries engaged in making shawls, carpets, embroidery work, gabba, lois, woodcarving, jewelry, and papier machie articles. Thus, the impact on tourism on Kashmir in general and Srinagar in particular was fairly widespread and the employment created directly or indirectly through it was considerable.
Till 1947, there were three highways linking the state with the outside world. Besides, Jehlum valley road from Srinagar to Kohala via Baramulla and Domel; Banihal road from Srinagar to Sialkot via Banihal and Jammu; and Abbotabad road, from Domel to Abbotabad via Ramkot were linking valley with the outside world. There was also a rail link from Jammu to Sialkot forming part of the pre-partition North-West railways (Bazaz, 2003).
Besides these highways, there were several bridle paths and footpaths connecting different parts of the state (Ahmad, 2007) with neighbouring countries but such of them as could be maintained in good conditions were used in case of emergency or only by local people living on either side of the border (Bamzai, 1980). It will be seen that like the big rivers all the highways connected the Jammu and Kashmir state with that part of the Punjab, which now forms part of Pakistan. It was therefore quite natural that almost all export and import business of the country should be carried on with or through the trade centres of that province particularly Rawalpindi and Lahore. To do so was easier, cheaper and mutually beneficial. The timber weighing millions of tons grown in the far flung forests of Jammu and Kashmir was carried by the Punjab almost free of any charge. Fruits and other products were speedily taken from the orchards of the valley to Rawalpindi and disposed off within twenty four hours. Of all the seaports in India Karachi, city of Pakistan was nearest to Kashmir. It was and could be cheaper to get foreign goods into the state through this port.
In 1947, British rule ended in India and out of the undivided country two states were fashioned—India and Pakistan, the latter again being in two units of East and West Pakistan. The whole business of the abrupt termination of the British Indian Empire seems to have taken most of the rulers by surprise, and some were profoundly shocked by what they have considered to be British perfidy. Till the declaration of the independence by India and Pakistan on 15 Aug. 1947, the people of Kashmir state hoped that they too would enjoy freedom after 128 years of incessant slavery and suppression. They thought that Maharaja Hari Singh might agree to the compulsions of geographical contiguity and composition of population of the state and accede to Pakistan. But with the announcement of Radcliff award a different picture emerged. Kashmir became more susceptible than before to the pulls of rival dominions of India and Pakistan and was, therefore, due to suffer heavily in consequence (Pampori, 1992).
With the Decolonization of Indian sub-continent accompanied by partition and conflict between the two succeeding states of India and Pakistan the problems of the state of Jammu and Kashmir which had close and intimate contacts with both of them increased manifold, needless to say that the status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir was the bone of contention in that conflict (Gupta, 1967). Partition explained with different meanings by different authors. Few of these are produced here.
Sugata Bose and Ayesha Jalal, had explained in these words, That the dawn of independence came littered with the several limbs and blood drenched bodies of innocent men, women and children was a nightmare from which the sub-continent has never fully recovered. The colossal human tragedy of the partition and its continuing aftermath has been better conveyed by the sensitive creative writers and artists—for example in Saadat Hasan Manto’s short stories and Ritwik Ghatak’s films—than by historians (Bose and Jalal, 2004). Larry Collins further substantiated partition in these words that “Cyril Radcliff’s … line had left 5 million Sikhs and Hindus in Pakistan half of the Punjab, over 5 million Muslims in India’s half dead”. Mehar Chand Mahajan, in his book “Looking Back” observed that about 2 million people migrated from one side to the other (Mahajan, 1994). This situation was touched by another author, who said that ours has been a century where countries have been partitioned to fulfill the economic and political ambitions of formidable groups, completely ignoring the cost of human suffering, which has been enormous and continuous. Even in such callous and unpromising times the partition of the Indian subcontinent registered as an awesome tragedy (Settar and Gupta, 2002).
Partition was accompanied by several unfortunate circumstances for India in general and Kashmir in particular. There were problems which were associated with any such process of division. For instance, difficulties relating to the division of assets, and liabilities, demarcation of boundaries both of the land and the water. Several administrative difficulties emerged as one political unit had to be bifurcated.
After partition, the embroidery industry Sozni like other crafts received a setback, partly because of the division of the country, leading to a human tragedy and partly due to the attack on Kashmir by tribesmen (Birdwood, 2005). The road and railway links of the state were cut off. No tourists visited Kashmir due to disturbed conditions. This led to the losing of markets inside and outside Kashmir. The situation highlighted by Ian Talbot in his book in these words:
The protection and control of access of the movement of people and goods through borders is a vital symbol of statehood within weeks of the chaotic scenes of partition, the India and Pakistan states had tightened their grip of Attari and Wagah (Talbot, 2006). The experience of the colonial states war time system of controls was put into practice with the creation of an elaborate system of permits and licenses. State construction proceeded at the expense of the former free movement of people and goods between Lahore and Amritsar. While the order was an economic resource for some, it dealt a savage blow to others and Amritsari traders in particular became hostages to geography their city, cut off from its former markets and raw material supplies, was now dependent for its prosperity on government decisions concerning cloth quotas, import and export licenses and transport. A peripheral city that lacked administrative importance possessed only limited political leverage.
To make good the loss sustained by the state and its, people by this abrupt dislocation of export and import trade, the government of India constructed a new highway at a hugest cost of the three crores of rupee linking Jammu with pathankot in east Punjab. It was a marvelous feat of road engineering (highly creditable to the public works department of the government of India) the road is an extension of the Srinagar Banihal-Jammu road. Thus instead of the four water ways, three highways and one railway linking, the state with the outside world we have now one road and it was supposed that this would meet the demand of the people. As a matter of fact the National conference leaders in Kashmir have stated in their speeches and statements more than once that the business carried on through the Srinagar-Pathankot road is larger in volume than used to be conducted through all the abandoned highways, waterways and railway put together (Bazaz, 2003). No doubt, when the new government under the leadership of Sheikh Abdullah took over, they formulated a well considered policy for rejuvenating artisan industry in Kashmir. The first and foremost step which the government took was to provide market to the suffocating artisan industries. This they did by laying a network of emporiums throughout the country under Government Arts Emporium. Among other arts and crafts, Kashmir embroidery formed one of the most important crafts of Kashmir and was displayed and sold through these Emporia. The embroidery produced, in the production centers and purchased from private Karkhandars was sold through these Emporia’s.
2. Conclusion
With the completion of Jehlum Valley Cart Road in 1890, life had become easier for the people of Kashmir in many ways, it increased employment opportunities in valley and also developed her trade relations with the other parts of the world especially Europe. Unfortunately, due to the absence of the reliable facts and figure it is very difficult to compare the situation after independence and before independence. The Maharajah’s previous governments used to publish: statistics about all important matters in their Annual Administration Reports. Many heads of departments also were, as a matter of rule, giving comprehensive data about their working in their Periodical Reports. After independence no report was submitted so therefore it is not easy to know to what extent the Srinagar-Pathankot road has been able to make good the damage that has been done to the country by the sudden closure of her nature-given water-ways, expensively-built highways and wisely designed small and single railway. Yet it is also very difficult to see the irreparable loss that the state people have suffered by the new arrangements and will, continue to suffer until the closed waterways and high-ways and the railway will be re-opened and traffic on them re-started under normal and peaceful condition.

In the past there have been similar flames between Austrailians and Americans.
My own opinion is that we Canadians generally feel that we are not sufficiently acknowledged by Americans. Example: How many Americans know that the first passenger jet outside of the UK was built in Canada? Probably not many. I don't think anyone seriously expects American schoolchildren to be able to recite volumes about Canadian history. But we do get annoyed when trated as if we are not signifigant.
I think Canadians usually feel smug in these areas and feel offended when not recognized by Americans:
-Publicly funded healthcare
-Human rights advancement
-Lack of fundamentalist religious movements
-Lower crime rates (in certain cases)
-Less racism, more open to immigrants
-A "more responsible" world citizen in military matters and in the UN (peacekeeping and paying full dues)
-Military contributions: Joining WWI and WWII from the start, War of 1812
-Less pollution (in some areas)
-A multiude of actors and recording artists that are highly visible throughout the world
-Engineering accomplishments: JetLiner, Avro Arrow, CN tower, development of nuclear power and weapons
However, we usually feel insecure over America's superiority in these areas:
-Current military strength
-Economic power and influence over Canada
-Immense power in global politics
I'm sure we can all think of more to add to each list. But what I would like to know is your opinion of Americans and their country. And if you are American, please feel free to share your view on how fairly/unfairly the rest of the world views you and your country.
In my own experience Americans are generally very kind people, in most cases more so than Canadians. I don't want to start an all-out war but would rather try to gather opinions worldwide why negative attitudes towards Americans exist.

But what does it actually look like when a will needs to be executed?
When a person dies, there are a number of events that must occur in order to finalize their affairs and figure out what to do with their assets.
A will helps direct what should be done with assets, among other things, and executing the will starts the process of Probate.
The more assets contained in the estate, the longer the process will be.
What we'll cover:
- Filing For Probate
- Need to sell property during probate?
- Appointing The Executor of The Estate
- Proceeding with Inventory of Assets and Notice to Creditors
- Paying Deceased Debts From The Estate
- Final Distribution of Estate Assets
- Need to sell the inherited house?
- Closing the Estate
- Frequently Asked Questions About Probate
Filing For Probate
When it's time to execute a will, you start by filing a petition of probate at the county clerk along with the death certificate.
This responsibility falls upon whoever has the will in their possession, often times a probate attorney or a family member that has access to the will, sometimes in a bank's safety deposit box.
The county that needs to receive the filing is the one that the decedent lived in when they did, and it must be done in a reasonable amount of time.
Some states may have different time frames for filing for probate, but in many states the window is within a year after death. Be sure to check with your state law to know how long you have to file for probate.
Once the form is completed and filed with the county clerk, they will then issue a citation and posted a notice that an application of probate has been filed so that a hearing can be scheduled.
Generally, the notice is posted in order to notify anyone who may contest the will or the administration of the estate.
This process can take 3-6 weeks to hear back from the court on their decision to admit the will to probate.
Nothing moves forward until the judge declares that the will is valid and signs appropriate court orders that confirms an executor to begin the process.
Once the court approves the petition, the person that filed the petition for probate will need to formally notify the heirs and beneficiaries, usually within 3 months.
This is ideally done before the hearing so that waivers of process and consents to probate from all parties can be received in time.
Need to sell property during probate?
Find out what we can offer for the property to help speed up the process.
Appointing The Executor of The Estate
The probate process requires that an executor is appointed, and they have a fiduciary responsibility to oversee all transactions of the estate, ensuring that the assets are distributed correctly.
The role of an executor is not to be taken lightly, as it can lead to personal liability if they fail to perform their duties.
An executor may be nominated through the estate (which normally occurs during the estate planning stage), or by the heirs and beneficiaries.
If the executor was nominated through the estate, then a self-proving affidavit must be provided to execute that appointment. The affidavit would have been signed by the decedent and executor nominee when the will was created.
If there are no nominations for an executor, or if the nominee wishes to not become the executor, then the court may appoint one.
Regardless of how the executor is appointed, the court will have final approval in who becomes the executor.
There's also one critical component to the executor: the status of dependency.
The executor of the probate process can be either a dependent or independent executor.
An independent executor has a few basic conditions that have to be met by the court, but otherwise doesn't need to be supervised by the court when deciding on transactions with the estate's assets.
The benefit to an independent executor is that there are less costs, since many things don't require the court's involvement, and the process can move much more quickly.
Not all states, however, offer the option to appoint an independent executor, so it's important to check with your states laws regarding this.
A dependent executor, on the other hand, will operate under the scrutiny of the court, meaning that in order to sell a car, stock, or other assets, or an attempt to pay any debts must first go through the court-supervised process in order to obtain approval.
This is the default method used for most states' probate cases.
The executor must also file all accounting records with the Court for each year of the probate, including receipts for expenses and bank statements plus verification from accounts owned by the Estate.
Once an executor is appointed, he/she will receive a Letter of Testamentary, which is an official document issued by the court allowing the executor to act on behalf of the estate's transactions.
In some cases, bond must be posted before being able to accept the letter, which essentially acts as insurance in case there were any financial damages done by the executor.
Proceeding with Inventory of Assets and Notice to Creditors
Once the executor has officially accepted their appointment, it's time to begin the arduous process of locating and tallying all assets and debts, as well as moving forward with notifying all parties involved.
Locating and calculating assets can be difficult because the decedent may have had many different accounts and locations that weren't known by others or easily documented, causing this process to take much longer than anticipated.
Some hidden assets can sometimes be identified through documents such as insurance policies and tax returns.
These assets will include anything such as real estate, vehicles, and other recreational materials (boats, yachts, etc).
Real estate is often one of the things that elongates the probate process because of how long it takes to sell the house.
When it comes to financial assets such as bank or investment accounts, once a bank or other financial institution receives a notice or death certificate, they will freeze accounts under the decedent's name, allowing the executor to assess and move those assets into the estate.
From here, the report of inventory and claims are then itemized, according to the value at the time of death, and submitted to the court to be officially logged.
Assets need to be appraised in order to assess the value at death, and that generally needs to be done within 90 days.
There are some time sensitive tasks that the executor will need to take care of.
- The executor will have to prepare a notice to creditors and send it to the local newspaper to be published within one month of receiving the Letter of Testamentary.
- Creditors that have liens against personal property of the estate are to be notified directly within 2 months of accepting the Letter of Testamentary.
- Certified letters of the full inventory must be prepared and sent to the beneficiaries within 2 months, and the executor must prepare and affidavit that states they have completed the notification.
- It's also the executor's responsibility to keep a balance to cover what's needed for final taxes, and insurance and mortgage payments in order to keep them current and prevent lapse in coverage and from entering foreclosure.
To keep inventory from appearing on public records, the executor can file an affidavit in lieu of inventory under 2 conditions:
- All debts, except for secured debts, taxes, and administrative expenses are paid; and
- All beneficiaries have received the certified mail.
Any creditor who wishes to make a claim must do so within the time frame permitted by that state's statute.
Paying Deceased Debts From The Estate
Once notices are posted, creditors will begin to make claims to recover debts.
It's up to the executor to determine which claims are legitimate and pay them through the estate.
In some cases, the assets will need to be liquidated in order to cover the debts and satisfy the claims.
The executor will also need to pay the decedent's expenses and liabilities that they have incurred such as final income tax and estate tax, which is due within 9 months after death.
Contesting a Will
Family members and beneficiaries of the deceased can contest the will, which can keep it from being finalized.
The contesting must be filed within 2 years, and it's up to the contestants to prove that the will, or part of the will, is invalid.
Final Distribution of Estate Assets
According to the will, or under the laws of intestacy if the deceased did not have a will or the will was not accepted by the court, an executor needs to perform a few final duties.
The executor must provide the court with documentation detailing every transaction during the probate process and the remaining value of the estate
Additionally, they will petition for final distribution for the authority to transfer the remaining assets. On average, this can take 4-12 months.
Once granted, they will then draw up the new deeds for property, and transfer stocks and other assets to the recipients. From petition to final distribution, this may take 4-6 weeks.
Need to sell the inherited house?
We buy inherited houses all over United States.
Closing the Estate
Once the final assets are distributed from the estate, then you've finally reached the closing point.
The executor can close the estate by filing a closing statement or a closing affidavit with the probate court.
The closing statement will basically be the official statement to the court that everything in the estate was distributed and all the relevant debts have been paid.
All in all, if your final question is "How long does probate take?", the entire average probate timeline can take anywhere between a few months and several years.
If you're about to get started on the probate process, or if you are currently in the middle of probate, then we have included this probate checklist to help break it down to an easy outline for you.
Frequently Asked Questions About Probate
How quickly is probate granted?
It usually takes about 3-4 weeks for the grant of probate to be received. Generally this occurs after the oath swearing has already been done.
Can you check if probate is granted / How do you find out if probate has been granted?
Yes, you are able to view if the probate has been granted. You'll have to go to the probate court and request assistance from the clerk there.
The clerk will be able to look up the estate information (you must provide the decedent's legal name), and they can check the status.
You'll be able to look at the probate file and request copies if the estate has been opened.
Where do I apply for probate?
The probate application is made to the probate office where the deceased resided at time of death.
This means they must have had a fixed/permanent place where the lived within that county.
Can you clear a house before probate?
Most personal items do not have any sort of title documents, such as appliances, clothing, furniture, household goods, and other personal belongings. These items are still subject to probate and need to be included on the inventory filing made with the probate court.
In some cases, there are items, such as heirlooms, that may be requested by siblings, children, or other beneficiaries. In these types of situations where multiple people request the same item(s), the executor can remove these items from the property and keep them in a safe location until the issue is resolved.
If there is not agreement between who is supposed to receive the item or items, then it is within the executor's rights to sell them and split the proceeds among the contestants.
How do I petition probate court?
To file the petition for probate, you must locate the appropriate office for the county where the deceased had a fixed residence. This might be a general unified court clerk, or there may be a separate probate court clerk that you will need to go to.
You can request the form from the county clerk, and they can help provide guidelines to assist you. The application will include a verification that essentially means you're swearing on oath that the filing for probate is correct to the best of your knowledge.
This document will need to be done in front of a notary (and be notarized), and then you can submit it to the clerk.
Make sure you keep a copy for yourself.
What happens if executor does nothing?
If an executor does not file for probate, then they will be unable to transfer title of any assets that exist in the decedent's name.
If the executor does file for probate but then does nothing, they can be personally liable for things like failure to pay estate taxes, incurring interest or penalties.
If the executor is not doing their job, then a beneficiary or another interested person (including a creditor) can petition the probate court to have that executor removed.
Additionally, any beneficiary can file a lawsuit against the executor if the beneficiary believes that the executor is mismanaging estate property or they are doing anything that breaches their duty.
How does an executor close an estate?
In order to close the estate, the executor will need to file a closing statement or file formal accounting, which details all the financial transactions that have occurred to close out the estate.
This requires another court appearance, and if approved, will finally receive a release of liability, which thus ends their duty as executor.In order to bring you the best organic produce, some ingredients may differ from those depicted.

Current promotional period
This latest promotion started on 18 January, and you’ve got until 5 March 2021, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time (4:59 a.m. on 6 March GMT).
You’ll receive 100% bonus points for purchasing points, beginning at 15,000 points. You can buy a maximum of 80,000 points with this promotion and receive 160,000 points, with a total cost of $800.
However, remember that Hilton Honors caps the points you can buy within a calendar year at 80,000 points. So, if you buy the maximum number of points during this promotion, you won’t be able to buy more Hilton points this year unless a future promotion temporarily increases the calendar year maximum.
Should you buy Hilton points during this promotion?
Typically, when Hilton sells points, they go for one cent each. But, this bonus allows you to snag points for half of that at 0.5 cents apiece. TPG values Hilton points at 0.6 cents each (or 0.4p), so this sale means you can acquire points for less than the average redemption value.
While we don’t often advise buying points without a specific redemption in mind, doing so can be useful when you’re one or two nights short of making a dream holiday complete. In other words, if you already have 200,000 Honors points but need 350,000 points for a specific booking, jumping on promos like this allow you to book your trip now.
It’s also useful for last-minute bookings at lower category properties. After all, these properties often have inflated cash prices but are affordable when staying with points.
Hilton also gives its elites the fifth night free when redeeming for award stays, increasing the value of your points by 20% when staying in increments of five nights. Also, Hilton’s Points and Money Rewards can sometimes allow you to get as much as one cent per point toward subsidizing the cost generally cost 90,000 to 95,000 points a night, this promo allows you to effectively purchase rooms for $360 to $380 a night (about £265 to £280).

OCAYA ALPHONSE } 2. ONEK MARY } RESPONDENTS 3. LOUM MARTIN } 4. OCAYA GEOFFREY } Heard: 12 February 2019 Delivered: 28 February 2019 Summary: dispute over customary ownership of land. ______________________________________________________________________ JUDGMENT ______________________________________________________________________ STEPHEN MUBIRU, J. Introduction: [1] The appellant sued the respondents for recovery of land measuring approximately ten acres forming part of one square mile of land located in Amalac village, Patuda Parish, Ongako sub-county, Aswa County, Gulu District, general damages for trespass to land, an order of vacant possession, a permanent injunction, interest and costs. His claim was that the land originally belonged to his grandfather Odong alias Dokgang. The appellant's father Sarafino Odur used it for grazing. Sometime in 2007 the respondents left their land situate in Kweyo village, Ami-Lobo sub-parish, Patuda Parish, Ongako sub- 2 county, crossed river Amalac that forms the natural boundary between the appellant's land and their land, to trespass onto the land in dispute. They have since established homesteads and gardens on the land. [2] In their joint written statement of defence, the defendants denied the claim in toto. They instead contended that the land in dispute measures approximately fifty six acres and belongs to them customarily. The first to the third respondents inherited the land from their grandfather, who is the great grandfather of the fourth respondent, Labella Lukwiya who in turn acquired the land as a gift inter vivos for grazing his cattle from his friend, Adwe during the year 1911. He occupied and utilised the land until his death in 1973. Adwe died during the year 1954. The boundary between the land in dispute and that belonging to the appellant is marked by a Lucoro tree and barbed wire fencing. It is bordered by a swamp on the Western side. All their activities on the land are lawful as they are the customary owners of the land. Although they did not present a counterclaim, they made a number of payers including dismissal of the suit, an award of general damages, interest, cots and a permanent injunction against the appellant. The appellant's evidence in the court below: [3] The appellant Odur David testified as P.W.1, and stated that he had lived on the land in dispute since his birth. The first respondent's father Okeny was Sarafino Odur's a herdsman and the latter allowed the first respondent's grandfather Labella Lukwiya to graze cattle on that land. At the fall of Idi Amin's government in 1979, all the cattle was looted as a result of which both Labella Lukwiya and Okeny Yovani returned to their ancestral land in Kweyo village. The respondents returned after the disbanding of the IDP camps to re-occupy the land and have since established gardens and dwellings on the land. P.W.2 Okumu Victor, a neighbour testified that the appellant's grandfather Sarafino Odur allowed five people including the first respondent's grandfather Labella Lukwiya, to graze cattle on his land now in dispute. When he died, his son Okeny Yovani continued 3 grazing cattle on the land until the herd was decimated by soldiers and he returned to his ancestral home. A fence had been planted along the river to stop the cattle from straying into people's fields. The dispute began when the respondents returned to the land after the insurgency and began cultivating crops on it. [4] P.W.3 Owiny Emmanuel testified that the natural boundary between the appellant's and the respondents' land is Amalac Stream. There was a fence along the stream but it collapsed. The first respondent has since crossed over onto the appellant's land and cut down trees. until he sold all of them and returned to the other side of the stream where his father Labella Lukwiya used to live. [5] P.W.4 Opira Samuel, a neighbour across Amalac Stream, testified that the land in dispute belongs to the appellant. Amalac Stream is the natural boundary between the appellant and the respondents. The respondent's land is on the other side of the stream and it is the land that belonged to their grandfather Labella Lukwiya.. When the cattle died, the first respondent began to grow crops on the land. The appellant's father Okeny Yovani although still alive is not claiming the land because he knows his father had only been allowed temporary user for grazing. The respondents' evidence in the court below: [6] The first respondent Ocaya Alphonse testified as D.W.1 and stated that the second and third respondents are his brothers while the fourth is his son. His 4 grandfather Labella Lukwiya told him that his friend Adwe permitted him to take cattle onto his land around 1911. Labella Lukwiya lived o the land until 1972 when he died. They planted Lucoro tree saplings to fence off the land and they have grown into trees. Their father was living on that land at the time of the first respondent's birth in 1956. Their grandmother died in 1984 and was buried on that land. The dispute began when the respondents lost all their cattle and the appellant in the year 2006 asked them to vacate the land. It has subsisted to- date. [7] D.W.2 Oneka Mark, the second respondent, testified that he was born on the land in dispute in 1973 and grew up thereon. During the insurgency they never left the land permanently as they would graze their cattle until 3.00 pm an return to the detach. Problems began in 2006 when government directed people to return to their land and the appellant returned from Karuma with a large family and demanded that the respondents should vacate yet before the war each family occupied its respective area of the same land separated by a common boundary. Labella Lukwiya had two wives; one on the land in dispute and the other on the opposite side of Amalac Stream. When he died, he was buried across the stream at the home of his second wife. D.W.3 Ocaya Geoffrey, the fourth respondent testified that he has lived on the land since he was born. The appellant is their neighbour and there was no boundary dispute between them until the year 2006. [8] D.W.4 Okeny Joseph Gaetano stated that the land belonged to the late Labella Lukwiya and now his grandsons, the respondents, live on it. Adwe lived on the West wile Labella Lukwiya lived on the East. Labella Lukwiya had two wives and when he fell ill he was taken to his senior wife across the stream. His second wife Lapobo remained on the land in dispute and when she died he was buried on that land. The appellant has never undertaken any activity on the land. D.W.5 Alobo Alisantorina testified that Adwe invited the first respondent's grandfather 5 Labella Lukwiya to live on the land. His second wife Lapobo remained on the land in dispute and when she died he was buried on that land. Proceedings at the locus in quo: [9] The trial court visited the locus in quo where it estimated the land in dispute to be approximately ten acres. The respondents were in actual physical possession of the land and had gardens on it. The respondents had four homesteads on the land and had planted about two acres of pine trees thereon estimated to be three to four years old. There were graves of the respondents' deceased relatives on the land. There was debris of a collapsed old homestead on the land. The appellant and his family occupied the adjacent land, with a road to Ongako Lagoo separating that land from the one in dispute occupied by the respondents. On the other side the land extends up to the swamp. Judgment of the court below: [10] In his judgment, the trial magistrate found that the respondents occupied the land as descendants of persons who had been permitted to occupy the land. The permission by the previous owners to occupy and graze cattle on the land was first granted to Labella and on his death, Yovani Okeny the respondents' father took over. Evidence at the locus in quo revealed that it is the respondents in actual physical possession of the land. they had established homesteads, had graves of deceased relatives on the land, gardens and pine trees. Their grandmother was buried on this land. The land has for ages been in procession of the respondents and their forefathers without any attempt to evict them. The appellant is simply trying to reclaim land that once belonged to his forefathers. He found that the land belonged to the respondents as customary owners and therefore they were not trespassers thereon. He dismissed the suit and issued a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from further acts of interference with their possession. 6 The grounds of appeal: [11] The appellant was dissatisfied with the decision and appealed to this court on the following grounds, namely; 1. The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact and misdirected himself when he failed to properly evaluate the evidence on record as a whole and came to the wrong conclusion. 2. The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact when he wrongly held that there was no trespass committed by the respondents thereby occasioning a miscarriage of justice. 3. The learned trial Magistrate erred in law and fact when he failed to consider the weight of the evidence of the appellant vis-à-vis the contradictory witnesses of the respondent and holding that the respondents are the owners of the suit land whereas not, thereby occasioning a miscarriage of justice. Arguments of Counsel for the appellant: [12] In his submissions, counsel for the appellant argued the second ground first and submitted that P.W.1 stated that they returned from the camp in the year 2007 and began to cultivate and build on the land. He said the respondents are neighbours on the opposite side. He stated that the grandfather of the respondents requested for grazing land from his father. He stated that the defendant left the land in 1979 after the overthrow of Idi Amin, and this was confirmed by P.W.2, 3 and 4. It was an agreed fact that all parties are on the land. The appellant testified that the respondents left the disputed land and returned to the land opposite the Amalac Stream and that they came back in 2007 when people returned from the camps. He then reported to the L.CII and that is when a fresh trial was ordered. At the locus in quo, the respondents were found in actual possession. The court found that the appellant had no connection of the suit land. It found two acres of pine about 3 - 4 years old. This was within 7 the time the case was ongoing before the Chief Magistrate. That there were graves belonging to the respondents. The respondent mentioned only one grave of Lapobo. There are contradictions as to when Lapobo died; D.W.1 1972, DW2 stated1974 and DW4 1954. Had the magistrate carefully considered it, there would be evidence of trespass. They were not on the land between 1980 - 2006. Had the trial magistrate looked at the evidence, there would have been a case of trespass found. Occupation continued as litigation went on. P.W.1 left the land to avoid violence. Trees were planted during that period. [13] With regard to ground three he submitted that the trial Magistrate failed to give due weight to the contradictions. P.W.1 said they did not have a home in Amara ranch. D.W2. said they had land there at Amara Lach. DW1 said their grandfather got land from Adwe. D.W.4 told court that the land was vacant when Labella the grandfather of the respondents acquired it. D.W2 stated that both parties were using the land while P.W.4 denied usage of any land by the appellant. Their claim is not clear and so is it about the occupation. Had the trial magistrate considered the contradictions, he would have made a finding that they were trespassers. [14] With regard to the last ground, he submitted that the court found many graves and an old homestead but did not make a finding as to who owned the graves. Some of the findings are not supported by evidence. The evidence of P.W.2 was not appreciated. Both parties were not considered. P.W.2 said that Adwe was already deceased at the time of the alleged grant. He said he was his uncle. Five people requested for land and then the respondents came in 2007. Had the entire evidence been evaluated, a different conclusion would have been reached. He is the son of the person who is purported to have given land to the appellant's grandfather. The respondents contend it is Adwe who gave them the land. D.W.2 gave evidence of usage by both parties. It does not show that the appellant never utilised the land as alleged by DW6. Cultivation was referred to when DW6 stated that the appellant is using the entire land. DW6 is the father of the respondents 8 and he did not reside on the disputed land. The land is occupied by DW2, 3 and 4 who are children of DW6. DW3 is son to DW2, and DW3 are brothers of DWI, DW6 is grandfather to DW2, DW3 and father to DW1. He thus prayed that the court be pleased to allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the lower court. Arguments of Counsel for the respondent: [15] In response, counsel for the respondent submitted that trespass occurs with entry onto land in possession of another person. It is possessory action and remedies can only be granted after proof of a possessory interest. From the appellant's evidence, the grandfather of the respondents was given land on a temporary basis for grazing which would confer a license. That is not true. It was a gift inter vivos not for grazing but for settlement. The appellant's grandfather died and left his son Apoli who lived on the land and did not chase away the respondent's grandfather. D.W.2 was born on the land and he grew up until now. There was no intention to revert as it was never done immediately on death. He claimed there were other families given a license but this was disputed by DW6 who testified that they never shared any grazing rights. The appellant only cane in 2007 on returning from Karuma after the LRA war. He was never in possession. He began laying claim in 2007 and by the time the land was in the hands of the respondents. It is difficult to infer that it was temporary. The grandfather said that a second wife Lapobo lived there, died and was buried on the suit land. The grave was seen at the locus. This shows a long period of occupation. Contradictions in the year of death of Lapobo is due to lapse of time. Witnesses could not have accurate memory. It does not go to the root of the mater, His death and burial was not challenged. The appeal should be dismissed. 9 Duties of a first appellate court: [13] This being a first appeal, it is the duty of this. Oral evidence when corroborated by physical evidence carries more weight: [14] It was the appellant's case that his grandfather Sarafino Odur Odong alias Dokgang gave temporary grazing rights on this land to five people including the first respondent's grandfather Labella Lukwiya who vacated the land sometime in 1979 at the fall of Idi Amin's government. This was because all his cattle were looted as a result of which both Labella Lukwiya and Okeny Yovani returned to their ancestral land in Kweyo village. The respondents returned to reoccupy the land only after the disbanding of the IDP camps in 2007 and have since established gardens and dwellings on the land. [15] It was the respondents' case that their grandfather Labella Lukwiya acquired the land as a gift inter vivos for grazing his cattle from his friend, Adwe during the 10 year 1911. He occupied and utilised the land until his death in 1973. When he died, his son Okeny Yovani, the respondent's father, continued grazing cattle on the land at the time of the first respondent's birth in 1956. Their grandmother died in 1984 and was buried on that land. During the insurgency they never left the land permanently as they would graze their cattle until 3.00 pm an return to the detach. The appellant is their neighbour and there was no boundary dispute between them until the year 2006. The appellant has never undertaken any activity on the land. [16] It emerges from the two versions that it is not disputed that sometime in the early to mid 1900s, the respondents' grandfather Labella Lukwiya was granted grazing rights over this land and that upon his death, his son Okeny Yovani, the respondent's father, continued grazing cattle on the land for some time. What is in dispute is; (i) whether those rights were granted by the appellant's grandfather Sarafino Odur Odong alias Dokgang or a one Adwe; (ii) whether the rights were temporary or permanent; (iii) whether those rights included establishing dwellings and gardens. The trial court found that on account of the fact that their grandmother was buried on this land, and that their forefathers had been in procession without any attempt to evict them, the appellant was simply trying to reclaim land that once belonged to his forefathers. [17] Since there is no standard method of evaluation of evidence, an appellate court will interfere with the findings made and conclusions arrived at by the trial court only if it forms the opinion that in the process of coming to those conclusions the trial court did not back them with acceptable reasoning based on a proper evaluation of evidence, which evidence as a result was not considered in its proper perspective. This being the first appellate court, findings of fact which were based on no evidence, or on a misapprehension of the evidence, or in respect of which the trial court demonstrably acted on the wrong principles in reaching those findings may be reversed (See Peters v. Sunday Post Ltd [1958] E.A. 429). 11 [18] Evaluation of evidence entails assessing the credibility and probative value of evidence before weighing it in order to arrive at a decision. In order to distil the truth from the evidence presented, the court must consider the body of evidence as a whole, as well as evaluate the persuasiveness of each individual piece of evidence. For all types of evidence, whether oral or documentary, direct or circumstantial, reliability must be assessed in order for the court to decide how much weight it should be attached to it. [19] In principle, no amount of corroboration would render incredible evidence credible. So the court has first to inquire as to whether the evidence that it has before it is credible before it even goes on to look for fortifying evidence, strengthening or confirming evidence. Evidence is reliable only if it has been shown to be correct. Correctness may be assessed upon considerations such as; whether the witness has a personal interest in the issue; if there is a basis for bias; if one party had a better opportunity to know the facts, and which version is more reasonable and probable.. [20] In the ordinary affairs of life when one is in doubt as to (see DPP v. Kilbourne [1973] 1 ALL ER 440; [1973] AC 720). Secondly, the 12 corroborating evidence must also be credible and independent. It should not be mere repetition of the evidence on record. [21] The trial court did not make any finding as to whether the respondent's grandfather Labella Lukwiya acquired the grazing rights from the appellant's grandfather Sarafino Odur Odong alias Dokgang as contended by the appellant or a one Adwe as contended by the respondents. The appellant and his witnesses were consistent in testifying to the fact that Amalac Stream formed the natural boundary between the appellant and the respondents' land. In cross- examination, none of these witnesses was impeached regarding this fact. It is trite that an omission or neglect to challenge the evidence in chief on a material or essential point by cross examination would lead to an inference that the evidence is accepted, subject to its being assailed as inherently incredible or possibly untrue (see Habre International Co. Ltd v. Kasam and others [1999] 1 EA 115; Pioneer Construction Co. Ltd v. British American Tobacco HCCS. No. 209 of 2008 and James Sawoabiri and another v. Uganda, S.C. Criminal Appeal No. 5 of 1990). The appellant's version on this point is not inherently incredible and was not shown to be possibly untrue. [22] Moreover the evidence showed that the respondent's grandfather was buried on the other side of the Amalac Stream. This was corroborated by the second respondent D.W.2 Oneka Mark and D.W.4 Okeny Joseph Gaetano who testified that Labella Lukwiya had two wives; one on the land in dispute and the other on the opposite side of Amalac Stream. When he died, he was buried across the stream at the home of his second wife. On the other hand, the respondent's version that their grandfather acquired the land from Adwe is devoid of corroborative evidence. The appellant's version fits in with other statements or circumstances relating to it and thus I am more inclined to believe it. I therefore find that it is the appellant's grandfather Sarafino Odur Odong alias Dokgang who gave the respondent's grandfather Labella Lukwiya grazing rights on the l and in dispute. It was not a one Adwe as contended by the respondents. 13 [23] In determining whether the rights were temporary or permanent, the trial court appears to have been persuaded by the fact that the land in dispute has for ages been in procession of the respondents and their forefathers without any attempt to evict them. the trial court in essence found that the evidence was more consistent with a gift inter vivos than with a grant of temporary rights of user. A gift inter viv). [24] A gift inter vivios of land may be established by evidence of exclusive occupation and user thereof by the donee during the lifetime of the donor. A gift is perfected and becomes operative upon its acceptance by the donee and may be established by evidence of exclusive occupation and unrestricted user thereof by the donee during the lifetime of the donor . None of the witnesses were present at the time of the grant. [25] The evidence before the trial court showed that the grant was never evidenced in writing. The transaction was entirely oral coupled with delivery. Whether or not it was on temporary basis could only be determined by evaluation of the cogency of evidence adduced by both parties. More weight is usually attached to evidence that can be independently and objectively verified. Because of the difficulty in determining the accuracy or clarity of the individual’s memory, evidence that 14 rests solely on the word of a witness will be accorded a lesser weight in the face of that which can be independently and objectively verified. However, even verifiable evidence must be scrutinised for accuracy. At the locus in quo, the court found graves of the respondents' deceased relatives on the land. There was debris of a collapsed old homestead on the land. This corroborated the testimony of the first respondent D.W.1, D.W.4 Okeny Joseph Gaetano and D.W.5 Alobo Alisantorina that Labella Lukwiya's second wife Lapobo remained on the land in dispute and when she died he was buried on that land. [26] The witnesses contradicted one another on the actual date of Lapobo's demise. It is settled law that grave inconsistencies and contradictions unless satisfactorily explained, will usually but not necessarily result in the evidence of a witness being rejected. Minor ones unless they point to deliberate untruthfulness will be ignored (see Alfred Tajar v. Uganda, EACA Cr. Appeal No.167 of 1969, Uganda v. F. Ssembatya and another [1974] HCB 278, Sarapio Tinkamalirwe v. Uganda, S.C. Criminal Appeal No. 27 of 1989, Twinomugisha Alex and two others v. Uganda, S. C. Criminal Appeal No. 35 of 2002 and Uganda v. Abdallah Nassur [1982] HCB). The gravity of the contradiction will depend on the centrality of the matter it relates to in the determination of the key issues in the case. [27] What constitutes a major contradiction will vary from case to case. The question always is whether or not the contradictory elements are material, i.e. “essential” to the determination of the case. Material aspects of evidence vary from crime to crime but, generally in a criminal trial, materiality is determined on basis of the relative importance between the point being offered by the contradictory evidence and its consequence to the determination of any of the elements necessary to be proved. It will be considered minor where it relates only on a factual issue that is not central, or that is only collateral to the outcome of the case. In the instant case since the fact of her death and burial on the land was not in dispute, the date of Lapobo's demise was not essential to the determination of the case. It was a minor contradiction that could be explained by 15 lapse of memory due to passage of time. Since it did not point to deliberate untruthfulness, the trial court was justified in disregarding it. [28] The presence of Lapobo's grave on the land and the debris of a collapsed old homestead thereon renders the nature of the grant in the instant case to be more consistent with a gift than a license limited to temporary grazing rights. The observations at the locus in quo by the trial court were more consistent with the respondents' version than the appellant's claim of temporary occupancy. The gift can be deduced from the presence of those features on the land. At common law, a donor of property who does not provide for a reservation of rights in the grant, absolutely and irrevocably divests himself or herself of title, dominion, and control of the gifted property. I find therefore that the appellant's grandfather Sarafino Odur Odong alias Dokgang gave the first respondent's grandfather Labella Lukwiya the land in dispute, not on temporary basis for grazing purposes, but as a gift inter vivos. Upon the death of Labella Lukwiya, the land passed to his Okeny Yovani, the respondents' father. The respondents therefore are not trespassers on the land. The evidence as a whole shows a significant imbalance that tilts the scale in favour of the respondents and therefore the trial court came to the correct conclusion. Order : [23] In the final result, there is no merit in the appeal and it is hereby dismissed. The costs of the appeal and of the trial court are awarded to the respondents. _____________________________ Stephen Mubiru Resident Judge, Gulu Appearances For the appellant : Mr. Akena Fred.

By
Adamawa State Chapter of National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwifery (NANNM) this medium gathered, is embroiled in leadership dispute over the chairmanship position relinquished by Lami Aminu.
The Chairman of the Committee of Chairmen and Secretaries of the Adamawa State chapter of NANNM, Comrade Bako Johnson confirmed the development to newsmen that there was an uproar by members during an emergency meeting on November 10, at the secretariat of the union in Yola.
Johnson told our correspondent that the uproar went dirty when Mrs. Lami Aminu staged a walk out on the Congress members who wanted a more elaborate explanation, clarity, and authenticity of notice of state by-election for the position of Chairman as they observed a belated letterhead paper was used and signed by A. T. Shettima.
Bako said the inconsistency of the two letter headed papers written by Lami thus: ” Notice of state by-election for the position of state Chairman and Re: One month notice for relinquishing the position/post of the chairman, NANNM Adamawa state both dated 27th October”, 2021 resulted to reactions and counter-reactions of suspecting a foul play to scheme her way to conduct the bye-election herself despite the relinquishing letter she tendered.
Johnson revealed that Lami’s actions resulted in temper rising high and members raising eye brows on each other, which made her furious to the extent of allegedly hijacking the collar of one of the unit Chairmen and damned the consequences of her status.
According to him, they want the National President of NANNM in Abuja at the union’s national headquarters to address the Adamawa union issues.
He said based on the constitution and guidelines of how the union should run, the Adamawa State Executive Committee (SEC) is not wrong to have observed a Constitutional breach being the fact that Lami is no longer in power to preside over union matters because she has tendered her resignation letter.
He blamed the Provost for not following up the administrative protocol to channel her letter that she was expected to write to the state executive council before it will be transmitted to the National headquarters.
“This Singular action and demand from the SEC in session prompted an unwarranted and unnecessary reaction from the leader (Lami) of her pedigree by staging a furious and vicious walk out on SEC in session where she grasped one of the branch Chairman (Hassan Kadala) who was among the people that were trying to persuade her to stay and resolve the issues amicably. Nevertheless, an attempt to persuade her could not yield any positive result which led to her eventually leaving the venue.” Johnson said
“You would recall that a panel committee and investigation was set up to find out the root cause and coming out with suggestions over divergence issues, complains in the Adamawa State College of Nursing and Midwifery where Lami is the Provost and the same time NANNM Chairman.
“One of the committee’s recommendations was for her to relinquish her Chairmanship position of NANNM so she can concentrate on her provost work of the college this is how the crux of the matter and Union imbroglio started.” Johnson further said
Bako, however, said despite the hullabaloo normalcy was returned and a five Man committee was nominated by SEC in session and is the chairman of the committee.
Other members of the committee he said are: Benjamin Emmanuel, (Secretary) Sarah Simon (Secretary), Verenwonson R. Bila (Secretary), and Adamu Usman Galadima (Auditor) with the mandate to interface and seek clarification from the National headquarters of the trending imbroglio.
The committee is mandated to seek the Constitutional interpretation of how a letter of resignation should be channeled, to find out either is constitutionally wise for any relinquished official at the state or unit level is logical to preside over union matters, to know if there is a constitutional back up for any officer who is resigned to supervise an election to replace his/her office and many more germane issues they raised.
On contrary submissions, however, the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Adamawa NANNM Union, Magaji Mani said the Letter from the National headquarters of the union before him does not reveal to him that Lami Aminu resigned from her position as the Adamawa State Union Chairman of NANNM.
According to him, there is no document to prove that Lami resigned and all the documents before him suggest that she is to hand over to the next elected Chairman whose election will be conducted by the National officials of the union, contrary to the thinking of comrade Johnson and other union members are trying to portray.
He said NANNM’s constitution does not permit Lami to conduct any election as officials from the National office are coming down to Adamawa to conduct the election on a scheduled date.
He refuted that there was no where Lami hijacked any unit chairman, but admitted there was a war of words that ensued among union members, which according to him is normal as far as unionism is concerned.The predominant SW aspect of the enigmatic dragonblood tree underlines the importance of fog.

Oxidative damage plays an important role in epilepsy pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment of epilepsy. Recent studies have suggested that nuclear factor LY3023414 chemical structure erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) binds to antioxidant response element (ARE) to induce antioxidant and phase II detoxification enzymes under conditions of oxidative stress, which reduces oxidative damage and accumulation of toxic metabolites. This study evaluated the role of Nrf2-ARE signal pathway in protecting the brain from seizure-mediated damage. Wistar rats and Nrf2-deficient or control mice were chronic kindled in the amygdala. Sulforaphane (SF) was used to activate Nrf2-ARE signal pathway. The progression of kindling, the cognitive impairment and oxidative stress parameters were assessed to determine the extent of seizure-mediated
brain damage. Our results indicate that activation Nrf2-ARE signal pathway with SF in hippocampus suppressed the progression of amygdala kindling, and also ameliorated the cognitive impairment and oxidative stress induced by epileptic seizure. These observations suggest that Nrf2-ARE signal pathway may represent a strategic target for epilepsy therapies. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.”

What do fish want?
Right up front, I confess that I have no idea. None.
All my life I’ve wondered what fish want. At various times, I thought I knew what would cause this or that fish species to bite. However, the few times when I was positive that I’d found The Secret, it turned out to be either my overactive imagination, my rose-colored glasses or a convincing combination of both. I’m still wondering.
Thinking I held the Key of Fish Knowledge, I’ve had the audacity to tell others how to get fish to bite. In this very newspaper, I’ve given tips on how to retrieve everything from a Clouser Minnow to a Size 5 Vibrax spinner with a yarn tail. I’ve shared different ways of curing salmon roe. I’ve told anglers how to jig for halibut, troll for salmon and bait a C-hook. Forget all that. Even the times when I was right, I was only partly right, part of the time. I’m sorry, but the rest of the time I was wrong, wrong, wrong.
At least I’m not alone in my ignorance. Everyone else who claims to know what fish want is wrong.
Looking back over a lifetime of fishing, I realize now that quite a lot of my success was due to persistence, a polite word for bullheadedness. Those times that I caught a lot of fish, I was fishing a lot. I simply had my line in the water when the fish — probably on a whim — began to bite.
Oh, I’ve had some success. There were days when the scuppers ran red and the fish box overflowed. On those days, I felt as if I’d finally figured out what made fish tick. But whenever I’ve tried to repeat what I did on these days, I’ve caught naught but disappointment.
I’ve tried everything. The craziest thing happened July 28, 2006 aboard the Cruiser VI, fishing for halibut out of Homer. A client had given the skipper a Biosonix BSX sonic fish-attraction system, an electronic “fish call” that broadcasts prey-fish sounds through an underwater speaker to attract predator fish. It had cost about $700, so he figured he should use it. We tried several settings, but only baby halibut came to our hooks. Then, just as we were ready to turn the contraption off, someone slid the “Dub Side of the Moon” CD into the boat’s CD player, cranked up the volume, and the bite turned on!
It was as if the fish had been poised, all senses alert, for a combination of psychedelic reggae and the pitiful cries of panic-stricken baitfish. We were suddenly reeling in keepers. But we’ll never know why. The skipper changed the music to Tennessee Ernie Ford’s “Sixteen Tons,” and the bite stopped like a two-dollar watch. To the best of my knowledge, no one has ever duplicated that exotic experiment.
So, as I stated at the start of this column, I don’t know why fish bite, and I’ve given up trying to teach others the reason. I’ve come to the conclusion that the main reason I like fishing is the not knowing, the wondering. Everything else about fishing is just so much futzing around.
All that said, I came across something the other day that I want to try on silver salmon this fall. It’s Dr. Juice’s Super Juice Tournament Salmon/Trout Scent, said to contain “fear pheromones, a special amino acid profile, and MF3, a stimulant derived from softshell crawfish.” According to the blurb at basspro.com, boat captains, guides and tournament pros say Super Juice “can more than double your catch.” You can’t help but wonder.
