"...the activists--in conjunction with likeminded persons both inside and outside the Church--will try to intimidate the Church from without and undermine it from within."
We ask forebearance for rehashing old ground, but the lesson must be learned--and what actually happened in San Francisco is an important lesson. In 1997, homosexual activists in Catholic Charities, in conjunction with the City of San Francisco, worked to force "domestic partnership" benefits on the Archdiocese, and then in 2006, they forced the Archdiocese into allowing adoptions to same-sex households. The 2006 scenario was practically a carbon copy of the 1997 event, which makes sense, since it worked so well for the activists in '97.
“Undermining from within”
How did this come about? In the 1980s, Catholic Charities stepped up admirably to help those suffering from the AIDS epidemic. They continue to do good work with AIDS sufferers to this day. Since over 90% of San Franciscans suffering from the disease were men who engage in “sex” with other men, this meant that Catholic Charities would be working very closely with same-sex attracted men, and, unsurprisingly, a large number of homosexual persons ended up in the organization. From a San Francisco Examiner article of January 30, 1997:
“With strong connections to the Bay Area gay community - and with gay employees itself – the group (Catholic Charities) has struggled at times to distance itself from Catholic anti-homosexual doctrine, according to some gay Catholics. But that division has been difficult to maintain, say ex-employees, who complain they couldn't hand out condoms, discuss safe sex in an unrestricted fashion or disagree with decisions by the hierarchy….
Franco Lacayo, a former Catholic Charities AIDS case manager who resigned three years ago, said there were many gay people working at Catholic Charities. He said that when he worked at the agency he had been frustrated because he wasn't supposed to hand out condoms and because gay people were discouraged from displaying gay slogans . . . – “Catholic Charities delays AIDS event. Flap over domestic partners alienates gay employees.”-SF Examiner, January 30, 1997"
So we see that homosexual activists had infiltrated the organization no later than the early 1990’s. While those activists disagreed with the Church, they were in agreement with the government--and the government was ready to show its fist. What follows is an abbreviated version of events (for more details, go here).
By 1997 the city had passed an ordinance that required all those doing business with the city to provide domestic partner benefits to their employees--including same-sex couples. The Archdiocese refused to do this, since it is in conflict with Church teaching.
"Intimidation from Without"
So the city (which, as we pointed out yesterday, supplies Catholic Charities with the overwhelming majority of its funding) threatened to withdraw funding if the domestic partnership benefits weren't granted. After a lot of back and forth, threatened lawsuits, etc., the Archdiocese caved. A “compromise” was crafted, that allowed any person working for Catholic Charities to name any other person as a "domestic partner." And where did that "compromise" come from? According to openly lesbian Supervisor Susan Leal:
"...a representative of Catholic Charities had also floated the proposal."
Long story short: the proposal was accepted, the homosexual activists won, and Church teaching lost. After the dust settled, in an interview with “First Things,” then-Archbishop William J. Levada commented:
“It is a given in San Francisco, I am told, that politicians concerned about their future weigh very carefully the impact of their speech and actions on the gay and lesbian voters...But it would be my hope that our experience here would provide good reasons why any proposal elsewhere for similar legislation on domestic partners should be defeated."
One shares the Archbishops hope. But as the 2006 gay adoptions debacle showed, the Archdiocese had apparently learned nothing. In my opinion, it is unfair to blame Archbishop George Niederauer for this, since he was new to this hornet’s nest. Someone in the Archdiocese with some experience of the city should have tipped him off. In the event, he was blindsided by the activists.
After 2000, under the leadership of an openly homosexual director of programs and services Dr. Glenn Matula, (himself an adoptive "father") the activists inside Catholic Charities began placing children in the households of homosexual couples. Once again, an action totally in conflict with Church teaching. Once again, the Church stands up, argues for its right to be true to Catholic teaching. Once again, the city shows its fist, threatens to withhold funding. Once again, a “compromise” is crafted, this time under the “consultation” of openly homosexual supervisor Bevan Dufty, whereby Catholic Charities outsources its adoption program to “Family Builders by Adoption”, “the gayest (adoption agency) in the country”, on whose Board of Directors sat the same Dr. Glenn Matula, Director of Programs and Services at Catholic Charities. Once again, the proposal was accepted, the homosexual activists won, and Church teaching lost. It was a classic case of good cop/bad cop. The only upside is that this time our Archdiocese apparently learned something. They have cancelled Catholic Charities’ adoption program completely.
San Francisco and Connecticut
But as we said yesterday, there is an irreconcilable conflict between what the homosexual activists want and the teaching of our Church. Today the government of San Francisco, controlled by homosexual activists, has moved far beyond the bludgeon of program defunding. In payback for our Church’s defense of natural marriage, they are now trying a new interpretation of the tax code to punish the Church. That is very similar what happened earlier this year in Connecticut.
For now, it appears that the two homosexual activist legislators in Connecticut have overplayed their hand--for now. As Jack Smith (and others) have pointed out Connecticut Bill #1098 was nearly identical to a proposal put forward by members of "Voice of the Faithful," and its most vocal exponent was Professor Paul Lakeland. We know of Professor Lakeland in San Francisco: On Sunday June, 15, 2008 "Voice of the Faithful of Northern California" sponsored an address of his on “How the Laity Can Save the Church” at, where else, the (Jesuit) University of San Francisco. For some reason that is no longer on the VOTF website, but we PDF’d it:
Shadow Power Structures
But let’s suppose that in Connecticut, Bill #1098 had passed, and that the activists had succeeded in restructuring the administration of parishes in that state. Who would have taken over? Are there any power structures being developed in or around the Church who could have stepped in? A power structure is simply a group of persons organized for common action. The homosexual activists we have described are one such power structure. In addition to corrupting Catholic Charities, they have completely taken over Most Holy Redeemer parish in San Francisco. “Voice of the Faithful” is another such power structure--and, not coincidentally, two of the “Voice of the Faithful Northern California” leaders are also members of Most Holy Redeemer. Other power structures, potentially far more powerful, exist as well.
One of the recent developments in church life is the appearance of local “organizing committees” who work with groups of parishes. In the San Francisco Bay Area there are three: the “Bay Area Organizing Committee,” the “Marin Organizing Committee” and the “North Bay Sponsoring Committee.” In Los Angeles the organization is called “One LA.” They exist all over the country, including Connecticut.
They charge a fee, not small, for a parish to join. As it happens, I have some experience with one such group. In 2000, my parish signed up with the Bay Area Organizing Committee. We held some meetings. I, and a lot of the more active parishioners, were invited. I asked the leader of the BAOC what we were going to try and accomplish. The answer was that we were going to join together for common action. But for what aim? I asked. He responded that we were going to try and build an organization that would work on issues affecting the community. In other words, I got no answer. (Read this page from the “One LA” website to see what I mean.) This left me suspicious. Anyway, our relationship with the BAOC soon ended, because Fr. Malloy came in as Pastor the next year, and his idea was that the Catholic Church is all the organization you need.
What I did not know back in 2000, but I know now, is that every one of these "organizating committees" are all part of the Industrial Areas Foundation, an umbrella organization founded by the famous community organizer Saul Alinsky.
Certainly, some of the things the IAF pushes may be good, but so what? Remember that homosexual activism at Catholic Charities was a result of the organization’s admirable response to the AIDS epidemic. That response was a good thing too, but it also resulted in the development of an alternative power structure within the Archdiocese that has been a disaster.
Those activists did not want the Church to go away--they wanted to use it for their own ends. They had allies in government who could pressure the Archdiocese in such a way so that the activists seemed to be the ones able to offer a way out--thus strengthening their position. They were working together. The IAF affiliates are even more dangerous, because they are about developing power structures pure and simple. And nobody has any idea what they will use their power for.
Today, in Connecticut and San Francisco, we are seeing more government intimidation against our Church than ever before in American history. They won't try to get rid of the Church. They know that is impossible. What they will try to do is find allies within the Church who share their vision. Then they will use the power of government to help those allies create an institution more to their taste.

Knocking It out of the Park
The Catholic Exchange website is more popular than ever, having hit new records in March and April with over 300,000 unique visitors each of those months. We're looking forward to serving an even bigger audience when we unveil the long-awaited, improved and updated version of CatholicExchange.com later this year.
Also, as promised, our Catholic Exchange Today podcast is now a nationwide radio program on the Ave Maria Network! The hour-long weekly show is running on a number of Catholic radio stations across the country. If it's not on your favorite Catholic station yet, please call in and request it! Of course, Catholic Exchange Today, along with our daily podcast, Rock Solid with Mark Shea, is always available on the CE website for instant online listening or download. And next month we will be adding a brand-new podcast from CE board member Fr. Stan Fortuna.
Our newest project, which made its debut at our enormously successful, first-ever Catholic Scripture Study conference last month in Charlotte, is a program to introduce our children to the Faith as taught by the Church through the Scriptures. It's called CSS Kids and is produced by the same first-rate team that runs our Catholic Scripture Study (CSS) program (which is now in over 300 parishes!). Sadly, many children's faith formation programs are like a candy-based diet sweet-tasting but lacking any real substance. CSS Kids speaks to youngsters at their level, but offers solid teaching to help them grow into healthy, well-nourished people of faith. We're now offering this program to parishes and study groups across the country.
Catholic Exchange also furthered our mission to influence the culture via the media by helping launch the God or the Girl reality series on the A&E Television Network. CE's legal team worked closely with the producers of the series to ensure that the Catholic Church, its priesthood and the men discerning their vocations were depicted with dignity and respect. The show got a great response. As a Catholic Exchange viewer wrote:
What an awesome accomplishment to get God or the Girl on the air. It was utterly amazing to watch and listen last night I never thought I'd see a positive representation of praying at an abortion clinic on a mainstream cable channel, let alone such a constant stream of favorable comments about Christ and His Priesthood! Your mission to get true Catholicism out of the “niche” media model has taken a GIANT leap forward with this show. M. Browne, New York, NY
In many ways, God or the Girl playing on A&E represents the best kind of media evangelization. We want to reach people who might never otherwise be inclined to turn on a Catholic TV station or open a Catholic newspaper and let them know that the Church has a message of salvation for them and for all people, that all are invited to the banquet.
Next up at Bat
Our newest project will do just that. Called Champions of Faith, it is a documentary video that looks at how the Catholic faith inspires and elevates some of the top players in Major League Baseball. CE's John Morales, host of our Catholic Exchange Today radio show and veteran TV sportscaster and reporter will host the documentary. Even if you don't know a double from a double play from a double espresso, you'll see inspiring stories, classic game highlights and astonishing interviews with baseball heroes in some cases living legends on how their careers have been strengthened and magnified by their faith in God and the Catholic Church!
We've already begun work on this powerful and unprecedented production, interviewing future Hall of Famer and current Padres catcher Mike Piazza, Royals All-Star first baseman Mike Sweeney, Angels manager and former All-Star catcher Mike Scioscia, and other notables. We also attended the first-ever Vatican Sports and Church Conference in Rome, created by the late Pope John Paul II before the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and talked with pitcher Jeff Suppan of the Cardinals, former Athletics great and current Brewers General Manager Sal Bando, and former Angels catcher Darrell Miller. More interviews with current and past baseball stars will take place throughout the course of this season.
Champions of Faith is providing these true modern-day heroes with a rare opportunity to discuss faith in God, belief in the Eucharist, teamwork, sacrifice, leadership, humility, sportsmanship and the many virtues, values, and spiritual lessons they have learned from the game of baseball. We believe this documentary will inspire young people to be champions in the game of life by putting God first.
Keep Us in the Game
The unfortunate consequence of having all these exciting, faith-filled projects in the works is that we've stretched our resources to the limit. So, dear friends, we need your help more than ever before. We've always been amazed by God's providence and the generosity of the Catholic Exchange audience, and now we need to ask you to be more generous than ever before as we continue our mission to evangelize the world with the saving message of Jesus Christ and His Catholic Church. The vital evangelizing work of Catholic Exchange a non-profit organization is not funded by the Church. Only the support of viewers and friends like you keeps us in the game.
We're deeply grateful for all your help and prayers, which we need now more than ever. Along with the expense of these new and challenging projects, of course, we also need to continue operating the powerful Catholic Exchange website and our uniquely fruitful Catholic Scripture Study program. We humbly ask you to consider the following:

P.S. Please take a moment to send us the most generous gift possible for this important work at this critical time. Don't our young people deserve the best faith formation materials possible so they don't fall away from the Faith during college?

Mr Cairns went on to say that research in the UK and abroad has "cast serious doubt" on the argument that girls do better academically, particularly in more "male" subjects when they are not close to boys.
"The real reason some all-girls schools have a strong track record in traditionally "masculine" subjects, such as physics, is that they're very selective institutions," he suggested.
"Bright girls are more likely to study physics than those of average ability. Whether they are sharing classes with boys is largely irrelevant."
Ms Jordan said: "Whilst Mr Cairns may find it unpalatable, the truth is that girls' schools feature heavily at the top the league tables for independent schools and have done for decades.
"It may also have escaped his attention that all girls' schools provide plenty of appropriate opportunities for interaction with boys; in fact, it is rather old-fashioned to assume anything other.
"Finally, it is not just the 'brightest' who do better at STEM in girls' schools - a recent and extensive survey by the Institute of Physics found that girls in independent girls' schools are 1.5 times more likely to study A-level physics than girls in independent co-ed schools.
"It is time for Mr Cairns to cease his rather tiresome attacks on independent schools colleagues - the sector benefits from diversity and choice and I am sure he would agree with that."). ]

Writing a personal mission statement is a great way to decide what you really want to do with your life, but it's hard to know what to include in that statement. Fast Company has a few ideas to get you started. »I will start with the “oops”! One of my golfing friends said to me after the last article was published, “We’ve been seeing these beautiful yellow and red birds you mentioned – you know, the Summer Tanagers.” I replied, “Oh, you mean Western Tanagers”. No, she countered: “The birds you mentioned in the last Pinewood News – the Summer Tanagers.” “Really?” I said. So I went back and read and article and lo’ and behold, I realized I had goofed. I meant Western Tanager but wrote Summer Tanager.
Maybe it’s because I wrote that article at 30,000 feet up flying back from the Horicon Marsh birding festival in Wisconsin. Or maybe it was because I was thinking about spending the SUMMER in Munds Park. Regardless, I goofed and apologize. The Western Tanager likes coniferous forests. The Summer Tanager can be found in Arizona, but usually not at an elevation as high as in Munds Park. So if you see a slender, medium-sized bird with a brilliant red head and bright yellow body, black back, black wings with white wing bars, and a black tail – that would be the Western Tanager. One did show up around our back deck and I hope it will again. By the way, the first written record of it dated back to the Lewis and Clark expedition.
While golfing I spotted a Peregrine Falcon. It was in the air, flying more than soaring, and then after a while took a dive down behind the condos off the 10th fairway. The wing structure was right, the view from the bottom was just like that in my field guide, and the head had a black hood and sideburns. So that is a first for me for Munds Park. I’m glad I carry a pair of binoculars in my golf bag.
Peregrine Falcons were on the endangered species list for many years, almost decimated from exposure to DDT in insecticides. They have had a successful recovery since DDT was banned and were taken off the endangered species list in 1999. I have seen one of these birds during migration over the Grand Canyon (that was my first spotting) and also saw two way above the Chicago skyline when we were touring at the top of the old Sears Tower – about 100 stories up. Peregrine Falcons do live in cities, preying on Rock Pigeons. So just like the City Mouse and the Country Mouse, there are City Peregrine Falcons and Country Peregrine Falcons.
I was very happy to see the Osprey back. You can find it at Lake Odell, flying and fishing, perched on the dead tree on the south side of the Lake, or perhaps in a nest. The nest in past years has been on the east side of the Lake. Since I don’t spend winters here, I have no idea how long the Osprey family stays in Munds Park. If any of you year-round residents have seen it over the winter months, I would like to know.
The Osprey feeds entirely on fish. When it takes a large fish to the nest or perch, it moves it around so that the head faces in the direction it is flying – presumably to increase the aerodynamics. It’s all about survival of the fittest, and this species has its own techniques to increase its chances of success in the wild.Rental : Mobile home Natura : 4 2

For the topping:
- Sieved apricot jam, to glaze
- 900g (2lb) marzipan
- 700g (1lb 9oz) all-in-one royal icing sugar (about 1½packets)

Method
- Soak the sultanas and raisins overnight in 150ml (5fl oz) of the brandy. Drain the fruit (reserving the brandy) and heat up the oven to 150ºC (300ºF, gas mark 2). Butter and line with greaseproof paper the sides and base of a 23cm (9in) round cake tin.
- Cream the butter and sugar jointly, then slowly beat in the eggs. Fold in the flour and spices, and then the reserved brandy. Put the dried fruit, peel, cherries, nuts, lemon zest and juice and fold jointly. Move to the tin and level the surface with a spoon.
- Cover the top with a circle of greaseproof paper and bake for 2½-3 hours, or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Leave the tin to make it chilly, then turn out onto a wire rack and pour over half of the remaining brandy. Leave for some minutes, and then pour over the rest of the brandy, wrap in cling film and store in a cold, dry place, ready to be iced for Christmas.
- In the meantime, make the topping. Brush the cake with apricot jam. Knead the marzipan until soft, and then roll out onto a surface calmly dusted with icing sugar to around a little bigger than the top and sides of the cake. Lift the marzipan over the cake and smooth the top and sides. Rub in circular movements to give a clean end. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess marzipan from the base, and then mold the trimmings to make a mound for the top of the cake. Secure it with a little of the apricot jam, and then leave to dry for half a day.
- Make up the royal icing with glycerin and water, according to the packet instructions. Utilizing a palette knife spread the icing in a thick layer of the whole cake. Make peaks, using the back of a teaspoon, so that the frosting looks like snow. Leave to dry. Top with a few jelly lollipops before serving.

KerrymanRunning Fedora 12 on the ASUS UL30A-X5Fri, Mar 26, 2010 in reviews
I’ve had an ASUS-UL30A-X5 for about two weeks now. This is the nicest laptop I’ve ever owned (and I was a laptop owner before that was cool). I’m absolutely thrilled.
I used a Dell Inspiron 1501 for the last 4 years, the AMD model. Everything was a pain due to poor Linux compatibility. I blamed some of it on other things. For example, I thought my external monitor was low quality because all the pixels crawled like ants. I got this laptop and immediately everything I'd had a problem with was a non-issue. Skype audio -- works great. Suspend and resume -- works great. Everything. I didn't know how much pain I was in until I got this laptop.
I also considered buying an HP Pavilion DM-3 and a Toshiba Satellite T135, both very nice machines also, and much in the same class as far as size, weight, and battery life. I physically drove around to a bunch of stores and saw them, picked them up, etc. In the end, I think they are all great laptops, but after watching multiple YouTube reviews of all of them, it became clear that ASUS had built a killer machine.
Main selling points for me are the size, the weight, and the battery life. Those were what I was shopping for. In more detail:
- Small and light. Nice size for travel. 13.3 inch screen, really a perfect size.
- Long battery life. They claim 12 hours. They're really not kidding, I've gotten about 9 hours of honest work on a single charge, and I'm not clocking the CPUs down. I'm not exactly running compilers the whole time, but I'm talking on Skype, running an external monitor, using the wireless, running CPU-intensive things like LaTeX builds, and so on.
- Nice display! It's LED-backed, very bright, very white (makes my old laptop look dirty yellow/green in comparison).
- Nice keyboard!
- Fast. This is not a gerbil-pusher running an Atom processor, it is fast, and the chip has the virtualization features that help a lot when I'm running VirtualBox. It's much more powerful than my old laptop, more than powerful enough for OpenOffice.org to be snappy. DDR3 memory too. Definitely a high performance laptop.
- 4GB of memory, and more hard drive space than I'll ever use. I can't believe how big the drives are these days.
- Cool running -- almost cold. Quiet too.
- Did I mention that it works flawlessly with Linux? (The stock Fedora 12 install has a flaky wireless driver; just 'yum update' to get a new kernel, and you're golden.)
Downsides? Not many. The touchpad is a bit too sticky. The display doesn't open flat, it only opens back to about 120 degrees.
I did a lot of research and brought myself up to speed on the latest hardware. One thing I learned that surprised me: you have to be careful with the Intel chips these days. The model numbers make it hard to tell what you're getting. You have to go to the Intel website and use their comparator. I also learned what you probably know already: most of these computers come in an Intel flavor, and an AMD flavor that typically has ATI graphics and other components. The differences are manifold: the AMD machines are typically $100 cheaper, have half the battery life, and have all kinds of problems with weak driver support in Linux.
My wife can tell you how much I agonized over this. Should I buy a new laptop? Ehhh... my old one got the job done, I felt guilty about hurting the environment by paying for another computer to be built, I did't want to spend money... blah blah blah. I should have gotten off the fence ages ago and just bought it. Actually I take that back, it's only been available for 6 months or so.
I bought mine from Amazon, which was actually the best deal on the web, even after researching dealnews and other sites. None of the stores I visited had it in stock; they only had the AMD model.
It has no internal optical disk drive, which is actually a good thing for me -- I probably pop a disc in once every two months, if that. So I bought an external DVD burner, pictured at left, which is also quite nice. It works great to boot from it. I promptly booted from it to a Fedora CD and wiped the whole drive to install a real operating system.

We pay more than $1,200 per month—more than half of our income, which comes from my husband's job in a fruit and vegetable store. For the last two years, we've been looking to find somewhere better—somewhere more affordable, with more space for our children. Our landlord wants us out, too, because he wants to renovate and charge new tenants more as Bushwick gentrifies.
But there's nowhere for us to go. Even studios near where we live are now renting for $1,400-$1,500—too much money, and too little space, for our family of six.
In recent weeks, the city has heard much debate on how to create and preserve affordable housing. The most talked-about item has been the Mayor's Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) plan, which would exchange zoning changes to allow more housing construction for, in most neighborhoods, the requirement that 25–30 percent of apartments be affordable to people earning 60 to 80 percent of Area Median Income (AMI).
The problem with the plan is that it won't solve the problem for working class New Yorkers like me.
Sixty percent of Area Median Income is almost $47,000 for a family of three, and many New Yorkers are far from earning that. My family of six earns about half that much.
As a recent Real Affordability for All (RAFA) report found, in many of the neighborhoods that are being rezoned—like East New York, the South Bronx, and East Harlem—the average income is far below 60 percent of Area Median Income. So, when I look at the MIH plan, I wonder: "affordable" housing for whom? Certainly not for local residents like me.
Mayor de Blasio stood on the right side with our communities in the Fight for $15, to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour for the 3.2 million low-wage workers in our state who currently earn less. But the reality is that, even once our families win the $15 per hour that we so desperately need, the vast majority of the housing being proposed in the MIH plan will not be affordable to us.
We ask the Mayor to reconsider his plan and expand affordability to preserve and build genuinely affordable housing.

Bag Hag was one of only 6 bloggers invited by Dolce & Gabbana to the European fashion center for a monumental week of cutting-edge fashion
popular
It all began with that fateful phone call at almost 1 a.m. I answered it, thinking it was an emergency call from someone I knew overseas. Turned out it was someone from Dolce & Gabbana in Milan on the other line. Initially I thought it must have been a mistake, someone calling me from Dolce & Gabbana? And then I was asked if I was Ingrid of The Bag Hag Diaries blog, to which I said yes.
Then came the offer: “We were wondering if you would be interested in participating in our upcoming event in Milan during Fashion Week. We have chosen you to be one of the six international bloggers to dress up the windows of the Dolce & Gabbana flagship store in Via Spiga.”
I couldn’t believe it. It was a dream offer.
When I arrived in Milan for fashion week, I was toured around the Dolce & Gabbana showroom as well as the flagship store on Via della Spiga 26—a massive treasure trove of a store with an equally unbelievably large off-limits-to-the-public basement full of clothes and accessories. This was where it was all going to happen, and it was going to be a major event, one that would be attended by the likes of Vogue Nippon’s editor-at-large Anna dello Russo and of course, the designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana themselves.
There were to be six blogger dress-me-up events in six cities, but Milan was the first. I was in excellent company. Also part of this dress-me-up event was an old friend from last year’s LuisaViaRoma party, Denni Elias, and our country’s own fashion blogger and arguably the most famous of them all, Bryanboy.
Other bloggers included Kristin Knox of The Clothes Whisperer, Kelly Framel of The Glamourai, and Susanna Lau of Style Bubble. We were each tasked to interpret the Dolce & Gabbana Spring/Summer 2011-2012 collection based on own our styles and tastes.
Various themes
On Feb. 27 at 6:30 p.m. and with the exception of Susanna and Kelly who had worked on their windows the day before (they had to leave Milan on the day of the event), the remaining four bloggers, myself included, roamed around the store with photographers as well as our corresponding stylists/visual experts and picked out clothes for our mannequins. Meanwhile guests milled about, danced to the music, and watched us do our work.
By 8 p.m. we were all done, and I was quite amazed at how each window managed to produce a different theme. My clothes were centered around the idea of what a woman would wear to a summer vacation in the French or Italian Riviera. I worked with brights, strong floral jackets, white trousers and shorts, and a nice contrast of leopard prints which included a leopard Miss Sicily bag, the house’s signature bag.
I also scattered a few bags from the chair to the floor as added visual to the clothes. We were asked to sign our windows and since I was known as “the bag hag,” I decided to make it a little fun and wrote out, “Hmmm… What bag to carry?”
It was a surreal experience, one worth writing home about. Apart from having been invited to both the D&G and the Dolce & Gabbana shows, the Dress-Me-Up Blogger event was the undisputed highlight of my first Milan Fashion Week. This was a blogger’s dream and I could not thank the wonderful people of Dolce & Gabbana enough for the monumental experience!

Feature of the Month-July 2016
G Line testing, commissioning underway
Current activities include crossing tests, integrative testing, corridor-specific operator training, and train tests which will be followed by a full system performance demonstration along the entirety of the G Line from Union Station to Wheat Ridge.
Thorough testing of all mechanisms along the alignment is required by RTD, the Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Railroad Administration before the rail line will open to the public. See below for some important testing information.
Abide by safety signage at all times
Train at Pecos Junction
Safety is always the top priority. During the testing process, you may see an activated gate with no train movement. Please abide by all safety signage at the railroad crossings even if a train is not visible because train activity and traveling speed will increase as testing moves forward.
If you wish to view the trains being tested, please do so from safe, publicly accessible spaces and remember construction sites and stations are off limits for public use.
Train horns used for safety
Train horns will be used during testing leading up to the opening of the G Line. Until quiet zones are in place, the use of train horns and other safety measures are important so that motorists and pedestrians are aware of train movements.
Quiet zones are not guaranteed to be implemented by opening day, but all entities involved are working hard to establish quiet zones. RTD will announce when quiet zones are approved for the G Line.
Potential road closures, detours during testing
Railroad or at-grade crossings along the alignment are subject to closures and delays may occur. Alternative routes are suggested to avoid delays at crossings. The roadways listed below do not have any G Line crossings and will not be affected by testing.
Arvada:
Kipling Parkway
Wadsworth Bypass
Ralston Road
Sheridan Boulevard
Adams County:
Federal Boulevard
Pecos Street
Denver:
48th Avenue
38th Avenue
If an intersection is closed, please abide by all safety signage. Those who attempt to maneuver around the gate arms are at serious risk for injury.
To report crossing concerns
In the event of a crossing malfunction or to report concerns, you may call the phone number on the blue signs located at each crossing. The contact numbers are:
Lowell and Tennyson Crossings: Union Pacific Railroad at 1-800-848-8715
All other crossings: RTD Security Command Center at 303-299-3911
Please provide the date/time and crossing name or intersection when calling.
For closure information, please visit
RTD-Fastracks.com
or call Christina Zazueta, Gold Line/NW Rail Public Information Manager at 303-576-3352.

Later, RV asks his team to go and prepare their pointers on the project. In the conference room, Rv tells Shenela that though her project is full of mistakes but he is giving the project to her. On the other hand, Deesha tries to speak to Manas about his parents breaking their engagement because of RV. Manas gets hooked and promises her that he loves her and will marry her only.
Now in it’s upcoming episodes, Chirag will come to meet RV at his house but it’s actually RV associate whom he met. Shanailla will try to tell him but since he doesn’t want Shanailla to know that he is meeting RV for the first time, Chirag will tell Shanailla that it’s him only. The associate will make a deal with Chirag and Chirga thinks that he fell into his trap but in reality Chirag will fell in RV’s trap by putting half the money required for the project. Chirag will sign the cheque and is completely in RV’s trap.
RV will see Chirag from his window where he feels a lot of anger towards him and his dad will come there and will ask him “You look at this man and you feel upset for Ishani”. Chirag’s parents will get shock when they realize that they have to put house and jewellery on stake as Chirag had already given a cheque of his share in the const business to RV’s company.

The Blast defender scored a three-pointer in the third quarter to put Baltimore in the lead to stay. And in the fourth when the Wichita Wings pulled within one, it was Simmons who raced upfield to score to clinch a 19-10 victory at the Kansas Coliseum."[Simmons] has stayed after [practice] working on his shot, especially the three-pointer and it paid off," said Blast coach Kevin Healey.
The Blast, which plays host to Harrisburg tonight, gave Healey his first victory in Wichita, rallying from an early 5-2 deficit. Tarik Walker finished with a game-high seven points and Simmons had five.Born/age: Apr 2, 1993 (24)

The result is either the total result or the result of a selected season.I woke up this morning to find my car buried in snow. I know, I know, it's February and I live in Alberta. No big surprise or anything.
I just really, really want it to be Spring. I want to be able to sit outside and enjoy fresh air and sunshine. I want to grow flowers. I want to read outside. I want to wear Spring dresses.
I'm not a huge fan of shoveling off my car, slipping on ice, and being cold. Nor am I a fan of all the muck that snow creates when it melts. My car is so dirty, and every time I'm ready to clean it it's either too cold or too mucky out and therefore pointless.
I try to be a Canadian trooper of the Winter season, but I get sick of Winter really fast. Basically, I'm good with Winter until January rolls around. I like the pretty snow until Christmas and New Years are over. Then I basically pine for Spring and Summer.
Plus, last night I suddenly developed a swollen painful gland near my left ear. And I'm not impressed. Off to the doctor I go tonight.
Snow: you are pretty, but can you please go away soon?
Sincerely,
Annoying Canadian Winter ComplainerIntroducing Blue at Valley Bend – a New Development in Jones Valley

Property Description
Introducing Blue at Valley Bend… an innovation in neighborhood shopping.
Beauty, convenience, and local interest intermingle amid the ultimate open-air shopping experience under the shaded mall of Blue at Valley Bend. Combining the best elements of open-air venues across the country has created a shopping experience that is truly client aware.
While conveniently nestled in Jones Valley’s retail district, the combination of restaurants, retail shops, professional office space, apartments, and residential condos creates an all-inclusive neighborhood that departs from the convention of other developments. The design and arrangement of the buildings allow easy access from parking areas to all shops, offices, restaurants, and markets. Large open spaces highlight architectural interest and provide a park-like atmosphere enhanced by waterfalls, exquisitely landscaped gardens and the sight and sound of moving water features. The unique arrangement in which each building intersects the next with corners clipped at 45 degrees allows for wide, shaded sidewalks, large open spaces, al fresco dining and other creative uses of space.
Experience the innovation of neighborhood shopping dedicated to local artistry within Blue at Valley Bend. Enjoy convenience and atmosphere like no other, enveloped by Huntsville’s Southern charm in the city’s first development to incorporate shop, work, play, and home into a celebration of local style, art, and grace.I never liked math as a kid (or as an adult for that matter), but here’s a little equation I threw together: Dances With Wolves – wolves and Natives + Soviets and Africans – any dancing whatsoever + Little Richard music seemingly on repeat x Dolph Lundgren = 42. Hold on Doc, I messed that up. Carry the one… well, whatever… the answer is Red Scorpion. Now on dazzling Blu-Ray from Synapse Films, Lundgren’s follow up to that boxing picture comes home guns a-blazing and reeking of Cold War nostalgia. So get off your Pogo Ball and put away those Garbage Pail Kids… it’s time to kick some Commie sack!
Dolph plays Lt. Nikolai Rachenko, Soviet Special Forces – basically a one-man Army. His mission is simple, infiltrate an anti-communist group in Africa and kill their leader. When he fails to do so, he’s told he’s no longer Spetsnaz and tortured. Being Dolph Lundgren, he kicks some ass and busts out of his confines with the greatest of ease. Rachenko then befriends an African bushman (seriously) who helps him to realize he’s been fighting for the wrong side. Joining the rebels, he now fights the military force he once was willing to give his life for.
The story of making Red Scorpion is much more involved than that of the film. Produced by convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the film was a platform to spread Anti-Communist sentiment in the mid to late ’80s. The production company had a deal in place with Warner Bros. to distribute as long as the film met WB standards on completion. During shooting, the small kingdom of Swaziland kicked the crew out, scared it was secretly some sort of coup. After many weeks of searching for a new location (and running up an additional $500,000 to their $8 million budget), they were finally allowed to shoot in Namibia. Due to an international boycott on South Africa (still segregated under Apartheid), Warner Bros. pulled out of the distribution deal. In the end, having spent double their budget and without a clear distributor, the bond company took control to quickly finish off the picture. Shapiro-Glickenhaus Entertainment eventually picked it up and distributed the Scopion all over the world. The film would tank in theaters, but later thrive in the home video market. Oddly enough, this would be the way most Lundgren pictures would make their money over the next twenty years.
For such a troubled production there sure was a lot of name talent involved. M. Emmett Walsh plays an annoying American journalist who likes bacon cheeseburgers, rock ‘n roll and dead Communists. Brion James and T.P. McKenna play Soviet military men, while F/X great Tom Savini works his magic (particularly during the cringe-worthy torture scene). The script is solid, holding up decades after the fall of the iron curtain. The only thing that really stands out like a sore thumb is the use of 50’s rock ‘n roll during major action scenes. Like that would somehow make the whole thing even more ‘merican. In these scenes, director Joseph Zito tries to bring a carefree lightness that simply has no business in car chasing, bullet dodging, explosive ass kicking. Despite all this, it’s not hard to see that the film rides on the shoulders of Lundgren who’s charisma is as large as his pecs. He can send chills down your spine with a single scowl and make you cheer giddily when he answers the question “Are you out of your mind?” with “No, just out of bullets.” Then he burps.
This 2k transfer is the best this film has ever looked. Certain scenes are grainer than usual, but nothing too bad. The picture’s been cleaned up pretty well and the film looks like it could’ve been shot 5 years ago, rather than 25. The audio is in both 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, providing a clean mix that makes good use of surround sound and the original 2.0 mix, also in DTS-HD Master Audio. Both are great, but the 2.0 has that true “downtown cinema” feel. Others may appreciate the open feeling of the 5.1 track which gives the film a modern and more spacious feel. You really can’t go wrong with either.
Bonus features are found in abundance, but I found the shining star to be the featurette Scorpion Tales, a super cool interview with Tom Savini which shows how he did some of the amazing makeup effects for the film. Savini also provides some Behind the Scenes VHS video footage – a nice little addition. Hath No Fury is a sit down with Dolph Lundgren where he discusses his early career, from bodyguard to Grace Jones, to James Bond background actor, to playing Ivan Drago and ultimately headlining his own movies. Everyone knows Dolph is extremely intelligent (he holds a masters degree in Chemical Engineering), but this interview also shows how humble, grounded and professional the man is. Producer Jack Abramoff discusses many of the film’s hurdles in Assignment: Africa. It’s informative, but listening to Mr. Abramoff is like listening to my old high school math teacher. Other extras include a still photo gallery, liner notes on the making of the film by Lundgren scholar Jeremie Damoiseau and reversible cover art. I love my movie trailers and Synapse has never let me down in this department. They give us the theatrical trailer (“His one mistake was a death sentence. Their one mistake was not finishing the job.”) and a slew of television spots (“Some men go to war… Dolph’s just going to work.”) to enjoy. Finally, a commentary track with director Joseph Zito and Mondo Digital’s Nathaniel Thompson is provided and it’s really a great listen. I’m a fan of this type of commentary (Synapse tends to do these often), where the director is free to talk about the film, but when things slow down the scholar sort-of interviews him to keep the flow. It usually results in a very candid discussion rich with information and anecdotes that the director alone, especially after 20+ years, most likely wouldn’t be able to self-muster.
Red Scorpion gets a solid 4 out of 5 reels. I really miss the old days of Communist villains and the one man killing machine. They really don’t make them like this anymore and the straight to DVD actioners with CG explosions simply don’t cut the mustard. This film represents a bygone era as much as Dolph represents a bygone genre. I’d love to see The Expendables 2 bring these movies back to theaters, but whether that’ll happen is anybody’s guess. In the meantime, just sit back and let Professor Lundgren teach you how to take out an Army, one man at a time. No math skills required… unless you’re keeping a body count, Doc.

- If the interviewee is not a current or former player: “So, what’s the best part of coming in to OH MY GOD THE GRASS HERE TASTES LIKE BACON ICE CREAM Wrigley Field?”

The tradition of racing open-wheel midget and sprint cars on Thanksgiving in Southern California continues Thursday with the 70th running of the Turkey Night Grand Prix at Toyota Speedway in Irwindale.
This is the 12th consecutive year that the half-mile Irwindale track has hosted the races, which began in 1934 and have been held every Thanksgiving at various Southern California tracks except during some war years.
Famous drivers such as Parnelli Jones, A.J. Foyt, Bill Vukovich, Tony Bettenhausen and Tony Stewart are among those who have won the night's main event, the United States Auto Club Midgets race.
Four former winners are scheduled to compete this year: defending winner and current championship points leader Bryan Clauson, along with Bobby Santos III (2008), Jason Leffler (1999, 2005) and Bobby East (2004), according to USAC.
The night's racing schedule also includes USAC sprint cars and Ford Focus midget racing. Gates open at 4 p.m. and racing starts at 7 p.m.
-- Jim PeltzChris is a great friend as well as a musician/songwriter, social worker, and philosopher of life. Married to Crissy (my previous reader interviewee), I've know him for a lot of years. He's also the person I credit for influencing me to re-embrace my passion for writing. He challenges me, inspires me, and even now with this blog -- coerces me to leave pre-describe formats and try something new. I added some photos to this interview to help create the best and most honest mood for this installment I could.
Here's my interview with Chris Hutchison-Jones.
1) What kind of reader do you consider yourself?
Scattered? A fisherman? Restless? Short attention span. I read like a songwriter. I'm just looking for something to steal. I have several books going on at once, at varying degrees and speeds. I read Slaughterhouse 5 in two weeks. I've been working on Moby-Dick for three years. A Levon Helm biography has put everything else on hold.
2) What kinds of books do you read and why?
The ones I can see. The ones I wouldn't mind dating. I take commitment very seriously.
3) What author's (or stories) do you return to again and again? Why?
I think most males of a certain persuasion go through a Kerouac phase. And he is fun to read still, but he's more of an old friend who doesn't quite fit in with my current station. Someday i want to write a version of On the Road for folks that work 9-5 and take family vacations. An existential crisis with coloring books and pics of the family with the world's biggest ball of barb wire in Texarkana.
4) As a reader. what do you expect out of the author and the story you are reading?
Spin me a yarn. Be a good liar so the story's so good that I don't care if they're lyin'.
5) How has the eBook revolution changed the way you read and how you buy books?
The revolution was postponed because of rain.
6) What makes you pick up a book or author you've never read before?
A whim. First and last name of the author starting with the same letter.
7) With so many books to read, why do you choose the books you do?
Momentary inspiration. At any moment I have five to ten books to read.
8) Film before book, or book before film? Why?
Plead the 5th.
9) List the five books that stick with you and tell why they do.
Desolation Angels
"I have nothing to offer anyone but my own confusion."
The Undertaking
How did death move outside and defecation move inside?
House of Leaves
Not sure I finished ... or ever started it.
Dante's Commedia
The perfection of theft
Dylan's Chronicles
Dylan in New Orleans writing Man in the Long Black Coat
10) What does reading give you in your life that nothing else can?
Paper cuts and dry eyes.
11) Some people read, some people don't -- why do you think you became a reader?
12th grade English almost killed reading for me. No one should read Shakespeare with a list of words next to them, having to write down the page they appear.
12) What makes a book disappointing to you?
Trying too hard to change the world.
14) Does the Internet (Facebook, Twitter, Good Reads), book reviews (blogs, Amazon, and B&N), or any media buzz influence your desire to read a book? How or how not?
Um... yes?
15) Do you judge a book by it's cover?
Yes. Book choice is often a game time decision.
16) Do author blurbs, cover jackets, and award seals matter to you when choosing a book to read?
Not for hardbacks. Dust covers are promptly discarded.
17) Have you ever read a book that surprised you, one you didn't expect to like but did?
Slaughterhouse 5 ... didn't know it was a Sci-Fi novel.
19) Have there been books you didn't finish reading?
Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man, I think I got lost in the navel gazing.
Dante ... a superior thief.

Educating oneself about vehicle insurance is essential. It can help you to make the best selection, which can preserve you cash and offer peace of brain. Obtaining the info you require can occasionally come to feel confusing even though. In this write-up we will go over several important automobile insurance coverage phrases, and give suggestions that make clear what individuals phrases imply to you.
If you truly want to preserve a great deal of funds on vehicle insurance coverage, you can waive almost each kind of insurance policies accessible apart from for point out-mandated legal responsibility coverage. Legal responsibility coverage guards other drivers on the street far more than you, so this is needed for all drivers. But other kinds of coverage are not essential and you can conserve big income by leaving them off.
There are many approaches to save cash on your car insurance policies guidelines, and 1 of the greatest approaches is to take away drivers from the policy if they are no more time driving. A great deal of dad and mom mistakenly depart their children on their procedures right after they have long gone off to university or have moved out. Don't neglect to rework your coverage once you shed a driver.
A wonderful way for you to preserve money on your auto insurance policy is to locate an all-in-one particular insurance policies provider. If you can uncover a company to supply your car insurance coverage, homeowners' insurance policies, and health insurance policy, you can purchase a single massive package deal and conserve up to forty% off of purchasing independent insurance coverage offers.
When it arrives to conserving some critical money on your vehicle insurance policies, it will help immensely if you know and realize the kinds of protection obtainable to you. Consider your time to learn about all the various kinds of protection, and find out what your condition requires of you. There may be some huge cost savings in it for you.
Mothers and fathers seeking to maintain their family's car insurance policy payments to a bare minimum would do effectively to purchase a vehicle whose insurance coverage is cost-effective in basic. A late-product, much less glamorous auto will be significantly less high-priced to insure in standard, and will specially conserve funds when such as any teenage children you might want to incorporate on your coverage.
Sticking with the same insurance policy organization for many years may not be a very good factor. Perhaps they will decrease your insurance if your are a lifelong customer, but another business may possibly have an even better offer. Your circumstance as a driver will modify, and you may possibly even get a new vehicle: an insurance policy business that was also pricey ahead of may possibly become your greatest option later on.
A fantastic suggestion to use to help save cash on your automobile insurance policy is to pay for the coverage in total. By doing this, you can help save upwards of 30% on your auto protection. Paying thirty day period to thirty day period might be much more handy, but it can also be a great deal much more high-priced. Paying out in a lump sum is preferable if you have the means to do so.
Now you can revel in your new-discovered expertise about your present automobile insurance policy decisions. There is no reason to come to feel at all intimidated. You conquered the first impediment, which is generally educating by yourself. Hold all of these tips in mind, and you will have an simple route to automobile insurance policies comprehension.tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27501132.post6498882371891419686..comments2015-05-19T17:45:24.940-04:00Comments on Mayerson on Animation: UPA Feature ClipMark Mayerson that the voice of Bill "Bulwinkle" Scott as th...Was that the voice of Bill "Bulwinkle" Scott as the voice of the dog?Joe Gannon UPA sequences in "The Four Poster" add up to q...The UPA sequences in "The Four Poster" add up to quite a bit of footage.

Difference between java.util.Date and java.sql.Date in Java
Here are few differences on java.sql.Date and java.util.Date in Java in point format, if you any other difference between them which is worth noting then please post in comments :
1. As per Javadoc java.sql.Date is a thin wrapper around millisecond value which is used by JDBC to identify an SQL DATE type.
2. java.sql.Date just represent DATE without time information while java.util.Date represent both Date and Time information. This is the major differences why java.util.Date can not directly map to java.sql.Date.
3. In order to suppress time information and to confirm with definition of ANSI SQL DATE type, the millisecond values used in java.sql.Date instance must be "normalized by setting the hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds to zero in the timezone with with DATE instance is associated. In other words all time related information is removed from java.sql.Date class.
Why do you need java.sql.Date if there is already java.util.Date exits ?
By the way if you get this JDBC interview question right there are more interesting questions to comes as follow-up like :
What is difference between java.sql.Date, java.sql.Time and java.sql.Timestamp ?
How to convert java.sql.Date into java.util.Date and vice versa ?
Better to prepare for these questions as well , I will try to post answers of these JDBC questions in some other post.
That's all on difference between java.sql.Date and java.util.Date. In summary sql date represent only Date information (e.g. year, month, day) while util Date represent both date and time information. Other Java questions you may likeINHALTE

The Great Thanksgiving Depantsing [POLL]
The big day for feasting is coming. Next Thursday is the day to give thanks and stretch our waistlines. I love Thanksgiving; the food, friends, family, football and fun are such a wonderful gift. This year my parents are coming, as is my son and his girlfriend. It is going to be a great day. There are many traditions of Thanksgiving, but I think one of the most revered is the traditional unbuttoning of the pants after the meal. I cannot remember a year when pants stayed fastened for a whole Thursday’s celebration. How soon after the meal do the pants come undone? Do you do it at the table, on the couch or while you nap? This year I am thinking of just showing up to the table naked so there are no restrictions. How about you?can be the Queen of Hearts.

Cleaning Stains from Carpets
Your carpet should be vacuumed frequently and cleaned professionally every 6-12 months, depending on the amount of traffic it experiences. If you have something spill on your carpet and it is due for a professional clean, it is suggested that you leave removing the stain to the carpet cleaning professional as they will know the best method for removal, without damaging your carpet or its underlying base.
For a quick spot clean, however, you may try these quick and easy tips. Be warned, however, that some of these products can damage or alter the colour of your carpet, so it is important to know the limits of your carpet, test in an inconspicuous area first and, if in doubt, always call 1800 BLUEJET and leave it to the professionals.
The important thing to remember when it comes to carpet stains is:
• Don’t add liquid to liquid – dry the stain out thoroughly before attempting removal.
• Dab at the stain, never rub.
• Try and clean the stain from the outside in, to prevent it from spreading further.
• After cleaning, cover the area with a thick pad of white paper towels and weigh this down to help absorb all the moisture and dry out the carpet.
Cleaning chewing gum from carpet:
• Using ice cubes in a bag or an aerosol freezing agent to chill the gum, pick and scrape it away.
• Use a dry cleaning solvent on what remains.
• Rinse with 2 teaspoons of vinegar mixed with a litre of warm water.
Cleaning wax from carpet:
• Place a slightly damp, white cloth so that it covers the wax.
• Run a hot iron over the cloth, letting the heat melt the wax and the cloth absorb it.
• Repeat if necessary.
Cleaning nail polish from carpet:
• Find a clear nail polish remover that doesn’t contain lanolin.
• Test on a discrete/hidden patch of carpet to ensure carpet isn’t damaged by it.
• Dab at nail polish to remove it.
• Rinse with 2 teaspoons of vinegar mixed with a litre of warm water.
Cleaning blood from carpet:
• You should always use cold water initially when cleaning blood from any material.
• Follow with a mild detergent mixed in with warm water (1 teaspoon detergent to 1 litre water).
• Rinse with 2 teaspoons of vinegar mixed with a litre of warm water.
Cleaning lipstick from carpet:
While there are products available on the market for removing lipstick stains, a suggested home remedy is:
• If the lipstick has been crushed into the carpet, attempt to remove as much as possible first.
• Rub Vaseline into the lipstick, working from outside in to prevent spreading the mark.
• Remove the Vaseline-lipstick combination, scraping it away and repeat step two if necessary.
• Follow with a mild detergent mixed in with warm water (1 teaspoon detergent to 1 litre water).
• Rinse with 2 teaspoons of vinegar mixed with a litre of warm water.Mask Africa Limited

* Hitachi soars after brokerage upgrade
* Nisshinbo closes 26 pct higher on platinum-free fuel-cell catalysts
TOKYO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rose for a third day to a one-month high on Wednesday after Wall Street strengthened and the yen pulled back, helping buoy cyclicals such as exporters and banks.
The Nikkei ended up 0.5 percent at 19,865.82 points, its highest close since Aug. 8.
The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrials and Nasdaq Composite clocked record closes, with investors drawn to riskier assets as concerns over U.S.-North Korea tensions eased and the financial impact from Hurricane Irma appeared less severe than initially feared.
In Tokyo, brokerage and banking sectors outperformed.
Nomura Holdings jumped 2.4 percent and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group gained 1.5 percent.
With the dollar hitting an almost two-week high of 110.290 yen, exporters including makers of machinery, electronics products and automobiles attracted buying.
Pump manufacturer Ebara Corp rose 1.3 percent, agricultural equipment maker Kubota Corp added 1.7 percent, Panasonic Corp surged 4.5 percent and Nissan Motor Co rose 1.2 percent.
"The risk mood seems to have come back as U.S. markets were rallying," said Hikaru Sato, a senior technical analyst at Daiwa Securities.
Still, investors are cautious about the medium-term growth outlook for the United States, especially as they try to gauge Hurricane Harvey's impact on the economy.
"We need to watch upcoming U.S. economic data and its impact on the stock market," Sato said.
Hitachi Ltd jumped 3.3 pct to a level not seen since August 2015 after UBS Securities raised its rating on the stock to 'buy' from 'neutral', saying that losses related to overseas projects were less than the market had expected.
Elsewhere, Nisshinbo Holdings closed 26 percent higher to a level not seen since November 2015 after remaining untraded all day. The company said that it will roll out platinum-free fuel-cell catalysts, which has the potential to cut the high prices of fuel-cell cars.
The broader Topix rose 0.6 percent to 1,637.33 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 0.6 percent to 14,503.72.
(Editing by Shri Navaratnam; Editing by Kim Coghill)Taking fish oil in teens can help prevent schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia is usually diagnosed in the late teens or early 20s when the brain is nearing the end of its development. However, a recent study showed that teens at risk for schizophrenia who took fish oil were less likely to develop the disease compared to those who didn’t.
Research has also shown that people with schizophrenia have lower blood levels of fatty acids the brain needs, suggesting their brains are deficient in these essential fats. Giving fish oils to adults diagnosed with schizophrenia has not produced good results — it appears the key is to give fish oil to youth before it’s too late, thus changing the trajectory of the disease.
Fish oils and other healthy fats, such as oils from olives, nuts, seeds, and avocados, have been shown to dampen inflammation in the brain, protect neurons, and enhance neuronal function and communication. Fish oils are high in the omega 3 fatty acids EPA, which dampen inflammation, and DHA, which supports brain health and function.
The brain is made up of primarily fat, especially the cell membranes, which are vital for communication within the brain, so the fats you eat determine how well your brain performs. It’s best to go for healthy fats and avoid trans fats, or hydrogenated oils, as they have been shown to sabotage brain health and function.
Fish oil group fares better than placebo group
The study followed 81 young people between the ages of 13 and 25 who showed early signs of schizophrenia. About half were given fish oil supplements to take daily while the other half were given a placebo.
A year later, the group given fish oil were less likely to develop psychosis.
A follow-up seven years later of 71 of the participants showed that only 10 percent of the group given fish oil went on to develop schizophrenia, compared to 40 percent of the group given the placebo.
Researchers say the results are striking but the trial needs to be done again with a larger group of people.
Gluten: Another factor in schizophrenia
Shoring up brain health with fish oils and other essential fatty acids isn’t the only tool in the prevention toolbox. A gluten- and dairy-free diet may also help.
Gluten, the protein found in wheat, has been found to play a role in many cases of schizophrenia.
Quite a bit of research has found a higher rate of a sensitivity to gluten among schizophrenics than in the general population. Casein, the protein in dairy, has also been linked with schizophrenia.
In fact, some research has shown symptoms in early-onset schizophrenia improved on a gluten- and dairy-free diet. Adding gluten back to the diets of patients who improved significantly worsened symptoms..Dates: July 6-11, July 12-17, 2014

The 22-year-old made a fill-in start for the Red Sox in June, picking up a win in his big league debut against the Dodgers while allowing five runs (three earned) in five innings. He is 7-2 with a 2.45 ERA in the minors this year, including 3-2 with a 2.36 ERA this year for Triple-A Pawtucket. He pitched twice against the Tampa Bay Rays in spring training, recording five shutout innings against Tampa Bay.
‘I’ve been working my regular five-day routine,’ Doubront said. ‘I feel more confident now.’
After witnessing Doubront’s initial big league start, the Red Sox aren’t hesitant in putting the pitcher out against Tampa Bay Tuesday.
‘What we really like about him is his poise,’ Red Sox manager Terry Francona said the lefty, ‘along with he’s got a fastball he’s not afraid to use. Sometimes with young pitchers that’s a difficult thing to get across. Use your fastball regardless how good major league hitters are. You’ve got to use your fastball. He’s seemed to understand that from the first day of major league camp two years ago. He’s got a pretty good changeup. The breaking ball isn’t the finished product but he competes, hold runners ‘¦ I don’t think anybody is happy with Buchholz going on the DL, but on the flip side it’s kind of exciting to see how he does.’
– Clay Buchholz will be placed on the 15-day disabled list, with an eye of bringing him back into the starting rotation shortly after the All-Star break.
‘We just weren’t comfortable with the running part,’ Francona said of Buchholz, who is recovering from a left hamstring injury and was put through some drills at Tropicana Field Monday. ‘When he was trying to run he was still feeling it. There was no reason for us to rush into it so we just kept letting it go and see if he did get better. But there was no way we were going to let this kid pitch unless he was perfect.’
Francona notes that the Red Sox have mapped out three different scenarios for the starting rotation immediately after the All-Star break. Jon Lester, who may get the start for the American League team, will most likely be slotted toward the end of the rotation once the team comes back from the break.
John Lackey is the only Red Sox starting pitcher who has taken every start this season. ‘Lack’s stuff is getting better, which is a good sign,’ Francona said.
– Josh Beckett will head down to Sarasota Tuesday morning to make a rehab assignment start in a Gulf Coast League game. If weather presents a problem the pitcher will head back up to Tropicana Field with some of the GCL players to participate in a simulated game.
‘He looks pretty good,’ Francona said of Beckett, who is expected to throw in the vicinity of 55 pitches Tuesday. ‘The other day he was letting it go pretty good. The command is going to take a little while , but he was letting it go pretty good. You can tell he feels good.
‘When.’
Francona said that he has routinely put the likes of Darnell McDonald, Daniel Nava, and Eric Patterson in the Sox’ lineup’s No. 2 spot in large part to keep consistency throughout the rest of the batting order.
– The Red Sox manager noted how important the presence of David Ortiz, both on the field and in the clubhouse, has meant to the recent success of the team.
‘It’s huge, and I don’t think we’re really shy about saying that,’ Francona noted. ‘When you have a guy who is your everyday DH he’s got to hit. He has to be that presence, and he’s back to being that<<Giger made actual unidentified jests of the written alien before crafting the specific how far back does a criminal background check go in arkansas.

Add commentLast weekend we went to Denmark to look at a boat that seems interesting to us. It is a Hallberg Rassy 43 from 2005. We got the impression it had been sparsely used and was in good condition.
We had an 8 hour drive from our home through Germany and up to Denmark via the Puttgarden-Rödby ferry. We went straight to the boat, that was inside a hall well kept from nasty winter weather. Of course that is great to keep it inside. We went aboard and went through every little detail of the boat. As it was on land there were a lot of things we could not check. We got a good impression and after a couple of hours there we went to our Airbnb to have a nice home cooked dinner and to talk about what we had seen.

My dad went with us, and he helped us evaluating all the pros and cons on the boat.
It is in very good condition and looks very nice. It has been sailing in northern Europe in the summers. It is not very well equipped though, which is a pity, but it means we can also choose what we want and need for it to be as we like.

And the cockpit
So the next morning we went back there, this time with a surveyer that we had contacted before. He went through the boat in his way checking for any faults or issues we had not seen the day before. He did not find any severe things that needed immediate attention. We had a long list of things we need dto buy and add for it to be up to our standards, but even so we could come to an agreement on the price, sort of…
We are currently emailing back and forth about the agreement in detail, and hope we can settle this very soon. We are so excited and really hope this can be our boat.Welcome to the Spencer Collection

Bodies of two soldiers on the ground.Why is it that so many employees don’t understand the basic etiquette of calling in sick?
With flu season upon us, it’s invariable that people will get sick and have to take a day off. Lots of people have figured out that part of the process. The calling-in part? Not so much.
That’s why Ed Holton, Louisiana State University professor of human resources, leadership and organization development, recently ran this list of do’s and don’ts for calling in sick. Place them at whichever workstations you think appropriate.
Rules for calling in sick
- Do telephone the boss directly whenever possible, if that’s standard policy.
- Don’t use e-mail or rely on someone else to let the boss know.
- Do give a brief explanation of your illness. “I have flu symptoms” generally will suffice.
- Don’t go into too much detail. No one really needs to know, for instance, how many trips you made to the bathroom during the night.
- Do explain multi-day absences. If you’re out more than one day, call in each day if possible and explain, particularly if you’ve seen a doctor who diagnosed a contagious illness, such as strep.
- Don’t think that calling in one day will cover you for several days’ absences. Should the boss just assume that you’ll come in when you’re good and ready?
What rules would you add to this list? Do you have any good stories about employees’ misunderstandings about calling in sick? Let us know in the Comments Box below.
We had a nebraska employee call in sick from a ski resort in Wyoming. Thanks to Caller ID.
We had an employee on work release because of “work related back pain” report he had slipped on the ice and hurt his back while getting his mail, so wouldn’t be in that day.
We had an employee call from Omaha saying he would be a little late getting to Grand Island NE for work cause his car wouldn’t start. He said his was home in Grand Island. (Caller ID again).
We had an employee call from Jail Collect saying he couldn’t make it in cause he couldn’t find his keys.
Don’t tell your co-workers you’re going on a job interview tomorrow and then call in sick.
We had an employee call in because her husband was in the hospital with a possible heart attack. Later on that day, said husband showed up at our shop looking for his missing wife!!
It will be interesting to see where this law suit leads. It is not totally clear if the immigration law that Arizona has enacted goes against the preemption doctrine. One would think that immigration is exclusively under the jurisdiction of the federal government. However, I am unsure how the Arizona law goes against what Congress has legislated. Congress has indicated what the rules are for coming into the country legally, the Arizona law does not alter that. It would be better if Congress changed the rules for how a person can legally be present in the country. That is the real problem here. If the federal government does not like the Arizona laws, changing the immigration laws so that most of the illegal immigrants suddenly had a lawful presence in the country would make the Arizona law pointless. I think the reason that the racial profiling argument was not raised yet is because it is a lot easier to prove after it has occurred and can be clearly seen through statistics and evidence.1. I called Ron the Painter and he actually came to finish skimming and painting the ceiling...for nine months we have lived with holes in the ceiling where the old flourescent lights were taken out and the new pretty lights were put in!

2. I scheduled a "mommy morning" for myself and attended a presentation by Barbara Curtis on Montessori methods of teaching. I have even implemented two of her ideas for preschoolers! More here tomorrow when I post pictures!

I have never made cookies before, so this will be a learning experience and somewhat of an adventure. I am going to start with a simple recipe, what may be considered a standard, the Toll House recipe.
The recipe calls for brown sugar, and at the supermarket last night I saw a few types of brown sugar: dark brown, light brown, some just described as brown, etc. What does brown sugar bring to the recipe, and how do the different shades of brown sugar effect the result?
Also, all the recipes I've looked at call for "packed" brown sugar. How much do I pack it? The degree of packing would change the amount of brown sugar in the mixture, which would, I imagine, change the result. Are there some "packing" guidelines?
Is there a standard for the various brown sugars, or do different brands of dark have different amounts of molasses in them (it's molasses that makes the sugar brown, yes), so that one brand of dark may not be the same as another? And this, then, goes back to the question, "what does brown sugar bring to the recipe?"
Thanks!The Day 1 prompt for Inktober this year is “Swift”, and since it’s October, I figured I’d draw a flying bat. In retrospect, I probably could’ve drawn him diving or something, but this is how it came out. I don’t think it looks that bad, since I was honestly going for a little cartoony, but the direction of the speed lines just doesn’t seem right. Ah, well, it is what it is. I can compare this to next year’s and see what happens.
I am quite happy with the new Copic markers and the new white pencil in the new mid-tone sketchbook. It really adds a lot.
NOTE: Apparently, even though it’s 10/1 here, it’s still loading as 10/2, so I’m guessing the server calendar is set to GMT or something that’s ahead of me by at least an hour. Rest assured, I am not behind on this Inktober challenge.
…for the very few of you reading this…LOUDOUN COUNTY, VA (WUSA9) -
Some Loudoun County parents are offended by an advertisement that was put together by the local school system.
The Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) system created an ad to promote its mobile app last week. The ad asked in a headline, "Are you that mom?".
The ad went on to read: "The mom who is uncertain what the first day of school is but thinks it might be a Thursday. The mom who missed the PTA meeting. The mom who can't remember what time soccer practice ends... Don't let your yoga pants get tied in a knot this back-to-school season! Download the LCPS app and stay ahead of the game."
LCPS parent Huyen MacMichael said she couldn't believe the ad when she saw it. She found it to be misogynistic and sexist.
"I have a daughter and I have a son," she said. "And, I don't want them to get this message that women belong in the house, that women are flaky."
MacMichael added that she was also offended by the characters that were included in the ad. It had two tigers, one of which appeared to be a mom driving a car.
Loudoun (VA) Schools has pulled the video ad from online. A spokesperson: "We apologize to anyone who might have been offended." (@wusa9) pic.twitter.com/vVKx5fFbnz— John Henry (@JohnHenryWUSA) August 22, 2017
"There's a racial reference to Tiger Moms being Asian moms that push their kids a little too hard," she said.
There were two different versions of the ad. It was first posted as a video online and on Facebook Tuesday. A spokesperson with LCPS said a small print ad then appeared in the Loudoun County Public Schools Annual Report, which was published in the Loudoun Times-Mirror on Thursday.
LCPS said the video has since been pulled from online.
"We produced the video using broad satire, hoping people would not mind a little fun being poked at an outlandish depiction of the hectic lifestyle in our area," said LCPS Public Information Officer Wayde Byard. "We apologize to anyone who might have been offended."
The video cost the LCPS Public Information Office $152 to create. LCPS said it received about 22,000 views.

I read where someone had done this so I decided this would be a fun "first." It was not as easy as I had hoped. The first playground I went to was being cleaned up by some men who live in local government housing (read inmates). They were working hard and doing a good job. The problem was with them and a few families playing I could not figure out how to slyly hide money for people to find later. I decided to go to a different playground.
I went to a different playground and that worked better. There was this one boy playing so I walked around and hid a little money on a bench. He and his family left right after that. I guess I creeped them out or something. So, I went to the playground equipment and hid some money around it. I wanted to take pictures of that, but my phone quit working about that time. I'm sure my dropping it had nothing to do with that. It started working about 25 minutes later so the pictures are pretty lame today.
It would be fun to be there to see the children find the money. It's not a lot (2 or 3 dollars worth hidden around the equipment) but it usually does not take a lot of money to excite a small child. The joy of the surprise is often a pretty cool thing to watch. Two or three dollars is not that much for me but hopefully it will be fun for a child.
I thought about how many gifts God has left for us today. They are just grace. We did not deserve them and many times did not even ask for them. Yet, God gives them graciously. I think of a sweet kiss from my wife, the ability to walk, a friend's smile, a pretty bird in the front yard, a child's laugh, a hot shower, lotion, a car that runs, and the list could keep going. I can't build a car and I don't know how to make lotion. These are gifts to me. The Bible says that every good and perfect gift comes from above. I want to live constantly amazed by grace. I want to live stunned that God would lavish such gifts upon me. That is so much better than living complaining and griping about things that I don't have. It is a real joy to give thanks with a grateful heart.
Thanking God for the abundant life

other than that, i'm being lazy. i've been watching bad tv all morning, waiting for the tool to get back to town. this afternoon, i think the plans are that we see borat, and then see too much light makes the baby go blind. i've been intending to see borat for two weeks now, and finally we're seeing it. it should be hilarious...i'm excited. as for too much light...it's just been way too long since i've seen it. i think it was fall break, last year...i remember being on the train, on the way up to the theatre, the tool checking his phone every few seconds for score updates since it was the same night as game 1 of the world series last year, game 1 of the white sox triumph.
speaking of that, i don't think i ever commented on this year's world series on here. sure, it was kinda amusing being in st. louis this year when the cardinals won the series. the mass hysteria was pretty fun to watch. but, i couldn't really get into it like i did last year's series. even though i wasn't in chicago for most of the series last year, i care about the white sox. they're one of only four teams i care about: the orioles and the white sox i care about because i love them so much, and the yankees and the red sox i care about because i hate them with a blinding passion. i'm an american league fan...so, as long as it's not the yanks or the red sox representing the american league in the world series, i go for the american league team. so, i was pulling for the tigers. but, it was the kind of situation where i wasn't rooting for the tigers with every fibre of my being, and where i wouldn't be hopping mad if the cards won the series. i was disappointed, yes, but i didn't hang on every inning of the series like i did last year. it was a minor blip, a sociological curiosity...and not a sporting event for the ages.Data.

Hi Sheldon,
I'm wondering if you've ever looked at your TGIF page outside of your blog. The title of the page looks like this:
<font color="#CC9900">T</font><small>HE</small> <font color
This is because the heading, in the body of the page, is formatted this way. While it looks nice there, it looks like garbage in the page title, which is also what you see if in search engine results (try googling: "history lesson lost" sheldon richman).
Joe
Thanks, Joe. Yes I am aware of this problem. I'm having the FEE webmaster fix it.Chicago, IL – With so many choices, many of which appear to be top contenders in the area, it can be difficult for someone to locate the attorney who can best help their case.

Will Frank Finlay, 82, of Sedalia passed away Saturday, October 26, 2013 at his home. He was born on December 10, 1930 in Kansas City, KS a son of Dwight and Grace (Bowline) Finlay.
On March 23, 2007 in Sedalia, he was united in marriage to Shirley Morton Wilson, who survives of the home.
In Bill’s younger years, he loved to play softball and baseball. He was an avid St. Louis Cardinals fan and loved to watch the game. He also enjoyed playing golf and riding horses. Bill was part owner and operator of the Sedalia Neon Sign Company. He served his country honorably in the US Marine Corps, Korean War. He was a member of The American Legion Post 642 and The East Sedalia Baptist Church.
He is survived by two children, Cathy Harrison and Judy Boatman, both of Sedalia; one brother, Don Finlay of Lake Ozark, MO; two grandchildren, Mark Woolery and Missi Pierce; two great grandchildren and one on the way.
He was preceded in death by his parents.
Celebration of Life Service will be held at 7:00 pm, Tuesday, October 29, 2013 at Rea Funeral Chapel, Sedalia with Rev. Ed Broyles officiating.
The family will receive friends one hour prior to service.
In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions are suggested to Flat Creek Cemetery in care of the funeral chapel.For this card, I had a sheet of 12×12 cardstock that I thought would make a fun card. It would make sense as a half fold card, so I decided to take a different route and make it into a trifold card. I had a little mishap with the front when I tried to print something on it and I made the blue glitter square to cover it over. Then I added some bronze glitter ribbon to finish off the top edge and the edges of the blue. This covered the mistake and made the best of a problem situation. I think I still would add the bronze ribbon at the top even if I didn’t have to cover a mistake!
SaveFrom the Covered California home page,. Those outside California, see healthcare.gov, the national site.
When you start looking into it, the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) actually seems fairly straightforward and not that complicated. In a recent presentation sponsored by California Lawyers for the Arts, someone from the Actors Fund gave a clear summary of the program’s benefits and who is affected. The Actors Fund got a grant to help with patient education, and they, along with the Affordable Care Act itself, are available for telephone assistance.
In California, the Affordable Care Act is implemented as something called Covered California. (They neglected to reserve the coverecalifornia.com website, so its coveredCA.com.) Apparently, California is one of the most prepared states in the country for Obamacare. Also in California, acupuncture is covered by some of the plans.
Policies for nearly everyone across the country with individual insurance or Medicare will now have ten essential benefits included in their policies, including both outpatient and emergency services, free physicals, maternity and newborn care, MENTAL HEALTH and substance-use programs, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services and devices, preventive and wellness services, pediatric oral and vision, coverage of preexisting conditions, and certain preventive free tests and procedures. Self-insured and group/employer plans are not covered and many group/employer plans are allowed to grandfather in their benefits or lack thereof, as long as they don’t change the benefits. But no ACA plan can exist that doesn’t also exist in the private sector.
If you are 65 or older, you can’t be on an Affordable Care Act plan, you have to be on Medicare (or you can be on Medicaid/Medi-Cal if you make less than $15,414 a year). However, most Medicare recipients making less than $85,000 a year have already been eligible for reduced prescription costs as part of the plan. And those who have Part B of Medicare (the medical coverage beyond purely in-patient hospital coverage) also get the ten essential benefits.
And Medi-Cal is now available to anyone of any age based on income. (You used to have to have a child or one on the way.) Again, California has taken advantage of the Medicaid part of the Federal program. Some states have initially decided not to help their poor through this program. And some states are intentionally not educating their citizens about the program. But, again, California is making a strong effort in this area.
If your employer already offers insurance you have to take that, unless it amounts to more than 9.5% of your income, then you can take a Covered California plan, which lets you get assistance if you’re eligible (which many individuals and especially families are). Some companies, like Trader Joe, are discontinuing their employee coverage, thinking that employees will get a better deal on their own, since ACA premium assistance comes with income levels below $45,960 a year. In fact, the government’s assistance to help pay the insurance premiums can be quite high. You can go to CoveredCA.com and navigate to a calculator that will tell you how much assistance you will get, if any, and what plans are available to you.
There are four levels of insurance plans you can choose from—bronze, silver, gold, and platinum—the more precious the metal, the higher the percentage of medical expenses covered by the plan/the lower the co-pay, and also the higher the premiums are. But all plans have the free prevention items, like free yearly checkups, blood pressure checks, vaccinations, and even stop-smoking programs. Mental health coverage will be a major new benefit for many.
There are 13 insurance companies you can go with in California, and of those, six serve L.A. County. When you are comparing plans on the Covered California site, the current site shows only four companies in a row, so look to see if there are more to the right. (When I viewed it, dots below the boxes showed if there were more plans to look at, and seemed easy to miss. But the site may look different as they refine it. It’s all new!)
During the first year, the amount of assistance you can get with premium payments is determined by your 2012 taxes. But if your income changes at any point, you just tell Covered California and they adjust. The Actors Fund kept emphasizing that the program is very consumer-oriented.
The initial enrollment period this year is Oct. 1, 2013 – March 31, 2014. If you enroll before Dec. 15, coverage starts Jan 1, 2014. After this year, the yearly enrollment period will be Oct. 15-Dec. 7.
There is a single total penalty of $95 for the year or 1% of your income for not enrolling the first year, $325/2% the next year, and $695/2.5% per year beyond that. And adults under 30 (“the invincibles”) can choose a catastrophic plan if they want to.
For assistance, questions, and information, you can call Covered California at 800-300-1506, go into an office (soon), or go online. You can also call the Actors Fund Covered California helpline, at 855-491-3357. The Artists Health Insurance Resource Center, at Ahirc.org, gives information about provisions that directly impact artists and entertainers.
A representative at Covered California said they were interested in making the system better as they go, and he said they were open to feedback.
For your interest, there is a fascinating article, called “Testing, Testing,” that appeared in the Dec. 14, 2009, New Yorker, that compares health-care reform to the reform of the U.S. agriculture system at the start of the 20th century, a comparison the article’s author finds hopeful. As part of that hope, he peers into some of the pilot programs that were tucked into the bill. Newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/14/091214fa_fact_gawande

Brand called Domina Elegans is fairly new, but already quite well known and awarded natural beauty brand from Estonia. It has been created by doctors and scientists who believe that the best inspiration and ingredients come from nature. Their skincare philosophy is to give the skin all that it needs to be healthy and radiant, and to pamper it softly without synthetic preservatives and only the best components from the nature.
As you can see I have Domina Elegans 4D Universal Revitalising Face Cream from their Natural Beauty line. What makes this cream so special and to stand out from the others in the market is patented natural emulsion HYDRESIA® (safflower oleosomes), cold-pressed natural oils, silk protein and Dead Sea minerals that promise to regenerate and revitalise the cellular structure of the skin by promoting skin cell metabolism and collagen synthesis.
I have used this cream day and night for couple of months now and am absolutely in love with it. But this love relationship didn't come easy for me! When I first got it I fell in love with its refreshing yet natural scent, almost reminds me fresh cucumbers. The freshness totally came into play when I applied this cream for the first time, it was so calming, soothing and uplifting on my skin. Even though it feels amazingly full of nurturing ingredients, I felt that my drier areas needed more moisture and I was confused. I always found myself reapplying this cream on my drier areas and also wanted to reach for my other, much richer, moisturisers, but continued to use this one. Within few days I noticed I didn't get the drier areas anymore! My skin felt completely hydrated, balanced, calm and smooth.
During the time I noticed this cream makes a beautiful base for a makeup and can also be applied around the eyes. It takes care of the tired and dull skin immediately and also gives the instant relief to my allergies and puffiness around eyes, also due to allergies.
Overall I believe that everyone could benefit from this cream, hence the name 'Universal'. When your skin is oilier it really needs some nourishment and hydration to calm the oil production down and this face cream would be perfect one to do that! When your skin is drier, give this cream some time to adjust with your needs and you won't regret it.I'm working on a longer post, but in the meantime please to enjoy this NPR Morning Edition interview with Iraq war architect Douglas "I heart Ahmed Chalabi" Feith. In it, he postulates that if forces within the State Dept. and the CIA had not attempted to exclude Chalabi, a known fabricator of false intelligence on Iraqi WMD, from discussions on Iraq war planning, then we would not be stuck still occupying Iraq.
Hilarious. I mean, in a "pathetic attempt at revisionist history from a discredited neocon hack who's doomed to live out the remainder of his life in ignominy and bitter recrimination" kind of way.

Arrogant effing bullies, all of them. We can only hope that all the neocon assholes will "'live out the remainder of [their lives] in ignominy and bitter recrimination.'"

17.15 (close): Hopes of an imminent bailout for Spain sent global stock markets higher today as investors cheered the prospect of a more stable eurozone.
The FTSE 100 Index raced more than one per cent or 64.9 points higher to 5870.5, while Wall Street’s Dow Jones Industrial Average added around 120 points in early trade, buoyed also by more strong third quarter US company earnings.
There were sharp gains across Europe amid the eurozone optimism, with the Cac 40 in France up 2.4 per cent and Germany’s Dax 1.6 per cent higher.
Spain is understood to be ready to
apply for a credit line which would pave the way for the European
Central Bank to start buying bonds, easing concerns over the struggling
country and the wider eurozone crisis.
The speculation strengthened the euro, which left the pound down against the single currency at 1.23 euros.
But sterling held firm at 1.61 US dollars.
Banking stocks were boosted by the
improved mood, with better-than-expected third quarter figures from US
group Goldman Sachs adding to the gains.
Goldman said it swung to a profit
after revenues more than doubled, which overshadowed the shock news that
Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit was resigning with immediate
effect.
In London, Royal Bank of Scotland rose 11.9p to 280p and Barclays added 9.25p to 246.1p.
Lloyds Banking Group rose six per
cent to near the top of the FTSE 100 Index amid reports the Financial
Services Authority has given the green light to plans to bolster its
finances by swapping assets with its Scottish Widows life insurance arm.
Lloyds, which rose 2.4p to 42.8p,
would borrow around £1billion of liquid assets held by Scottish Widows
under the deal by using a larger pool of lower quality securities as
collateral in a bid to boost its cash position.
Mining stocks were also encouraged by
the momentum in the eurozone, which comes ahead of a summit in Brussels
on Thursday, as Evraz rose 14.5p to 243.7p and Polymetal International
added 34p to 1160p.
Deteriorating trends in Europe’s car industry dented engineering firm GKN after it reported “some softening” in order books.
Redditch-based GKN saw its shares
fall three per cent or 7.1p to 204.8p as it warned challenging
conditions in Europe had offset stronger demand in the US and China and
in its civil aerospace division.

pared earlier gains to stand 0.5p higher at 53.5p after the online gamer
said it would back an increased takeover offer from Britain’s biggest
bookmaker William Hill.
Sportingbet said it was minded to
recommend the 61.1p a share offer, which values the firm at more than
£400million, to its investors.
Meanwhile, housebuilder Bellway rose
three per cent in the second tier after it increased its final dividend
payment by 59 per cent to 14p per share following a 57 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to £105million in the year to July 31. Shares were 30p
higher at 980p.
This boosted rival firms, with
Persimmon up five per cent or 39.5p to 786p, Redrow ahead 2.9p to
158.9p, Taylor Wimpey advancing 1.8p to 58.8p and Bovis Homes adding
6.5p to 510.5p.

Back in London, the
FTSE 100 has surged along with other top European markets amid signs
Spain will overcome its scruples and request financial aid.
It’s up 59.3 points at 5,864.9 as the end of the session approaches. Read more here about Spain’s woes.
13.25:
London shares have gained ground as speculation mounts that Spain will soon request financial aid.
Spain is understood to be ready to apply for a credit line which would pave the way for the European Central Bank to start buying bonds, diluting the uncertainty around the struggling country and the wider eurozone crisis.
The FTSE 100 was up 59.4 points at 5,865 in lunchtime trading, and banks also got a boost from improved sentiment ahead of a eurozone summit in Brussels this Thursday.
Royal Bank of Scotland was up 5.7p at 273.7p, Barclays was ahead 2.5p at 239.5p, and Lloyds rose 1.8p to 42.7p.
Mining stocks were also encouraged by the momentum in the eurozone – Evraz rose 5.7p to 234.9p and Polymetal International added 26p to 1152p.
Ishaq Siddiqi of ETX Capital said: ‘Overnight, reports that Spain is considering a credit line demonstrated the country is finally making some progress on the financial support front, although we continue to assess the implications of such action.
‘EU policymakers have also expressed concern regarding Italy and what a credit line would mean for Italy – could we see pressure on borrowing costs or maybe even Italy requesting similar assistance.
‘What we do know is that any action will have to first be approved by EU leaders which we all know could take some time. We look for more details on the Spanish situation at this week’s EU summit which kicks off toward the end of the week.’
Deteriorating trends in Europe’s car industry dented engineering firm GKN after it reported ‘some softening’ in order books.
Redditch-based GKN saw its shares fall 3 per cent or 6.4p to 205.3p as it warned challenging conditions in Europe had offset stronger demand in the US and China and in its civil aerospace division.
10.55:
European markets are in the black as the U.S. corporate earnings season pans out better than expected and fears of a Greek debt default ease.
The FTSE 100 is ahead 26.2 points at 5,831.8, while on the continent Germany’s DAX is up 37.1 points at 7,298.4 and France’s CAC 40 is 11.3 points higher at 3,431.6.
David Madden, market analyst at IG, said: ‘The mood is positive in Europe today after Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras said he is confident that Greece will receive the next tranche of its bailout.
‘Greek borrowing costs have fallen as traders are less fearful of a default, and the trokia [European Commission, ECB and IMF] has recommended that Athens should be given a two-year extension to meet its budget-slashing targets.
‘The fear is that Greece will enter its sixth year of recession and the cycle will continue.’
He added: ‘Portugal witnessed protests yesterday after the government announced a new round of tax hikes and spending cuts that will probably keep the country in negative growth for a third year.
‘Rumours of a Spanish bailout are still doing the rounds. Madrid has made its opposition clear to receiving a bailout but it may be they are holding out for better terms, or that Spain will request a bailout after the regional elections in November.’
Stock futures point to a higher open on the Dow Jones, although pending inflation, manufacturing and industrial data could change the mood.
Fawad Razaqzada, market strategist at GFT Markets, said: ‘With Q3 earnings news continuing to broadly impress the market, traders will be keen to keep an eye on the detail and assuming we see further positive noises today – Coca Cola and IBM are two of the bigger names on the agenda – then perhaps there will be sufficient to push markets higher once again.’
Brent crude is trading at $114.16 a barrel and gold at $1,742.50 an ounce.
9.45:
Inflation fell to a near three-year low last month, although energy price hikes are soon expected to put household finances under pressure again.
The Office for National Statistics said CPI inflation dropped to 2.2 per cent in September, down from 2.5 per cent in August and the lowest level since November 2009.
The FTSE 100 has shed most of its early gains but remains 22.7 points ahead at 5,828.3 following a strong session on Wall Street. This was driven by positive U.S. retail sales figure and increased optimism over Spain’s future.
Spain is understood to be ready to apply for a credit line which would pave the way for the European Central Bank to start buying its government bonds, easing the uncertainty around the struggling country and the wider eurozone crisis.
Shares in Sportingbet surged 4 per cent on the London market today as the online gaming firm said it would back an increased takeover offer from Britain’s biggest bookmaker William Hill.
Sportingbet added 2.2p to 55.2p after it said it would recommend an expected 61.1p a share offer, which values the firm at more than £400million, to its investors. Read more here.
Lloyds Banking Group rose 2 per cent amid reports the Financial Services Authority has given the green light to its plan to bolster its finances by swapping assets with its Scottish Widows life insurance arm.
Lloyds, which rose 0.9p to 41.2p, would borrow around £1billion of liquid assets held by Scottish Widows under the deal, by using a larger pool of lower quality securities as collateral in a bid to boost its cash position.
Meanwhile, housebuilder Bellway leapt 6 per cent after it increased its final dividend payment by 59 per cent to 14p per share.
It posted a 57 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to £105million in the year to July 31. Its shares were 46.8p higher at 996.8p.
8.25:
The FTSE 100 has opened up 59.7 points at 5,836.4, tracking gains on Wall Street and in Asia following better than expected U.S. company results and economic data.
The mood has been buoyed by Citigroup’s forecast-beating earnings and by U.S. retail sales that sharply exceeded expectations. Read more here about CitiGroup’s results.
Investors are now awaiting earnings from corporate bellwethers such as Goldman Sachs, IBM and Intel, in the hope of further insights into the state of the global economy.
Greece is back in focus after leader Antonis Samaras said the debt-stricken country would conclude austerity talks with its lenders to continue receiving the bailout funds it needs. However, officials said the talks would most likely not be finished by Thursday’s EU summit.
The FTSE 100 closed 12.29 points higher at 5,805.61 yesterday, boosted by gains for heavyweight banks and hopes Spain is moving closer to asking for a bailout.
The latest consumer and wholesale price inflation numbers will be released later. A monthly increase of 0.4 per cent is forecast in CPI inflation for September, giving an annualised rate of 2.2 per cent, down from 2.5 percent in August.
PPI output prices for September are seen up 2.2 per cent year-on-year, unchanged from August’s rise, with PPI input prices seen falling 0.8 per cent year-on-year, after a 1.4 per cent gain in the previous month
Stocks to watch today include:
Rio Tinto: The world’s number two iron ore producer maintained its 2012 production guidance at 250million tonnes, saying its operations were performing strongly despite a volatile market caused by China’s uncertain economic outlook.
RBS: The bank will get the go-ahead this week from government and regulators to exit the state-backed insurance scheme covering its old ‘toxic assets’, in an early step towards reprivatisation, the Financial Times reported.
But plans to sell its American business have been derailed by a U.S. investigation into allegations it laundered money for rogue nations such as Iran, according to the Daily Mail.
BP: The oil major is the subject of persistent speculation, including market talk of a potential carve up of the company between french firm Total and UK peer Royal Dutch Shell, according to the Daily Mail market report.
GKN: The car and plane parts maker GKN said a sluggish European automotive market weighed on third quarter profit and that a continued slump could impact the group for the remainder of the year. It reported a largely flat pre-tax profit of £99million for the three months to the end of September.
Bumi: Financier Nat Rothschild has resigned from the board of the coal mining group he co-founded two years ago, attacking his partners and directors as they consider unravelling the Indonesian venture.
Carpetright: Britain’s biggest floor covering retailer, posted a small rise in underlying second quarter sales at its core UK business, as the rollout of store refurbishment and its laminate and bed ranges helped boost trading.
N Brown Group: The British home-shopping group posted a 4.5 per cent decline in first-half underlying profit with the wet summer depressing demand for ladies clothing, though the firm said its sales were on an improving trend.
Bellway: The house builder reported a 57 per cent jump in profits for the year, beating analyst expectations and prompting it to lift its dividend.
Petropavlovsk: The miner said third-quarter gold production was up 39 per cent from the previous quarter and the company is on track to achieve full year production target of at least 700,000 ounces of gold.
Informa: The business media group said its full-year expectations remain unchanged.
Sportingbet: The bookmaker William Hill and partner GVC Holdings have agreed the terms of a £530million takeover of the online gaming company, valuing Sportingbet shares at 61.1p each.
Smiths News: The group said its full-year underlying profit before tax rose to £47.5million, up from £38.6million a year earlier, with its medium term outlook remaining positive.
Spirit Pub Co: The pubs operator said its full-year profit before tax rose 16 per cent to £51million, and it is well placed to make further progress in the year ahead.

“The FTSE 100 was up 59.4 points at 5,865 in lunchtime trading, and banks also got a boost from improved sentiment ahead of a eurozone summit in Brussels this Thursday.”….no, that is just nonsense. There is always a difference in total purchases and total sales across the market and the share values which lead to slight rises and falls but it’s not much to do with anything in particular. Big problems cause big rises an falls but it would be better to use a five or ten day average to see trends.

This despite the report the other day that the US is on the edge of a fiscal cliff that will bring down the rest of the world and everyone is fearful that Spain will fail by having to ask for more help. Plus, the comment from that Lady in France saying the austerity measure may have actually been a bad move after all.

Reinvesting dividends has been just as poor a proformance as the shares themself over the last 10 years, within a month or so the share price is less than the reinvesting price, even buying on a Company Scheme has produced no gains just pain, today the share price is lower than the buy or reinvestment price, inflate then deflate, flatlined in my eyes. Hope you all have better luck with shares than we have over the years, even if you love shares as one does you may find out your life ends before they return a profit.

The release date is January 23 and yes I mean of this year of this month. Because of the short time between today and the 23rd and with today’s update bringing a whole bunch of bug fixes I shall not be reviewing any of the patches/updates that are coming along before 1.0, if there are anymore that is. Today’s update is mostly bug fixes (and I’d like to think they called this patch “Just Quietly” from there official post about it) and since I don’t want to start yet another play through with the game so close to launch I figure I’ll just wait for it to launch and review it then.
Until then, if you REALLY need to see what’s happening or if they release another update and REALLY need to know what it is, you can check there main page out.
Also a side note from my previous post about the last update, apparently I was “over optimistic” about being able to finally get the Neptune Escape Rocket as that is indeed in the game but not enabled. So for those who are trying to get there or almost there, be careful. Unless today’s update enabled it, all you’ll be doing is wasting resources to build nothing. So until launch, just hold out on seeing the ending of the game.
I’ll be sure to as quickly as possible write a review at launch. Until then, hang tight.Today we're joined for a guest blog from Mark Ramsey, founder & President of Mercury Radio Research (and an accomplished blogger in his own right):
The momentum (such as it is) behind HD Radio is driven in part by a magnificent lie: Listeners want more choice.
They may say they do.
But no, they don’t.
That’s why Satellite Radio listeners tune in only a handful of channels. And their most popular channels are the same as the biggest ones on Radio.
Thanks to our neurotic fear of Satellite and the rationalizing power of “choice” our industry is hurtling down a perilous and distracting HD road. “It’ll create more format choices,” industry leaders say.
These industry leaders need to study consumer behavior.
Just because we can thin-slice a format into skinnier niches doesn’t mean we should. One slice isn’t all anybody likes. That’s not “variety,” it’s “depth.” The thinner the slice, the less you appeal to the breadth of your audience’s taste. And the more you force them to self-program that variety by changing stations, the unhappier they will become. Listeners want variety, all right, but in as few stations as possible.
If you’re a typical radio listener (as opposed to a musicologist, audiophile, or musician), and you’re listening less to radio now it’s not because you can get more choices elsewhere. It’s because you can get your own perfect mix elsewhere. This is why most mp3 players are permanently set on “shuffle.” It’s why mp3 players – a personal selection of music – outsell Satellite Radio – a diverse but impersonal selection of music.
By assuming “more stations” is the answer to what ails Radio we are saying that Satellite has a formula tastier than ours. We forget why listeners come to us in the first place and why they’re so satisfied with what they hear.
Yes, that’s right. Satisfied with what they hear.
Not the college radio geek in a band, maybe. Not the aesthete who writes for Fortune and listens to NPR. But for Joe and Jane America, for the great “unwashed masses,” Radio is doing a pretty damn good job, and it’s about time someone stood up and said it.The Nokia Lumia 800 has to be one of the best looking and well thought-out Windows Phones on the market today. Everything from the shape and build quality to the Metro UI are designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Here we give you a rundown on those pesky data symbols and what they mean on your Nokia Lumia 800.
When you pick up your Nokia Lumia 800 and start to move around the Live Tiles it’s easy to overlook those odd symbols and little squiggles that appear along the top of the screen every now and then.
Top 100 free Nokia Lumia 800 Windows Phone apps
The thing is, once you understand what these data symbols mean, you’ll have a much better understanding of the kind of tasks you can and should be attempting with your Nokia Lumia 800, or whether you should just hold off until you get to that Cafe Wi-Fi hotspot.
For example, if you have an HD video clip lined up for streaming, you might want to check that your phone’s showing H rather than G. Here are all the data symbols explained.
Those are all the data symbols you’ll encounter on your Nokia Lumia phone here in the UK. Just remember that H is the best mobile network connection we can get right now, and to save those data-intensive tasks for that or a 3G signal.
While the above cover every day symbols you can expect to see, there are others that are a little less common, be no less likely to throw a curve ball should they pop up on your Nokia Lumia 800 when you’re out and about. weird and wonderful symbols you might find when using your Nokia Lumia 800.

Do you remember where you were 7 years ago today when the Twin Towers were attacked? I bet you do.
I was on my way to USF Tampa for classes. The report came over the radio as I pulled into the parking lot. Classes were cancelled, so I went to lunch with my friend Warren. We watched on the news as we waited for our meals. I remember thinking, “How could this happen to us?” When food arrived, I prayed. It was an extra-long prayer. When I looked up, Warren was still praying. To my knowledge, Warren wasn’t a Christian, but that day he needed to talk to God. I remember it vividly. Like it was yesterday.
On my way in to work today, I tried to recall other pieces of history. I remembered being in Mrs. Smith’s fourth grade class at Dundee Elementary when the Challenger exploded. And in Mr. Kennon’s ninth grade history class when we invaded Iraq.
Isn’t it funny how we have such vivid momories of the worst days in history? And the best days of our lives fly by.
I don’t remember much from my wedding. Once Ginny walked through those doors, the rest was a blur. I couldn’t tell you who attended. I know we did the Hokey Pokey. I have to defer to pictures for the rest. But that was one of the best days in my life.
Why is that? Bad days stick with us and good days fly past?

I remember the Challenger well – it was my senior year of High School. I watched it as I came back to class from lunch. First Iraq war I was in class in college. We watched it on TV during class. You are right, we let the good times slip by – I think it’s because we know (and hope) more good times are on the way, we always hope these bad things never happen again.

I remember I was at home getting ready to leave for work after a conference call on 9/11. I was walking out of the door and as I passed the tv I saw the second plane hit the other tower. It seemed so unreal. It still does. I left for work and remember pulling in to the parking lot in Zephyrhills and heard on the radio that a plane had hit the Pentagon. Seconds later I got sick in the parking lot after stepping out of my car.
I was outside watching the Challenger launch in my 8th grade science class at Westwood Jr High. I watched it explode and remember feeling so helpless. I remember my teacher crying.
I was in my Humanities class at PCC when we invaded Iraq. It was also my oldest sisters birthday.
I do remember bits and pieces of my wedding day. It all seemed to go by so fast. Like a blur. I am thankful for the video we have of it so I can see everything and have that memory.
It is strange how the bad memories seem to make more of an impression.

I was working for the state at the time and I got a call from Bobby and I remember telling him something must be wrong with the radars. Then I remember him say oh no another one… Not long after that he called my office back and by that time, I agreed to go pick up our daughter who was in 1st grade and stay together Just in case something was to happen here… We ended up going to another church members house and praying like crazy b/c their daughter in law worked in tower 2…. I get chills and a lump in my throat just thinking about it. As for the Shuttle, I was in 10th grade and we knew right away something bad had happened- the media was not quite as fast in those days… As for the 1st gulf war, I was at work and the guy I had been seeing at the time was there along with a good friend from childhood. I remember my customers from Canada telling me we have to leave right away we dont want to be in the states with this going on. I guess I would have felt the same way. We just have to focus that when bad things happen, God is still in control… He has a plan for us. Many things happened in my life following 9/11 that were to say the least uncomfortable, but God prevailed and made a way for us. So, due to both of us loosing jobs we became closer as husband and wife and our family was made stronger. I am not glad that these events took place, but I am so glad that God is in control!<<

The Facts About Income Tax
Millions faithfully file their 1040 forms each April. But some things about federal income taxes may surprise you.A Dare County Schools record of 64 students have earned recognition as AP Scholars for their exceptional achievement on AP exams in 2017. For successful performance on AP exams, students can earn college credit and/or opportunities to place in more advanced courses. In the College Board’s Advanced Placement (AP®) Program, AP course options provide motivated and academically-prepared high school students with the opportunity to take rigorous, college-level courses.
Twenty-three percent of the graduates in Dare County Schools earned credit for at least one college course through the AP curriculum in 2016-2017.
The College Board recognizes several levels of achievement based on student performance on AP exams. AP Scholars have completed three or more AP exams with scores of 3 or higher, AP Scholars with Honor earn an average grade of at least 3.25 on all AP exams taken and grades of 3 or higher on four or more of these exams; and AP Scholars with Distinction have earned an average grade of at least 3.5 on all AP exams taken and grades of 3 or higher on five or more of these exams.
All current seniors have the opportunity to take additional AP courses and potentially earn a higher-level award.
Thirty-six Dare students qualified as AP Scholars:
First Flight High School graduates Miller Cipriano, Anna De La Cruz, Devyn Dodson, Mack Doebler, Christian Eberhard, Ryan Gallaccio, Edward Gowan, Katherine Spore, Sarah Hayes, Ashley Jones, Samuel Kitchin, Jonathan Lawson, Raven Ruff, Hailey Schreyer, Mary Pat Thompson, Emma Turnage, and Jeffrey Wells with current seniors Jack Coleman, Ida Greenlee. Mast Lige, Beverly Murry, Alexandra Rodman, Arabella Saunders, Emma Strickland, Summer Tonnesen, and Elijah Whitfield; and Manteo High School graduates Hannah Anglin, Garrett Basnight, Kaleb Beach, Albert Hurley, Lindsay Simansky and Joshua Tolson.
Ten students qualified as AP Scholars with Honor:
First Flight High School’s Class of 2017 members Aaron Creef, Evan Fish, Joseph Sawin, Bryce Tholen with current seniors Logan Haas, Isabella House, Tyler Love, and Meghan Savona; and Manteo High School 2017 graduates Shelby Foster and Daniel Mitchum.
Eighteen students qualified as AP Scholars with Distinction:
First Flight High School 2017 graduates Sara Cook, James Gillis, Chandler Kelly, Lake Lige, Matthew McKenna, Dylan Owens. Mikayla Peterson, Luke Potter, Blaiz Rodman. Sarah Skinner, Elizabeth Tyson, Samuel Wills and current seniors Emma Bancroft, Crewe Douglas, Quinn Douglas; with Manteo High School graduates Aaron Crum, Joshua Pack, and Sydney Pearce.
Research shows that students who experience higher levels of rigor, such as AP offerings in high school typically demonstrate greater academic success and have higher college completion rates than students who do not. Over 90% of four-year colleges in the US provide credit and/or placement for qualifying exam grades.
Other options for Dare County Schools high school students to earn college credit while in high school include dual enrollment in community college, meeting standards in selected Career and Technical Education (CTE) high school courses prior to enrollment in a community college, and selected online coursework.
Chief Academic Officer Arty Tillett notes "For the district to have 64 AP Scholars speaks volumes about our students and our accomplished teachers. Dare County Schools continues to provide academic rigor in high school with AP course offerings and dual enrollment opportunities as part of our mission to prepare students for college and careers."Opinion: Policing shouldn’t be tested by trial and error
July 14, 2011
(c) kenjonbro
Katy Owen
There is a bill currently making its way through the House of Lords (albeit without a fight) titled ‘Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill’ which, among other things, aims to abolish police authorities and replace them with elected police commissioners. These commissioners would be selected based on proposed policing priorities for different areas which constables would then be expected to address and prioritise.
Home secretary Theresa May has argued that these changes would increase the connection between the public and the police and improve democracy while putting police decisions in the hands of local communities rather than Whitehall. So far, so populist. One imagines that this change is part of this government’s attempt to be associated with the positive notion of reform as well as the negative one of cuts.
So why care? Aside from the fact that the changes – according to Home Office figures – could cost up to £130 million in the first year, they could also be, in the words of the Welsh Assembly, ‘disastrous’ for policing outcomes in certain areas. Recognising that democracy is not perfect, especially when we have such low voting turnouts, means understanding that certain essential services – policing included – must not be politicised.
Imagine the following scenario: a particular town has a diverse range of communities with different policing needs. The richer areas have higher voter turnouts and therefore it is the candidate who panders most to their policing needs who is elected as commissioner for the entire area. The police force is then under pressure, or even obligation, to comply with those particular needs over any others thereby potentially hampering effective policing for the entire town.
Furthermore, police would be focused on short-term visible gains rather than tackling long-term crime problems in the same way that governments often are. The question they would ask themselves is: ‘How can we be seen to have made a difference in the key electorally important areas in the next five years?’ rather than ‘How can we tackle crime in the long term for the entire community using our expertise and knowledge of which areas are important?’
Sir Hugh Orde, of the Association of Chief Police Officers warned against Tory plans back in 2009, arguing that police independence is ‘absolutely critical’ and warning that certain fundamental policing issues which cross the country such as organised crime and serial rapists are at risk of being ignored because they are not local issues. The government has similarly been warned by New York’s former chief assistant district attorney, Jessica de Grazia, arguing that a similar scheme in the US bred corruption amongst policemen and did serious damage to their reputation.
These changes are completely untested in the UK and should not be implemented when such grave concerns are being expressed by those in the know. The police are not a service to be reformed through ‘trial and error’ when people’s lives could be in danger and serious damage to effective policing could be done.

The thinking is that advertisers will be able to better take action on insights when all conversions are shown in one place. They can use the information as they enable automated bidding to optimize.
"People turn to multiple devices throughout the day to shop, communicate and stay entertained," says AdWords Bidding senior product manager Wilfred Yeung. "From a laptop at work to a tablet in the living room, we move sequentially and seamlessly between many device types to get stuff done. In fact, nearly 40% of online shoppers start their research on a smartphone and make their final purchase on a computer or tablet. That’s why for several years, we've invested in cross-device conversions across Search, Display and Shopping. Advertisers around the world are now capturing the full value of their AdWords campaigns by using cross-device insights to measure up to 16% more conversions."
"We are committed to helping you gain insight into the new conversion types that are part of a constantly connected, multi-screen world so that you can make the best advertising decisions possible," says Yeung.
Advertisers can activate cross-device conversions in automated bidding by going to settings under Tools>Conversions and ensuring that the Conversion bid metric is set to "Conversions" as opposed to "Converted Clicks." Then click "include advanced conversions" and the check box to include cross-device and other advanced conversions.
Google has more information about how to factor cross-device conversions into automated bidding here.

10-31-13 “TURTLE” From Entourage On The Morning News With Dave Lee
Part of the new movie, LAST VEGASToday we had our first house session for 2013. It was so much fun!
At Selwyn House, we have five houses and twice a term it is the House Leaders' job to plan a twenty minute gathering to help the younger girls get to know the older girls and also to build community within the house group. It is always a highlight of the school week; we love spending time with other year groups within the school.
Today was our first time taking a House session. There were some surprises.
"It was lots of fun but hardest to motivate some of the Year 7s to play the games we had planned,"said Samantha.
"There were some challenging girls in my group but I think they had fun," said Izzy
"We thought we could improve on House sessions but it is much harder than it looks," Kate said.
"Learning how to gain and maintain the girls' attention at the YMCA was so helpful," Izzy said.
Here's Abby telling us about the Arawa house session.
AbbyLeadership from Bridget Compton-Moen on Vimeo.
It seems like houses are like mini family in the large selwyn house family with lots of fun, , supportand friendship. Awesome work girls.
That's true, Stefanie. Its a great way for everyone to make friends outside their own year group.

He was 75.
Sample was a student at Texas Southern University in the mid-1950s when he, saxophonist Wilton Felder, drummer Stix Hooper and trombonist Wayne Henderson formed the Jazz Crusaders. The band eventually dropped "Jazz" from their moniker, while introducing aspects of funk, rock and roll and rhythm and blues to their recordings.
"Unfortunately, in this country, there's a lot of prejudice against the various forms of music," Sample said to the."

By Robert Dixon
InsuranceNewsNet protection and wealth-management businesses.
Genworth is considering selling non-core businesses as it seeks to boost value for shareholders by divesting units that aren’t central to its strategy, Klein said in October, according to Bloomberg.
About the same time last fall, Reuters quoted anonymous sources as saying that Genworth was negotiating to sell a wealth management unit to with private equity firms Genstar Capital and Aquiline Capital Partners. A deal for the wealth management unit and the insurer’s alternative investments business could be worth $400 million to $450 million, Reuters said. Those businesses are part of a unit that reported a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.
In his added new role, Klein “will lead the related priorities of increasing International Protection’s and Wealth Management’s value and exploring options to realize that value,” Tom McInerney, Genworth chief executive officer, said in a statement.
In October, Genworth announced a realignment of its divisions. The company operates through three divisions: The U.S. Life Insurance Division comprises the U.S. life insurance unit, which includes life insurance, long-term care insurance and fixed annuities. The Global Mortgage Insurance Division business includes its international and U.S. mortgage insurance units. The Corporate and Other Division comprises the international protection segment, which includes the lifestyle protection insurance business, the wealth management segment and the runoff segment, which encompasses Genworth’s variable annuity, variable life insurance, institutional, corporate-owned life insurance and Medicare supplement insurance products.
Klein became Genworth's chief financial officer in 2011. He has nearly 30 years of experience working in financial services, according to the company statement.
Genworth Financial Inc. is a Fortune 500 insurance holding company with more that $10 billion in revenues in 2012.

Driving DirectionsIf you read my blog about Babci, I finish it with a few paragraphs from a narrative I wrote up from Babci several years ago. I lost the last few pages of it, but here's what I do have. She was the most pragmatic, practical and loving woman out there, and I hope that you see that in her words here...
I am from Poland, from a very small town. Its name is B. I was taken when I was twenty years old to Germany to work during the war. You see, when they took our country, there were not enough workers in Germany for the factories. So whomever had three kids, one went to Germany for six months. But that wasn't true. After six months, the war wasn't over. I guess they thought that the war would be quick. I worked for a little while in a soap factory, for oh, three or four months.
In the soap factory, there are many departments, and I did as many jobs as they needed. Some workers can switch easily, don't take a long time to get used to the new job, and that is what I did.
But then, my boss's maid had a baby. I went to work in his household as a maid. It was June of 1942 when I went to Germany. The war was over in 1945, but I couldn't go home because of the Russians.
There was no mail to Poland. I could not write my family. My family was very persecuted there. It is hard to understand or to put on paper. My father didn't want to submit to the Russian guidelines. They were not right. He believed everyone is free and can live free - just like we do here. But the communists, they have a different system. My father said no. If my father said OK, then the rest of the people would go, too. This is why he was treated so badly by the Russians.
My father was honored by the people: he helped whomever needed help, so the people supported him. He suffered a lot because of this; he gave in at the end.
All this was after the war, though. During the war, the Germans were there and life stayed the same. When the Russians conquered the Germans, they inflicted their rights.
After the war, I couldn't go home because of the Russians. So I became D.P., that's a displaced person. I didn't have anywhere to go, so a good friend took me in. Her name was AW. I knew her from working in the factory. Yes, she was German. I lived with her and her parents and sewed for people. They were very good to me, and I agreed to stay in Germany until it was free for me to get on a plane, or a bus, or a train to go home. But that never happened.
I had an uncle living in the United States, and he invited me to come stay with him. I really didn't want to go. You see, the first time you move to another country, you don't know what to expect, but the second time, you know the hardships you will have to face. And I already had a family in Germany.
But my uncle kept asking me, so I came for six months. I came from the Germany on a boat, the Stuart. That was an empty United States military boat. We didn't have to pay, just clean the boat. We were fourteen days on the sea. Lots of people was seasick the whole time. There were all kind of people on the boat, like me, displaced.
But they were a different kind of displacement. They had to leave the territory for various reasons. Some of them, the Germans have to take them out of their homes because of the war. It wasn't punishment, but they still lost their homes because of the war. Then the Russians came. Before going to the United States, they lived in, where is the military home? If you are drafted, you don't take an apartment, you go to training. Well, that is where the D.P.'s lived, there was lots of room there after the war.
But when I arrived here, I couldn't go back, because I didn't have the money. This was 1952, I was 30 years old. So I found a job at a dress factory. In 1953, I met, uh, Daddy - W. He came to visit my uncle: he is related to my aunt. He asked me to marry him and I agreed. We were married in 1953.
That was another hard decision to be made. He was a sick and he needed the work. But he could speak English. I could speak almost very little English then. I still wanted to go back, too. I couldn't go back to Poland, the Russians don't deal so merciful, they treat the people who come back like traitors. But the Lord showed me if I was to go back to Germany... well, here, I knew I will have many difficulties to overcome, but there are blessings here too. So I knew I had to stay.
We got a little apartment, and we bought a house, this house where we are now, in 1954. Our daughter A was born in 1954 and S came in 1955. Life went on. Going back home was something that I no longer hoped for. I learned more English, God gave me new friends, and a church, and I grew in loving him.
I am still a displaced person. I didn't take U.S. citizenship. People have told me it would be very easy, married to an American citizen. I just never applied for it, though. I don't regret it, I never needed to use it. I never traveled more than to Baltimore to visit S and her family. I feel like a U.S. citizen. And I still could have returned to Germany.
I'm not illegal, I'm married to a U.S. citizen. And I have the, what is it? The pink, no, the green card, l came to the U.S. because I needed a country. I have the privilege to live here. Nobody ever asked me for anything. No, no problem with social security either.
My friends from Germany passed away. One girl is still alive. I can't do the German anymore, I can't keep in touch with them anymore anyway. After a long time, you know, you lose the language. I tried to read it for a long time. A family I lived with here before I married was German, but they sold their house and moved to California ten years later. They were kind of like parents to me, their son is back in Germany. So I lost the German.
I never talked to my sister. We write, but we don't talk. Only my sister is now living. My brother have a three sons. My other sister has three children living in Russia. Just to feel you want to is too much trouble for the people. My daughters would be worried to make sure I get there, that I don't get lost. My desire would be very costly.
In Germany, almost everyone is gone. At home, too. The price would be much too big. Sometimes we have to put our desires behind to do what is right...

It's currently in a state of disrepair (see photo), Ago-at-the-end style, going through the motions for hotel guests. According to a source familiar with the project, the end will finally come when it closes for renovations in late September. As for what will replace it? At one time, the word was that it was being converted into a Maxim Prime, though that whole business seems to have been aborted, in New York and elsewhere. And then there was to be a more mild change, according to Gansevoort owner and meatpacking district menace Michael Achenbaum, who said that, "the new concept will incorporate many of Ono's best-selling items but will expand certain offerings, like sushi."
Now, with details emerging on the new club replacing the Garden of Ono — specifically, that it'll take over a large portion of the Ono restaurant — what's clear is that Ono is getting a dramatic overhaul and downsizing, probably name included. One rumor we've heard from a good source is that the Chodster is considering turning Ono into a Far East izakaya-style bar. Speakeasy-meets-meatpacking-meets-Chodorow. Now that there's construction afoot around him, expect the big man to announce his plans soon — although if it's a speakeasy, our suggestion is that he roll anti-Chod and open the whole thing without saying a word.

User blog
Project Natal theoretically seems like a nice and innovative way to play video games but in reality it's bound to completely fail.
Project Natal theoretically seems like a nice and innovative way to play video games but in reality it's bound to completely fail.
When we used to talk about the future of games in the early 90' we often said the words "virtual reality" but why? Because theoretically the machine will let us feel the game like it was real! But natal just let us use gestures and no other thing like a controller... The explanation is something like his example of the driving wheel on the blog. (trying to make long ass comment short, so think)
In fact I see more future in the Sony motion controller than in Natal because it is a proven technology. Proven by Nintendo.
I entirely agree with this blog. =)
Motion controllers suck, they are imprecise and annoying. Give me a well built game pad any day over this sudo-VR balderdash!
. "
....but it still upsets me to see someone judging Natal (or anything else for that matter) before they've experienced it. So we've seen a few videos of Natal in action. We've read plenty of inform regarding it as well, but considering the fact that its not even out yet, not to mention that you sir, nor I, have yet to experience it.
You made alot of good points though, I see where your coming from, just remember... until the day comes that we get to experience natal, possibly playing our own favorite game with it, we can do nothing but speculate. Even those who have tried it weren't using the finished product. The truth is, as far as I've "SEEN" at "THIS POINT" I won't even play with Natal. I can't say for sure though. I may like it.
Keep up the good blogs man.
Otherwise I like your blog.
MS obviously planned the current media blitz for the first reason you offer for Natal's possible failure, with Milo as the primary catalyst. Come the second, you can be sure they'll be ready to cover their tracks.
See what I did there?
Anyways, don't like it? Don't buy it. I'm holding my judgments until I get to see it in action myself.
In reality we may see that some games use a controller as normal and has natal as an option. bad example tbh but like with the socom games, you can command your squad using a mic but if you don't have a mic you can just select text commands from a menu.
But as well as obv not judging it so early, i'm amazed at the amount of people going on about how amazing it is. Again, how can you really judge it till you play it.
Personally for the majority of games, you need a controller. as 1 guy mentioned, racing where you hold thing air... i'd just find that weird and is subtracting from recreating a driving experience (that you can get by using a decent wheel, pedals etc
i think it will be a long time untill we see it used in a game i'd consider playing rather than a mini game
The eyetoy can sense depth but probably not all that well. I mean based on the stage tech demo it can easily sense depth direction and other things with a little halp. The pet game can as well a little. Even games that are out like Trials of Topoq can but not as well as you might hope... Still though in the end if PSeye is 30$ and natal turns out to be like 70 or more then it's kinda... Well you get the idea it's like compaing a porsche to a ford. The porsche may have more bells and whistles but they both can get you where your going...
EyeToy

-Microphone
Natal
-Senses 3D Movement
-Senses color
-Voice Recognition
-Integration with system interface
Anyone who thinks EyeToy is even close to Natal in quality so far is bonkers. EyeToy has so far had 21 games released exclusively for it, with 15 of those being "EyeToy: (insert name here)" games that all sucked.
thats my concern tbh. It may be a big leap from the eyetoy, but it's essentially the same thing. My biggest problem is seeing this as being used in a way that isn't simply trying to take some of nintendo's pie which would mean 'casual' games. I think ms even said themselves that was the target market for natal.
Well BAM!
I agree 100%. Even though I too think it's too early to judge natal, especially when MS hasn't given gamers a solid specific date for its release (or a price).
How will we be able to even make our video game character walk? Or even run and pull off Crazy ninja combos???
Anyone care to answere?
so how could it fail, if it's not released?

If you want to get in touch email is the best way to reach me.On a whim yesterday, I bought the Independent on Sunday rather than the Sunday Times and came across this article on page 3. One positive thing about the story - a Plaid Cymru MP makes page three of a non tabloid UK paper. The negative - it is a completely ridiculous and ignorant piece of journalism.
First of all Mr Matthew Bell, who wrote the article, could you please interview some actual Welsh people if you want to find out what we're thinking? The way you've gone about it is a bit like asking white people after a white person has made a racial slur against a black person if they think he or she was being racist!
Lembit Opik MP is not Welsh. He may have represented Montgomeryshire at one point, but he is most definitely not Welsh and not a natural spokesperson for us.
Chris Bryant the MP for Rhondda was brought up in Cardiff, Spain and Cheltenham. I would not say that his identity is one of a Welshman.
The reporter then goes on to say that Stephen Fry and Gyles Brandreth also support the criticisms. Both NOT Welsh.
However, he did find one genuinely Welsh person to support his view that we are being ridiculous to take race slurs so seriously: Carol Voderman. Her words of wisdom: "Shrug your shoulders and have a glass of something fizzy to celebrate that life is never dull". Oh dear...
And so it seems that the UK press, even the Independent, believe that racism towards the Welsh is one of the last acceptable forms of racism. Jonathan Edwards was completely right to complain about the article. It was sick and racist, and to be honest, the article that appeared yesterday was racist as well. Why should we allow people to slur us in this way? I hate the way that if we complain about our treatment by the UK press, we are always accused of being oversensitive, thin skinned and paranoid. If that's the case, then surely that's the advice that should be given to everyone who feels discriminated against? Luckily, that's not the case, and the police do take forms of discrimination seriously.
That's not to say that we shouldn't ever be able to laugh at ourselves. Everyone needs to have a sense of humour and accept that people will make fun of different attributes and characteristics of a nation. But there is a line, and when it is crossed, some attacks are racist rather than funny. And we are right to stand up for ourselves when such a line is crossed.

Absolutely. Most of the Welsh people I know, whether in real life, on Facebook or Twitter or blogs, were appauled by the comment and fully supportive of the MANY PEOPLE who reported it to the police on racism grounds.

The company's in-store digital engagement system uses proximity and iBeacon technology to alert retailers when one of their best online shoppers walks through the door of their store. A demo video with further information on Localz can be viewed here.
Localz will receive £100,000 investment from John Lewis, which will go towards supporting the company's relatively new UK operations. It will also be used to further develop the technology and initiate a live in-store trial with John Lewis.

Fittingly, No.7 in the countdown features the great Andrew Johns and his display in the 2003 series opener, the first Origin match to be played at the refurbished Suncorp Stadium.
A blow-up with long-time coach and confidant Phil Gould in the lead-up to the series dominated the headlines, but ‘Joey’ ultimately did his talking on the paddock.
His pinpoint passes produced a first-half double for fullback Anthony Minichiello, while he sent Craig Wing over with another magical pass after the break, kicked a field goal and sealed the match by hitting a hole off a Danny Buderus pass to score. Johns added four goals in the 25-12 victory.
Luke Bailey was a surprise man-of-the-match off the bench, while Johns claimed the gong by dominating the series-sealing 27-4 thrashing in game two. But in one of the toughest series-opening clashes in Origin history, Johns’ masterful ball-playing performance gets our vote.

Two-time "Melrose Place" diva Heather Locklear has been hospitalized with a bacterial infection, but according to People she's on antibiotics and "doing fine," her rep says.
Locklear recently returned from Canada, where she was filming the Lifetime TV movie "He Loves Me," a thriller costarring Max Martini, a regular on "The Unit" who also appeared recently on the new "Hawaii Five-O."
TMZ broke the news Wednesday morning. Locklear completed 30 days inpatient rehab in July after being suspected in a hit-and-run accident in April. That case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence, TMZ said.

The Colour Circle, until Mar 26.The year 2010 continued a shift toward consumer electronics (CE) devices with networking capabilities, allowing more devices to directly connect to the Internet or to a home network. In-Stat sees a continuation of the trend, forecasting growth in CE 802.11n-enabled devices. Annual unit shipments will increase from 53 million in 2010 to almost 300 million in 2015.
Portable CE devices such as digital still cameras, e-readers and handheld games are not the only CE devices benefiting from Wi-Fi. Stationary devices such as digital photo frames, digital televisions and gaming consoles are also seeing increasing Wi-Fi attach rates as consumers see the benefits of having Internet connectivity to stationary CE devices without the need for new wires.
“The migration to 802.11n is an impressive but interim step in the evolution of Wi-Fi. Users will see significantly greater speed and range than 802.11.b/g,” says Frank Dickson VP of Mobile Internet. “However, looming on the horizon is 802.11ac with speeds of around 1Gbps as the Wi-Fi ecosystem looks to address the movement of video in a serious way. The first shipments won’t hit the market until 2013 and its real impact will not be felt until 2015 and beyond.”
Research findings include:
– E-readers will reach a Wi-Fi attach rate of 85 per cent by 2013.
– Over 82 million, 802.11n-enabled tablets will ship in 2012.
– Mobile device with Wi-Fi will still dominate shipments. In 2013, shipments of mobile phones with embedded Wi-Fi are projected to exceed ≤ of a billion units.
– 29 million digital photo frames will be shipped in 2014; 53 per cent will be Wi-Fi-enabled.wiley wears:

Hiding in the guard’s office, I listened to the conversation of Yuzuki-sensei…
「…Shirasaka-san. I will be at the student council room after school so depend on me if anything happens. I’ll be there to talk to you」
The glasses student council president…Iwakura-senpai’s voice.
「…Iwakura-senpai, thank you very much」
Shirasaka-san’s crying voice…
「…Do your best. No matter how harsh it is, it’ll surely end. I guarantee it…okay?!」
「…Yes」
Senpai encourages Shirasaka-san.
「Yuzuki-sensei…please don’t be too cruel on Shirasaka-san…!」
Iwakura-senpai appeals to Sensei…
「…I wonder what should I do? In the end, it depends on the person herself…isn’t it the same on your time?」
I can’t see it from my position but I’m sure that Sensei’s laughing.
「Anyway, you can go back now Iwakura-san. Or could it be that you want to participate? You haven’t done sex for a while yet don’t you?」
「…I」
Iwakura-senpai’s voice is trembling…
She’s prostituted in the past so her fear of sex might come back…
「I, I will do my best! I’ll work hard so please…Senpai should go back!」
Shirasaka-san seems to have interrupted the two…
I see…Iwakura-san has a university student boyfriend right now so she doesn’t want to get involved.
But are you sure…Shirasaka-san?
Saying something like that in front of Yuzuki-sensei.
「Oh, you’re totally willing now aren’t you Shirasaka-san? How’s it, are you used to having sex already? It should be feeling good already, shouldn’t it?」
「I-It doesn’t feel good…!」
「…Then, you’re going to have sex until it feels good!」
…Look?
「I won’t get used on that way…I won’t!」
「Even if it’s forced sex, if it continues for long, it’ll feel good you know…women’s body has that kind of feeling…!」
「…That’s a lie!」
「At the beginning of Meiji era…do you know red light district? It’s a place where there’s a lot of brothel. There’s a scholar who asked the prostitutes about their change. Various data remained. Among them, there’s a prostitute who keeps company with a customer she hated saying 『No matter how much you hated it, you’ll soon reach climax after doing it a lot of times』 The body gets used to it…!」
Sensei laughs!
「…No…I don’t want that!」
「…Shirasaka-san, it’s okay. You’ll surely be fine…okay?!」
Iwakura-senpai’s voice was somehow able to calm down Shirasaka-san…
…However!
「…Iwakura Yukiyo! Go home already!」
Sensei ordered her!
「Yes! Iwakura Yukiyo will return!!!…Uuuu!」
「…Senpai!」
Past Iwakura-senpai accepts Sensei’s orders directly.
The current Iwakura-senpai tries to refuse Sensei’s orders by reflex.
There’s two selves fighting inside Senpai.
「Iwakura-san…you’re my 『Fourth Toy』 That will never change…Both your joy and pains will taste the same. Don’t forget it!!!」
I heard Sensei’s laughing voice again…
「…Goodbye, Shirasaka-san see you tomorrow…Endure it, do your best…!」
「…Yes. Iwakura-senpai, thank you for your guidance!!」
◇ ◇ ◇
…Before long, Shiraska-san and Sensei entered the Guard room.
Iwakura-senpai seems to have returned already.
When Shirasaka-san confirmed that I’m here, she sent me a glance of hatred and scorn…
I’m already hated from the bottom of her heart.
I thought once again…
We passed through the guard’s room and entered the closed space in the school, the 『Construction Area』
Of course, Yuzuki-sensei locks the door of the guard’s room tight…
It’s impossible to run away anymore.
Shriasak-san…and me.
「…This way!」
Sensei invited Shriasaka-san and me on a small building.
It’s a two stories ferroconcrete…It’s surely a Showa building. The concrete is completely dirty and discoloring green…
「You see, this was an annex of the old school building. It was a building added later for a special class」
「…S-Special class?」
「…In this high school before, there’re are students who graduated who wants to be employed. It’s a special teaching lesson for such children. Clothing room, cooking room, and technical room…there’s only special classrooms here」
…Eh, so there was such a class here before?
「Due to the declining birthrate, this high school has is centered for preparing them to get into university for ten years ago. That’s why such special classes has been stopped ahead」
…Haa, I see. So that’s what this building is.
But, why is the old main school building became an empty lot and only this annex remained…?
Sensei opened the lock to the back entrance of the building…
「Remember this…I’m the only one who have this key」
…We entered the building
It smells moldy…
There’s dusts collecting on the window…
The school building in the Showa era has a lower ceiling than the current school building…
There’re pipes showing itself on the ceiling…
Somehow, the atmosphere feels dark…
It’s already sunset outside the window.
Oh…It’s already that time.
「…This way. This room is convenient so this building remained without being destroyed」
Sensei stopped in that toom.
It’s written as『Night Duty Room』…
「During the Showa Era , there’s young teachers staying overnight and patrolling the school building…Isn’t it funny? But thanks to that this room is prepared for lodging environment so…it’s ideal for sex isn’t it?」
…Haa, is that so?
『Night Duty Room』, I can’t imagine what kind of room is that…
Honestly…I don’t want to look outside, but I can’t say that.
Sensei put her hand on the doorknob…
And opened the lock to the night duty room!
…The old wooden door opens with a creaking sound!
「Oh, I’ve been waiting for you!」
…Huh?
Katsuko-san in maid uniform is inside…?!!!
「Ojou-sama, I’ve done the preparations according to your order!」
The energetic Katsuko-san smiles pleasantly…
「Thanks…Katsuko」
Inside the night duty room…
The floor is made of wood…and there’s at least a 60cm tall tatami mat spread on the interior floor.
Oh, it feels like the Janitor’s room in the middle school.
It has an impression of a 4.5 mat Japanese style room on a 6 mat Western Style room…
The western room part has a gas stove and a sink. There’s an old refrigerator too.
However…It somehow brings out a strange feeling…!
The 4.5 mat area room…!!
What’s there is a futon spread out and two pillows…
There’s a small screen behind the pillow.
Somehow, it’s in lewd Ukiyoe1
Then there’s a small black tray with two bags of condom…
On the side of the room, there’s a big old fashioned dresser.
It’s cleaned perfectly but…could this be…?
「Ehehe, I made it to an image of Showa era brothel!」
‘Ehehe’…Katsuko-san?
「It’s the world of 『A Strange Tale from the East of the River』2」
“Bokuto kaidan”…What’s that?!
「Well done…You’ve overdone it in some places though」
Sensei seems to be satisfied with Katsuko’s work.
「…But, this isn’t needed」
Saying that, she picked and raised the condom on the tray…
She showed the bag of condom to Shirasaka-san…
「Shirasaka-san, do you know this…?」
Sensei laughs maliciously.
「…I don’t. What’s that?」
Shiraskaa-san answered with a displeased expression…
Shirasaka-san doesn’t know!
「Condom…A rubber tool to prevent pregnancy!」
Shriasaka-san is surprised…
「T-That, please let me use it!」
Shirasaka-san’s fingers tries to reach the condom in Yuzuki-sensei’s hand…!
「…Nope!」
Yuzuki-sensei raised her hand up quickly…!
Shirasaka-san’s hand won’t reach the hand of the tall Sensei.
「…A child like you doesn’t need condom!」
The devil smiled…
「Get your inside filled up a lot today!」
Shirasaka-san’s face distort in humiliation…!
Ignoring Shrasaka-san, Sensei went towards the door.
「Now then, I have some urgent business today. That’s why I don’t have time to watch your sex for today…!」
Sensei says while placing the bag of condom on her pocket.
Eh…Could it be that today’s sex is cancelled?!
「But your body just learned about sex so your body should be itching to do it several times all day long don’t you?」
…I am though.
Ah……Shirasaka-san’s angry again…
「It can’t be helped…Katsuko will be supervising your sex for today!」
「…Certainly!」
Uwaa…This was the plan from since the first anyway
Eh, but…Katsuko-san will be watching our sex in Sensei’s absence?!
「Katsuko…Shirasaka-san’s quota this time is five times」
「Okay, it’s fine as long as Shirasaka-sama makes Yoshida-sama ejaculate five times isn’t it?!」
「That’s right…Shirasaka-san, what time should you be going home?」
Suddenly, Sensei aksed Shirasaka-san.
「…What?」
「Your mother should be coming home today shouldn’t she? Your father’s still in a business trip though…A daughter of a good home like you should have a curfew, don’t you?」
「T-There’s nothing in particular…B-but at least I want to go home by Seven!」
Seven o’clock…that’s the end of the baseball club’s practice…
Endou would be calling her…
「…Seven o’clock is impossible!」
Sensei said it flatly.
「…It’s nearing five o’clock isn’t it? If you want to arrive home by seven o’clock, you need to leave here by half past six. It’s impossible to have sex five times with one and a half hour you know?」
…Amazing
The location of Shirasaka-san’s house and the way to commute is completely grasped!
「No matter how much you persevere, you’ll end at half past seven or eight o’clock. I’ll send you home by car if ever it gets too late. We’ll be properly deceiving your mother too…」
「…It’s fine. Don’t do that!」
「Oh my, I’m sociable so it’s fine. I won’t say anything to worry your mother…」
「I beg you…please don’t get my family involved here!」3
Shirasaka-san strongly repulses Sensei’s words.
Yuzuki-sensei snuffled her nose…
「Is that so?…Then hold out and do your best. Try to finish five times as early as possible, okay?」
Sensei’s sneering eyes is completely making fun of Shirasaka-san…
Those cold eyes once again checked the interior decoration Katsuko prepared…
「Shirasaka-san…this will be your room from now on」
「…What?」
「You need your own work room as an exclusive prostitute don’t you?!」
…Prostitution room!
…Shirasaka-san’s!!!
「…If I recall, Shriasaka-san’s hadn’t entered a club yet, don’t you?」
…Could this be?!
「I filed a new club establishment report by today’s date. Tomorrow, Iwakura-san will be pushing the stamp of authorization of the student council. Club head will be Shirasaka-san. The adviser will be me. And the member, Yoshida-kun for now」
Shriasaka-san shivers.
「…The club name will be 『Sex Club』!」
Shirasaka-san lost all the power in her body from the shock.
The sixteen year old girl weakly sits down on the floor…!
「I-I don’t want that!」
Shirasaka-san who’s pushed being the sex club’s head…cried, and protests!
「It can’t be helped…I’ve already delivered it!」
…W-What are the club activities?4
…B-but, If it’s a club, then other students can wish to join in too?!
Or rather, could it he that Sensei’s going to turn Shirasaka-san a prostitute in this school?!!!
「Geez…Yoshida-kun, don’t make that kind of face! Don’t worry…whatever happens 『Sex Club』is a 『Prostitution Club』. Katsuko…read the rules of the club」
Ordered by Sensei…Katsuko-san took out some paper out of the pocket of her apron…
「Well then, I will read out the rules of 『Sex Club』!!」
Ehem, Katsuko-san clears her throat…
「First, the activity of this club is to research and practice illicit sexual relations. Creating a smooth communication between members through sex!」
…W-what?!
「Second, the purpose of this club is to have the high school students get pregnant and give birth. Never practice birth control and experience pregnancy and childbirth while high school students as much as possible!」
Shriasaka-san’s body doesn’t stop from trembling from despair!
「Aren’t you glad?…You’re still a first year so you can get pregnant three times…!」
Sensei’s having a victorious smile!!
Shirasaka-san curled her own body strongly!
「Third, the members of this club cannot have sex with other people except the members! Applicant’s cannot join the club as long as the club adviser doesn’t give her permission!…That’s all!!!」
Katsuko-san finished reading…
「…With that said, no member will get in as long as I don’t allow them. I will go out picking the best for a while. That’s why…Yoshida-kun, have sex with Shriasaka-san intensely, okay!」
…Fuu.
…For the time being, it seems that she doesn’t intend to let it become indiscriminate group sex.
I feel a bit relieved.
「Oh right…Katsuko, I just remembered it, add this to the rules…」
「Roger!」
Katsuko-san took out her pen and prepared to take memo.
「Ready…Fourth, once you entered this club, you can never withdraw. You can never leave whatever reason it may be!」
Shirasaka-san trembles.
「Yup…I took it down」
Katsuko-san smiles laughingly.
Yuzuki-sensei’s ridicules.
Right now…what kind of face am I making?
「…It’s no use even if you two die. If ever you died while in high school『Sex Club』 will be on your school funeral…!」
…This person will seriously do it.
「Oh, I’ll also be leaving the photos of the club activities on your yearbook. You guys having sex as club activities and the resulting child…!」
「…No…no…Noooooooooooooooo!!!!」
Shirasaka-san screams…!!
It seems that she’s unable to endure it anymore…!
「Oh…this building is an off limits area so you can shout as much as you want!」
That’s right…this area in the school is partitioned with a high iron fence for construction, the gate of the campus is also a bit far. There’s only fee people walking around the east gate from the start…
「Oh right, I’ve made a member card for Yoshida-kun」
Saying that, Sensei took out a piece of card…
It looks like a stamp card from a shop.
My name and member number 001 are printed on the surface…
Opening inside…There’s fourteen 『Yukino』stamp pushed in it.
「Handling the card is Shirasaka-san’s duty as the head.. You have to fix a stamp on Yoshida-kun’s card on how many times you had sex…you hear?!」
You can push stamp on the card 100 times.
「Look at me, Shirasaka-san…I’m taking my time here to explain the stamp card!」
Shriasaka-san’s covering her face with both of her hands.
She’s thoroughly refusing Yuzuki-sensei…
「…What? Do you really hate being the head of 『Sex Club』?!」
Towards Yuzuki-sensei’s provocative words, Shriasaka-san muttered.
「…I hate it…isn’t it obvious that I hate it…?!」
Yuzuki-sensei’s mouth distorts to a devil smile!
「Is that so…If you hate it that much then it can’t be helped. Then, let’s do this. If you ever filled up the stamp in one week…At that time, Shirasaka-san, you’ll be freed. 『Sex Club』will be gone. I’ll be deleting all of the sex videos you have until now…and of course, It’ll help Endou-kun too…!!!」
「Eh?!」Shriasaka-san looked up at Sensei’s face…!
「Yesterday, I promised that Yoshida-kun will have one week didn’t I? Today’s April 27 so, it’ll end by May 4!」
…One week?
……The columns of the card has to be stamped until May 4?
「The stamp fields are 100 pieces…but fourteen are already stamped yesterday. With this pace…it’s easy to have sex 86 times for the remainder of the week, don’t you think?」
You say that Sensei but…
Last night, I drank some strange drug…
I ejaculated to the extent that I was surprised but I feel so much burden on my body.
Even with simple math, won’t it be more than ten times a day for the remainder?!!
…I-It’s impossible!
I-I’ll do it though.
「…What would you do? Will you throw away your chance of getting free? Are you giving up?」
Sensei’s stirring Shirasaka-san up with a foolish tone…
「…Got it」
「Is that so…go ahead and try it okay? Shirasaka-san」
「…Yes」
The orange ray of the dusk shine from the window…
The light shinign on Sensei’s face seems to be stained with color of blood…
The red teacher laughed once again.
「Then, Katsuko…I’ll leave the rest to you. Take recordings of the club activities. I’ll be watching later」
「Yes…Ojou-sama」
「Then, enjoy the club activities to your utmost!!! Ufufufufu!!」
Sensei went out of the room while laughing as she say that.
I can hear the cold steady footsteps from the corridor.
The footsteps gradually gets away…and finally gone.
◇ ◇ ◇
「Then, let’s start the club activities!!!」
After Sensei’s gone, Katsuko-san spoke first.
…T-Too bright.
Why is this person so bright all the time?!
Katsuko-san took out her favorite DSLR camera from the big leather travelling bag that’s on the wooden floor.
「I will be taking the photos properly so the two of you are free to do what you want! Go on!」
…Go on, she said.
…Hey, Shirasaka-san.
I looked at Shirasaka-san and she turned the other way…
Shirasaka-san’s harsh with me if Yuzuki-sensei’s not here…
Well, that’s obvious.
…W-What sould i do then?
「…Are you troubled Yoshida-sama?」
Katsuko -san holding the camera called me out.
「…W-W-W-W-Well, Y-Yes」
I don’t even know what to do or how to start…
「If you want, you can consult me!」
Yes, I’m thankful if you can guide me!
「Then, Yoshida-sama…what would be the theme of the Sexual Intercourse5 for today? Something like a situation you want to try」
Katsuko-san…what’s with ‘sexual intercourse’
It’s my first time seeing someone saying 『Sexual intercourse』
Katsuko-san’s so beautiful and sexy outside…and yet, she’s disapointing!
「If you don’t have any theme or situation in particular…I have a suggestion」
…Eh?! What?!
Rather, it’ll help me if you have a suggestion…!
I’m alone so I don’t know what to do with the angry Shirasaka-san!!6
「Let’s see…then since the dusk light is being beautiful. Let’s have Shirasaka-sama do a striptease act in this light…!」
Katsuko-san…You’re a genius!
I’m sorry I said you’re disappointing!!!
「S-Shirasaka-san…s-striptease…」
I ordered Shirasaka-san…
Shirasaka-san glared at me silently…
「Okay, Shirasaka-sama will be doing a striptease! Cast off all your clothes and become naked!!!!!!」
Ooh…people who don’t read the atmosphere are the best.
Katsuko-san…you’re so good!!!
「…Got it. There’s no choice but do it, right?」
Shirasaka-san muttered small…
「Then, Yoshida-sama, please take a seat in this place and appreciate it! Shirasaka-sama should go in front of the window…Yes, that’s the brightest so the rays hitting looks great. Then…please take off your clothes in sequence!」
The ray of the setting sun comes through the window.
In that light…Shriasaka-san’s taking off her jacket first…
…oooh!
「Nー, what a nice expression! That’s good! It looks good, Shirasaka-sama!!!」
Katsuko-san presses the shutter…
「…Next, which should go first, the blouse or the skirt?」
Katsuko-san asked me.
Err, since the blouse will remain to the last minute of the night…
「…B-Blouse!」
Shiraskaa-san’s trembling fingers unbuttons her blouse…
The white blouse shines orange from the evening glow…
Shirasaka-san’s face is nervous.
…Expression of embarrassment.
…Expression of hatred
All of it is being recorded by Katsuko-san…
…I see the bra.
…The cute navel.
When every button was taken off…
B-B-B-Bravo!!
Bravo, Shirasaka-san!!
「Okay, Shirasaka-sama please take off your blouse quickly」
Shirasaka-san takes off her blouse while being told by Katsuko-san
I can see the armpit!
Shirasaka-san’s arm is very thin…
「Please throw the blouse to Yoshida-sama!」
「…?!」
「Throw it! The striptease dancers will always do that! Please remember that!…Go!」
She’s becoming desperate?…Shirasaka-san threw the blouse she took off to me!
It spreads out in the air and the white blouse falls on top of me.
「Yoshida-sama, please smell it! Sniff it! More, like a middle aged man!」
While being told, I sniffed the scent of Shrirasaka-san’s blouse!
The smell of Shirasaka-san’s blouse…it smells like sweet milk.
Ah…Shirasaka-san’s who’s upper body is only covered with bra is glaring at me with a frightful look!
As expected, she hates it.
「Then, Shirasaka-sama…the skirt is the next one!」
Shirasaka-san’s fingers trembled again from Katsuko-san’s words.
She undo the fastener of the skirt…!
「…Just like that, drop the skirt to the floor!」
Shirasaka-san’s determined…But by the moment she released her hand from the skirt, she had an anguished expression like she scalded herself for a moment.
The light-blue silk panty that was handed to her in Sensei’s house this morning…I can see it!
「Good, good…I’m taking good pictures!! Please throw out the skirt to Yoshida-sama too!!」
The skirt flew off!!
I sniffed it…kunkunkun!
Shirasaka-san’s having such a hateful face…that’s good!
「Yoshida-sama…should we go with the strip stease rules next?」
…Striptease rules?
「…The bra goes first and panty goes last!」
…O-Oh right
「T-Then…let’s follow the rule…!」
「Following the rule, certainly, with pleasuree!…Shirasaka-sama the order will be Bra first and Panty last」
I-I don’t get it though…
Still, Shirasaka-san’s following Katsuko-san’s instructions…
Her trembling hands turn around to the hook of her bra…
Is this bra having a back hook…Is that so?
poron…Shirasaka-san’s beautiful breasts spill out!
P-P-P-Pink nipples too…!
Shirasaka-san’s having a unbearable expression!!!
Her cheeks are red in humiliation…!!
That appearance is also captured by Katsuko-san…
「…Yoshida-sama, is it difficult?」
Katsuko-san suddenly turned to me.
「…W-W-W-W-What is?」
I’m not having any difficulties at all…I’m totally enjoying this.
The one who’s having a hard time is Shirasaka-san who’s stripteasing.
「…I’m talking about your honorable penis!」
「…W-What!?!」
「Yoshida-sama’s honorable penis is intensely erect so I thought it’s painful to leave it like that…」
…Yes?
…Oh, Yeah
…Certainly, my erect penis seems about to explode.
Katsuko-san…please stop calling my penis 『Honorable』7
「How about you take off your pants and take out the penis from inside your brief?! I think you may rub your honorable penis while you’re you’re watching Shirasaka-sama striptease…」
…I-I lost.
…But.
「N-No…U-Uhm…」
「…Is it embarrassing?」
「…Y-Yes」
「It’s fine. Aren’t you aroused with Shirasaka-sama’s beautiful figure?! Your penis is erect with Shirasaka-sama as the sexual target. Please take it out confidently and show it to Shirasaka-sama!」
「B-But…K-Katsuko-san’s here too」
「…Me?」
Katsuko-san had a curious face.
「Please don’t mind me. I’m just a tree. Air. If you think of me as a fairy with a thin existence…!」
No…isn’t the fairy too strong in self0assertion?!
「Look…Shirasaka-sama, beg for it too! 『Please stroke your penis while watching me strip』…!!!」
Katsuko-san’s forcing Shirasaka-san on the absurdity!
However…Shirasaka-san is…
「…Please stroke your penis…while watching me strip…!」
…Shirasaka-san!!!
「I want to go home soon. End this faster…!」
I can feel anger from those words…
I slowly took off my pants.
I took off my brief showing off to her…and my erect penis exposed itself!!!
「…Now…Shirasaka-sama, please throw your bra to Yoshida-sama」
The silk bra was thrown as hard as possible!!
I grabbed it and sniffed it!
I stoke my penis while sniffing it…!
I purposely showed it to Shirasaka-san!!
「…Uwaa, It’s completely erect isn’t it! Shiraska-sama, right now, Yoshida-sama is doing the men’s masturbation. Please look at it…!」
Shirasaka-sann’s face froze as if she’s looking at something ugly and frightening!!
「…No, I don’t want thiiiis!!!」
Shirasaka-san tries to avert her eyes away from me…!
「Look at it! Shirasaka-sama!!! Open your eyes wide!!!」
…Shirasaka-san looked at me.
It must be her first time seeing a male’s masturbation scene…
How’s it…Is it ugly! Dirty? Are you feeling disgusted?!
「Then…let’s continue and take the last one off!」
Shirasaka-san’s trembling as she look at me!
「…Please take your panty off! Shiraskaa-sama!!!」
The trembling hands…reaches for her panty!
「Let’s do it faster…Take it off!!!」
When the panty was lowered…the cute pubic hair came out!!
「…Please take off the panty from your foot!!」
Shirasaka-san tries to follow Katsuko-san’s instructions…!
However, her body’s trembling that her foot gets entangled…!
Shiraskaa-san’s posture breaks and she fall down the tatami mat!!!
…Dangerous!!!
Katsuko-san moved immediately and pushed Shirasaka-san’s body from the bottom!
Shirasaka-san’s naked body lied down on the mat!!!
…!!!!!
On top of the tatami mat…Shirasaka-san fell down on the futon that was spread out…
The ray of the evening reaches the great body of Shirasaka-san…
The panty that was about to take off is caught in her right ankle…
The crotch is opened a bit…Shirasaka-san’s crack is…!!!
Lewd…what a very lewd appearance.
…Shirasaka-san!!!
…I can’t endure it anymore!!!
The me naked on the lower half face towards Shirasaka-san’s body!!!
「…You can’t, Yoshida-sama!!!」
For some reason, Katsuko-san stopped me…?!
「…Katsuko-san?!」
Shirasaka-san’s surprised…
「It’s no good to attack suddenly. Isn’t that just rape?!」
No, It’s rape though.
Or rather…it’s always been rape all this time.
「This is a club activity so doing it forcefully is no good. You both have to express gratitude at each other…」
…What?!
「…Could it be that Katsuko-san’s high school days」
「Yes, I’m from Kendo club!」
I-Is that so?
「Then, Shirasaka-sama…It seems that Yoshida-sama can’t endure it any longer so I think it’s time to advance to sexual intercourse soon…is it okay?」
…Is it okay, you ask?
Shirasaka-san answered Katsuko-san’s question this way.
「…Please wait a moment! I’ll be taking a medicine!!」
…Medicine?!
…The one Iwakura-senpai handed Shirasaka-san?!
「I’ll do anything after I drank the medicine…please!!」
Shirasaka-san’s eyes had tears accumulating in it…!!
Katsuko-san looked at me.
I nodded.
「Then…please hurry up!」
「O-Okay!」
The naked Shirasaka-san jumped out of the bed and searched her own bag…
Then she took out the pill case passed by Iwakura-senpai from the inside.
「Shirasaka-sama…have some mineral water!」
Katsuko-san took out a pet bottle and handed it to Shirasaka-san…!
「The electricity and water of this building has returned yesterday, however…the water that would come out now if you twist the faucet is from the tank on the rooftop that’s been collected for a long time, so…」
…It can be used in toilets but it’s impossible to drink?
Shirasaka-san swallowed the medicine and drank the water.
After she drank the medicine…She’s a bit relieved.
Shiraskaa-san…do you think that it’s a contraceptive?
But…I do know.
That drug doesn’t have an effect of preventing pregnancy…
「Then, Shirasaka-sama…please sit down at the corner of the futon」
Being told by Katsuko-san …The naked Shirasaka-san goes no top of the mat.
Ah…the silk panty’s still hanging on her ankle.
「Ah…Please take off that panty. The socks too」
Shirasaka-san takes off her panty and socks while having a red face.
Katsuko-san picked up the things she took off…
「Yoshida-sama…Want to smell it?」
「…I-I’m fine right now!」
My penis is already maximum erect!
I don’t have time for that !!
「Certainly…Then, at least wear the panties!」
「…Please wear it!」
I-I-I-I don’t get it but!!!
For the time being, I’ll just wear the panty Shirasaka-san took off on my head as I was told!!
「…Subarashii9! It’s Splendid!」
W-What is she praising for?
Ah…Shirasaka-san’s looking at me in blank surprise.
「Then, Shirasaka-sama, bow your head while pressing three fingers of each hand on the floor and face Yoshida-sama! Yoshida-sama please bow while still standing!」
On the mat…the side of the futon, the naked Shirasaka-san sat on her soles and faced me bowing her head and pressing three fingers of each hand on the floor.10
My penis is standing up while I’m still on my school uniform on the upper body, I bow my head while having Shirasaka-san’s panty on my head…
「Then…Best regards on the two of you!!」
Katsuko-san’s the judge!
「B-Best regards!」
「…Best regards!」
Looking up…my eyes met with Shirasaka-san…!
「…Fight!!!」
The soul gong rings!!
「…S-S-S-Shirasaka-san…lie down and face up the futon!!」
「…O-Okay」
The naked Shirasaka-san lied down the futon facing up, following my order.
「…O-Open your legs!」
「…O-Okay!!!」
Shirasaka-san opens her legs with an enduring face.
「More!…If you don’t open it wider, you can’t can’t have sex, Shirasaka-sama」
Katsuko-san who’s holding the camera, ordered her!
「Shirasaka-sama, that’s where you say『Please ravish me』!!」
Shirasaka-san’s closed her eyes.
「…Please ravish me!」
「…Say『Please fill up Shirasaka Yukino』!」
「…Please fill up…Shirasaka Yukino!!!」
That moment…I attacked Shirasaka-san’s’ body!!
While I’m still on my school uniform on the upper body…my lower body’s stark naked!!
I can’t endure it anymore!
I can’t endure!!
I licked Shirasaka-san’s breasts!
I bit her nipple!
I licked up her nape and made my tongue crawl on her cute ear!!!
Shirasaka-san is closing her eyes…she’s desperately enduring!!
I opened Shirasaka-san’s legs by force!!
I pushed in my about to explode penis in her vaginal opening!
「…Hiii!」
Shirasaka-san’s body shuddered from the fear of the insertion!
「…H-Here we gooooo!!!」
「Nooooooooo!!!!」
「Shirasaka-sama, you have to say 『Please put it in』!!」
「…Like hell I can say that!!!!」
Unlike last night, the aphrodisiac’s effect isn’t strong…
The drug she have drunk right now might not be fast acting.
Shirasaka-san’s body is trembling purely from the fear of rape…!
「Say it, Shirasaka-sama. 『Put it in, ravish me, enjoy it』You have to flatter him like a prostitute…if you don’t, this won’t end!!!」
Shirasaka-san’s heart is pierced by Katsuko-san’s; words!!
Her cute mouth has lewd words coming out!
「…Please put it in! Please enjoy violating me!!」
Murimuimuri, the angry penis penetrates Shirasaka-san in a dash!!
「…Iyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!」
Guchoguchogucho…I start the piston movement!
Sex on top of a futon is different from when doing it on the restraint stand…!!
The movement of my waist is handed down to Shirasaka-san directly!
Guigui, every time I pierce her, Shirasaka-san’s beautiful breasts shakes and draw a circle!
I’ll massage those breasts!!
Shirasaka-san’s inside gets wet bit by bit.
Deeper, Deeper, stronger, pierce, pierce, pierceeeeeee!!!
It feels good…Shirasaka-san’s body is so soft!
Her damp genital twines around my glans…!
「…I-I’m about to cum!!!!」
When I raised a merciless scream, Shirasaka-san…!
「…Hurry up and release iiit! Hurry up and cuum!!!」
That’s the line Iwakura-senpai taught her.
As expected of an honor student…she’s got a good memory.
…If so!!
「L-Let’s kiss, I-I want to r-release inside S-Shirasaka-san while k-kissing!!」
「…W-we can’t kiss! I hate kissing!!」
「…T-Then, I-I’m fine whatever you want!!」
「…L-Lick my tongue…I’ll allow you to lick my tongue!!」
Saying that, Shirasaka-san took out her pink tongue…!!!
I covet that tongue!!!
A man’s mucous membrane coming in contact with a woman’s mucous membrane, the pleasure is chilling!!
「…Nnnn!!!!!!!」
…Too late!!
I lick Shirasaka-san’s tongue!
Our tongues are twining!
Feeling disgust, Shirasaka-san presses me down forcibly and violently!!
Of course, I didn’t stop my piston!
Lastly, I sucked in Shirasaka-san’s tongue with all my might!!
My lip overlaps with Shirasaka-san’s lip!
…This is a kiss isn’t it?!
Furthermore, it’s a deep kiss!!
Shirasaka-san’s eyes open wide from shock…!!
…At that time!!!
…Byurururu, byurururu, dokun!!
I began my grand ejaculation inside Shirasaka-san’s womb…
Shirasaka-san’s look at me with trembling eyes. Her body’s trembling.
Her whole body’s accepting the ejaculation…
I continued sucking Shirasaka-san’s tongue until my ejaculation completely settles.
Our lips remained overlapping…!
When I released everything…I separate my lip from Shirasaka-san.
We’re still connected down there.
「…Cruel」
Shirasaka-san muttered…
Before I noticed, the sky’s grown dark…
The orange light doesn’t come to our room anymore.
I’m embracing Shirasaka-san in this very dim light…

Flotation feeds hopes for US while Europe suffers
Offering by baby food company ends an 82-day IPO drought
If one swallow does not make a summer, then it is unlikely that five initial public offerings would make an economic recovery. However, activity in the US IPO market has left some bankers daring to hope that the worst of the winter chill may be showing signs of ending.
Volatility in the equity markets and investors' risk aversion have made IPOs a difficult sell. But last week there were signs the market is beginning to wake up. On Tuesday, Mead Johnson Nutrition, a baby food company spun off by pharmaceutical company...

I hope that you had a lovely Easter ! And as we don't get it here - the snow sounds nice to an African like me, too ....
Not long ago you posted about huegelkulture. I had to plant 2 large old wheelbarrows with flowers and so I decided to use this method, instead of wasting all that good soil. I used gravel in the bottom and then filled up with twigs, branches and other garden debris, then I used the composted soil. I will report later on how it worked out.
For some reason winter Does Not Want to LEAVE!!!
I hope you get to feeling better soon.

But in a letter the banks have told the chancellor that he should reimburse them for the cost.
So far the Treasury has yet to respond to the banks.
The letter is signed by the British Bankers' Association, the Building Societies Association and the Payment Service APACS which is responsible for security of money transfers.
Refund
It warns the chancellor that they will refund their customers initially but, if there is widespread theft due to the blunder by the Revenue, the banks will look to the government for recompense.
Speaking on Radio 4's Money Box programme Sandra Quinn of APACS said: "Under the Banking Code we protect customers. And customers need to know that they have one point of contact if they're concerned and that is their bank or building society.
"But there is a separate issue about long-term liability. And if there is evidence that the loss of this data does lead to widespread fraud we will want to pick this up with the Chancellor and the Revenue. They won't be surprised by that."
Sandra Quinn also told the programme that APACS and the banks did not hear about the data loss until Friday 16 November, more than four weeks after the disc was sent and more than three weeks after a senior Revenue official became aware of the loss.
"We'd have liked to have known earlier because the earlier we knew the sooner we could take steps," she said.
No guarantee
And, despite assurances by the chancellor that all the 7.3 million bank accounts affected would be "flagged" so they could be monitored for "irregular activity", Sandra Quinn said that could not be guaranteed.
"Obviously this is a massive issue we can't guarantee that every account will be flagged. But there is no evidence that this data is in criminal hands."
She said every bank and building society had been told which of their accounts was affected and would sample accounts to monitor activity for any signs of fraud. But she added that individuals should also check their bank statements carefully themselves.
BBC Radio 4's Money Box was broadcast on Saturday, 24 November 2007 at 1204 GMT.

During summer, kids are on break from school and plan to enjoy every moment of freedom. However, this freedom increases the likelihood for accidents. Simple accidents such as getting hit with a ball, running into another child or accidentally being elbowed in the face can all result in a black eye.
Caused by blunt force trauma to the face, a black eye can be a source of discomfort and is a fairly common injury among children and teens. Normally, effects of a black eye are not permanent and may include symptoms such as bruising, swelling, slight pain and blurred vision following impact.
Typically, an individual will start to experience such symptoms within the first 24 hours. During this time, swelling and bruising around the eyes becomes noticeable and eventually forms what most individuals refer to as a “shiner.” Over the next several days, the swelling will decrease, bruising will begin to disappear and the black eye will fade.
Although most black eyes are considered harmless, some traumas can cause significant damage to vision and should not be ignored. Although an injury may seem minor, a black eye could be a potential indicator of a more serious problem.
Symptoms such as seeing flashes of light, dark shapes, having blurred or total loss of vision, or experiencing double vision and pain when exposed to bright light are all indi cators of a negative impact to one’s vision.
Common vision-related consequences of black-eyes include traumatic unveitis, a hyphema, glaucoma, an orbital floor fracture and a detached retina.
• Traumatic unveitis is a common side-effect caused by a black eye. Symptoms include reddened eyes, painful vision when exposed to light, an irregular shaped pupil, blurred vision and floating spots obstructing vision.
• A Hyphema occurs when blood accumulates in the anterior chamber of the eye, the area between the colored iris and the cornea, causing blurred vision and pain when exposed to bright light. Typically, a hyphema is miniscule in size and difficult to identify by an untrained eye, but large hyphemas can fill the eye with blood. If left untreated, a hyphema can cause permanent, partial or total vision loss.
• Glaucoma is an increased pressure within the eye that damages the optic nerve caused by an accumulation of blood. Signs can become evident immediately or not be present until several years following the trauma. Symptoms include eye pain, nausea, visual disturbance, blurred vision, reddened eye and a halo effect surrounding the eye.
• An Orbital Floor Fracture occurs when blunt force pushes the eyeball into the socket and fractures the bone surrounding the eye. This fracture pinches the muscles allowing eye movement as well as the optic nerve. Double vision and/or loss of vision are the main warning signs.
• A Detached retina: A detached retina occurs when trauma tears or pulls the retina away from the posterior lining of the eyeball and can result in permanent vision loss. Symptoms include seeing flashing lights, spotted vision, and complete or total vision loss.
Although a black eye can indicate a more serious vision-related injury, it is important to note that not all black eyes result in such consequences.
Following blunt trauma, be conscious of the symptoms being experienced and check for warning signs of a more serious problem. If symptoms persist, seek the expertise of an optometrist or doctor.

The clinic operates under the the umbrella of the University of Chicago’s law school and has been conducting a series of town hall meetings with the Street Vendors Association (more commonly known as AVA, Asociacion de Vendedores Ambulantes) to educate existing and potential street vendors about the ordinance and stir support for the legislation among the general public.
Working closely with the city’s Public Health Department, the Institute for Justice Clinic has crafted a proposal that takes the city’s priorities into account: safe, clean food that’s easy to inspect. The ordinance would only allow vendors to sell food that’s been prepared and packaged in a licensed kitchen — no cooking would be permitted at the operator’s home or on the cart — and maintained at a proper temperature.

Carnivore Magnet Set
If meat must be on their plate at every meal, their mouths will be watering once you present them with this carnivore magnet set. Uniquely made from recycled bottle caps, the set includes 6 clever designs.BEREA (92.3 The Fan) – The Cleveland Browns have a big enough media circus on their hands without adding to it.
The team declined an invitation to appear on HBO’s Hard Knocks in August – when they were approached by the league prior to the NFL Draft.
“I just really wanted to get through that first season’s training camp. This was a decision that was made long before the draft,” head coach Mike Pettine said. .”
In 2010, Pettine and the New York Jets were featured in season 6 of the series which chronicles the drama surrounding a team during training camp.
Because the Browns are in the first year under a new coaching staff (again), they are exempt from being required to appear on the show.
Receiver Andrew Hawkins, who remembers when the Bengals appeared on the show last year, is glad the Browns turned it down.
“I think that was a great decision,” Hawkins said. “It does get a little distracting. There’s just so much other stuff going on. Guys are in there worrying about football and learning plays and guys are trying to make the team. I think sometimes, even what I noticed in Cincinnati, a lot of the young would kind of play into the cameras, and they’re setting up stories and they’re too naïve to even see it and it’s taking away focus for them. So I think it was a great decision for coach to turn that down.”
Sheard Extension – Outside linebacker Jabaal Sheard is entering the final year of his 4-year, $5.09 million rookie contract and there have been some preliminary discussions about a long-term deal but they haven’t gone far.
“Hopefully it works out,” Sheard said. .”
Unfortunately since being drafted the Browns have gone 13-35 in his 3 NFL seasons and he’s hoping to stay around long enough to see the franchise turn it around.
“I can’t wait. I want to be here when this city erupts,” Sheard said. “I just know it’s coming. Hopefully this year is the year.”
Sheard, who was selected in the second round – No. 37 overall – of the 2011 NFL Draft, transitioned from defensive end to outside linebacker last season and started the 13 games he played. He figures to be a starter at the position again this season under Pettine.
“He’s been impressive,” Pettine said. “He was a guy that we liked coming out of Pitt. I was very encouraged from watching the film from last year. We talk about the ‘Play like a Brown’ attributes, and we want a guy that plays like his hair is on fire. If I had to pick on guy that fits that, the first name I would come up with is Jabaal.
“He’s versatile. I think we can move him around. He can play with his hand down. He can play up. His drop skills are more than adequate, and he plays violent.”
Burleson Back, Austin Held Back – Receiver Nate Burleson was back on the field catching passes Tuesday while fellow receiver Miles Austin watched from the sidelines.
Burleson, who had his cast removed last week, is returning from a procedure to correct a plate in his forearm that he received after breaking it last year during a car accident. He re-injured his forearm in April but has made a quick recovery.
Meanwhile Austin, who has battled hamstring injuries, is working his way onto the field slowly. He participated in individual drills last week and again on Tuesday.
Brownie Bet – Lose a bet, dress up as Brownie the Elf for a practice.
That’s what happened to one of the Browns area scouts who watched practice in the mascot costume which drew a few chuckles from the Browns front office and coaching staff.

Still Out – While cornerback Justin Gilbert was back on the practice field, fellow rookie guard Joel Bitonio remains sidelined with an ankle injury sustained last Tuesday. He will not participate in minicamp Pettine said.
Receiver Travis Benjamin, defensive lineman Billy Winn, running back Dion Lewis and linebacker Tank Carder were among the notable players that did not participate and rode the bikes Tuesday.
Of the injured players, Benjamin is the only player that Pettine said that he may not have on day 1 of camp that could start on PUP (physically unable to perform).

Vale Guy Walter
The New South Wales racing industry remains in shock following the sudden passing of highly respected trainer Guy Walter. The Warwick Farm trainer died of a suspected heart attack at his home yesterday morning. He was 59. One of the country's most successful trainers, the Mudgee-born Walter managed the careers of numerous Gr1 winners including Tie The Knot, Appearance, Spinning Hill, Defier, Republic Lass and Streama, who won last Saturday's Gr1 Doomben Cup in Brisbane. "Like everyone in the racing industry, we are shaken by the tragic news of Guy's passing," said Racing NSW Chief Executive, Mr Peter V'landys. "Guy was one of the most popular and humble trainers I have ever met. I guarantee you would not find one person with a bad word for Guy; he was a very genuine, kind and respectful person." Mr V'landy's added, "Guy achieved some amazing success during his career and he will be sadly missed." Walter trained 36 Gr1 winners and 132 stakes winners for total prize money of over $40 million, but will be best remembered for his association with the Tait family's champion galloper Tie The Knot. The son of Nassipour and Thousand Guineas winner Whisked won 13 Gr1 races during an outstanding career, including a remarkable four Chipping Nortons, two Sydney Cups and two Mercedes Classics (now known as The BMW).Muslim-Sex.Com - Info

Later it hit me that I've never seen either of them - or any other management person - ride a motorcycle to work. Is there a policy against that? Do you think that they have to drive cars to work so they can deliver packages?Buzzer Reaction
MVP: I’m going with Blake Griffin here after he nearly messed around and had a triple-double (34 points, 8 rebounds, 9 assists) in a team-high 41:56 minutes. Griffin also had only 2 turnovers and made the Clippers’ last 2 field goals of the game.
That was … a defensive 180: The Clippers were getting the brakes beaten off of them from the jump, with the Pistons making a season-high 5 threes in the 1st quarter and a season-high 54.3 percent mark from from the field in the 1st half. The Pistons led by as much as 17, and had a 72-59 lead with 6:25 left in the 3rd quarter. But then, the script was flipped. The Clippers turned it on defensively, holding the Pistons without a FG for almost 12.5 minutes of game time; Detroit made only 3 of their last 19 FGs (0/9 from 3), a span that covered the last 18:20. In that time, the Clippers outscored the Pistons 42-24, with Griffin (17 points) and Jamal Crawford (18 points) putting the offense on their backs.
X factor: I might be wrong for saying Crawford wasn’t the MVP, so let me give J-Crossover some props here. In his first start of the season, Crawford dropped 37 points (12/27 FGs, 3/7 3s, 10/10 FTs). His previous season-high was the 18 points he scored Thursday night in Phoenix. He didn’t score 30 all of last season. Crawford turned 35 in March; he’s the first Clippers player aged 35 or older to score 37 points in a game. Tonight was also the first time in Crawford’s career that he had 37 points, 6 rebounds and 8 assists on the same night.

Perseverance
Jamal Crawford has been bad.
Bad, bad.
And it’s been no small thing – through the playoffs Crawford shot under 25%
from three point land, and 36% total, despite playing over 27 minutes per game.
He probably hasn’t been this bad since his rookie season.
Yet, the Clippers obstinate coach, Doc Rivers, steadfastly continued to
give Crawford minutes in the face of his impending “washed-ness”, for lack
of a better term.
It paid off today, as Crawford had his best game in a long time, and led the
Clippers to a hard-fought crunchtime victory against the ornery, active Detroit Pistons. The pesky
3-ball which had refused to fall for him finally found the bottom of the net.
He was the high scorer of the game, with 37 points. This has to boost his
confidence and create momentum going forward, with sharpshooter JJ Redick
and lead guard Chris Paul “in limbo”, according to Rivers. Doc’s faith
in Jamal has finally returned dividends in a big way today, but it remains
to be seen if this is truly a return to form, or simply an outlier in a losing battle
against Father Time.

Iteration
An embarrassment of riches is only a good problem to have when there is an understanding of how the assets are best managed. Much of the early season has seemed to lack that understanding; when the Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of the team thus far comes while memories of last season’s bitter end are still relatively fresh, expectation and result emerge ever greater as the enemies of patience and perspective. It can be easy to forget this was just the 10th game of the season for these Clippers, and with the team bringing in 8 new players onto its roster, this season could be frustrating for the results-oriented as it may take months for the team to fully coalesce.
Perhaps it is promising then that today’s game showed one of the first signs of adjustment within the early season. There is familiarity between a unit consisting of Jamal Crawford and Blake Griffin, which proved highly beneficial in terms of maximizing Crawford’s usefulness on the team. Luc Richard Mbah A Moute may not be as talented a player as Lance Stephenson, but the understanding of the role he plays means there is less ebb and flow within what he can provide in the minutes he is given. In both cases, the adjustments made are about limiting variance within the team’s performance. In observing the steadiness of the team’s second half, let’s hope this is less a small sample size than a promise of consistency moving forward.
– Brandon TomyOne of the most powerful conjurations that King Solomon left us is the “Conjuration of the Seven.”
We resolved to personally investigate the entire esoteric content of the “Conjuration of the Seven.” We performed these investigations of High Theurgy within the Superior Worlds. We needed to have complete cognizance of the essential content of that prayer which Solomon the sage left us in ancient times.
Many magicians in the past, as well as in present, utilize these conjurations. However, in order to work consciously with them in the rituals of High Magic, we must understand the meaning of its content. This was the main motive for our in depth investigation of the esotericism of the “Conjuration of the Seven.”
Sequentially, here we give to our readers the explanation of the “Conjuration of the Seven.” Let us read it:
Conjuration of the Seven of Solomon the Sage
In the name of Michael, may Jehovah command thee and drive thee Iod-Chavah, begone Lilith! Let us rest in peace, Nahemah!
By the holy Elohim and by the names of the Genii Cashiel, Sehaltiel, Aphiel and Zarahiel, at the command of Orifiel, depart from us Moloch! We deny thee our children to devour!
By carefully examining the “Conjuration of the Seven,” our beloved readers can see the style in which it is written.
Indeed, the task we had ahead of us was pretty exhaustive, arduous, and difficult. Frankly, Spiritism (with its mediums) would have been useless to us, since we wanted to see, touch, and feel all the entities that are mentioned in the Conjuration of Solomon the sage! Likewise, for us Goeteia’s circle of pacts and black evocations would have also been useless, since none of us wanted to fall into the abyss of black magic. Therefore, only High Theurgy could help us resolve all of these problems.
Thus, we began by studying the first conjuration in the Superior Worlds, which literally states:
In the name of Michael, may Jehovah command thee and drive thee hence, Chavajoth!
Michael is the Genie of the Sun, and any advanced occultist knows this. Jehovah is the regent of the Moon; he governs Eden, and waits for all of us in Paradise.
Therefore, we only needed to know about Chavajoth. Who could this strange personage be? Why was it necessary to conjure him in the name of Jehovah? Why does Michael have to be named in this conjuration? What tenebrous entity could Chavajoth be? Undoubtedly, all of these enigmas disquieted us. Thus, we wanted to clarify this matter! We did not want to continue repeating (like robots) a conjuration whose content we ignored.
It was then that we decided to investigate.
We left our physical body at will. Thus, within our Astral Body we all walked along a solitary road. While we walked, we invoked Chavajoth, the mysterious personage mentioned by the great King Solomon. We must confess that we had to utilize the grand and supreme Appellation of “Peter of Apono.”
It is as follows:
HEMEN ETAN! HEMEN ETAN! HEMEN ETAN! EL, Ati, Titeip, Azia, Hin, Teu, MINOSEL, VAY, ACHADON, Vay, Vaa, EYE, Aaa, Eie, Exe, A EL EL EL A Hg! HAU! HAU! HAU! HAU! Va Va Va Va! Hg HAU HAU HAU! HAU! VA! VA! VA! VA! CHAVAJOTH!
Aie Saraye, aie Saraye, aie Saraye! Per Eloym Archima Raburs, Bathas Super ABRAC ruens superveniens ABEOR SUPER ABERER, CHAVAJOTH! CHAVAJOTH! Impero tibi per Clavem SALOMONIS et nomen Magnus SEMHAMPHORAS.
The outcome was astounding! At the side of the road we found a solemn, Olympic sculpture. It seemed to have been carved by Praxiteles! Its countenance was similar to that of the Greek Apollo. The curvature of its feet, the profile of its hands... the entire erythema of that sculpture could compete with the Venus de Milo! Nevertheless, there was something ominous about that very beautiful sculpture! This precious human effigy was dressed in a blood-colored robe which had beautiful, exotic, and fatal pleats, extending down to its feet! We then comprehended that we were before Jehovah’s opposite pole. We were before the frightening and terrible Chavajoth! Thus, by extending our right hand towards that malignant and seducing beauty, we conjured it with a loud voice saying:
In the name of the Tetragrammaton, I conjure thee, Chavajoth!
Immediately after pronouncing these words, with great surprise we saw the beautiful and malignant sculpture become terribly enraged with us. Then, he advanced towards us and attacked us with his horrible, hypnotic power. Thereafter, he exceedingly insulted us. His words were indeed revolting, proper only for the great harlot whose number is 666.
That encounter was terrible. We had to defend ourselves with all of our spiritual forces in order to drive away this terrible demon of malignant beauty! Thus, we finally succeeded and the frightening personage took the form of a harlot, and hid within a tavern where only alcoholic beverages were served at the bar.
Lo and behold black magic. Lo and behold the abyss!
After having met this personage of darkness, we returned into our physical bodies. By the color of his tunic, by his filthy language, and by all the activities of that sinister personage, we arrived at the conclusion that this was the exact antithesis of Lord Jehovah.
Now, we wanted to delve even further! We wanted to know the specific labors to which Chavajoth was dedicated.
Thus, on another night, we, the investigators, abandoned the physical body with the purpose of conversing more closely with the antithesis of Lord Jehovah. Again, we pronounced the grand Appellation of Peter of Apono. After a while, we arrived at a street in an unknown town. Multitudes of people came and went all around us. As we invoked, we could easily appreciate the power of the Word. The Word was transforming everything... We were moving from one dimension to another. We were submerging ourselves into those atomic regions, which the Princes of Darkness inhabited! By carefully observing, we noticed that someone was approaching us with a decided and firm step. It was Chavajoth! The sinister personage arrayed himself with his blood-colored robe; thus, like this he came towards us. We then conjured him as follows:
In the name of Jupiter, the Father of the Gods, I conjure thee, Chavajoth, TE VIGOS CO SLIM.
These mantras have a tremendous effect. Chavajoth, as if wounded by a mortal ray, raised his arm as if to defend himself. We advanced a few steps, came closer to him and stretched out our hand to him in a friendly gesture.
He then, in an ill-mannered tone and using expressions applicable only to prostitutes, asked us about our wives.
With serene temperaments (we did not want to be carried away by any emotional or sentimental reactions), we answered this personage and told him that our wives were quite well, thank you! Thereafter, we told him that we wanted to be his friends.
So, the sinister personage seemed satisfied. Thus, he walked with us towards his tenebrous cavern. We walked a lot until reaching the peak of a high mountain. There he has his tenebrous cavern, where he teaches his disciples. He confessed to us that he had a physical body and lived in Germany, that he worked for the grand Black Lodge and that he was impersonating a war veteran, etc.
Indeed, we found the cavern of Chavajoth crowded with German disciples. His disciples concurred in their Astral Body to the cavern. There Chavajoth taught them the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes. Such a tenebrous doctrine teaches a sinister system of Sexual Magic, during which the magician commits the crime of ejaculating the seminal liquor. The outcome of those exercises is always disastrous, because through them the fiery serpent of our magical powers, instead of rising, descends to the atomic infernos of the human being and is transformed into the tail of Satan. Chavajoth’s system of black Sexual Magic was practiced by the monstrous Lemurian-Atlanteans, as well as by the sorcerers of Atlantis.
The cult to the goddess Kali existed in the vanished ancient continent of Atlantis. Later on, after its submersion, the sect of this goddess was established in India. This is the sect of the stranglers. The fanatics of that sect strangled their victims. The English police had to intervene many times in India in order to judge those types of criminals... That is Black Tantra!
In our western world, there were many instructors who had been in the White Lodge and then went astray to the horrible path of Black Tantra.
For these reasons, we arrived at the conclusion that Chavajoth is an adept of the shadows, the antithesis of the Lord Jehovah. He is the head of a fatal legion! He works for the tenebrous fraternity. Chavajoth has to be conjured in the name of Jehovah!
Some days later, we, the investigators, in the Astral Body, decided to invoke this pair of opposites of philosophy: Jehovah and Chavajoth. We made a circle around ourselves...
The two invoked beings attended our call. The Lord Jehovah, like a dove of immaculate whiteness, hovered over our heads. Chavajoth, his antithesis, kept himself out of the circle. He was dejected! The presence of the Lord Jehovah wounded him to death…! Jehovah works for the Chastity of the world. The divine wisdom of Jehovah is enclosed within the “Arcanum A.Z.F.” This is the key to Eden! This is the key to the Ark of Science... Chavajoth works for Black Tantra, for the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which is the fatal science that transforms humans into beasts!.

Since I don't comment on Thesauros' blog anymore, I wanted to let you know over here that I agree with your comment regarding the anonymous commenter!
I think I should stop reading too though because I still feel like reading/writing too much and it's such a waste of time...
If you make it your goal to get a Christian to think, you'll get frustrated. If you make it your goal to frustrate a Christian... now that I can achieve.
Well said...
My issue is that I consider to have spent too much time focusing on religion online in the past... hum... probably like 3-4 years. It's time for me to move on.
Unfortunately, each time I tried to do that, I failed... it's worse than drugs I think because I find some purpose behind it, it made me change the way I see life as a whole.
Recently, a few things convinced me though. The first thing was my cousin with whom I had a 15-sec discussion on religion, I don't remember how it came to the subject but I asked him if he ever ran into annoying Christians when he was in London. He replied that he has never discussed religion with anyone... ever.
The other thing was stupid Rod (Thesauros) who will not correct any mistakes he makes, and keeps insulting me on a personal level without even knowing who I am. I think he does it on purpose because he likes to be insulted in return, "proving" that Christians are persecuted and it makes him feel good. I joked about that recently and he said that I sounded slightly insane and that my girlfriend would be right to leave me... That's so random! Obviously I don't care because we don't really know each other, but he did not say anything more, even when I pointed out that bashing my relationship with a girl I intend to marry is not cool at all!
Anyway, enough of this nonsense, there are other things that I could mention but it would go on forever and I don't even know why I am writing this here... Once again, I am wasting my time and this is exactly what I said I should stop doing altogether.
Take care Ginx!

See? there is a chronological series of events that tell a story when you order it like that. Now go get a new hand, Buster.
@Hugo; I stopped commenting on his blog a long time ago... he's inconvertible. I have better things to do online than argue with this man.
I never quit commenting. I consider it a victory when I get asked to stop or I'm banned outright, whichever comes first.
Oh, and yeah, I totally dropped the ball on this list. I was sort of out of it when I thought it was done this morning. My allergies make it hard for my eyes to focus right now. Expect typos and rushed posts until we get our first frost.Title

Abstract
Ocean acoustics has been a useful avenue for testing evolving theories for Wave Propagation in Random Media (WPRM). These theories generally assume that the index of refraction statistics are stable in space and time, an assumption proven reasonably true in the deep ocean for acoustic paths away from boundaries. In the present work, results from 60 years of theoretical and experimental WPRM research at the University of Washington's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) are reviewed. The first experiment was performed in 1959 to test theories for amplitude fluctuations based on the Born approximation. The Rytov approximation (from Russian literature) for calculating the log-amplitude fluctuations was also evaluated. Conclusion: neither applied. Experiments in 1971 and 1977 measured acoustic fluctuation statistics for an 18 km acoustic path at sonar-relevant frequencies, 2–13 kHz. A 1985 experiment under Arctic ice used 2–16 kHz signals over a 6 km path. These experiments are discussed together with theoretical issues based on the Moment Equation method to provide one viewpoint on the history of ocean acoustic WPRM. The following translation of Voltaire is appropriate: "The ancients when reasoning about physics without the enlightenment of experiments are like blind men explaining the nature of colors to other blind men."

As long as it is a personal loan ( not HP or secured on the vehicle) they can be included. However, the lender will then pursue the guarantor, who will have to pay the loan for you --- they can then become a creditor in their own right.

Some guarantor loan companies have different criteria to the usual banks and often reject if these criteria are not met. This rarely matters whether the loan is guaranteed by you or for you by someone else.Terrance Jones, executive director of the Canton Negro Oldtimers Activities Center, returned home re-energized after attending a party hosted by Oprah Winfrey in New York to salute Susan L. Taylor, editor-in-chief of Essence magazine, and nearly 400 community advocates.
"It was a defining moment of my life just to be in a room full of difference makers on an international level," said Jones, founder of the Black College Tour, which takes local minority high school kids to visit historically black colleges in the South. "It was life-changing, seriously."
The Dec. 2 event served as a fundraiser for the National CARES Mentoring Movement, which is dedicated to pairing vulnerable African-American children with a caring mentor.
Gospel stars Yolanda Adams and Donnie McClurkin performed. Other notable attendees were Common, Sean “Diddy” Combs, Terry McMillan and Ruby Dee.
Jones, former Canton Mayor Janet Creighton’s community liaison, said he didn’t get to meet Oprah, but he got a picture with Gayle King, Oprah’s best friend.
TRAVELING MAN
Eric Kramp gave up his cubicle in Tampa, Fla., in September and started traveling the United States. He came through Canton on Nov. 22.
“I gave up my cubicle prison (in the medical field) of four years to travel in a rental car across America for a few months to see many of our country’s landmarks, meet people, and lose weight while eating only from Wendy’s value menu,” he said. “I was going to go to Europe, but decided I needed to see my own back yard first.”
He started in Tampa, weighing 325 pounds. By Thanksgiving, he was down to 290, and that is without very much exercise.
“I’ve met a lot of people,” he said, noting that he’s always believed that everybody has a story, and he wanted to hear them. “America is a truly diverse and an amazing country. I wish I could have taken a busload of people with me on this trip. Unfortunately, that will probably never happen.”
“It’s been very exciting for me,” he said. “I have heard stories of cancer survival, wishes of similar adventures in their youth, and aspirations of losing weight too. From young people, elderly, and even a fifth-grade class in New Mexico. It seems as though everyone relates to my adventure in one form or another.
“I’ve already begun to work on my next bucket list (dream list) item, so we shall see how that goes. I’m hoping to go from 290 pounds to completing a marathon on my birthday in August.”

The following acceptable use policy for university and departmental computing resources was approved by the Department of Sociology faculty on April 9, 2004.
Network Activity
All computer network activity that takes place in the Sociology Department, whether from wired or wireless connections, occurs over network resources that are owned and operated by Duke University. Use of these resources is subject to a policy published by the Duke University IT Security Office and endorsed by the Information Security Steering Committee. This policy prohibits:
- The use of Duke network resources in violation of federal or state law, University policy or regulation, or Duke's contractual obligations to network service providers that connect Duke to the Internet.
- The use of Duke network resources to acquire data or resources to which the user has no right.
- The use of Duke network resources to intentionally harm individuals or interfere with the use of network or computing resources at Duke or elsewhere.
Duke University reserves the right to collect evidence of alleged violations of acceptable use and to revoke computing privileges of alleged violators, followed by timely notification of such action.
In keeping with the values of freedom of expression and diversity of opinion, it is not our desire or intent to exercise a censorship role over what is published or transferred over Duke networks. Users of Duke networks have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Network activities will be investigated by system administrators only as required by reports of illegal activity or to resolve technical problems.
Departmental Activity
The Department of Sociology is the owner and maintainer of additional computing resources that include servers for mail, web and file services and desktop PCs for use by specific individuals or groups of individuals. It is the intent of the Department that these resources be used in a manner that maintains a harmonious and secure computing environment for use by all Sociology faculty, staff and graduate students.
Computers are widely used in shared office settings, where some uses of computers can be objectionable to others. Use of discretion and restraint to minimize the discomfort or inconvenience your activities may cause others is expected.
Departmental computing resources are intended for professional use in carrying out the instructional, research and administrative missions of the department. In keeping with this principle, the following are not acceptable uses of departmental computing resources:
- Downloading of intellectual property, such as music or videos, in violation of copyright laws.
- Installation and use of proprietary software for which licensing fees have not been paid.
Departmental system administrators will exercise mechanisms of access control, software audits, quota restrictions and log analysis to ensure that usage is in compliance with departmental acceptable use and best practice security standards. Shared resources will be monitored to ensure that individual uses do not overwhelm network bandwidth, storage and printing capacities in ways that impair the ability of others to do their work.
In performance of these duties, departmental system administrators will respect the privacy of user home directories and mail holdings, in both on line storage and off line backup storage..
Grill Big or Go home….whenever I turn the grill on, I try to fill it up! When tenderloin goes on sale I have the grocery store slice it for me and cook as much as i can fit on the grill. I vacuum seal different size packets. Single piece packets are for my husband’s lunch, or my daughter’s dorm room. I use the same process for chicken breasts, too. (we discovered that a dorm refrigerator cranked down to the lowest setting is like a mini freezer. It at least will keep frozen things frozen.)
I’ve collected large crockpots from garage sales and the thrift store. I set them up on our covered patio so I can make multiple packs of shredded chicken, ground beef, pulled pork BBQ, and shredded pork. No muss, no fuss, and the house doesn’t even smell like I’ve been cooking meat all day. Knowing that I can easily attack large quantities meat with so little prep makes it easy for me to take advantage of clearance deals and unexpected sales. The vacuum sealer really extends freezer life…no more freezer burn.
Fast food at our house is just a few minutes in defrost and express cook. We save time, money and eat much healthier. Win-Win-Win!
Great work filling the freezer!
I have been using our extra CSA ingredients to fill up our freezer with meals. Here is how we did:
Sorry! Wrong link above. It should be this one:
Been playing around with how we want our oatmeal packets so should have those ready to go this weekend. 5 pounds of ground turkey cooked and ready to be put in meals today. Woke to 2 chickens in the crock pot–yuck but at least its done. But overcame the chicken smell with the two breakfast casseroles that I prepped last night and pulled from the oven this morning that will be frozen for quick breakfasts. Just having some meat prepped makes life a whole lot easier to make sure I cook.
I love your plan. I may have to refer to it the next time I do some planning ahead! I like to “fill” my freezer for the week’s meals. Kind of like Once a Week Cooking, only I prepare each of them so that I can cook them in the crockpot. Here’s my menu so far, if anyone would like some recipes on how to do that:
I am loving the container you have your flour in. I have been looking for something like that to buy larger quanities. Any clue where you got it??
I have a similar one I got at a resturant supply store. I’ve also seen them at larger cooking/houseware stores.
I bought those buckets at Smart and Final.
In my effort to eat from the pantry this month, I took two bell peppers and 1 lb ground turkey (and some other pantry items) and made 8 jars of pasta sauce! Eek! They definitely take up more room in the freezer than the turkey did, but they’re ready for future meals and easy spaghetti nights.
I’m also trying to make double batches of the meals I’m making, one for now and one for the freezer. Hopefully I’ll get through the pantry quicker, PLUS have a full freezer to boot!
The granola doesn’t last long around here either, and there aren’t 6 of us! I grilled extra chicken last night for the freezer. I have not tried this before, so I only did a little bit to see how we like it. I want to make some oatmeal packets, too, and some breakfast burritos. Your freezer cooking is an inspiration!
This is my plan for the weekend – get ready for Back to School with lunches, snacks and breakfasts ready to go – thanks for some great ideas!
Steak fingers, chicken strips and corn dog muffins are big school lunch items for us. I also make hams and chickens just for lunch meat and some diced up for adding to salads and what not. I also freeze rice in small portions the texture is different but my kids don’t mind. Still trying to figure out freezing macncheese and spaghetti. We are gluten free and so the pasta is rice pasta and the texture is different. Oh and freezing soup, chilli and stew is a big hit with my better half. Rather than do one huge freezer cook I find it works better for me to cook for my freezer one afternoon a week. I also cook for my pantry one day a week (granola for example) and lunch prep one day a week. (Repackaging chips cutting up carrots etc.)Thank You. Your Request for Information has been Sent

CHICAGO — Former president Bill Clinton lent his support and celebrity to a former top aide yesterday,, who also served as Clinton’s campaign finance director, as one of the key reasons he was elected president. Emanuel returned the praise, extolling Clinton’s accomplishments during two terms in office.
“I could not ask for a better role model than you,’’ Emanuel said to Clinton.
Clinton made the high-profile visit to Chicago to stump for Emanuel, one of six candidates in the Feb. 22 race to replace the retiring Mayor Richard Daley. Unless a candidate gets a majority of the voters, there will be an April runoff.
Clinton told the crowd that Emanuel is “fearlessly honest’’ and is not afraid push for change. Being Chicago mayor is a big job and he said Emanuel knows how to set good policy and make things happen.
“Rahm’s not even 6 feet tall. He probably weighs about 150 pounds dripping wet. But in all the ways it matters, he is a very big person,’’ Clinton said.
Three of Emanuel’s rivals, former US senator Carol Moseley Braun, former schools president Gery Chico, and City Clerk Miguel del Valle, have emphasized their deep city roots while saying Emanuel is more of a Washington insider. Moseley underline Emanuel’s importance.
“It probably represents a plus for Emanuel,’’ said Bennett, author of “Third City: Chicago and American Urbanism.’’
“It suggests, ‘I’ve got some leverage,’ ’’ he said.

North Dakota’s Conrad won’t return to Senate WASHINGTON — Senate Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad of North Dakota, a leading deficit hawk who would have faced a tough reelection fight, said yesterday he will not seek another term in 2012.
The decision will give Republicans a major opportunity to pick up another seat reelection. Democrats, who control the Senate with 53 votes to 47 for Republicans, will be defending 23 of the 33 seats up for a vote in 2012.
“There are serious challenges facing our state and nation,’’ Conrad said in a statement. “It is more important I spend my time and energy trying to solve these problems than to be distracted by a campaign for reelection.’’
In a sign of how competitive a race would have been, the Republican-leaning American Future Fund already has run radio ads opposing Conrad’s reelection. Last week, North Dakota public service commissioner Brian Kalk, a Republican, said he was considering challenging Conrad., who is sometimes teased by.

No second thoughts on Gulf War for elder Bush HOUSTON — President George H.W. Bush says he’s comfortable that the defining moment of his presidency was the Gulf War, which began 20 years ago this week.
In an interview yesterday, Bush also says he’s relieved the loss of American lives was minimal after critics warned “thousands of body bags’’ would be needed for casualties. And he doesn’t regret stopping the war with a vanquished Saddam Hussein retaining power in Iraq.
Bush says he doesn’t think he would have done anything differently.
While he acknowledges hoping Hussein would “do himself in in some way,’’ he says the mission was liberating Kuwait, not ousting the Iraqi leader.
Bush will commemorate the war tomorrow during a reunion of top administration officials at his presidential library at Texas A&M University.

Where do you go for some good Mac anti-malware/virus software? Preferably the free kind...
Just waiting for the
'But it only affects you if you click ok and put your password in and only an idiot will do that, it's so much better than windows'
While ignoring the fact that the majority of malware for Windows requires EXACTLY the same thing. Many users will see this and just think 'it's a codec to play the video, so I need to install it' and happily do just that - probably more so with the Mac crowd as an awful lot of them are so smug they think that OSX is invulnerable and malware will never affect their beloved OS. Windows users on the whole are a lot more sceptical these days and many (although not all) will do a quick search on google to see if something asking to be installed is legit or malware.
I knew that question would be asked one day! Running AV on a Mac suddenly isn't so stupid after all, is it?! (before somebody says "M$ fanB0y", I hate to disappoint, been a Mac user myself for years).
Paris, because she likes downloading random crap off the Internet.
Why should it be free? Do you really expect someone with talent to spend their time supplying you with free software or food, drink and place to crash for that matter. Why should they? Why should you expect them to?
Free, means "of little value" and that is generally what you get. All viruses are free. When did somebody last pay for one?
Just so you know, the "x"'s in the name "GxxxxBxxxxxx" are our way of hiding the real pseudonym he used.
Running AV on a Mac is still a waste of time and money. Not being an idiot is your best protection - software can't stop malware harming your computer if you give it your permission. The whole security circuit is just a scam, they make money by spreading fear.
I am most certainly not a freetard, what I meant was that I'd like something like AVG, that I use on my Windows boxes, free for a basic version, far more functionallity if you pay. I'm not talking about ripping off someones software.
Now if you want to talk about free and profiting from other's work, just take a look at the OS-X kernel...
and I mean malicious software programs - not virii or trojans etc.
I could provide a set of instruction (for the uninitiated) that would turn Disk Utility into malware.
Steve
Try this,
or I think Avast do a AV product for the MAC but is chargable
You're right of course, but on the other hand you have Mac users who are being told by the company that makes their hardware not to worry about virii, so why should they worry about common sense? They've never had to worry about downloading files from a site, especially a security site before, so why now?
Is the name GreetBritany?
"While ignoring the fact that the majority of malware for Windows requires EXACTLY the same thing."
XP doesn't require your password, Vista does, but the access controls are so annoying people turn them off.
Not to mention that if your installer was released and compiled with the Windows API prior to Vista then Vista determines what to do based on the filename!!! so if it's called Setup.exe it asks for a password, otherwise it doesn't!!!
Mac viruses are much less common for a few reasons, firstly who is going to buy a premium computer and then write software to destroy it? secondly it is a more secure OS without question. Security controls and permissions where there from day one of OSX. Windows has had to retrofit it and the behaviour of older applications doesn't fit with the new security model of Vista, so Microsoft has left gaping holes for backward compatibility purposes.
ok so:
1- Mac users, who have nothing to fear but fear itself, go to a site called Macvirus.org to keep an eye on Mac Virii - a concept about as solid as phlogiston.
I would imagine the site gets about five hits a year?
2- Same Mac users are pleasantly surprised to find distraction from their - utterly pointless - security concerns by a supposed erotic video thingy by a troubled chanteuse who has had her escapades plastered all over the net forever - it's not as if one has to try very hard to find this sort of material.
3- Happy to find such extraordinary and rare material up for grabs - on a security forum no less! - these people go to download and authorize an obviouly bogus codec for a video they were not even looking for.
4- These very same people who obviously must have /some interest in computer security in order to even consider visiting a forum with an obviously tediously topic as macvirus - these folks have not seen the news in the past ten years extolling the virtues of social engineering, the "I Love You" virus and countless "Anna K. in compromising positions" hoaxes and whatnot, and are happy to ignore the fact that they are their own biggest enemy whenever they decide to download dubious smut requiring one to authorise the installation of players/codecs/dialers/adware.
5- We are actually expected to care that there are some perverts on a roll to secure their system, who get it compromised through their own greasy fingered stupidity.
cue PhanBoj flame :P
A smiley because I can't stop smiling. This is just too funny.
Vista doesn't only use the filename for privilege escallation. It will alos ask you when it NEEDS to. The Setup.exe thing is a feature to save you going partway through an install before doing it.
"Vista does, but the access controls are so annoying people turn them off"
It's is more annoying on my Mac since it asks me for a password everytime, whereas on Vista it is just a boolean.
Macs are good, but don't be so blinkered to their flaws.
I'm pretty sure the plural of virus is viruses, and that virii is a made-up word. Possibly used in some previous comments in an attempt to sound more intelligent.
Fortunately I like the Mac for many other reasons besides the less frequent occurances of a virus and malware. One, it is easier to fix software components that go bad and not lose or have to reload alot of personal data. Two, it is much more user friendly for the computer stupid people while still being powerful for the opposite people. Three, I can now, if I actually CHOOSE to, dual boot my Mac to run Windows.
That being said, I have been using windows since version 3.1. I have not been impressed with Windows since W2K although I have been supporting XP since it came out. I also haven't supported Vista yet but after all the facts I read about it and Microsoft's blantantly obvious, laughable attempts to boost Vista's credibility, I'm not so eager to want to. Like the BOFH, I'm more inclined to run a Vista emulator by turning on all the flashy crap in XP, dumbing down my processor, removing half my memory and breaking Windows Media Player.
You shouldn't touch Vista with a barge pole, your two grand Mac won't run it then you'll complain about Vista being too slow.
Some idiot has a poorly managed forum that has been invaded by SPAM bots... That happens all the f@#king time, so why is this news?
How many times to we have to have this same argument Windows vs. Mac vs. Linux.
There is no perfect solution to the problem as long as you have mechanisms to make the use of a system easier. Easier on the surface == complex under the covers. It does not matter if it is the sudo model that is in OSX or Linux, the Role based securtiy model of Vista or the "lets just do it" model of XP running as administrator. The basic problem still exists in that you need to do something out-of-the-ordinary, and you either trust it, or ask some form of question.
In every case, unless the user is really on the ball, there is always the chance that something nasty could get through. The Unix model (different from popular Linux distro's) of putting the code in your own non-privileged space is about the only robust model there is, as you are very unlikely in a properly run system to import anything that will affect anyone other than yourself. That's not to say that a 'bot or a trojan will not get through, but other users of the system are unlikely to be compromised. I am deliberately ignoring the lack of binary compatibillity, which is not what I am arguing.
Of course, this means that everyone who wants to use a particular browser extension or version of Java will have to install it themselves, and it is possible for things to be run when you are not logged in (just put it in cron), but this is quite easy to spot.
So, lets just agree that it is a knotty problem, accept that different OSs do it differently, and leave it at that.
By your own admission you haven't touched Vista, yet feel qualified to bad-mouth it. If that isn't a bad case of 'I'm so anti-ms I can't be objective anymore' I don't know what is. In case you hadn't realised it, more and more people are coming forward with very positive experiences of Vista as demonstrated by the recent comments to the El Reg article 'Why I downgraded Vista to XP'
Once you get used to the fact that it works differently than XP, it's really quite good. Most of the negative things about it are coming from people like yourself, or those who tried it for 5 minutes and because it was different ran away crying
I've noticed this same attack against a very, very large number of forums--primarily those running phpBB and PHP-Nuke in the last four or five weeks. Planting bogus spamvertisements that redirect to malware sites into forums and guestbooks is nothing new, of course, but in the last few weeks, using security holes in badly-secured forum software to plant redirectors to Mac and Windows Trojan downloaders really seems to have skyrocketed.
Most likely, the attacks are automated; many of the redirectors placed in the forums have the same copy. In several cases, they redirect to the same fake codec downloader sites talked about in the Register article at
The attacks are becoming both increasingly frequent and increasingly sophisticated. In some cases, the redirectors look at a user's referrer and only forward to the virus-dropping sites if the user comes from certain domains (most commonly Google). In other cases, the payload site serves up a fake porn page and then redirects the user to either a Mac or a Windows Trojan download script based on the browser's user agent. Sometimes, the sites won't redirect to the payload dropper script if they're accessed repeatedly from the same IP address, presumably to throw off security researchers and/or ISP abuse teams.
I've seen payload sites that host these Trojans all over the place, but so far every one I've seen without exception is hosted on a domain registered by the same domain registrar--estdomains.com.
The Mac version of the Trojan is still quite rare, but I've seen a few systems that are infected. The Mac version is easy to remove without antivirus software. Mac users who wish to protect themselves with antivirus software can use the free ClamX AV, which has a fairly low footprint (for antivirus software) and does the job nicely. ClamWin on the PC is a free AV program that works as well.
I recommend that Mac users stay away from Norton Antivirus. I've had a large number of clients who've had very serious problems with it, including kernel panics, data-corruption issues, network file copy issues, and problems with poorly-constructed antivirus .dat updates which can falsely flag harmless files as "viruses."
See the AC post a little earlier: "But it only affects you if you click ok and put your password in and only an idiot will do that, it's so much better than windows". Congrats for being the first, dude. ;-)

Thomas JOHNSON, Individually, and on behalf of all others
similarly situated, Plaintiffs-Appellants,
v.
UNCLE BEN'S, INC., Defendant-Appellee.
No. 78-1437.
United States Court of Appeals,
Fifth Circuit.
Oct. 17, 1980.
Carol Nelkin, Houston, Tex., Randall L. Speck, Jerry D. Anker, Washington, D.C., for plaintiff-appellant.
Philip J. Pfeiffer, Houston, Tex., for defendant-appellee.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.
ON PETITION FOR REHEARING
Before VANCE and SAM D. JOHNSON, Circuit Judges, and THOMAS*, District Judge.
VANCE, Circuit Judge:
The motion for rehearing is granted. This panel's unpublished opinion of April 11, 1980, 615 F.2d 917 (5th Cir.), is vacated in its entirety.
I.
This appeal challenges the district court's disposition of a class action brought pursuant to section 1981, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. Suing on behalf of a class of black persons and Mexican-American persons who have been, are, or may be, employed by defendant Uncle Ben's, Inc., plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that Uncle Ben's had engaged in a variety of discriminatory employment practices. Specifically, they contended that Uncle Ben's discriminated against both groups in compensation, hiring, promotion, transfer, seniority and other terms and conditions of employment. The district court, however, held that plaintiffs had failed to present a prima facie case showing discriminatory treatment of Mexican-Americans and on all but one issue regarding blacks, and, therefore, it dismissed as to these issues at the conclusion of plaintiffs' case. On that one issue, the district court found that plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of discrimination against blacks in promotion, but ultimately ruled in favor of Uncle Ben's on this point as well.
II.
The district court adopted and applied an erroneous notion of the controlling legal principles regarding the use and role of statistics in an employment discrimination case. In discussing the promotion issue, the district court stated,
If we accept the Plaintiff's side of the case, all that the experts say, the way I see it, is that what has transpired in the real world at Uncle Ben's could not have statistically happened by chance. We are not here to enforce a law which says that things must occur within the limits of mathematical probability. The law says the defendant may not discriminate on the basis of race. The law does not say that the defendant shall not violate the rules of mathematical probability.
A business such as the Defendant's cannot be run successfully by chance. Decisions as to who may best serve in any given job must be made rationally by persons with sufficient knowledge of the individuals and jobs involved to make such decisions.
(Emphasis added.) This standard is incorrect.
Statistics as to racial composition of the defendant's work force serve an important role in judging employment discrimination cases. International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 339, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1856, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977); Fisher v. Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Co., 613 F.2d 527, 543-44 (5th Cir. 1980). ). See also Fisher v. Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Co., 613 F.2d at 544; Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d 211, 225 & n.34 (5th Cir. 1974). The class plaintiffs do not need to prove knowing and intentional discrimination to prove a disparate impact case. International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. at 335 n.15, 97 S.Ct. at 1854-1855 n.15; Scott v. City of Anniston, 597 F.2d 897, 898 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. denied --- U.S. ----, 100 S.Ct. 1850, 64 L.Ed.2d 271 (1980). Nor must the plaintiffs prove a racially disproportionate impact with " 'complete mathematical certainty.' " James v. Stockham Valves & Fittings Co., 559 F.2d 310, 337 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1034, 98 S.Ct. 767, 54 L.Ed.2d 781 (1978) (quoting Vulcan Society of the New York City Fire Department, Inc. v. Civil Service Commission, 490 F.2d 387, 393 (2d Cir. 1973)).
The clearly erroneous standard of review does not apply to findings of fact premised upon an erroneous view of controlling legal principles. Parson v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 575 F.2d 1374, 1382 (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 968, 99 S.Ct. 2417, 60 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1979); Johnson v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 491 F.2d 1364, 1372 n.20 (5th Cir. 1974). The district court's findings based on its misunderstanding of this legal standard are entitled to no deference. We must undertake an independent analysis of the record before us in light of the correct legal standards.
III.
Plaintiffs alleged that between 1972 and the institution of this suit in 1974, and as far back as 1960,1 Mexican-American workers, who comprise nine percent of Houston's labor market, constituted only four percent of Uncle Ben's employees. This gross disparity between Uncle Ben's workforce and the relevant labor market, which is statistically significant, ordinarily would satisfy plaintiff's initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of hiring discrimination. Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. at 307-08, 97 S.Ct. at 2741-2742; Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d at 225 & n. 34. Despite Uncle Ben's contrary claims, we ascribe no affirmative legal significance to Uncle Ben's increase in the number of its Mexican-American employees subsequent to the filing of this suit. International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. at 341-42, 97 S.Ct. at 1857-1858; Parson v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 575 F.2d at 1385-86.
This case nevertheless raises a difficult problem involving whether there was evidence of Uncle Ben's substantial underutilization of Mexican-Americans at the close of plaintiffs' direct case. Uncle Ben's asserts that the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs' allegations of discrimination against Mexican-Americans because at the close of plaintiffs' case the record was devoid of evidence supporting such allegations. We agree.
Plaintiffs' case regarding Mexican-Americans rested on the testimony of their expert, Richard Alfred Tapia, to the effect that Uncle Ben's substantially underutilized Mexican-Americans. On cross examination, however, Dr. Tapia disclosed that he had relied on statistics relating to 1975, more than a year after suit was filed. He conceded that he had no information regarding the number of Mexican-Americans employed and terminated during the period covered by the suit. He conceded further that the basis for his opinion did not include prior interviews with any of Uncle Ben's employees or an examination of any of the company's personnel files. Dr. Tapia relied instead on Uncle Ben's answers to interrogatory number 13 alone, which Dr. Tapia acknowledges he incorrectly assumed to relate to 1974. In fact, the information related to September 12, 1975. This interrogatory answer was introduced into evidence. Plaintiffs' counsel failed to offer other available evidence that contained the 1974 data that would have established a prima facie case of discrimination. Because there was no substantial evidence before the court of discrimination during the period covered by the suit, the district court correctly dismissed the claim regarding Mexican-Americans. Plaintiffs' counsel never sought to have the claim reopened when the availability of the needed data became evident.
IV.
The district court originally, and at the time quite correctly, determined that plaintiff would adequately represent the certified class of blacks and Mexican-Americans. At trial, however, representation of the class of Mexican-Americans was not adequate. The thrust of plaintiffs' direct case concerned the situation involving black employees. Although this may well have been necessary on the issue of promotion considering the small number of Mexican-Americans employed by Uncle Ben's, plaintiffs' preoccupation with the issue of black promotion seemingly led them to omit to introduce into evidence the number of Mexican-Americans hired by Uncle Ben's.
Under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the trial court has a duty to supervise plaintiffs' presentation to safeguard the rights of the class being represented. Grigsby v. Northern Mississippi Medical Center, Inc., 586 F.2d 457, 462 (5th Cir. 1978); Guerine v. J & W Investment, Inc., 544 F.2d 863, 864-65 (5th Cir. 1977). When it became apparent that plaintiffs did not adequately represent the Mexican-Americans, the trial court should have taken action such as dividing the certified class into a separate subclass for the Mexican-American members, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(4), decertifying that class, or certifying a second class. To remedy the trial court's failure in this respect we now hold that dismissal of all claims regarding Mexican-Americans is without prejudice. This judgment does not have res judicata effect against them in light of plaintiffs' total failure adequately to represent them. Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United States, 366 U.S. 683, 691, 81 S.Ct. 1309, 1314, 6 L.Ed.2d 604 (1961) ("the judgment in a class action will bind only those members of the class whose interests have been adequately represented by existing parties to the litigation"); Grigsby v. North Mississippi Medical Center, 586 F.2d at 461-62; Gonzales v. Cassidy, 474 F.2d 67, 73-75 (5th Cir. 1973).
V.
Plaintiffs' case of employment discrimination against blacks showed that the proportion of that group in each job grade did not reflect the proportion of blacks available for promotion from lower job levels.2 Plaintiffs further alleged that Uncle Ben's filled its better jobs generally by promoting employees from within the firm rather than making lateral hires from without. Blacks, therefore, tended to remain in those low paying, entry level positions while similarly situated whites advanced upward from such positions.
The district court correctly determined that plaintiffs' statistical evidence and testimonial evidence made out a prima facie showing of discrimination against blacks on the promotion issue. E. g., Watkins v. Scott Paper Co., 530 F.2d 1159, 1185-86 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 861, 97 S.Ct. 163, 50 L.Ed.2d 139 (1976); Rowe v. General Motors Corp., 457 F.2d 348, 357 (5th Cir. 1972). Uncle Ben's then had the " 'onus of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion,' " James v. Stockham Valves & Fittings Co., 559 F.2d at 330 (quoting United States v. Hayes International Corp., 456 F.2d 112, 120 (5th Cir. 1972)), as to either the existence of "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for (its) action by a preponderance of the evidence," Turner v. Texas Instruments, Inc., 555 F.2d 1251, 1255 (5th Cir. 1977), or the total unacceptability of plaintiffs' statistical proof, see EEOC v. Datapoint Corp., 570 F.2d 1264, 1269 (5th Cir. 1978) ("statistics must be relevant, material and meaningful, and not segmented and particularized and fashioned to obtain a desired conclusion"); Robinson v. Union Carbide Corp., 538 F.2d 652, 658 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 822, 98 S.Ct. 65, 54 L.Ed.2d 78 (1977); Johnson v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 491 F.2d at 1371.
The trial court held that plaintiffs' prima facie case had been rebutted by Uncle Ben's evidence showing both the absence of discriminatory impact and the presence of "legitimate, nondiscriminatory" explanations for the status quo. Plaintiffs did not introduce evidence that these explanations were pretextual.
The findings regarding the absence of discriminatory impact are, in pertinent part, as follows:
11. Plaintiff also introduced through Dr. Tappia (sic) evidence of differences in upward mobility-wage increases received by Defendant's black and white employees. . . . Such evidence does not, however, when considered in conjunction with countervailing evidence of individual cases offered by Defendant, establish discriminatory treatment of Defendant's black employees.
12. During the period from August 8, 1971 through May 10, 1974, limiting the analysis to employees who were employed on both dates, Defendant's black employees received a statistically significant greater wage increase than did Defendant's white employees. . . . Further, . . . the Court finds that the percentage increase in black wages exceeded the percentage increase in white wages regardless of whether or not individuals in job classifications falling within the EEOC category "Officials & Managers" are included. . . . Utilizing salary level groupings suggested by Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 8, e. g., employees earning less than a given amount, any differences in black-white wage increases during the 1971-74 period were not statistically significant. . . .
13. The Court finds that any differences in wage increases received by black and white employees, or claimed differences in upward mobility as between black and white employees, were due to specific individual attributes of Defendant's employees. Such differences were not due to the race of the employee concerned. The referenced attributes or upward mobility factors include, for example, limited ability to read, write and make numerical calculations; promotion refusals; demotion requests; non-shift work requests; lack of interest in changing jobs; and performance shortcomings.
14. As of March 31, 1974, the Defendant employed 141 blacks out of a total work force of 394 employees. Considering the job classifications utilized at Defendant's facilities and the necessary requirements for those jobs, and based upon the 1970 United States Census availability data, the Court finds the Defendant employed an equitable number of blacks in view of their availability within the Houston SMSA.
19. In terms of the number of employees promoted, their time in grade prior to promotion and the wage increases received upon being promoted, the Court finds that there has been no statistically significant difference in the treatment of Defendant's black and white employees. . . .
The district court's findings concerning legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons are, in relevant part, as follows:
15. The large number of black employees employed within Defendant's lower job zones is not the result of racial discrimination.
16. The Court finds, based upon the testimony of Dr. Richard Jeanneret, an expert in the field of industrial psychology and job analysis, that Defendant's requirements for its jobs are valid, job-related and necessary. The Court further finds that certain of Defendant's jobs require knowledge and skills not obtainable through on-the-job or internal Company training or experience.
17. The job classifications/positions within Defendant's Office differ greatly from those within its Plant. They involve and require different skills, knowledge and training.
18. Because of the Office-Plant differences, and because the lines of progression and patterns of promotion respecting wage differentials and time in grade differ significantly, statistical analyses which separate Office and Plant employees are proper and allow meaningful comparisons to be made and conclusions to be drawn. The joinder or lumping together of Office and Plant employees does not provide a meaningful or valid basis for comparing the treatment of black and white employees.
On the discriminatory impact issue, Uncle Ben's persuaded the district court that the black/white ratio in each of Uncle Ben's job levels should be compared to the black/white ratio in comparable jobs in the Houston SMSA, and not compared to the black/white ratio in the relevant lower job level(s) at Uncle Ben's. The district court accepted this argument and, because of the favorable statistical comparison between Uncle Ben's at various levels and similar Houston SMSA job levels, found that Uncle Ben's had not violated Title VII.
The dispositive issue is whether Uncle Ben's ordinarily employs individuals for upper level positions by hiring laterally from outside the company or by promoting from within. If it hires laterally, the relevant comparison is to the general or qualified outside labor force. If Uncle Ben's fills jobs by promotion, the relevant comparison, as we recognized in James v. Stockham Valves & Fittings Co., 559 F.2d at 331, 341, is the company's internal work force. Accord, Hereford v. Huntsville Board of Education, 574 F.2d 268, 272-273 (5th Cir. 1978).. See Mayor of Philadelphia v. Educational Equality League, 415 U.S. 605, 620-21, 94 S.Ct. 1323, 1333-1334, 39 L.Ed.2d 630 (1974); Hester v. Southern Ry., 497 F.2d 1374, 1379 n.6 (5th Cir. 1974).
The difficulty is that most cases fall between these extremes of exclusive promotion and of exclusive nonpromotion. As a general matter, however, cases are dealt with in terms of the extreme to which they most closely accord. In addition, the necessity of nonpromotions in certain jobs-or even in the majority of jobs within a company-should not foreclose an inquiry at trial into whether the remaining jobs filled by promotion are discriminatorily filled.
The district court frankly ignored deciding the questions of whether any promotion or upward mobility occurs at Uncle Ben's, and, if so, whether blacks suffer a disparate impact in seeking promotions. The trial court's findings 11-13 and 19 suggest that promotions occur. Findings 14-16 suggest that no promotions are made from Plant to Office. Yet neither set of findings is necessarily incorrect: Uncle Ben's may fill some of its positions by promotions while it must fill other positions from outside the company. If so, it is insufficient to know that blacks constitute 141 of Uncle Ben's 394 employees. We must know how many of those 394 employees hold jobs that ordinarily cannot be filled by promotion to decide the question of discriminatory impact.
The district court must, therefore, prepare new findings on discriminatory impact. Findings of fact 12 and 14, for example, are useless to the extent they incorporate or commingle facts about lateral hiring. First, the new findings must determine the number of Uncle Ben's jobs that were filled by promotion and the number that were filled by hiring from the outside of the Uncle Ben's work force. In essence, the absence or presence of blacks in lateral hire positions is generally irrelevant to the question of discrimination in promotion. Because the issue of discrimination in lateral hiring for desirable positions at Uncle Ben's has not been properly raised, the district court must excise facts germane to that issue from its assessment of discrimination in promotion. Second, the district court must decide whether Uncle Ben's has rebutted or discredited plaintiffs' prima facie showing that in promotions blacks are relegated to lower level jobs and are promoted at a significantly slower rate than whites. On this question, statistics comparing Uncle Ben's work force to the external labor market are irrelevant. Third, the district court also must find whether the legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons that it credited, based on a correct view of the controlling legal principles on that point, apply to any of the promotion positions and not just to the lateral hire positions. Given the peculiar nature of this case, on remand the district court will not abuse its discretion if it allows plaintiffs and Uncle Ben's an opportunity to clarify and supplement their original presentations.
The two issues of access-promotion and lateral hiring (including hiring from schools)-should be kept separate in scrutinizing statistical analyses. Cf. Johnson v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 491 F.2d at 1372-73 (statistical consequences of unvalidated testing should not be manipulated by including effects of independent transferral policy). Assuming that Uncle Ben's only hired whites for nonpromotion positions, only similarly situated black applicants have suffered discrimination. The class of black laborers who are striving, or would be striving but for discrimination, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. at 363-64, 97 S.Ct. at 1868-1869; James v. Stockham Valves & Fittings Co., 559 F.2d at 341-42, for a promotion from within the company to a promotion job may not have been injured. Similarly, if lateral hires were exclusively black, this would provide little solace for the class of black laborers, and would not mitigate any discrimination suffered in promotions.
VI.
The trial court erred in tacitly approving the part of Uncle Ben's promotion system that is based on the use of subjective supervisory evaluations. We have repeatedly held that subjective selection processes involving white supervisors provide a ready mechanism for racial discrimination. Parson v. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp., 575 F.2d at 1385; James v. Stockham Valves & Fittings Co., 559 F.2d at 345; Rowe v. General Motors Corp., 457 F.2d at 359.
Uncle Ben's subjective promotion system substantially embodies the mechanisms that we invalidated in Ro. at 358-59 (footnote omitted). See Wade v. Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service, 528 F.2d 508, 518 (5th Cir. 1976) (§ 1981 standard). These Rowe vices are not undone here simply because Uncle Ben's has made certain changes about the time this suit was instituted. Nor is Rowe avoided because subjective decisions are made by a group instead of an individual. See Robinson v. Union Carbide Corp., 538 F.2d at 661-62. This is not, moreover, a case of permissible subjectivity. Davis v. Board of School Commissioners, 600 F.2d 470, 475 (5th Cir. 1979), modified on other grounds, 616 F.2d 893 (5th Cir. 1980).
In all likelihood, the district court did not mean to approve Uncle Ben's subjective promotion system. Rather, it probably concluded that Rowe was inapplicable because no resulting substantial discrimination existed. Hester v. Southern Ry., 497 F.2d at 1381. We hold that Uncle Ben's subjective promotion system fails, unless the district court concludes in light of our instructions in Part V that blacks suffered no discriminatory impact in promotion.
VII.
If the district court finds on remand that a discriminatory impact existed, it must then reexamine its conclusions regarding whether Uncle Ben's educational requirements have been validated. Should such inquiry be necessary, it must be made in light of the following standards and principles.
Title VII was specifically designed to remove ). Cf. Miller v. International Paper Co., 408 F.2d 283, 294 (5th Cir. 1969) ("The ethic which permeates the American Dream is that a person may advance as far as his talents and his merit will carry him.") An educational requirement for a job is lawful if it is required by "business necessity," Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. at 431, 91 S.Ct. at 853-854; Payne v. Travenol Laboratories, Inc., 565 F.2d 895, 899-900 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 835, 99 S.Ct. 118, 58 L.Ed.2d 131 (1978), and valid under the EEOC's Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 29 C.F.R. § 1607 (1979); see Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2375, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). See generally Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. at 431-33, 436, 91 S.Ct. at 853-854.3 An educational requirement is not a measure of probable performance for many jobs at Uncle Ben's. See Watkins v. Scott Paper Co., 530 F.2d at 1181-82 & n. 30. This test of "justified business necessity" may, of course, be relevant, leaving aside the question of discriminatory impact, to the question on remand whether certain jobs are filled by promotion or lateral hiring.
MODIFIED AND AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.
DANIEL HOLCOMBE THOMAS, District Judge, dissenting:
This writer respectfully dissents. In the course of rendering its decision, the district court stated "that what has transpired . . . at Uncle Ben's could not have statistically have (sic) happened by chance," yet "(t)he law does not say that the defendant shall not violate the rules of mathematical probability." Although this and similar statements indicate the Court's confusion as to the role of statistics in cases of this sort, e. g., Fisher v. Procter & Gamble Mfg. Co., 613 F.2d 527, 544 (5th Cir. 1980). I would affirm because, when evaluated on legally sufficient grounds, the district court's findings regarding the lack of discrimination in the promotion of blacks at Uncle Ben's are not clearly erroneous. I would further conclude that the district court did not err in holding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie case on all issues other than discrimination against blacks with respect to promotions. I would affirm the ruling of the district court.
I dissent.)
Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d at 218 n. 10. See also Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 309 n. 15, 97 S.Ct. at 2742-2743 n. 15, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977).
Plaintiffs demonstrated, inter alia, that of the 172 plant hourly positions, 118 such positions were held by blacks (68.6%). In the next four higher zones, blacks held 30 of the 67 positions (44.8%). Taking higher plant hourly pay zones into account as well as all office hourly jobs and the salaried jobs, blacks represented 35.8% of Uncle Ben's total work force. The overall pattern appeared to be one of blacks being clustered in the lowest paying jobs. Even those few blacks who entered the generally more desirable salaried jobs tended to be clustered in the least remunerative and responsible jobs at those levelsAUCD-NCBDDD 2010 RTOI Explores Health Surveillance of Adults with Intellectual Disabilities
May 18, 2011
View Project Description [
]
This RTOI project team set out with the goal of completing foundational work towards improving the surveillance of health of adults with intellectual disability (ID) in the United States. One component of the work includes developing recommendations about how to ensure that health surveillance covers the broadest range of this population as possible, extending beyond those community members who are receiving traditional state-agency funded DD/ID supports. The project is interested in reaching out to community leaders who support people (directly or indirectly) who have an intellectual disability but do not receive state DD/ID agency supports, to learn about the types of supports people seek and receive, and the surveillance or data collection that they currently do. This RTOI will be discussed at the May 23-26, 2011 Health Frontier for Intellectual Disabilities meetings and documented in the project reports, to be finalized later in 2011. If you are aware of community groups that support significant numbers of people who have intellectual disability and are not served by their state's DD/ID, please contact the RTOI Principal Investigator, Alixe Bonardi.
This article was featured in the AUCD-NCBDDD Cooperative Agreement Newsletter.The Alabama Kidney Foundation (AKF) was founded to assist kidney patients and has over a 40 year history of serving Alabama's kidney patient population. Today, the AKF is the only state-based organization dedicated to assisting kidney patients, and each year touches the lives of thousands of Alabamians.
AKF Mission
The Alabama Kidney Foundation serves kidney patients by providing financial assistance, education, and support services. The Foundation provides public education to promote organ donation awareness and prevention of kidney disease.
Our History
It all began with a conversation in 1975 between two kidney patients where one made known his decision to stop expensive treatments because he feared it would leave his family destitute. That hopelessness and despair would have far-reaching effects. William E. Rowe was the patient who listened to this tragic bedside confession, and he knew other patients faced similar circumstances. His empathy and concern drove him to gather a group of volunteers and form an organization dedicated to financially supporting the kidney patient. This compassionate group of volunteers soon became known as the Alabama Kidney Foundation. Incredible advancements in the world of kidney medicine have occurred since those early days, but the despair and hopelessness caused by kidney disease is still evident.
Alabama has an an usually high occurrence of kidney disease, ranking fifth in the nation. Today over 10,500 Alabamians seek dialysis treatments three times a week simply to sustain life. Many of those patients turn to the Alabama Kidney Foundation for help.RTI International to expand R&D efforts on CO2 capture
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. — As part of an effort to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants, the U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has awarded RTI International two new projects to develop and test transformational technologies for CO2 capture.
"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through carbon capture and storage remains one of the great challenges in our era of abundant fossil fuels, which are linked to climate change," said Markus Lesemann, Ph.D., senior director for business development in RTI's Energy Technology Division.
Fossil fuel-fired power plants are expected to continue to play a critical role in global electricity generation, especially for base-load generation. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an important approach to significantly reduce domestic and global CO2 emissions. RTI's new technology developments are aimed to further reduce the cost and energy penalty associated with carbon capture to better prepare for a low-carbon future.
Under a $2.7 million award, RTI researchers will continue the development and scale-up of RTI's non-aqueous solvent based CO2 capture technology with engineering partner Linde Group and Norwegian research entity SINTEF.
The process currently is being tested at small scale in RTI's facility in North Carolina, under funding from DOE-NETL. The new award will allow the process to transition to large bench scale/small pilot testing on actual flue gas, substantially leveraging SINTEF's existing pilot facility outside Trondheim, Norway.
If successful, the new project will position the technology for large scale slip stream testing. The overall program is also substantially supported by CLIMIT, the national Norwegian program for CO2 capture R&D, under an international cooperation framework between the U.S. Department of Energy and the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy.
A second, $1.6 million award will allow RTI to develop novel solid CO2 adsorbents which have additional step-out performance and cost savings potential compared to current CO2 sorbents that RTI is testing under an existing NETL-funded effort. These novel sorbent approaches are based on hybrid metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and dendrimers, unique materials with advantageous physical and chemical properties for CO2 adsorption.
If the initial work is successful, RTI's substantial expertise and existing testing capabilities at lab and bench scale will allow for a clear path to accelerated scale-up and demonstration for these new 3rd generation sorbent materials.
"RTI's technology development program will remain focused on cost-effective CO2 capture process technologies that can be implemented with lowest possible negative impact on electricity prices," Lesemann said.
RTI International's Energy Technology Division develops advanced process technologies for application in the energy and chemicals sectors. For the last 15 years, RTI has been developing CO2 capture technologies with funding from DOE, industry and international funding agencies.

May the Fourth Be With You!
Because May 4th is International Star Wars Day! But even more significantly, it’s my mom’s birthday!
Happy Birthday, Mom!
Sometimes the Stars align, such as celebrating both my luminous mom and that spectacular movie about a scrappy band of stellar rebels. In case you were unaware, big fan, right here. Big nerdy fan.
But my mom is the coolest mom. She has gamely watched so many years of science fiction movies and TV shows with me and my sister; decades really. Even now, when she sees Capt. Kirk hanging on through sheer bare-chested grit, we can still get her going with the line, “This is the one where Kirk dies, Mom.”
“Really?!” … “Ohhh, you guys are kidding me!”
You’ve heard it before: The dictionary definition of gullible includes a picture of my mom.
But being gullible is not the same as being unintelligent. Mom is one of the best-read people I know. And remarkably, she constantly marvels at the changes she has seen over the course of her life. We all know people who rue change, who view whatever condition the world was in when they were young as the definitive measure of desirability. Not mom.
Maybe it’s because she was a nurse and values the wondrous advances in medicine she has witnessed, or it may simply be her transcendent curiosity, but she has never shied away from the next new thing. She wants to understand technology and all the new gadgetry.
Like many grandparents, she will watch her grandson play his various beeping games for hours. “Oh, I just love being with you, honey,” she’ll say. But then you’ll hear her ask him, “How do you move around that video game so fast? I wish I could do that!”
I wish I could do that. I wish I could embody the delight my mom still exudes in the ninth decade of her life. I know she will savor this quote I read yesterday:
“Living on earth may be expensive, but it includes an annual free trip around the Sun.” (anon.)

Delightful. Absolutely delightful. You’re right – you DO have a great mom. I have absolutely zero regret about sharing my mom’s Best Mom status with your mom. Happy birthday to your mom, and congratulations to you to have her to cherish.

Our mother definitely set the mom-bar very high, and the grandmom-bar even higher, I think. Happy Birthday, Mom.

The “high grandmom-bar” makes me giggle. I’m seeing our mother, whiskey sour in hand, leaping over a high-jump bar. She is Super-Grandmom!

Hi Yolande, yes let’s talk after the break, in the meantime are you aware of the national cultural policy discussion initiated by Minister Garrett? Submissions close 1 February 2009.In recent years, I've received dozens of letters from people with Native American roots who have taken the path of emuna as Noahides. Six of these folks - five of whom have Cherokee ancestors - have become Orthodox Jewish converts.
The following is one of the most special letters I ever received, from "Sara Rivka," a young women who converted to Orthodox Judaism 12 years ago at the age of 23 after completing her MA in American History. Her area of concentration was the history of the Native Americans before the Civil War. She is now a mother of five in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood. She looks like a rabbi's wife and few know that she's a convert. Yet, even fewer know the challenges she faced as a convert, which she shares with me in the following poignant letter.
One more thing: when I was using my sleep time to devote the needed hours for recording "Calming Waters" in the studio, a colleague asked me why I'm putting so much effort into a music project. I told him that many people get more spiritual vitamins from a moving melody than they do from a book or CD. Hashem does everything for a purpose; He gave me those melodies for the benefit of some very special people, like Sara Rivka. Here's what she writes:
Dear Rabbi Brody, shlit'a,
I cannot tell you what a delightful addition your Calming Waters CD has made in my life. This is the most moving music I have ever heard. The melodies are simply amazing and as a person of Native American roots, you know this music is close to my heart. I grew up with it, my father plays the Native American Flute, I grew up with the melodies of Robert Tree Cody & Carlos Nakai. But, hearing a Torah-observant Jew incorporate audible holiness into our traditional music makes this CD truly a treasure.
As an Orthodox convert trying to navigate the foreign waters of Jewish culture, I've often felt lost and so alone having no Jewish heritage or family. When I converted as a 23 year old, I thought I was simply elevating my relationship with G-d. I was unprepared for how much culture & religious politics played a part in being Jewish. There have been times I thought I made a mistake, wondering if I would have been better off as a Noachide while keeping to my Native customs instead. Your writings and music have changed my life as a Jewess though. Both have bridged a painful gap for me.
Finding some connection between these two worlds has brought healing to my soul. You have been Hashem's messenger in bridging what I felt was an impossible chasm in my life. I'll never forget for this. You have given me back my self-esteem, and I no longer feel that I need to cast away my past - I can now simply uplift it and incorporate it into my present, as you yourself have taught me. All of a sudden I feel that I am returning to - and have found - something that my ancestors have been searching for for hundreds of years. This connection gives me a sense of fulfillment and purpose as a Jew.
You have illuminated the meaning in my heritage, awakening a restoration of what has been lost over the ages. I no longer think of Jewish-Indian similarities as quaint coincidences. The whole world is crying out for shortcuts to HaShem and the ancient sparks of holiness in the 'New World' are being fanned. It seems Creation is moving toward the fulfillment of the Aleinu prayer when all of mankind calls out Hashem's Name and I pray to be a part of its realization in some humble way.
I thank you and HaShem's loving grace for these inspiring revelations and I pray for Emunah Outreach to continue in strength and success.

Like these two images for example - Marvel's 'Satanna' and Ediperiodici's 'Lucifera'. I mean, seriously - had they run out of things to call the villainesses or was it just simpler to make their names and purpose *that* on the nose? I'm betting that wasn't the point at all. Based on the referrence material I got for these two, it was all about the T&A and less about being 'Satan's Daughter'. What's the difference between the two, you ask? Well...one's published by Marvel and the other's...not.
And here's what Wikipedia has on Luc.
On the surface world she seems to inhabit a mythical and very violent Europe from the Middle Ages - populated by wenches, knights and three-headed dragon dogs.
'Dragon-dogs', it says. The three-headed variety, no less. Very interesting, eh? What? You're too busy looking at blocked-out boobs to worry about the trivial facts about this now-defunct character? Too mesmerized by overtly sexual and erotic characters obviously aimed at the misguided hormones of young boys? Guess what? You're their target audience! Congrats, Mr. Hairy Palms!

Nice job on Satana- I always liked that character. Wish Warren Ellis had gotten the chance to write her like he was supposed to several years ago...
hahahahha! wow, such a very intriguing blog on what would otherwise be just some awesome (yet erotic) pin-up art....bravo!
These con pieces are just getting better and better! You are awesome sir!
thats hot! very clean work.
Your line is is is... incredible. I LOVE your characters. Great work!
Even with a single figure no background piece like Satana, your composition and balance are amazing.
As for Lucifera, even with the black bar, that is one sexy piece, especially the way she is suggestively stradeling that finger.

It was a work related trip and I am so grateful I was one of 36 lucky South Africans that were chosen to go and explore one of the world's oldest civilisations. I'm doing a travel piece for the M&G so I can't really give a breakdown of what happened yet, wanna save that for a paying audience thank you very much. Just kidding, I am going to release some images and stories bit by bit, I took way too many pics to put it in one post and I'm thinking of doing different themes with every post. I think I will start with the children that won my heart forever and ever.
One of my favourite moments was vising a farm school called the Ethiopian Children's Fund or ECF, a school started by former supermodel Anna Getaneh, who is of Ethiopian origin and was a big deal model in the early 90's. She invited me on this trip, which is in association with Ethiopian Airlines and Ethiopian Tourism - it's about promoting tourism there so they invited journalists and other media people to experience their country and culture. She's done a fantastic job of starting something from absolutely nothing and providing education for all of these children for the past 12 years, all of whom are orphans.
We went to visit them because we were in the area and being there turned out to be one of the most special part of the trip for me. These kids literally attacked me with hugs and tugs and wanting to be photographed. I lost the group I was with because I was stuck in a sea of little kids going Me Me Me Me Me Me Me! It was so sweet. Here they are:
With the help of USAid and some generous NGO's Anna founded the school in 1999 with 40 children. Since then it has grown to accommodate more than 600 children and a waiting list of over 700 orphans each year. The school is about 45 minutes outside Addis in a rural district that is one of many decrepit regions in Ethiopia but when you step onto the 15 acre properly, there's nothing but happiness. We went to different classes and found the kids quietly doing their work or reciting words from their black boards and writing them onto their slates (remember those?)
The school takes children as young as 4 years old to 18 from 8am - 6pm every day and all of them are fed by the school's feeding scheme. Anna says it wasn't easy establishing the school initially. When the locals saw NGO cars and white people, some of them thought they were coming to adopt the children and others thought they were there to start a new religion so there was some resistance but today, the school is an indispensible part of the community, having passed its first matriculants last year, 75% of whom passed with honours. Since schooling is free in Ethiopia, the school relies on child sponsors and fund raisers to survive. Anna produces an annual fashion show in Addis Ababa and there are also sponsors from Ethiopia and abroad who sponsor each child for about US $45 a month. It was wonderful to witness such a commitment from Anna, the staff of 51 employees and of course the kids, who are apparently obsessed with reading, says the librarian. I hope to see them again when I go back to Ethiopia.

Happy belated birthday miss. M. Its features as these that incite one to make a difference...thank you for all the posts.
Why are Ethiopian girls so much prettier than everyone else?
Wow, that is a post after my own heart.
Such beautiful images. I agree with Judy...these fueled my motivation to make a difference with my work if not only for people in my country but for other African queens and ings too. Lets keep the lihgt shining:)
Nice story.
i love Ethiopians, i have a lot of friends in Addis ababa and they are such a blessing. when i grew up the saying "It takes a village to raise a kid" was really true every mother in your street was your mom.

The bladder wrack Fucus vesiculosus is a large brown algae, common on the middle shore. It can be found in high densities living for about 4-5 years (S. Kraan, pers. comm.). Under sheltered conditions, the fronds have been known to grow up to 2 m in Maine, America (Wippelhauser, 1996).
- none -
Air bladders or vesicles are produced annually to make the frond float upwards when immersed, except at highly exposed coasts where no air bladders are produced (S. Kraan, pers. comm.). Fucus vesiculosus supports few colonial organisms, but provides substratum and shelter for the tube worm Spirorbis spirorbis, herbivorous isopods, such as Idotea, and surface grazing snails, such as Littorina obtusata.
Growth Rate
The growth rate of fucoids is known to vary both geographically and seasonally (Lehvo et al., 2001). Relative growth rate can vary from 0.05-0.14 cm/day depending on temperature and light conditions (S. Kraan, pers. comm.). The increase in growth rate for Fucus vesiculosus at 10, 12.5 and 15 °C was found to be, on average, 280% higher than it was at 7 °C (Strömgren, 1977). In the northern Baltic, the highest relative growth rate of vegetative branches for Fucus vesiculosus was observed in the summer (up to 0.7% / day ) compared to winter growth (less than 0.3% / day). In Sweden, growth rates of 0.7-0.8 cm / week were reported over the summer months of June and August (Carlson, 1991).
Growth rate can also vary with exposure. In Scotland, Fucus vesiculosus at Sgeir Bhuidhe, a very exposed site, grew about 0.31 cm / week whereas plants at Ascophyllum Rock grew an average of 0.68 cm / week (Knight & Parke, 1950). The proportion of energy allocated between vegetative and reproductive growth also varies throughout the year. In the northern Baltic, reproductive branches experienced a peak in growth rate in mid April where the relative growth rate was almost 0.1% / day (Lehvo et al., 2001).
Global distribution
Fucus vesiculosus is found in the Baltic Sea, Faroes, Norway (including Spitsbergen), Sweden, Britain, Ireland, the Atlantic coast of France, Spain and Morocco, Madeira, the Azores, Portugal, the North Sea coast of Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium and the eastern shores of United States and Can -

The removal of the interface between the ITO (indium tin oxide) layer and the acidic PEDOT:PSS layer along with the substitution of a low work function metal electrode with a high work function metal electrode in the inverted device configuration renders relatively higher stability in these devices. However, one of the main inherent difficulties involving the fabrication of devices with such inverted architecture is the wettability of the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS onto the photoactive layer such as the P3HT:PCBM blend which is hydrophobic in nature. To overcome this, we have used a novel fluorosurfactant, Capstone® Dupont™ FS-31 (CFS-31), as a substitute to the conventional Zonyl FS-300 as an additive to PEDOT:PSS. A smooth and uniform PEDOT:PSS layer was coated onto the P3HT:PCBM blend layer by addition of CFS-31 alone without any further treatments. Using this surfactant, an efficiency of 3.1% and a stable device performance (up to 400 hours) under ambient conditions without encapsulation have been achieved.Christmas is my absolute favourite time of year. The best way I can describe my feelings about it is to mention the German Christmas market that comes to my town every year – dark nights lit with fairy lights, cold air and hot mulled wine and music and presents. As my day job has mandatory leave over the Christmas period, it also means I can wake up, see snow outside and know I don’t have to go out. It’s perfect.
So why, I wonder, have I never written a holiday story?
It’s not that there aren’t opportunities. Every year there are Christmas anthologies with varying slants. And it’s not as though there isn’t fodder for my imagination. I can think of dozens of Christmas-related sex scenes involving candy canes, tinsel or gifts under the tree. Heck, even Santa might like a quick one in between dropping off presents. It must be a long night for him.
I think it’s just that my brain is weird. All my ideas seem to come out of left field. My husband is used to bizarre queries about plot points, or being urgently told while I’m driving “I’ve had an idea! Text me the word ‘bullet’ so I don’t forget!” The shiny happy Christmas vision I hold somehow doesn’t translate into stories, which generally require conflict to have human interest.
So I’m not doing a Christmas story this year. But I’m working on three different projects right now, so the New Year should be a good one in literary terms.
Merry Christmas, and may you get all you want under the!ACT rejects push to curtail animal activists on farmsABC Rural Lucy Barbour
ACT Greens MLA and ACT Primary Industries Minister, Shane Rattenbury, opposes any plans to introduce state or territory laws to curtail animal welfare activists on farms.ABC News
The ACT Government has rejected the Federal Government's push for states and territories to introduce laws against trespassing and conducting unauthorised video surveillance on farms.
Earlier this year, the ACT Government banned factory farming, despite there being no factory farms in the Territory's jurisdiction.
The Federal Agriculture Minister, Barnaby Joyce, has indicated there's national agreement on the need to introduce the laws, which aim to curtail the actions of animal welfare campaigners.
But ACT Minister for Primary Industries and Greens politician, Shane Rattenbury, disagrees.
"I don't support that position," he said.
"The Federal Government doesn't have powers in these areas, so states or territories have to do it individually.
"The ACT believes there are sufficient laws in place and we should, in fact, be focussing on improving animal welfare standards to ensure that the industry is well prepared for the change in customer expectation around animal husbandry."I agree that the act of turning on/off the switch is not a resource.

Warlocks occurred by virtue of a sort of spiritual contagion, and have occurred all across the world and in every culture. The warlock is a person touched by the spirits, marked by the wild ones. They were not originally seen as evil people, but they were not well trusted in general because their behaviour could in a sense be called “mad.”
In the case of the warlock phenomenon, I think it would even be possible to train someone as one who is not otherwise innately disposed toward it. The practices of the Sufi dervishes and voodoo ritualists might be an example.Stardrops Pine Disinfect

B97.A advantage of the positives, you need to be aware of the disadvantages so you can mitigate problems before they happen.
Here are some disadvantages that you, as a team leader, must keep in mind:
- Meetings, Meetings and More Meetings — Teams are made up of groups of people (no secret here!) which requires that they get together often to discuss team business. Provide them with the training they need so their meetings will be more than a gathering of people.
- Long Decision-Making Process — When one person makes all the decisions, it can be done in a heartbeat. When several people are required to provide input and discuss the pros and cons before making a decision, it can take some time. Equip your teams with decision-making tools so that the process is not agonizing for them.
- Productivity Will Dip Before It Peaks — Things around your company will be very different when it is all team-based. After you begin your journey, you may wonder why you started a team-based organization in the first place! Be patient, the gains will come — and typically they will be big gains.
- Chaos Can Happen — Ensure that your organization is really ready to provide the infrastructure and support needed by teams to accomplish their work. If the organization merely calls a work group a team and doesn’t provide critical training and support, you’ll have a major mess on your hands.
What do you think are other disadvantages of creating a team-based culture?

@KareAnderson, Thanks for your compliment. I appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback. I agree that team operating guidelines are one of the keys to success for a team. One of the neat things is that development of those guidelines — as a team — helps bring the team together as they start their journey.

Oh goodie gumdrops. I found treasure! Free, customizable, crisp, vintage graphics. I know! What magic is this?!! Well, Wedding Chicks has 16 free customizable monograms, and more save the dates, invitation suites etc. Sure, its meant for a wedding but I am seeing simple stationary, easy cards, transfer paper crafts and sweet wall art in my future. I am sure some of you can sympathize with my frustration in finding only cheesy free graphics online... so I am pretty jazzed have access to graphics that range from architectural to whimsical to painterly. Plus, monograms are popping up all over the place!
I do love a monogram as I do lean a little preppy in my interior taste. And I love them even more once I learned that the woman's initial goes first (who knew?). So now I know that Boyfriend and I's monogram will be sSa rather than.. well.. you can figure it out. Phew!
Enjoy, and if you create some monogram crafts this weekend let me know!NO. 17426 . 1 Jun 1925 - 6 May2014
Died in Chagrin Falls, Ohio
ROBERT REHM WERNER, age 88, of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, died May 6, 2014, after a brief illness. He was born June 1, 1925 to Minerva (Rehm) and Louis Wolf Werner and grew up in Yonkers, New York. He was their only child. His parents lived frugally on his dad's teaching salary so that the family could travel. By the time he graduated high school he had traveled with his parents to all the states (48 at the time), Canada, Mexico and Europe. He kept this love of travel to the final days of his life. In the last two years he traveled with one or another of his children to France, Italy, Scotland, Egypt, Turkey and Central America. Two months before he died he was zip lining in Honduras.
After graduating high school he enlisted in the Army in 1943 and went to Europe with the 86th Infantry Division and was wounded in combat in Germany. He won an appointment to West Point (signed by General Eisenhower). Graduating in 1950, he was commissioned in the Corps of Engineers. He married his high school sweetheart, Leila (Wilson) Werner on June 7 at West Point following graduation. He made the Inchon Landing with the 62nd Engineer Construction Batallion in the Korean War, and later served in Japan, Germany/France, Greenland, and Korea again after the Pueblo Incident. In 1964 he was assigned to the Office of Chief of Engineers and returned for a second tour, focusing on water resources and environmental impact in planning. He held a Master of Science degree in Civil Engineering from Texas A & M, was a registered professional engineer in the state of Texas, and was awarded a PhD in Economics from South Dakota State University.
He retired from the Army as a full Colonel in 1973, and wanting to test some of his ideas in civilian life, joined Dalton Dalton Little and Newport, consulting engineers, to head up their Planning and Environmental Systems Group. In 1982 he left Dalton and founded SEMCOR, Inc. a strategy consulting firm, and later SEMCOR, Europe.
Throughout his life he was a good synthesizer, able to bring multiple disciplines and viewpoints to solve problems. Over his many decades he had a continuing interest in engineering, planning, strategy, peace and religion. His book, Designing Strategy: The Art of Scenario Analysis, 2010, reflected his vision and perspective. He was an avid tennis and Bridge player, and achieved Bronze Life Master in Bridge. After his children were grown, he became the patriarch of the family in the best sense of that word. He kept a far-flung family together through summer reunions, daughter winter getaways, guys' golf, holidays and adventures. Everyone willingly came not only because it was great fun, but because the Colonel said so. The interest, love and acceptance he consistently showed to each member of his large extended family made him a role model for all of us.
He is survived by his loving wife, Leila of 63 years; his adoring children, Jacqueline Werner-Gavrin and her husband, Marc, Robert R. Werner, Jr. and his wife, Teri, Mary C. Smith and her husband, Chris and Judith L. Werner and her husband, Dan Borden; and his devoted grandchildren, Anneka, Elizabeth and Ari Werner-Gavrin; Suzanne Werner; Aaron and Kevin Smith; Paul, Garrett and Ryan Nugent. A Memorial Mass will be held at The Church of the Resurrection in Solon, Ohio on Monday, May 19 at 11:00 a.m. A Full Military Honors Funeral will be held at West Point on Tuesday, June 3 at 10:00 a.m. Memorial Gifts may be made to Covenant House, 461 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY, 10001.

February 20th, 2014 Leave a comment Go to comments
People injured in auto accidents have a 3 year Statute of Limitations (deadline) for either filing a lawsuit or settling their insurance claim. Too many injured persons wait too long and get too close to their case’s Statute of Limitation deadline before hiring a lawyer. This creates needless stress and worry. And it greatly hurts your claim’s $ value. The best thing to do is hire a lawyer right after your injury accident.

The protesters were holding placards and effigy of the Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah. They demanded immediate restoration of water supply.
“Some of the areas were deprived of water for the last fifteen days and they do not have water for basic necessities,” enraged citizens told Business92.

Here's a description of "Altered Earth" from Aitken's website:
ALTERED EARTH is a 21st century Earthwork. This multimedia work is described by Doug Aitken as "a series of moments and fragments of time focusing on the geography of the Camargue," which provides "an almost holographic view of the physical landscape." The work exists through moving images, sound and architecture, exploring the ever-changing landscape. It is a work of Land art for the electronic era. The installation of ALTERED EARTH creates a form of liquid architecture out of large scale moving images where the viewer explores a labyrinth of synchronized moving images, which explore new definitions of time and

By Evan Minsker on June 20, 2013 at 10Twice I have thought, "He is really cool." The first time while watching It Might Get Loud as Jimmy Page played his guitar. The second time tonight, during Neil Gaiman's appearance at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills.
Yes, a cool, smart, English writer dude. He is brilliant. His body of work includes comic books, children's books, adult books, scripts, and more. And then there is Neil himself. This is the second time I have sat in one of his audiences, and between these appearances and his online persona, I think he is a genuinely nice guy. One who I would enjoy having conversation with over a beer.
What I appreciate most is his connection to his fans. If you follow Neil Gaiman on Twitter, you will see how he answers his fans, shares their news and just appreciates them. Today he signed about 800 books for fans who pre-purchased the tenth anniversary edition of American Gods. Which is much more than I can say for another author who stamped books for an appearance.
If you ever need book recommendations, Mr. Gaiman's are great. Thanks to him I found my way to Robin McKinley (Sunshine is a new favorite), Gene Wolfe, Diana Wynne Jones, and Robert Holdstock.
About the event. It was wonderful. Once it got started. The show should have started at 8:00 p.m., but at the appointed hour we were still standing in a line that wrapped around the Saban, along Hamilton Drive. My guess is that the long wait occurred because all tickets were will call, as well as signed books to be picked up inside. Thankfully the show did not start until most of the audience was seated, somewhere around 9:00 p.m.
Patton Oswalt was the moderator/interviewer. Funny, funny guy. I saw him do something similar at Comic-Con two years ago, but this was better. Like us audience members, Mr. Oswalt is a big fan, and that went a long way. The evening included a hilarious book reading by Neil himself, Mr. Oswalt and Zelda Williams, as well as some extra tidbits on what the lot of us might soon expect. The future's looking good for American Gods Two; a musical set in 1920s Paris; non-fiction work; a children's book called Chu's Day; and American Gods, the TV show. One of the best things about the night besides Neil Gaiman? The fact that there were about 1,500 people in the Saban Theatre to see an author.
I highly encourage you to go see Neil Gaiman is he is ever in your town for an appearance. He does not disappoint. Plus, your vocabulary may grow.From inside the book

France's tour of Paris - part 2France's tour of Paris - part 2 by Ashry42
Author's Note: To take it from the beginning, click here:
France pursed his lips as he watched through narrowed eyes the commotion that was taking place right in front of him, his arms crossed over his chest, and his fingers drummed on his biceps. No, he didn't want to believe it. He refused to believe this would happen every time they would enter a public building.
Exited yells and angry cries continued to echo through France's ears, which only increased his animosity. His eyebrow twitched.
"Putain!" He unconsciously let a curse slip out. "Ne m'dit pas qu'ça va être comme ça chaque fois…" (Don't tell me it's going to be like this every time…) He grumbled under his breath. Depending on his mood, he would change his language register. When anger got the better of him - like it is happening now - he would sometime revert back to less formal speech and chose a m

As he turned down the street and emerged from the town, Russia was met with a wide sea of gold, speckled with infinite dots of black. The spicy aroma of the soil surrounded Russia as he entered the field and he quietly sang a song to himself about the joys of summer and the happiness the sunflowers brought.
Russia wished that others could be as happy as he was right now, and the only way he imagined such gladness could be transferred, was with these very sunflowers. So he proceeded to search the field for flowers to give to his friends, so that they would smile and sing too.

Part 2 of 4 (Autumn)
Despite only being the late afternoon, the sun had already disappeared behind the horizon. It was that time of year again, when darkness fell sooner and sooner every day. The leaves had all fallen off the trees and were left scattered along the ground, some tumbling along in the occasional gust of autumn breeze. When a chill wind picked up, Toris shivered and wrapped his sweatshirt a little tighter around himself. He expected to see snow any day now.
Normally, he felt glad to have a job that was within walking distance of his apartment, but now he wished that he lived just far away enough to need a car. Then he would be using one right now, and would surely have the heat on full blast. That sounded so much better than having a hood that barely protected his ears from the cold.
He wouldn’t deny, however, that he was thankful to not be making car payments or paying for gas. They couldn’t afford that—not with Feliks out of work. He tried not

Part 1 of 4 (Summer)
It began in the spring, with nothing more than a simple introduction.
“Hello, I’m Toris,” the young Lithuanian said, outstretching his hand towards the shy Polish boy, who appeared to be about his age.
“I’m Feliks,” the Pol replied. He never did like strangers, but wasn’t about to let that show. He reached out and shook his hand.
Neither one imagined that day that they would fall in love. But, though their first meeting was a bit uncomfortable, they quickly warmed up to each other, and it wasn’t long before they were in a steady relationship. They moved in together, and by summer of the following year the two had intentions to marry. Though some insisted it was too early, and that they were too young, they believed otherwise. In any case, they felt in no rush; they would wait until the next spring to have the wedding. In the meantime, they made each other happy. That was all that mattered.

Seasons - WinterThis world, twisted as it is, is inhabited by Angels who protect the Balance between good and bad Karma and guard us throughout our lives while we go about our daily business, unbeknownst of the greater forces at work.Seasons - Winter by Dark-King-Of-Winter
Long ago, when this universe was first created, Angels were simply traces of energy, and the world was a simple mass of combined elements. The Creator turned the energies into powerful Guardian Angels that protected said elements, and those Angels were called Elementals.
Four of the primary Elementals—each of whom represented a season, a compass direction, and a virtue—grew fond of the Humans, who were cast out of the Garden. To help, they became human by creating physical bodies from the materials of their season. In order to sustain their fragile bodies, they bonded with immortal Nations, who were in turn bound to the earth of which they walked.
Thus, the Shadow Nations were born.

He had been woken by the sound of a trapped bird playing out its song late in the night, when it was allowed to. He had decided that he was going to seek out the source of the music. He was not entirely sure why he felt so strongly, he simply did. His instincts did not usually fail him.
Prussia pulled on a vest over his shirt, decided that it was too late at night to bother with a cravat. He then pulled on a pair of boots on; the oldest pair that did not make the same loud clicks as the others. The air was still filled with the sweet notes that had awoken him. He stopped by the door for a moment to think, there was something else he wanted to bring with him.
He walked over to a cabinet he hadn't opened in quite a
The Sleeping DoitsuThe Sleeping Doitsu by MagdaTheHuman
Once upon a time there lived a German king and his queen. They loved eachother a lot, so they decided to have babies.
Nine months later, his first son was born. His name was Gilbert. But something happened with that baby. He didn't look like his father nor his mother. He was an albino with red eyes.
"My Queen, what have happened with this kid?" the Germanic king asked, confused about his son's looks.
"I don't know. But I think that maybe someone has cursed our son..." the queen answered, without a single idea about what happened with her baby.
Not sure about the baby's health, they decided to don't make a birthday party to him. Gilbert didn't protest, because he was a baby, and babies can't talk.
The Italian king, who had heard that the Germanic crown had a new heir, sent a letter to the Germanic king asking about the baby -and if it was girl, so she could marry one of his sons-. The German king told him about the baby's strange l
Breathe- Spamano One-ShotLovino always gets lost, and today is no different. He wanders the streets of the great city, undeniably and irrefutably lost. The moon is at his back and the streets curious and strange around him. The peace is almost unsettling; men call out to him from behind stalls, offering their wares, and he wonders at how different their voices sound from the wails of battle he has grown accustomed to. The capital city is so much different from the mountains that he feels as if he has stepped into another world. But he is still lost in it, and alone, for his brother no longer walks with the living.Breathe- Spamano One-Shot by Illusionsdreamsfan
This is why Lovino walks, to leave behind the shadow of his brother's soul that grips at his ankles and threatens to pull him down into the abyss. Or perhaps what he feels are the demons Grandpa Roma tells him to beware. Demons who are alive in the dark of night and slip in through the cracks of a weary soul. He loved his brother when he was alive, and still he does, but it has been years since he dr

"Tell me again why you took me out to the forest in the middle of the night?" Vash asked his friend, Vladimir, raising his eyebrow at him. Mentally telling him to speak up. Vlad rolled his eyes and placed his hands on his hips in an annoyed manner
"Because I wanted to speak to you in private!" He groaned, smirking and pulling his uptight friend deeper into the shadow encased forest. At this point Vash was starting get nervous, he wasn't usually afraid of the dark, it's just that being really deep in a pitch black forest at night isn't the safest place.
"Vladimir, this isn't safe, we should go back" Vash protested, glaring at the back of the Romanian's head. His friend just simply shook his head
"Nope! Deeper we go!" He said over-enthusiastically, pulling him deeper into the forest. Vash just sighed and followed him nonetheless, putting all his trust into his Romanian friend.
Trust My Heart (DenNor) Chapter 1Trust My Heart (DenNor) Chapter 1 by Gumi1111
Warning: story contains gore, dark humor, slight mention of rape, but most importantly, a lot of feels!!!
Since the beginning of my life I have heard stories. Stories of the world before my own time. It was said that the kingdom of Oteomos and its rivaling kingdom Arshein was in a time of peace after a long time of war that ravaged both to ruins. People would smile and greet strangers and help those in need without any hesitation. To most, it feel like they had finally gained their perfect world; however, not everyone was happy on how things ere turning out for their kingdom. After the kings of both Oteomos and Arshein made an announcement that they were to form an alliance, the kingdoms rejoiced. The king of Oteomos was to set him first born to marry the other king's only daughter. His second born son, was furious. He thought that it should be him to marry the beautiful princess! It should be him who should help bring his kingdom into peace! Not his p
Come Together- Chapter 8 (USUK)Arthur wasn't sure what happened after that. He wasn't sure if he shouted, if he cried, all he knew was that everything turned black. When he woke up the next morning, he drank. He drank and drank until the blackness came back and took him again.Come Together- Chapter 8 (USUK) by Illusionsdreamsfan
Arthur didn't care anymore. He had nothing to care about. Alfred was gone.
Over the next few weeks, he threw himself into protest work. He hated the war. He hated the government. He hated everything. The protests were the only thing that mattered to him, and damn the rest.
He couldn't stand being in the shop anymore. Everything reminded him of Alfred and it was suffocating, devastating; he was certain it would kill him. He didn't know what happened to it- he didn't care.
Everything passed in a blur. Arthur wasn't entirely sure what he felt- it first was deep, crippling despair, but after the first month it gave way to numbness. He was just... Indifferent.
Kiku was high more often than he was not. It was strange too see him so vacant and empty
Come Together- Chapter 6 (USUK)The next two weeks was the busiest Arthur had ever seen the apartment. The first three days were lethargic- everyone was recovering from the party, especially Kiku and Heracles, both of whom didn't remember a thing. Yao and Ivan left immediately, Gilbert and Antonio hung around for a while after it, and Arthur spent most of it terribly hung over. After that, everything sprang into motion. There was going to be a protest on Wall Street and everyone was preparing for it.Come Together- Chapter 6 (USUK) by Illusionsdreamsfan
Everyone but Arthur. He spent most of it in the shop. After all, he had only recently moved to America; he didn't have very strong views on anything here.
Alfred would drop in, too, every so often. It was Arthur's favorite part of the day.
It was hard to believe that Alfred loved him- after all, Arthur was quiet and kept to himself and wasn't anything near the dazzling vitality that was Alfred. Alfred was so popular and spirited and yet he still chose Arthur. He wasn't used to being someone's first choice or favorite or
Come Together- Chapter 5 (USUK)When Alfred returned to the apartment, uproar began. Kiku trapped him in a tight hug, Francis shook his head, whispering, "Mon dieu, but I could not lose you both"; even Heracles was grinning. Arthur, feeling a bit awkward and unneeded, slinked back to the corner of the room and watched them. He felt a slight twinge of jealousy at the way Alfred acted toward Kiku. Alfred seemed to favor him over the others- even the way he ruffled Kiku's hair seemed more affectionate. Maybe Arthur was overthinking, or maybe he was just noticing it for the first time. Then again, being jealous was ridiculous; even if he had made a small difference in Alfred's life, he was simply a side character, Kiku was far more interesting, and-Come Together- Chapter 5 (USUK) by Illusionsdreamsfan
Wait, why was he thinking like this? Being jealous over an irritating, naive American was what was ridiculous.
Even as he thought it, he knew he didn't believe it.
After the commotion was over, he and Alfred were the only ones still in the main room. Arthur began to le

Scars (Latvia)*** this ones my favorite***Scars (Latvia) by DJdiscord626
the darkness has engulfed what light
i had left, and now here I am in the
shadow of death.
I'll never be free, so why try to fight.
i guess I'll just stay,
although its in spite.
the others have left me here all alone,
with the devil himself,
in his own home.
i want to be freed from cage in hell,
but how can I be, if no one else sees
what he's doing to me.
the others who know of this life I lead,
have been gone for a while and
are no help to me.
if I try to escape who knows what he'll do,
I guess I'll just stay, because I have to...
I don't have a choice, to stay or to go...
i guess I'll just wait,
and see what unfolds.
but to people who ask,
where I got my scars... They came
from the one, who's heart is the snow...

Canadian Bus Driver...I was listening to the radio earlier and I heard a story that made me tear up in the good way. Heartwarming story.Canadian Bus Driver... by MaplePucks
I forget exactly where but somewhere in Canada recently a bus driver while on his regular route noticed a homeless man. The first day he saw him, he noted he didn't have any shoes. Bus driver continued on, saying a prayer for the man. The next day, he spotted the same man still without shoes. He threw on the emergency lights for the bus and got off the bus, rushing over to the man. Asking why he was without shoes, the homeless man simply replied that he had lost his pair. The bus driver then took off his own shoes, gave them to the man and got back on the bus. His passengers were in awe, many of them had tears in their eyes. He continued on his route, like nothing had happened.
I have worked with the homeless before. I love doing it. At the college I went to, we hosted a shelter on our
Just something that pulled my heartstrings :'D((OOC/: ... I just had the most wonderful experience ever at the aquarium. It made me feel so good inside. I was in the Splash Zone area (a coral reef themed exhibit) for little kids. I was using a seal puppet to entertain the children.Just something that pulled my heartstrings :'D by Ask-MatthewWilliams
(By the way, I am pretty darn good at using that seal puppet. Today, I made over 70 people believe that it was a real seal pup and not a seal pup puppet. Ahaha, yes I counted... I counted because my first few times with the seal puppet, a lot of people thought it was real, and I just wanted to know how many, so today, I actually counted the people XD)
Anyway, back to my story XD!
I was using the seal puppet and noticed a child in a wheelchair, staring over at me with the puppet. I smiled, walked over, knelt down on one knee and asked if he would like to pet the puppet. His mother said that he can't see, so I assume that when I thought he was looking at the puppet, his head was just facing my direction.
However, I asked the boy again, "Woul

Billion-Dollar MegaprojectsThere were many plans to improve Canada after the Second World War, but the greatest set of plans were arguably made by Canada's Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. His plans were technological advancements that benefited the whole of Canada, from the Maritimes to the Pacific West Coast. These advancements included the Trans-Canada Highway, the Trans-Canada Pipeline, and the St-Lawrence Seaway. Although many debates were held over these plans, all three great projects commenced anyways, and are still being used in Canada today.Billion-Dollar Megaprojects by CanHistoryinCartoons
The Trans-Canada Highway
This plan was mainly a way to create jobs for Canadians after the Second World War. It was to create a link from St. John's Newfoundland to Victoria, British Columbia and pass through all ten provinces. The Trans-Canada Highway Act was passed in 1949 to approve the decision to start construction. Although it wasn't a failure, the construction process faced major obstacles including rising construction costs and difficulty building through

1) Use proper grammar. PLEASE. Just do it. It's not that difficult. Put periods at the ends of your sentences and capitalize names and beginnings of sentences and stuff like that. Grammar may seem like a very small difference in writing, and it is. It's not hard to fix. It just makes me take rps more seriously when they have proper grammar.
2) Is your character always crying? Pet peeve. I get it- it's totally okay if the character's under stress and they cry, but seriously. If your character is crying over literal spilt milk, there is a problem. It also bothers me that the same character will scoff if my character is upset about something. I don't scoff when your character cries every second of every day. Don't scoff when mine gets a little upset.

First we have some NIJA SADU units:
The full reinforcement. 4 Turtle-class units, 3 Beetle-class units and an new experimental SHI unit.
Secondly we have the NTC's new recruits:
The first 4 Warriors are identical to the units previously fielded, with auto-rifles and 1 unit carrying an additional should-mounted missile pod.
The remaining 3 warriors come equipped with the latest of NTC's anti-armour weapons, the solid shooter bazooka. Designed to fire a hyper-velocity sabot, the bazooka causes extreme penetration and damage to armoured targets, even without an explosive warhead.
Standing taller than the average mech, and at more than tripple the mass, the Jotun is a real heavyweight by any standard. Armed with missiles, a plasma rifle and powered fists, it can easily smash smaller mechs to scraps. The heavy armour plating makes sure that a Jotun unit reaches it's target, without fail.
The last NTC unit may not look that different than the standard warrior, but it's difference is more than a paintjob. Rather than sinking even more funds into experimental unit programs, the NTC opted to improve on the basic unit in it's mecha arsenal, the Warrior.The Warrior Custom have upgraded laminated armour, a stronger powerplant and rewired and improved electronics, allowing an elite pilot to get the most possible out of the versatile Warrior frame. If it'll be enough to take on the experimental units of the SADU is still to be determined.
I've started thinking about making a few conversions, to cover some of my favorite ATs that's currently missing a sculpt. These would most likely be one-off's unless I find a really good way to make the required mods.
We'll see about that in the future however, for now I'm thinking over a few new terrain pieces to go with these and other mechs.

Filed under: Bankruptcy Information
If you and your partner are both considering seeking bankruptcy protection due to unmanageable debt loads there are some things you need to consider before filing. The main question is whether you should file as a couple in a joint petition or file separate petitions.
There are pros and cons to both and there may be reasons why one or the other may not be available under certain conditions. There needs to be a serious discussion between the parties as to which may be the best avenue of approach. The benefits for filing a joint petition are primarily ones of expedience and cost. The fees associated with seeking bankruptcy protection can be significant and by filing a joint submission you are able to keep the costs more manageable by only having to pay the fees once rather than twice.
Also, the amount of paperwork will essentially be cut in half by filing jointly. If you have a large amount of joint debt then this may be the best avenue for you and your partner. If, however, you or your partner has ever filed for a prior bankruptcy then you will be unable to file a joint petition. There are other considerations as well that arise from the type of assets that are held by the partnership that will need to be resolved before filing.
The best way to determine if a joint submission is the best way to proceed, given your particular circumstances, is to contact a Houston Texas bankruptcy attorney and get the advice you need before doing anything else.Segway Controller Notes Ground Plane: Areas enclosed by the outer rectangle that aren’t occupied by anything else are filled with copper.

Power Entry: +V could be virtually any DC power source, 7.2V - 24V. For our Segway, power comes from a 12V sealed lead-acid battery.
Reverse Polarity Protection: A diode only allows current to flow in one direction, protecting the circuit in case the battery is plugged in backwards.
Power Filters: A large capacitor between the power supply positive circuit and ground filters out noise from power electronics that control the large motors. Other smaller capacitors provide additional filtering for individual components.
Microcontroller: A PIC16F877 microcontroller handles all of the control tasks based on a program (written in C) that we write and download onto it. This is the same microcontroller setup used on the Machine Science XBoard.
Oscillator: A small device that keeps time for the microcontroller. It can run at up to 20MHz, 20 million “ticks” per second.
Reset: A button that connects the reset pin of the microcontroller to ground when pushed, causing a reset. Otherwise, the “pull-up” resistor R1 connects the reset pin to 5V, causing it to do nothing.
PWM Outputs: PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is the type of signal used to control the motors. These two outputs are connected to specific pins on the microcontroller that can generate 5V pulses with accurately-timed duration (width) of 1-2 milliseconds.
Analog Inputs: Four inputs can be used to read in the value of analog sensors (sensors that provide a range of information, not just “on” or “off”). These could be used for steering, additional gyroscopes/accelerometers, or potentiometers.
Digital Input/Outputs: Four digital connections provide a way to read in on/off sensors (switches) or to control on/off devices (LEDs, cold-cathode lights, relays).
Digital Radio: A digital ZigBee radio allows two-way wireless communication to the microcontroller. The white arrows indicated the direction of signal flow. Resistor R2 protects the 3.3V radio from the 5V microcontroller signals.
Serial Connection: A regular Machine Science serial connection can be used to program and talk to the microcontroller instead of the radio.
Inertial Sensor Connection: A special set of connectors used to connect the Analog Devices 6-way inertial sensor to the microcontroller. The sensor is entirely digital, so all of its information can be retrieved over a simple four wire interface.
Mounting Holes: Six mounting holes sized for 10-32 bolts. The metal plating is not connected to any part of the main circuit, so the chassis will necessarily be grounded. The holes are at spaced out at 0”, 4”, and 6” horizontally, 0” and 3” vertically.
Silk Screening: A place to put instructions, customized designs, etc.UK Election: No Comeback for Ex-Minister
UK prime minister Theresa May’s surprise decision two days ago to call an election in just seven weeks’ time on June 8 has prompted some former parliamentarians with energy dossiers to seek re-election.
However NGW can report that Danny Alexander – former deputy UK finance secretary (Chief Secretary to the Treasury) from 2010 to 2015 – is to stay on in his new role as a vice president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). A spokesperson for the bank told NGW April 20 that Alexander would be staying on in his new role, held since early 2016. Other UK reports this week had indicated that he would not be returning to Westminster.
AIIB vice-president Danny Alexander (Photo credit: UK government)
Beijing-based multilateral bank AIIB makes loans to road, airport and energy infrastructure projects and has already made a number to gas projects such as the trans-Turkey Tanap project and a scheme to add compressors and pipes to boost indigenous gas production in Bangladesh. It has 52 founding member states, of which 35 in the Asia-Pacific region and 17 beyond (including the UK).
Alexander belonged to the Liberal Democrats, junior partners in the 2010-15 coalition government. In contrast his LibDem colleagues, former UK energy secretary Ed Davey and former UK business secretary Vince Cable are both seeking re-election to their former outer London constituencies on June 8.
After last June’s UK referendum vote to leave the EU, Theresa May took over as PM and leader of the Conservative Party in 2016 from David Cameron who had held the PM post since 2010.
Alexander is understood to have been recommended for the AIIB job by former UK finance secretary George Osborne, a conservative and his senior at the UK Treasury, before Osborne was sacked by Mrs May in July 2016. Osborne is now editor of London's main evening newspaper.
UK sells Green Investment Bank
The UK government said April 20 it is to sell the state-owned Green Investment Bank to Australia's Macquarie Group for £2.3bn ($2.95bn). The green bank was a project called for by the LibDems, under their 2010 coalition agreement with the Conservatives. The government said the sale would "secure a profit on the government’s investment in the bank, provide value for taxpayers and ensure GIB continues its green mission in the private sector." Green Party member of parliament Caroline Lucas tweeted that the divestment was "a kick in the teeth for green economy."
The £2.3bn is made up of £1.7bn proceeds from the sale, with a further £0.6bn of GIB’s outstanding commitments that will be met by Macquarie and its partners rather than by taxpayers.

With the new World Touring Car Championship kicking off at Monza this weekend, Peter Mills runs the rule over the field and tries to work out who will provide the biggest threat to champion Yvan Muller
This weekend Monza plays host to the opening round of the 2012 World Touring Car Championship, with a healthy crop of rookies joining the established tin-top veterans in what looks set to be a year in which the category rejuvinates itself.
Yvan Muller starts as favourite to win a fourth title and with it break the record he currently shares with Andy Priaulx, but his Chevrolet team-mates Rob Huff and Alain Menu won't give him an easy ride. Nor, for that matter, will the likes of Gabriele Tarquini, especially as the 2009 title winner now has extra SEAT resources behindNational NETwork Against Malaria and Weill Cornell Medical School Chapter
2nd Annual Art Contest
Theme: Bed Nets Save Lives…by promoting education
DEAR TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS:
NETwork Against Malaria is a national non-profit organization that raises money to purchase malaria bed nets for impoverished Ugandan families. NETwork 1) purchases and distributes malaria bed nets to Ugandan families, and 2) educates and empowers American children about how to participate in life saving efforts to eliminate malaria.
To facilitate learning about mosquito nets and the people who need and use them, NETwork Against Malaria has established an art contest. By creating artwork that nutures understanding of serving others with malaria, NETwork aims to help students develop an appreciation of other cultures, increases awareness of the problems others face, fosters the growth of the global community, and teaches children how they can make a global impact.
This year’s theme: Bed Nets Save Lives…by promoting education
The average Ugandan child misses 60 days of school each year because they are sick with malaria. If the child survives, he or she falls behind in class, and may even drop out of school. In Africa, without an education, children will live their lives in poverty. Bed nets not only promote education, they also FIGHT POVERTY. The annual economic loss in Africa due to malaria is 12 Billion dollars. Poor African families spend about ¼ of their meager income on malaria treatment and hospitalization. As parents miss work with illness or to care for sick family members, they sink deeper into poverty. Bed nets protect children’s health so they can to attend school. Malaria is the number one cause of sickness and death, infant mortality, and underweight and premature births. Malaria causes stunted growth, childhood anemia, and mental retardation, BUT bed nets prevent malaria and promote good health.
Contests Rules for participating children:
1. Create an original piece of art using the theme: Bed Nets Save Lives…by promoting Education. The theme should appear on the front of the work. Art should reflect the theme.
2. Use 8.5 x 11 inch paper (for both mailed and emailed artwork).
3. Make your poster colorful. Use markers, colored pencils, crayons, paint. (Do not use glitter or glue.)
4. Original art only. Please no stencils or coloring book pages.
5. Please label the artwork: For mailed entries: student’s name, school, teacher, grade must be written on the back of the paper.
For emailed entries: The art should be scanned or photographed. Student’s name, school, teacher, grade must be included in the name of the file in the format: FirstNameLastName.School.Teacher.Gr(grade number) (e.g. JaneDoe.WeillCornell.MrsDoe.Gr8). Please submit files in .GIF, .JPEG, or .PDF format.
6. Prizes will be awarded to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and honorable mention winners in each division.
7. The divisions are as follows: grades K-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-8,
Winners will receive a certificate and a goodie bag with a NETwork Against Malaria T-shirt.
Teachers/educators of winning participants will also receive a NETwork necklace made with fair trade Ugandan beads or T-shirt.
Please mail and postmark submissions by March 30th or email by 11:59pm March 30th.

Well I’m using Subversion for managing various websites and it works pretty well, I’m happy with it. I’m not doing anything that needs distributed developers or branches, though, so I don’t need any of those features that Arch, et. al or git supplies.
I’ve used CVS for years, and had great results – very resilient version control, including all sorts of insane branching for reasons imposed by others.
I’ve managed to persuade my new company to use Subversion, and it seems to be going just as well, although I’m not involved in the projects that are using it. (I didn’t like VSS and PVCS before, and now that I have to use them, I know they’re terrible!!)
And I can’t recommend TortoiseCVS & TortoiseSVN highly enough! On Windows, they make CVS & SVN an absolute pleasure to use.
Fortunately virtually everything I use at home or at work is Linux, so I’ve never had the pleasure of meeting VSS or PVCS yet. 🙂Bledsoe still unsigned but still in Suns’ plans
Suns GM Ryan McDonough maintains Eric Bledsoe will wear a Suns uniform next season.
The Suns have maintained roster and financial flexibility to make a major transaction. But the next big move figures to involve Eric Bledsoe, their restricted free-agent point guard.
With no offer sheets from other teams thus far moving Bledsoe to sign, the Suns have avoided bidding against themselves.
When questioned about Bledsoe’s status in an interview during Tuesday’s NBATV telecast of the Suns’ summer league game from Las Vegas, Suns general manager Ryan McDonough said keeping the budding star continues to be the plan.
Since last week’s signing of free-agent point guard Isaiah Thomas, assumption by peripheral media outlets now considers Bledsoe — or even Goran Dragic — expendable.
"Eric’s a big part of this team," McDonough said. "We feel like the strength of our team is in the backcourt and we feel like we’ve added to that and made it an even greater strength with the signing of Isaiah Thomas.
"We’ve created a system where we have multiple ball handlers who can run pick and roll, create a lot of shots, score efficiently and create shots for others. Our top priority is to bring Eric back, keep him in a Suns uniform and build on last year."

Looking for a perfect plus size vacations package? Most vacation planning companies, tour guides, travel agents, booking agencies, and travel advisers send you to exotic locations that feature beaches, bikini-clad beauties, and other ego-ruining factors that make a plus size person feel out of place. Instead of choosing a great beach, where you feel like you have to wear that dreaded bathing suit, consider somewhere different. Places like Ireland offer so much to travelers, and enjoying your vacation is the key, not going somewhere that everyone goes.
Depending on why you are going, Ireland has something for everyone, from party havens, to historic monuments, to interesting sites, and much more. Most require no bathing suit, so you don’t have to worry about feeling uncomfortable in your own skin when on a plus size vacations trip. In addition, you will have new and interesting stories to tell about your spring break, aside from everyone’s cruise and beach story. This way, you can be different, but still have a great time.
There are dozens of famous historic sites here, including castles, villages, ancient libraries, and breathtaking scenery. If those aren’t enough for you, consider fun and interesting sites like the Blarney Stone, especially if you want an instant imaginary boost to your speaking abilities. The “gift o’ the gab” is a great reason to visit the beautiful and imposing castle, and the world-famous rock on top is just icing on the cake.
Parts of Ireland are also party central, and the Irish are known all over the world for their partying capacity. From interesting and unique alcohol flavors to party-friendly atmospheres, spring break is just another reason to get together for this vacation haven. Here, you can be yourself, and no one will be bothered if you do not bring your bikini. The only thing to remember is that Ireland does have very strict drinking and driving laws, so you will want to keep a designated driver or the number of a local taxi service handy when you plan to drink.
Keep in mind that, like most overseas destinations, you will need a passport to travel to Ireland. Do this early to avoid problems, and consider registering with the United States Embassy for safety’s sake (regardless of where you decide to go). They can point you in the right direction for places to stay, and give you a lot of helpful information about the area in general, including any relevant or pertinent safety tips. On average, the crime rate in Ireland is mostly restricted to typical petty crimes toward tourists, such as purse snatching, so being careful is the key to any good vacation.
Unlike the crime rate in destinations like Mexico,Ireland has very few problems with terrorists, drug lords, cartels, or similar problems these days. The abduction rate in Mexico increases every year, but it still remains a very popular tourist destination. You have enough to worry about with deciding what to wear when you travel, weight limits/restrictions on your means of transportation, and comfortable traveling accommodations. Adding worry about kidnapping or terrorism ruins the relaxation of any vacation, regardless of how much “fun” is available overall.
Being plus sized should never mean that you cannot go where you want to go. However, people can be cruel, and what fun is a vacation where you feel out of place amongst even friends? Choosing somewhere neutral is a great way to enjoy time away from home and/or work, and locations that offer fun for everyone are the best neutral locations. Ireland has so much to offer anyone who visits, regardless of weight, so consider somewhere that is interesting—and different—for your next vacation, spring break blowout, or honeymoon destination. Start enjoying your perfect plus size vacations from now on.by Sara Golling on Wednesday Mar 08 2017
In my. Overall, it seems to this resident and observer that Rosslanders have little to complain about with regard to our local governance these days.
Provincially and federally I see much more fuel for complaint. Make that outrage.
Why do non-profit societies have to sue these levels of government in attempts to obtain court orders forcing them to govern according to the laws of the land when those laws are aimed at protecting human health, or wildlife, or wild fisheries, or the already-established rights of First Nations? Why do our governments seem to think that short-term economic "growth" of the sort that results from acquiescing to the demands of industrial interests such as the fossil fuel industry, the mineral exploration and extraction industry and the salmon-farming industry, to name only three of the better-known from a long list of them, is of greater value to our province or our nation than safeguarding everyone's health and longer-term economic interests?
In 2015, a non-profit public-interest organization called Ecojustice sued Canada's federal government over the Department of Fisheries and Oceans' (DFO) negligent conduct in allowing fish farm companies to place fish carrying infectious disease into open-net fish-farm pens situated along the migration routes of wild salmon. Ecojustice won the case in Federal Court.
The real shocker? DFO joined with the fish-farm company (Marine Harvest) in appealing the Federal Court decision. The unavoidable message: DFO is on the side of a foreign-owned company and puts its interests ahead of the health and viability of BC's wild salmon populations and all who depend on them. What is wrong with this picture?
In April of 2016, the appeal was withdrawn, but only after more evidence came to light about diseased fish in salmon farms. That the appeal was dropped is a piece of good news for BC's wild ocean fisheries.
But wait -- don't rejoice too quickly: DFO is still refusing to test farmed salmon for the virus associated with a disease deadly to wild fish before allowing them to be placed into those open-net pens on wild salmon migration routes. So a new lawsuit is in the works, again thanks to a public-interest non-profit.
Why should it be so hard to protect the health of such a valuable resource as wild salmon? Why should it be up to individual donors to fund lawsuits to force the government to act in the public interest? Or, why is the government's concept of "the public interest" so divorced from the long-term ecological health necessary to keep our economy going?
As for our provincial government, consider its gung-ho barging ahead regardless with Site C, over the protests of First Nations whose treaty rights are being ignored, and over the protests of the Regional District in which the dam is being located, and over the protests of local landowners, not to mention the findings of the joint federal-provincial review panel tasked with assessing the project. The joint review panel found that there was no need for the dam or the energy it is intended to produce. That finding has been ignored by both the BC government and the federal government; both have issued permits for it to proceed, and the work is going ahead. Whose interests will the project serve?
The chair of the joint review panel, Harry Swain, spoke about Site C to DeSmog Canada in a video on the project. To view it, click this link.
"I think we're making a big mistake, a very expensive one," Swain says in the video. “Of the nine billion dollars it will cost, at least seven billion will never be returned. You and I as rate payers will end up paying seven billion bucks for something we get nothing for.”
“There is no need for Site C,” Swain said. “If there was a need, we could meet it with a variety of other renewable and smaller scale sources.”
The mining industry has long been favoured in BC over the public interest in clean drinking water, healthy fresh-water fish habitat, wildlife, forestry, or private property rights. A recent report was released by the University of Victoria's Environmental Law Centre, commissioned by the Fair Mining Collaborative, a non-profit that helps First Nations assess mining activities and proposals. A letter to Premier Christy Clarke accompanying the report calls for a "Commission of Public Inquiry to investigate and report on the Province’s regulation of the mining industry, and to make recommendations to rectify and improve BC mining regulation." Both the letter and the report can be found here.
The letter states that "the provincial mine regulatory system is in a state of profound dysfunction. A series of major systemic failures demonstrate the need for wide-ranging reform. The systemic failures include:
• The Mount Polley Mine disaster;
• The Auditor General’s devastating critique of provincial enforcement of mining laws;
• The recent official confirmation that taxpayers may be liable to pay more than a billion dollars for mine cleanups;
• The discovery that Government failed to inspect a closed Jordan River mine for over 20 years, allowing the undetected destruction of a salmon river;
• Recent studies that document how BC’s rules for environmental assessment fall far short of global best practices;
• New research showing that BC’s placer mining rules endanger provincial rivers and streams; and
• Growing discontent with the 19th century Gold Rush law that still authorizes prospectors to stake mining claims on private land, First Nations land and environmentally sensitive areas."
Further to the Mt. Polley disaster, a non-profit called MiningWatch Canada has initiated a lawsuit against the mining company and the provincial government. "We are all concerned that, almost 30 months later, despite clear evidence of impacts on waters, fish and fish habitat, no sanctions and no penalties have been brought forwards by any level of government,” explained the non-profit's co-ordinator, Ugo Lapointe. But now the federal government is seeking to have the charges stayed. That means the charges could just quietly go away -- never be pursued. Whose interests would a stay of proceedings serve best?
Mining is a necessary sector of the global economy, but just how sloppy and destructive should it be in its effects on other resources such as fish and fish habitat, and fresh water for drinking? And who should be responsible for ensuring compliance with even the minimal regulation on our statute books? Arguably, the enforcement burden for protecting common resources and public health should not fall on private citizens or non-profit organizations.
Last year, the Peabody Coal Company lost a court case on the social cost of carbon; it posed all the usual laughable climate-change-denier arguments (inter alia, "the climate is not actually warming, but cooling; if it's warming, it's not warming because of human activity -- the sun is entirely responsible; higher levels of CO2 are healthy and promote growth; climate change is benign") and it was quite satisfying to read the court's weighing of the "evidence" they presented as contrasted with the overwhelming real evidence presented by the state of Minnesota which was defending the social cost it had set for carbon.
A new article in the Guardian details how the courts in many countries are being called upon by citizens and NGOs to enforce environmental protection. In South Africa, the government lost a case challenging its planned new coal-fired plant, which would have produced significant CO2 emissions. In Austria, a federal court blocked a planned airport expansion in Vienna, because it would have resulted in an increase in CO2 emissions. In Holland, a landmark climate change case resulted in a court order that the government take steps to reduce CO2 emissions. In Pakistan, a farmer argued successfully in court that his rights to life and dignity were threatened by his government's inadequate climate change policies.
We can celebrate the fact that these courts' findings support human rights to a healthy environment -- or at least, our right to keep it from being damaged too much faster. But these courts' findings ought to be unnecessary, because our governments ought to be proactively taking steps to enforce environmental laws, to mitigate climate change, to protect wild fish populations and other wildlife, to protect the quality of fresh-water resources, to protect agricultural land, and to stop subsidizing what threatens those things. Our governments ought to be acting in the best long-term interests of all our citizens, not just the owners and management of corporations.
So why, in do many instances, is that not happening? Might it have anything at all to do with the lobbying and associated very large political donations made by industrial/corporate interests? Really, can't we call the system allowing this what it is -- corrupt? And having recognized the corruption, can we please get rid of it? Some of our legislation seems to require major surgery. And a lot of stitching up.Just after his recent Olympic silver medal win at Rio, Polish discus thrower Piotr Malachowski sold his silver medal to give a three-year-old boy the gift of life-saving cancer treatment.
To help little Poland-based Olek Szymanski afford his cancer treatment, Malachowski put his medal up for auction. Because of Malachowski, young Olek can now travel to New York City to be treated for a rare form of eye cancer called retinoblastoma. It was a decision that Malachowski has no regrets about:
“My silver medal is worth a lot more than a week ago. It is worth the health of little Olek.”
The two-time Olympic winner had put his medal up for auction at first hoping to raise $84,000. On his Facebook page, Malachowski called on his friends, colleagues and family to help him auction off his medal. He wrote:
“In Rio I fought for gold. Today I call on all people — let us fight together for something that is even more valuable. For the health of this fantastic boy.”
It wasn’t long before Malachowski pulled the auction down, even though it had only raised $19,000 at the time of closing. Over Facebook, he announced that he’d closed the auction three days early because billionaires Dominika and Sebastian Kulczyk “declared their willingness to buy my silver medal for an amount which enables us to meet the goal set.” Olek’s treatment carried the hefty price tag of $126,000, and thanks to Malachowski and the Kulczyks, it has all been covered.
❤️❤️❤️❤ Piotr Malachowski

Malachowski gave up one of his greatest accomplishments – his silver medal – to help a child in need. As the post-Olympics news has been dominated by the shameful actions of swimmer Ryan Lochte, it’s amazing to see Olympians like Malachowski show everyone what true selflessness and kindness looks like. We look forward to hearing how little Olek heals and progresses through treatment.

May 13, 2013, 9:58 AM EDT
Major League Soccer longest home unbeaten streak is over. Sporting Kansas City’s gritty 1-0 win late Sunday over Houston snaps the Dynamo’s league record home unbeaten streak at 36 games across all competitions.
Sporting KC is the first team to win in Houston in almost two years (since June 18, 2011).
Dynamo president Chris Canetti obviously was not thrilled, but took the night in stride. Via Twitter he said: “The streak is something to be proud of. Had to end sometime. Tribute to players and fan support that we set the MLS record.”
And: “Not used to driving home unhappy. It was only our 18th regular season home loss in 116 home games. We are 65-18-33 all-time at home.”
Houston veteran center back Bobby Boswell tried to add some perspective, suggesting that the streak was always something the rest of us talked about, but that the players inside BBVA Compass Stadium’s locker room attempted not to focus on.
I’ve said this since you guys started talking about the streak. It gives teams that come in here more motivation, it gives them a reason … Have you ever seen a team win a game and have a huddle after the game? And go run around screaming in the tunnel after a game? I haven’t.
They obviously feel like they’ve accomplished something great. Credit to them for getting the result, but that’s not going to break us a team.

Sucks to break the streak. Sucks that Crying KC was the one to do it. Sucks that it was that French dope with the winner.

Each year, I find myself coming to the topic of simplifying the holidays. Don’t we just all wish this time of year was a little easier? Despite my best efforts to simplify, it can feel impossible in the midst of the kid’s holiday programs, get togethers, shopping, wrapping, sending of cards, gift-giving, & holiday baking.
I don’t want to brag, but this year we really did achieve that simple holiday we have been longing for and I am partnering with Ritz to share how you can avoid the parade of endless holiday to-do’s and instead embrace a simpler holiday.
Simplify the Giving of Holiday Cards
I love, love, love having pictures that I am in and having someone else take them for me, but we lost track of time and weren’t able to book our usual family session. Instead of not sending cards, I set my camera up on a tripod and we took our family shot by setting the timer on our camera and having me jump into the family picture. By getting everything set up in advance before my family came outside, we were able to get our picture in a mere five minutes. Before everyone had their coats off, I had our photos edited and cards in the mail. The best part is that we have moved our family session to the Spring, a time of year we decided was much less chaotic, and will really enjoy it all a little bit more.
I will admit that I was also was more laid back about how we did our cards this year and enlisted one of my favorite helpers to assist me in this year’s mailing. Not only was she excellent at adding our stamps and sealing the envelopes, but she also kept me on track because she was waiting for me to get those addresses on so she could do her part with them. It gave us time to chat while we were doing them and ended up being fun instead of a holiday chore this year.
Simplify the Holiday Baking
This year we decided to skip the big baking day and make easy treats instead. Although I usually love holiday baking, this year I focused more on creating knitted gifts than my typical holiday treat box. Fortunately, we found a fun holiday treat that we could make that didn’t require a bit of baking, but was just as delicious. On the Ritz Holiday Parade site, we found an easy recipe for Mint Thins to create together that tasted just like one of our favorite cookie treats, but were made with Ritz Crackers, chocolate, and crushed candy canes.
It just goes to show that making holiday treats doesn’t have to be an elaborate baking day. My kids loved helping to crush (and eat!) the candy canes for our cookies and we enjoyed eating these while watching, “A Christmas Story,” this year. Yet another simple and easy tradition is born!
Simplify the Gift Giving
I often talk about our commitment to do the Four Gift Rule, but this year we took it a step further and asked the kids if they would like to skip the presents and just take a family adventure together. We gave them lots of options for places we could take a mini-vacation to and they chose a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan for our holiday getaway. We are so excited to take in all of the museums, holiday lights, ice skating, and see the sites of the city.
If your kids are struggling to come up with gifts this year or your home is overrun with just too much stuff, consider creating your very own, “Choose Your Own Adventure,” vacation in lieu of gifts. Not only did I have a lot less to buy this year, but I also get to spend four days with my family making incredible memories that I hope they will remember forever.
Start planning and dreaming ahead for next year though because those vacation rentals do go quickly!
Focus On the Fun
Ritz wants to bring back the fun for the holidays and this year they have created a fun interactive Ritz Parade where you can visit the site and build your very own float. You can add up to twelve items on your float from toys, characters, celebrations, and banners. The pieces can be scaled to your desired size and placed anywhere on your float. Once it is complete, you can share your holiday float with others. It’s a fun little interactive tool that you can use to keep the kids busy while you are putting those last minute touches on those holiday festivities. Since we adopted a cat this year, we loved making a float of her for our holiday parade. I am sure this illustrates just how special she has become to all of us!
In addition, the Ritz parade allows consumers to unlock deals to help decrease the stress of gift buying! You can check out all the deals here!
Happy Holidays, friends!

The girl who was training me introduced me to one of the moms who was "graduating." She encouraged the mom to tell me a story about her daughter. Her daughter had a difficult time separating and so it was hard to get her to go to school. One of our local family court judges had recently been sending mothers of truant children to jail in an effort to get them to take it seriously. Our mom took it very seriously and tried everything from hand delivering her to the front door (and she ran out the back door and walked home) to dragging her to car to drive her to school (the neighbors called the cops and said some lady was trying to kidnap a girl). In frustration, the mom parked outside the local jail and told her daughter, "there are some bad people in there...people who rape and murder. They want to put me in there because you won't go to school." They both sobbed and finally the girl looked at her mother and said, tearfully, "I'll miss you..."'
I was a kid, what did I know...I laughed. I tell you this, on a week, years later, that at least one of my children has been hand delivered to the school and then walked out the back or, when I told another if they missed one more day of school the truant officer was going to put me in jail and been told, "I'll take care of the kids..." Karma.
In my defense, I am separated by several generations from many of my kids...its been many decades since I was one of them and I am not quite as up on the lingo or the culture. Still, I was feeling pretty good when my kids started referring to me as cool. It wasn't until earlier this week that one clued me in that cool stands for "constipated overweight old lady." Sigh...So on this, the eve of Mother's Day Weekend (we moms of 11 children have to take the whole weekend) I remind myself of the night that I closed myself in the basement and sobbed and yelled at God for not giving me a child and how He proceeded to Bless me abundantly. I am the mother of 11 amazingly wonderful individual treasures. While it isn't always easy, it is my life, and I love it. These moments will pass all too quickly and then I may no longer be a nerd (never-ending radical dude ;0)
11 adopted kids, lots of pets, two tired parents, organizing it all while cooking green and discussing the Sunday Mass...drop in!!!

ding dong the witch is dead
Wow, what a difference a day makes. Last week we were all crying about the government and our military guys and gals were justifiably upset because their paychecks were not going to arrive on time or at all. Today everyone is waving the flag and singing God Bless America! How convenient that, on a week when our military casualties were especially high, an almost 10 year operation to find that madman was completed. And why are we, as a country, compelled to give him so much air time. Hasn't he already taken enough from us. We don't need him or news of him to spur us on to remain vigilant; we have forever lost that sense of safety. We don't need him to justify keeping our boys overseas; we have other madmen to hunt. We're still busy. I'm glad there is some tiny bit of closure for Sept. 11, 2001. Yeah, I'm glad they found him but have to think it was just one item on a very long punch list. And I just can't find it in me to find joy in the death of any man who doesn't know the Way ...

Cauliflower curry, brown rice and mint tea in Leon, while catching up with two good friends. The weekend felt like more of a halfway mark though, and on Saturday night we treated ourselves and ate meal number 42 at Manna in Primrose Hill – a fantastic vegan restaurant I have been visiting since it was merely vegetarian. I highly recommend the cashew cheese croquettes, and the vice-cream and cookie pudding my partner had looked amazing. Just like Manna, I think I have converted to veganism for good now.
Eating out is going very well so far – on Tuesday night, meal number 30 was the vegan ramen at Shoryu in Soho.
Meal number 39 was experimental, by many standards: I BBQ-sauced the tin of jackfruit I bought at Vegan Life Live last week.
God knows what pulled pork is meant to taste like. This tasted mostly like BBQ sauce to be fair, but it was tasty. And I ate it with the last of the cashew-tahini dressing that I made to drizzle on Buddha bowls the night before (meal number 36). Neat!
For most of the meals in between, may I refer you to the image at the top of the post? Still addicted.
Vegan meal number 54 should be pretty special too – there’s a cocktail bar in east London called Pamela. Which is the best name. And it has just brought in an entirely vegan menu courtesy of Club Mexicana. So we are heading there tomorrow night with veggie/vegan pals to sample its wares. And I’ll be celebrating, cos I am so pleased I made this change. I feel better physically, and my conscience is lighter too. It’s just a small change to make, but if enough of us do it, it will make a big difference.
And in case I ever were to waver, I have been collecting some alternative Veganuary motivation to keep me on track.
- Vegan chocolate – so good.
- Despite the above, I’ve lost a few pounds, all of which needed shifting, and there are more where they came from.
- Watching footage of 19th-century livestock auctions as part of my job.
- Watching vegan documentaries on Netflix in my lunchbreak. Yikes.
- I’ve booked a trip to the US and I want to save some pennies to offset the cost.
- I’ve booked a trip to the US and I want to reduce my carbon footprint to offset the cost to the environment.
- You can’t really argue with this statistic. For those of us who have a choice, eating meat really is unsustainable. And with meat, goes everything else …

Pelosi elevates two on Dem steering committee
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has elevated two sophomores on the influential Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.
The California Democrat has promoted Rep. Eric Swalwell, also of California, to vice chair of the panel and added Michigan Rep. Dan Kildee to the leadership committee.
Story Continued Below
Members of the Democratic Steering Committee often are considered de facto members of senior leadership within the House ranks. The panel helps pick who serves on House committees.
“The steering committee embodies the energy, drive, diversity and strategic vision of all House Democrats," Pelosi said.
The panel also helps House Democrats push their agenda while in the minority. The steering committee is hosting a hearing next week on the Flint, Michigan water crisis, and the state's Republican Gov. Rick Snyder has been asked to give testimony.
Swalwell has focused on millennial engagement during his tenure in Congress. He launched the Future Forum, a group of more newly elected lawmakers as a method to reach out to younger voters.
Kildee voiced early warnings on the water crisis in Flint, which falls in his district. He also was a leading voice during the hostage negotiations between the U.S. and Iran, given that one of his constituents was held in a jail in Tehran.compete

Nature of Proceedings: Req. for Order Child Support; Req. for Order: Child Custody/Visitation
Two Requests for Order: Child Support; Child Custody; Visitation
Attorneys
Tracey Cruz, counsel for Petitioner;
Matt Moore counsel for Respondent.
Rulings:
At the outset, the Court found the documentation submitted very extensive and at times contradictory and inconsistent; thus the Court has set out a substantial summary of the respective positions taken by the parties.
1. Custody evaluator’s retainer. Mother’s request that the Court order each of them to advance $6,000 to Dr. Iverson, subject to reallocation at trial, is GRANTED. The sum shall be paid no later than February 9, 2018.
2. Scope of evaluation. Father’s request that the Court order the scope of the evaluation be expanded to include his request to move with the child to San Diego is GRANTED.
3. Child support. Child support is $1,258/mo effective August 1, 2017, with father to receive credit for any sums of money actually paid; there are no offsets of any kind authorized at this time; father’s request for travel expenses to be offset is denied without prejudice; he may renew it at trial. See the “Court’s Conclusions” below for more analysis.
4. Spousal Support. The Court acknowledges mother’s RFO re spousal support is set for 2/13/18; the Court has no present opinion about that issue.
5. Case Management Conference. This case was filed in 3/2017; it was a 5 year 4 month marriage with one child; the date of separation was 1/2017. There are experienced lawyers on this case. The Court has read the very extensive documentation about the underlying issues and has only been asked to make temporary decisions about the issues. Final decisions will obviously be delayed by the time it will take to perform the 3111 evaluation. The Court wants to maintain a close overview of that timing. Thus, another Case Management Conference is set for 2/13/18 to monitor the prompt payment by both parties of the Evaluator’s retainer.
Analysis
Mother’s RFO
Filed on 7/12/17; it is 59 pages long; the Court has read it all but summarizes here; she requested that many issues be resolved; one of them was her request that the cost of the 3111 evaluation be divided equally; there is a $12,000 retainer needed; her extensive RFO, that included significant issues, was set for hearing on 7/25/17.
Father’s Response to Mother’s RFO
He filed his response on 7/17/18; it was 42 pages long and the Court will only summarize; the vast portion of the response related to issues other than the retainer; the other issues were resolved without Court intervention; as for the cost of the evaluation, father did say that he hopes they can figure out a way to pay for a custody evaluation; he is confident that it will help them make the decision that is in their child’s best interest; until then, he asked that the Court reinstate his visitation time of three full days and three overnights per week.
Father’s RFO to set Temporary Child Support
It was filed 7/24/17; is 29 pages long; the Court summarizes; he testifies that he has been paying informal child support since separation, but the uncertainty about his child support obligation is a major source of friction between mother and father; resolution will help them to co-parent cooperatively; mother has made it abundantly clear that her wealthy family is supporting her lifestyle; mother believes he should be paying more than he is; but he is providing as much financial support as he can; does not have more money to give her; had to borrow nearly $10,000 over the past six months, and the business has borrowed about $90,000 in the past nine months to stay afloat; financial situation will turn around; will be able to provide more for Charlotte; but for now, he asks the Court to set child support based on their actual current financial circumstances; requests that the Court order Guideline child support as set forth in his attached Declaration under Local Rule 1418.
Father’s suggested DissoMaster assigned mother income of $3,548/mo and child support suggested was $697/mo; there was no request for an offset for travel expenses.
Minute Order of 7/25/17
The Court’s minute order of 7/25/17, when mother’s RFO was to come on, reflects that counsel appeared and said the parties signed a stipulation resolving all issues; subsequently counsel signed a stipulation that said the hearing currently set for August 15, 2017, remains on the Court’s calendar; mother and father agree that the stipulation temporarily resolves the custody and timeshare issues pending Dr. Iverson’s evaluation; the only remaining issue that the Court will decide at the August 15, 2017, hearing, is the allocation of the evaluation fees between mother and father.
Stipulation filed 8/5/17
The parties signed and filed a stipulation that said father’s RFO re Child Support, as well as mother’s RFO re the cost of the Custody Evaluation, both currently scheduled for August 15, 2017, may be continued to September 12, 2017. The hearing was subsequently continued again to 10/3 and then again to 12/12 (parties further agreed that until permanent support is ordered, either through agreement of the parties or order of the Court, father shall pay temporary child support directly to mother; father will receive credit for any sums paid to mother directly in accordance with the agreement) and then continued to 1/9/18.
Mediation Report
A mediation report was filed on 9/12; mediation was incomplete. The parties needed time to consider each other's proposals.
Father’s Supplemental Declaration
Filed 12/14/17; father testifies that he filed a RFO to establish child support on July 24, 2017; it was continued numerous times while they attempted to resolve the matter informally; have not been able to do so; a few things have changed since July 24; he is now filing an updated Income and Expense Declaration; will file an updated DissoMaster Calculation after mother produces a current Income and Expense Declaration; will provide the Court with the most current information from which to make a child support order; he is seeking, as additional affirmative relief, a child support add-on to offset his extraordinarily high visitation expenses; makes this request 16 court days before the hearing to permit mother the statutory period in which to respond to the request.
Father testifies that since May, at mother’s insistence, he has exercised visitation in Santa Barbara instead of at his own home in San Diego; mother and he agreed to a custody evaluation and both understood that the location of visits would be taken up by the custody evaluator, so he believed the financial strain of renting a room in Santa Barbara would be temporary; despite his pleas, mother refuses to allow him to conduct visitation in San Diego; she has not provided any cogent reason why he should not exercise visits there; he rents an additional room in Santa Barbara for the exclusive purpose of exercising visitation here; drives up from San Diego on Sunday mornings, exercises visitation from Sunday morning through Wednesday evening, and returns to San Diego Wednesday evening; must be in San Diego at least three working days per week (Thursday-Saturday) to keep business profitable; cost of this visitation arrangement is high; gas expenses alone are $3,632 per month; room he rents for visitation purposes is $850 per month; it will go up in January; since July 2017, he has paid out an average of $1,213 per month in visitation costs.
Father testifies that the financial strain could be resolved by allowing visits to occur in San Diego and having mother and himself share transportation; mother won’t have it; this concern is better addressed in upcoming custody evaluation; he needs some financial relief; mother’s parents are propping her up in Santa Barbara; she was working at $20 per hour back in July, but he does not know if she is working now; was not financially realistic for them to live in Santa Barbara during marriage; is even less realistic now.
The question of whether to move Charlotte to Australia, as mother requests, or to San Diego, as he requests, is not before the Court now; will call on a custody evaluator for a recommendation on that point; evaluator will likely help resolve the location of visits; so long as mother refuses to allow him to conduct visits in San Diego, she should share the financial burden of conducting them in Santa Barbara; asks the Court to order an offset of one half of visitation-expenses from the child support.
Father’s Response to Mother’s RFO on the Issue of the Retainer
Filed 12/26/17; the document is 29 pages long; the Court can only summarize; father testifies that mother requested a custody evaluation to determine the child's best interest with regard to her proposed move to Australia; they agreed to an evaluation but he requests that the scope of the evaluation be expanded to include his request to move the child to San Diego; also requests that mother advance the cost of the evaluation subject to allocation at trial.
Father testifies that they are currently exercising joint physical custody by stipulation whereby the child spends most of the day Sunday through Wednesday, and two overnights, in his care; mother proposed a stipulated custody evaluation in June and he responded that he embraced the idea, but could not afford to pay for an evaluation; still cannot; believes mother can; until recently, mother has claimed to possess a massive $250,000 war chest of her parent’s money in order to litigate these proceedings; her nonchalance in communications with him about returning to Court for resolution indicate that she is not wanting for litigation resources; on the other hand, he does not have a pot of cash from which to pay attorneys’ fees; his attorney agreed to represent him for a reduced rate under the Santa Barbara County Bar Association’s Modest Means program; lawyer recently advised him that he no longer qualifies for modest means representation, and that his hourly rate will increase to his customary rate of $330 on January 1; will make it exceedingly difficult for father to maintain representation in these proceedings, especially if he is required to pay Dr. Iverson on top of his own legal fees; he asks that the Court order mother to advance the evaluator’s fees subject to apportionment at trial.
Father testifies that he trusts that the custody evaluator will make a thoughtful determination about Charlotte’s care going forward and he understands that the process, though expensive, could save attorneys’ fees for both of them; he agrees that he should contribute to the cost to the extent he is able; asks the Court to order mother to advance the cost of the evaluation subject to allocation at the time of trial.
Gary Gray’s [mother’s forensic accountant] Declaration
Filed 12/27/17; he opines father’s has between $6,515 and $6,739 per month in cash available for support.
Father’s I&E
Filed 12/14/17; estimates mother’s income earning ability to be $5,440/mo; as to his income, over the last 12 months, average wages $1,935/mo; $350/mo informal income; $2,016/mo self-employment income/mo; informal and formal loans from business and his brother to cover his expenses and his attorneys’ fees; $345 health insurance premiums; $195 cash and all other assets a negative $95,000 debt; living expenses $2,438/mo; modest installment debt listed; paid his attorney $11,440 and owes less than $1,000; he does not cover Charlotte on medical insurance policy [mother has made other arrangements]; travel expenses to exercise visitation listed at 1,513/mo.
Mother’s I&E
Filed 12/29/17; estimates father’s income at $7,200/mo; she has been unemployed since 10/14/16; $137 cash; all other assets have no tangible value; lives with mother who has income of $900/mo; living expenses $6,790/mo [$3,000/mo “paid by others”]; $13,000 in installment debt; paid her attorney $25,000; paid by a loan from her father; owes $9,000; father has time share with child from 10am on Sunday to 6pm on Monday and 8am on Tuesday to 6pm on Wednesday; reports that father was providing some support and rent money until July 2017, at which point he drastically reduced his financial assistance to her; until she has orders for support, her parents are providing her some assistance, and she is paying bills with credit cards.
DissoMaster calculations submitted
The DissoMasters submitted by the respective parties are identical except father takes $1,513 per month deduction as a “child support add on” [means mother’s child support is offset by $756/mo]; father’s requested child support order is $499/mo; mother’s requested child support order is $1,258/mo.
Mother’s Reply to Father’s Response on her RFO re: Dr. Iverson’s retainer
Filed on 1/2/18; testifies that she submitted a RFO for Child Custody and Visitation on July 12, 2017; asked for sole physical and legal custody of their daughter, Charlotte; asked for permission to move with Charlotte to her home country of Australia, subject to reasonable visitation with her father; requested a 3111 custody evaluation; asked for the costs of the evaluation to be shared equally between them, each to advance one-half of the evaluation expense; Dr. Iverson’s retainer is $12,000; asking the Court to order each of them to advance $6,000 to Dr. Iverson, subject to reallocation at trial.
Also testifies that at the same time she submitted her RFO, father brought an ex parte request for a custodial schedule; before either of respective hearings were heard, they arrived at an agreement as to every custody issue but one; agreement is contained in July 27, 2017, Order. There was only one issue that they could not agree on and which is before this Court: the question of how the evaluation costs to Dr Iverson should be apportioned.
Mother testifies that father is in a financially superior position; he is able to share the costs of the evaluation; he owns a painting company; company has not yet been forensically assessed; he claims to have borrowed $90,000 against the company in the past nine months; company has 43 employees and provides a steady income stream; the Declaration of Gary Gray, CPA, agrees with father’s December, 2017, financial information which indicate his total monthly income stream from the business is $6,739 per month; amount is suitably robust that it can be used to pay part of Dr. Iverson’s retainer.
Mother testifies she has been out of work since October 14, 2017, when her fulltime temporary position ended; since then she has looked for but has not yet found employment; she is not generating any income.
Father’s Reply to Mother’s Response to his RFO to Set Child support
Filed 1/2/18; he testifies that out of respect for the Court’s time, he is not submitting a separate Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Reply; reminds the Court that, in her opposition, mother proffered no authority to support a denial of his request to offset child support by the cost of visitation in Santa Barbara thereby conceding the request has legal merit; the decrease in his informal support to mother was the result of running out of money; it coincides precisely with his increase in visitation expenses, which is the main point at issue in this request; has been forthcoming with his business books and income from the outset of these proceedings; mother has a forensic accountant.
Father testifies that his business is a hands-on service business and it needs a strong sales and service manager to stay in the black; partner is good with logistics and operation, but he is not the strong sales leader the business needs; can do some of his work remotely, but most of his work requires his physical presence where the business is located in San Diego; visitation was eventually sorted out; mother and he agreed he would have Charlotte four days and two nights per week; renting a room in Santa Barbara not only reduced his lodging costs, it allowed him to prepare meals at home to further reduce costs; provided a stable and consistent environment for Charlotte; allowed him to get his visitation expenses down to about $282 per week ($1,213 per month).
He testifies that mother has yet to articulate a reason to stay with Charlotte in Santa Barbara while her best potential for employment is in Los Angeles and his home and work are in San Diego; recognizes that it is his duty to support his family; has a limited supply of income each month, and for so long as mother insists that visits occur in Santa Barbara, he is paying out over $1,500 per month in order to see his child; requests that the Court recognize this fact and order child support accordingly.
Court’s Conclusions
As for the payment of the retainer for Dr. Iverson’s services, it is clear that both parties are seeking a move-away decision in this case. That will result in a very important assignment for the evaluator, which will have a very consequential effect. Based upon the fact that each party will need to borrow money to fund the evaluation and the fact that each side has a material stake in the recommendation, it makes sense that each party pay one-half of the cost; subject to reallocation at trial. Additionally, that eliminates the possible claim that the evaluator “sided” with the party paying the bill.
As for the child support “offset” requested by father, the Court finds that father’s travel expenses appear overstated; there is no breakout of the particular costs; no accounting submitted; the Court concludes there is vastly insufficient evidence to provide an “offset” without more information. One question is whether father’s “home” is in San Diego or Santa Barbara. He appears to spend equal time in both locations. Additionally, there is a serious issue of whether father’s time-share could be better arranged to eliminate some of the major expense. The Court concludes that it needs to address the reason for the time-share agreement in place before making a decision as to whether mother must pay one-half of the very high travel expense. Father blames mother for the problem but the Court concludes that it has insufficient evidence on that point. The Court also notes that father’s election to request such an offset was only recently presented; he originally asked the Court to impute income to mother; then withdrew that election and instead seeks a travel expense offset; such an alternating approach, in addition to the other issues presented, leads the Court to conclude that the claim should be rejected, without prejudice, until trial when all the material facts are in hand.Effective Objective-C 2.0： Item 4: Prefer Typed Constants to Preprocessor #define
Item 4: Prefer Typed Constants to Preprocessor #define
When writing code, you will often want to define a constant. For example, consider a UI view class that presents and dismisses itself using animations. A typical constant that you’d likely want to factor out is the animation duration. You’ve learned all about Objective-C and its C foundations, and so you take the approach of defining the constant like this:
#define ANIMATION_DURATION 0.3
This is a preprocessor directive; whenever the string
ANIMATION_DURATION is
found in your source code, it is replaced with 0.3. This might seem exactly what you want, but this definition has no type information. It is likely that something declared as
a “duration” means that the value is related to time, but it’s not made explicit.Also, the preprocessor will blindly replace all occurrences of
ANIMATION_DURATION,
so if that were declared in a header file, anything else that imported that header would see the replacement done.
To solve these problems, you should make use of the compiler. There is always a better way to define a constant than
using a preprocessor define. For example, the following defines a constant of type
NSTimeInterval:
static const NSTimeInterval kAnimationDuration = 0.3;
Note that with this style, there is type information, which is beneficial because it clearly defines what the constant is. The
type is
NSTimeInterval,
and so it helps to document the use of that variable. If you have a lot of constants to define, this will certainly help you and other people who read the code later.
Also note how the constant is named. The usual convention for constants is to prefix with the letter k for constants that are local to a translation unit (implementation file). For constants that are exposed outside of a class, it is usual to prefix with the class name. Item 19 explains more about naming conventions.
It is important where you define your constants. Sometimes, it is tempting to declare preprocessor defines
in header files, but that is extremely bad practice, especially if the defines are not named in such a way that they won’t clash. For example, the
ANIMATION_DURATIONconstant
would be a bad name to appear in a header file. It would be present in all other files that imported the header. Even the
static const as it stands should not appear in a header
file. Since Objective-C has no namespaces, it would declare a global variable called
kAnimationDuration.
Its name should be prefixed with something that scopes it to the class it is to be used with, such as
EOCViewClassAnimationDuration. Item 19 explains more about using
a clear naming scheme.
A constant that does not need to be exposed to the outside world should be defined in the implementation file where
it is used. For example, if the animation duration constant were used in a
UIViewsubclass, for use in an iOS application that uses UIKit, it would look like this:
// EOCAnimatedView.h
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
@interface EOCAnimatedView : UIView
- (void)animate;
@end
// EOCAnimatedView.m
#import "EOCAnimatedView.h"
static const NSTimeInterval kAnimationDuration = 0.3;
@implementation EOCAnimatedView
- (void)animate {
[UIView animateWithDuration:kAnimationDuration
animations:^(){
// Perform animations
}];
}
@end
It is important that the variable is declared as both
static and
const. The
const qualifier
means that the compiler will throw an error if you try to alter the value. In this scenario, that’s exactly what is required. The value shouldn’t be allowed to change. The
staticqualifier
means that the variable is local to the translation unit in which it is defined. A translation unit is the input the compiler receives to generate one object file. In
the case of Objective-C, this usually means that there is one translation unit per class: every implementation (
.m) file. So in the preceding example,
kAnimationDuration will
be declared locally to the object file generated from
EOCAnimatedView.m. If the variable were not declared
static, the
compiler would create an external symbol for it. If another translation unit also declared a variable with the same name, the linker would throw an error with a message similar to this:
duplicate symbol _kAnimationDuration in:
EOCAnimatedView.o
EOCOtherView.o
In fact, when declaring the variable as both
static and
const, the
compiler doesn’t end up creating a symbol at all but instead replaces occurrences just like a preprocessor define does.
Remember, however, the benefit is that the type information is present.
Sometimes, you will want to expose a constant externally. For example, you might want to do this if your class will notify others using
NSNotificationCenter.
This works by one object posting notifications and others registering to receive them. Notifications have a string name, and this is what you might want to declare as an externally visible constant variable. Doing so means that anyone wanting to register to
receive such notifications does not need to know the actual string name but can simply use the constant variable.
Such constants need to appear in the global symbol table to be used from outside the translation unit in which they are defined. Therefore, these
constants need to be declared in a different way from the
static const example. These constants should be defined like so:
// In the header file
extern NSString *const EOCStringConstant;
// In the implementation file
NSString *const EOCStringConstant = @"VALUE";
The constant is “declared” in the header file and “defined” in the implementation file. In the constant’s type, the placement of the
const qualifier
is important. These definitions are read backward, meaning that in this case,
EOCStringConstant is a “constant pointer to an
NSString.”
This is what we want; the constant should not be allowed to change to point to a different
NSString object.
The
extern keyword in the header tells the compiler what to do when it encounters the constant being used in
a file that imports it. The keyword tells the compiler that there will be a symbol for
EOCStringConstant in the global symbol table.
This means that the constant can be used without the compiler’s being able to see the definition for it.
The compiler simply knows that the constant will exist when the binary is linked.
The constant has to be defined once and only once. It is usually defined in the implementation file that relates to the header file in which it is declared. The compiler will allocate storage for the string in the data section of the object file that is generated from this implementation file.
When this object file is linked with other object files to produce the final binary, the linker will be able to resolve the global symbol for
EOCStringConstant wherever
else it has been used.
The fact that the symbol appears in the global symbol table means that you should name such constants carefully. For example, a class that handles login for an application may have a notification that is fired after login has finished. The notification may look like this:
// EOCLoginManager.h
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
extern NSString *const EOCLoginManagerDidLoginNotification;
@interface EOCLoginManager : NSObject
- (void)login;

Note the name given to the constant. Prefixing with the class name that the constant relates to is prudent and will
help you avoid potential clashes. This is common throughout the system frameworks as well. UIKit, for example, declares notification names as global constants in the same way. The names include
UIApplicationDidEnterBackgroundNotification and
UIApplicationWillEnterForegroundNotification.
The same can be done with constants of other types. If the animation duration needed to be exposed outside of the
EOCAnimatedView class
in the preceding examples, you could declare it like so:
// EOCAnimatedView.h
extern const NSTimeInterval EOCAnimatedViewAnimationDuration;
// EOCAnimatedView.m
const NSTimeInterval EOCAnimatedViewAnimationDuration = 0.3;
Defining a constant in this way is much better than a preprocessor define because the compiler is used to ensure
that the value cannot change. Once defined in
EOCAnimatedView.m, that value is usedeverywhere. A
preprocessor define could be redefined by mistake, meaning that different parts of an application end up using different values.
In conclusion, avoid using preprocessor defines for constants. Instead, use constants that are seen by
the compiler, such as
static const globals declared in implementation files.
Things to Remember
Avoid preprocessor
defines. They don’t contain any type information and are simply a find and replace executed before compilation. They could be redefined without warning, yielding inconsistent values throughout an application.
Define translation-unit-specific
constants within an implementation file as
static const. These constants will not be exposed in the global symbol table, so their names do not need to be namespaced.
Define
global constants as external in a header file, and define them in the associated implementation file. These constants will appear in the global symbol table, so1 year ago 1

Cyndy Feasel lost her husband Grant in 2012 to cirrohsis of the liver due to alcoholism, which was connected to a degenerative brain disease called CTE. The CTE in turn was caused by a lifetime of receiving concussions from playing football.
(PODCAST INTERVIEW WITH CYNDY:)
Cyndy shares her story in a book by Nelson Books titled “After the Cheering Stops: An NFL Wife’s Story of Concussions, Loss, and the Faith That Saw Her Through.”
The couple, which had three children, divorced about a year before Grant’s death, ending 29 years of marriage. They made peace shortly before his death.
“If I’d only known that what I loved the most would end up killing me and taking away everything I loved, I would have never done it,” Grant told Cyndy weeks before his death.
Cyndy calls Grant’s issues a “slow fade.” She did not realize the extent of his brain injuries until his death; CTE can only be diagnosed by performing an autopsy on the brain, she said. The damage happened over the course of his lifetime of playing football.
To understand their marriage, you have to start at the beginning of their relationship, she told me. They met while attending Abilene Christian University — he was a Southern California guy on a full football scholarship and she was a Texas gal.
Their first date was a blind date, but she had already seen him around campus. At 6 feet, 7 inches, he was the tallest man she had ever met — and handsome. The two Christians had a great deal in common.
“I knew he was a different kind of guy,” Cyndy said. “A beautiful mind.”
Grant loved poetry, music and art. She had never known another guy on a first date to be into those things.
Grant was a gifted football player — and extremely intelligent. He won every academic award and was an academic All-American. He was accepted into every dental school in Texas but chose to put off a medical or dental education to play football. He was drafted by the Colts.
“We were kids in our early 20s,” she said. “One percent of people in the world would get a chance like this. Who wouldn’t take it, right?”
Cyndy calls those the good years. They traveled a lot and met lots of people. Grant worked hard and she was a stay-at-home wife. However, even before then, she worried about the physical toll the game took on Grant.
He had a concussion in his senior year of college. He blew it off. That served as a red flag to Cyndy, whose sister had fractured her skull in a serious fall. But people didn’t really talk about concussions at the time.
Grant would later suffer another serious concussion within the last five years of his NFL career during a game at Mile High Stadium in Denver. He went back into that game despite experiencing tunnel vision. Other symptoms included nausea and head pain. However, there was no sports concussion protocol in the 1980s and 1990s.
I asked Cyndy if pro sports organizations are doing better about dealing with concussions.
“I’m trying to wrap my mind around all of how big this picture is,” she said in response. Grant played football from age 8. “I think they’re talking about it more and there’s more awareness. But parents and people cheering the NFL games … I don’t think everybody understands the visual the brain is like gray Jello. I never dreamed the brain is made out of a soft substance like butter. If I had known that, I would have begged Grant on bended knees not to play.”
Grant’s brain was “jiggled” around in every play every day from age 8 to age 32.
“I think the NFL knows it and I think they know there’s a huge problem,” she said. “I think it’s all driven by money. It’s like a gladiator game, and I think we forget that it’s a human face.”
Cyndy said she posts frequently on her Facebook author page about the dangers of concussions.
“We’re cheering and clapping and giving people money and it ends up killing our loved ones.”
She calls her marriage a “tragic love story” similar to Romeo and Juliet. She and Grant drifted apart.
Cyndy also says that Grant’s condition was a “slow fade.” She thought he was simply fighting drug and alcohol addictions, which is why he started making irrational decisions like continuing to play after nearly dying of a serious staph infection. Even though he had a port that allowed antibiotics to be delivered to his heart, Grant continued to play football.
“I remember the look in his eyes” when he said he would not retire, she said. “I think that’s when a huge decision was made that was not realistic. He knew. He wanted to be a doctor. It shows he had lost his reasoning ability.”
After that, Grant began bringing in bags of unmarked pills and drinking liquor with sodas. Candy later learned that sleeplessness and alcoholism are signs of CTE.
The night that he did retire, Grant drank an entire bottle of whiskey of a leading brand. “He loved our family and he loved me. But … he had a constant drive.” That night he gave Cyndy an expensive ring as a gift — the same exact ring he had given her two years prior, and he did not remember when she reminded him.
Cyndy began finding bottles of alcohol hidden in his clothes at home.
She wishes now that she had chosen one person in whom to confide, but she says she was a co-dependent bent on not sharing her marriage’s problems.
“Please tell one person” if you are going through a similar problem, she urged. That person can be a lifeline to get you help somewhere.
Grant always had ongoing prescriptions for pain killers for various hurts but only had one surgery, to fix a broken nose. He never had knee replacement or had his hurt back fixed.
Cyndy said she always believed her old Grant, her children’s father, would return. He never did.
She said she did not know about the CTE for sure until after his brain was examined after death. Toward the end of his life, he had begun to suspect he had CTE like certain other athletes who had been diagnosed with it. That’s when he said he would never have played football if he had known it would kill him.
There are four stages of CTE. Grant had Stage 3, Cyndy said.
She said she considered suicide after Grant’s death. Her faith, and her family and Christian family, have carried her through with their unconditional love. God is her answer.
“I wouldn’t be here without my faith,” she said.
Christian therapy and a church support group have also helped. “If you’re going through anything like this you can’t do it alone.” She said she was a “terrible co-dependent” and pretended she had a perfect life.
“I believe in the Bible,” she said. “I believe that God knew everything about me before I was born and knew about Grant.” She believes Grant is in Heaven saying “You go girl!” about her sharing her family’s story.
She and Grant reconciled at the end. But before that, “we ended when I was mad, sad and angry. It was a very tragic ending.” Forgiving one another before Grant’s death was the only way she has been able to carry on, she said.
Cyndy said she is honoring her husband’s legacy by sharing his story.
More information about Cyndy and her story is at afterthecheeringstops.com and cyndyfeasel.com. Look up her name on Facebook for her author page. She has resources for people to learn more about CTE and brain research.
She belongs to a group called Save Your Brain for family of CTE victims. She did not have that resource when going through Grant’s health struggles. She also recommends looking up CTE on the Mayo Clinic and Centers for Disease Control websites.
“This is a disease that affects not only NFL athletes but children,” she said.

On one hand the oil rich country receives almost 95% of its revenue from petroleum, foreign investment is mushrooming in Kurdistan and within the governorates, and elections are taking place. On the other hand, democratic change is hindered by many challenges, which include wars in surrounding countries, internal violence, human rights violations, and others. While these challenges are ostensibly the state’s responsibility due to its responsibility to maintain domestic security, uphold the law, and ensure due process, the problem of corruption appears to be more subtle and entrenched throughout almost all strata of Iraqi society.
A recent report released by UNDP titled Corruption and Integrity in Iraq’s Public Sector reveals the extent to which corruption is a part of everyday life in Iraq. A few key findings of the report suggest that almost 60% of civil servants have been offered bribes, bribery prevails across Iraq but varies regionally (Baghdad: 29.3%, other governorates: 10.2%, Kurdistan Region: 3.7%), and that 66.3% of all civil servants would not feel adequately protected if they were to report an act of corruption in their own ministry.[1] [2] These findings not only illustrate the prevalence of bribery and corruption and that it is centered in the administrative capital of the country, but also that there is little being done to protect those who speak out or practice anti-corruption policies.
The report also explicitly states that “misconduct at all levelsis regularly reported in the media or directly experienced by citizens themselves in the interactions with public officials.” Therefore, corruption is not only acknowledged privately but also publicly, and by default condoned by those who fail to stand up against it in the media or in the political public.
It should be noted, however, that a problem arises when one juxtaposes an official definition of corruption and a patronage system such as wasta. A modern bureaucracy is likely to experience some corruption, but when the state must reconcile and define what falls under corruption and what falls under a deeper set of practices in Iraq’s then it becomes difficult to legislate these practices.
Nevertheless, legislation is not enough. The Commission of Integrity (CoI) investigates corruption cases and works to advocate for honest practice but the main issue is impetus. As stated above, there is a lack of public encouragement for whistleblowing, as well as protection for whistleblowers. Until the Iraqi government and administration legislate and enforce better practices publicly and privately, while encouraging whistleblowing, corruption in Iraq will continue. Furthermore, whistleblowers should organize to create independent anti-corruption organizations in order to raise awareness and place pressure on the government.Allopathic Medical School ( U. of Iowa, etc.)
Application process really starts with the MCAT. THe MCAt is administered via computer on 19 different dates at Prometric Test Centers. The information for registering to take the MCAT is available at Application for the April MCAT is on line at. Basic information about this test is shown at. This site has all the MCAT info you need. Loras also sponsors MCAT Review Sessions each year here Wed. nights Dec.- March prior to the exam.
AMCAS Application – All premed students fill out one application on line for med school which is sent to a central application service called AMCAS. Website is. You designate the schools to which you are applying on the AMCAS form. These applications should be started during the summer and submitted on line by Sept. 15 at the latest. Ignore other deadlines put out by the individual schools. If you apply late, you have a very poor chance of getting in.
Then, each school to which you applied will send you a “secondary application” asking for more info and more money. At this time, you send that back and notify Dr. Davis that a committee letter is needed. Loras writes a committee letter of recommendation to medical schools. Members of this committee are chosen by the student and should include one faculty member from each science dept (biology, chemistry, physics and math) plus two others (faculty or non faculty) from outside the sciences. This committee letter counts as one letter of rec for most schools. Usually they require 3 max. So two other letters must be asked for too. One from another faculty member who knows you and one (non family member) from a work supervisor or someone who knows you well.
Interviews are set up early or late depending.
Final notification is done by March 1.
You have the option of deferring for one year and entering one year later.
(Each individual school has individual rules that the applicant must be aware of.)
Osteopathic Medical Schools (Des Moines University, etc.)
Same as allopathic schools except you apply on line using a different central application service called AACOMAS. This website is.
More info on osteopathic medical school can be found at
In general, procrastinators who apply late in this process have not been accepted to medical school.
Dental School
This application process usually starts with filling out the AADSAS central application service application for dental school on line at. This is usually done after June. 1 the year before you plan to enter dental school. In this application you choose the schools to apply to. The schools will then start sending you information that you need to send back to them.
All applicants must take the DAT which is given on computer at various Sylvan Learning Centers in Iowa City, Quad Cities, Madison, etc. Loras has not done committee letters for dental school. Individual letters from 2 faculty and a dentist who knows the applicant well are required. You can register for the DAT on line at
The website for applicant info at the U. of Iowa is.
Physicians Assistant
This process also begins with application to the central application service called CASPA. The website for this application is. An excellent website that answers almost any question about PAs is at. This is a very competitive process mostly because class size is small (usually about 32 at the U. Iowa) and there are not a lot of programs out there. The timing is about the same: apply early in the fall of senior year.
Most PA program require the GRE General test. That should be taken early in the fall of senior year too. This test is taken on line and more information/dates can be seen at. An information booklet with practice test info can be picked up in the Center for Experiential Learning in the Campus Center, second floor.
Physical Therapy
Applications should be sent directly to the schools. Most require the General GRE. This is a 2 – 2.5 year Masters degree or sometimes bachelors degree. A good website to answer many questions about PT is at.
Optometry
This rewarding field has an excellent website at that describes all aspects of applying for and being an optometrist. All applicants are required to take the OAT which is described in detail at. It is given twice a year at several locations in the Midwest. Application forms can be requested from each of the 17 optometry schools in the country which are listed at. A shadowing experience with one or several optometrists is highly recommended.
Podiatry
This attractive,high potential field needs applicants. They have a central application service called AACPMAS which has a website at. This website can also be used to answer many questions about this field. Same timing as above. Usually can apply in spring of senior year and still be accepted for the following fall.
Nursing
The current plan at Loras for those MEN and women interested in nursing is to complete a 4 year degree at Loras with a solid science background and taking the major of choice. The science courses need to include Intro Biology, 2 Sem of Gen Chemistry, 1 sem of Organic Chemistry, 1 semester of Physics, Physiology, Anatomy, Genetics, Microbiology, Statistics and 1 Sem of College Algebra or above. During the fall of the senior year, the student applies to several Accelerated Advanced Bachelors of Nursing Degree Programs in the country. This is a 12-18 month intensive course of study that awards the students a B.S.N. and qualifies the student to go on into Advanced Nursing education programs like Nurse Practitioner, Cardiac Rehab Nurse, Surgical Nurse or any other nursing specialty training program. Nurses with these degrees can almost get a job anywhere in the country at almost any hospital or health care clinic.
The University of Iowa School of Nursing started a 16 month Accelerated program in January 2003 that leads to a Master's in Nursing. This program will take 32 students that already have a 4 yr. bachelor's degree from another school. It starts in January each year and will finish in May the following year. Yes, summer is included in the plan.
Some websites for these programs are at Loyola, Creighton, Vanderbilt, U. Miami, U. Wisc. Madison.
U. Iowa Nursing Anesthesia Program -.
(A true Accel. B.S.N. is under construction at Iowa set to start May 2003)

Veterinary Medicine
Students have the best chance for admission to veterinary school to the state school of which they are a resident. The University of Illinois, the University of Minnesota and the University of Wisconsin all participate in VMCAS which is the central application service for veterinary schools. Specific admission procedures for these schools can be found at their websites but also at the VMCAS website at. Iowa State University operates the state veterinary school for Iowa. Their application process involves sending the appropriate application materials directly to them or through VMCAS. More information on their admission process can be found at . Applications should be in by Sept. 15.POA

There are so many improvements to the campus and particularly to the Curriculum Materials Center where I teach the class.
I had previously taught there nine years ago for a period of 12 years. It was definitely a growing experience for me professionally and spiritually (It's a Christian university.), and I have many fond memories of my time there.
I left to return to public school because I felt out of touch with what was going on in schools. You don't gain a full understanding as a professor just doing student teacher and entry year teacher observations. Tremendous changes had taken place in public schools during the decade I had been teaching at ORU. I felt like I wasn't bringing my teacher candidates the most current information about the "real world" of teaching. "Back in the olden days when I was teaching . . . ."
I told my 2ndies about teaching the class and had them write letters to them, telling them how important reading good books to their students it is. They also made suggestions of good books to read. My teacher candidates loved them and wrote back. I can see a lot of good back-and-forth learning that can take place this semester as they continue these exchanges.
Good on you for heading back to the classroom to "keep it real". I think that in a always changing field like education most of the undergraduates education instructors/profs should be classroom teaching as well as teaching in the university setting.
My 9 years back in the classroom have been very helpful for me, Sandi.Good location, within walking distance of the Palais des Congres and Rue Ste-Catherine, and a short distance away from the river. Rooms clean even if the interiors have not been updated in a while - you can see they have been through the grind. Unimpressive lobby, and you need an elevator ride to get in and out of the hotel. Staff were professional. Breakfast the standard fare.

Wine AdvocateThe 2006 Brunello di Montalcino is a classy, elegant wine laced with sweet red cherries, subtle herbs and hints of tobacco. Cedar and leather appear later, adding further complexity. This is an interesting Brunello that presents an essentially classic aromatic and flavor profile, but with a little more textural richness and depth than most wines made in a similar vein. A long, generous finish rounds things out nicely. Today the 2006 is still quite primary, but it certainly has the potential to develop into an even more beautiful wine in a few years. Anticipated maturity: 2016-2026.

Wine SpectatorSupple and elegant, this displays its cherry, raspberry and cigar box flavors with intensity and harmony. Ends with refined tannins and a flourish of spice. Best from 2013 through 2025. 1,400 cases made.

Many adore the Rolex Daytona for unknown reasons but many adore it for very, very good reasons. Launched in 1963 as the plain Cosmograph Ref. 6239, though some people tend to dismiss that fact and actually group it into the Rolex chronograph section. Inspired by motor racing, the Daytona wasn’t the first name it was given, the original name of the Daytona was actually ‘Le Mans’ but obviously this name didn’t stick.
When the Cosmograph made its way to North America,.
The Rolex Daytona is undoubtedly the most collectable sports watch in existence and is still the most popular chronograph in the world but when it comes to vintage Daytonas there is something just that extra bit special about them. As mentioned, the 6239 were the first Daytonas introduced and sported a Tachymetre bezel. Though through the early years small adjustments were made to these and there were a couple of dial variations too. Beating away at the heart of these early Daytonas, was the infamous Valjoux 72 (a movement used by many watch brands during these years) – which Rolex named the 72B. The next significant change came just a year later in 1965.

Rolex pride themselves on having water-resistant watch cases, so to have a wristwatch that wasn’t fully deserving of their ‘Oyster’ inscription on the dial just wasn’t quite right, so gone were the pump chronograph pushers and in came the new screw-down pushers – this reference would be known as the 6240 and now bared the ‘Oyster’ inscription. But I think where Daytonas start to get interesting and also quite ridiculously priced. Strangely enough the Paul Newman Daytona when introduced really didn’t sell that well but trying to get your hands on one now, will cost you, dearly!
In 1988 Rolex finally introduced a self-winding Daytona. Now beating away at the heart of the Daytona was the Zenith calibre 400, which Rolex dubbed the calibre 4030. The aesthetics of the Daytona also changed, it now sported crown guards, a new dial that featured halos around each subsidiary dial and the size of the Daytona had also grown from 37mm to 40mm. This update was probably the most significant because until this day the Daytona, design-wise, is almost unchanged.
In 2000 Rolex announced the new in-house automatic calibre 4130 and the only cosmetic change this made were to the running seconds, which moved from its position at 9 to 6 o’clock. The Daytona is a legendary timepiece that commands and deserves its respect in the world of horology and when you look a little into its history, you can see why.

A judge ruled that licence fee income was unlawfully used by Westminster council to take enforcement action against illegal sex shop operators.
Mr Justice Keith said a recent European directive did not permit a ‘reasonable’ licence fee to include the costs of enforcement.
The ruling was a victory for Simply Pleasure Ltd and other long-standing licensees of shops in Soho, Covent Garden and the West End.
But the council said it will appeal, insisting enforcement against the illegal sex trade was a ‘proper use of public money’ and also benefited legitimate operators.
Tony Devenish, Westminster council’s Cabinet member for licensing and public health, said: ‘Westminster City Council has always maintained that the use of licence fee income to enforce against illegal sex shops is a proper use of public money, protecting the quality of life for our residents and visitors, including the global reputation of London.
‘Enforcing against the illegal sex trade actually benefits those who are legitimate operators in the sex industry.
‘With millions of extra visitors about to descend on London to celebrate the Jubilee and Olympics, it is critical people see the best face of our city.’
The judge added: ‘When people of my generation hear the word Soho, they tend to think of seedy clubs and illicit sex.
‘But the sex industry is now highly regulated.’Poor single mother, who earns around $40,000 a year, was caught sharing files and offered an out-of-court settlement for a few grand. She declined, fought it in court, lost, and was hit with the $220k order.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services administers the Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled Program, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395 - 1395aaa (Medicare Program), and has delegated that responsibility to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). HCFA contracts with private insurance companies to act as fiscal intermediaries and reimburse participating health care providers for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. 42 U.S.C. § 1395u.
Part A of the Medicare Program pays for inpatient hospital, home health, and skilled nursing services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Part B is a voluntary program which provides coverage for physician services, outpatient hospital services, and other supplementary medical insurance benefits. The providers of services must meet the statutory criteria and enter into Health Insurance Benefit Agreements (Provider Agreements) with the Secretary, through HCFA, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc. HCFA may not reimburse a provider unless it executes a Provider Agreement.
Under the provider agreements, Medicare providers are reimbursed for services on the basis of "reasonable costs" as defined in the federal regulations. 42 C.F.R. § 413. 1 et seq. The fiscal intermediary, such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield, determines reasonable costs and makes payment. 42 U.S.C. § 1395h.
The fiscal intermediary makes estimated payments based on historical levels of service. These payments are subsequently reconciled with the actual reasonable costs incurred by means of an annual cost report which the Medicare Provider is required to submit. 42 C.F.R. §§ 413.20, 413.24. Based on the audited cost report, the intermediary makes a final determination whether the facility was overpaid or underpaid during the year. Id.
The intermediary adjusts the estimated payments if it receives information that the compensation will be excessive based upon the projected level of services, 42 C.F.R. § 413.64, or because the provider refuses to furnish the required information to allow the fiscal intermediary to determine the correct amount due to the provider, 42 C.F.R. § 1395g(a).
In addition, the intermediary reconciles the total payments made with actual reimbursement due based on annual cost reports filed by the provider after the end of each fiscal year. 42 C.F.R. § 413.20. If the provider was underpaid, the intermediary immediately remits the difference. If the provider was overpaid, the intermediary notifies the provider of the overpayment, adjusts ongoing payments to reflect the fact that the provider was overpaid by the Medicare program, recoups funds owed the provider until the overpayment has been collected. 42 U.S.C. § 1395g(a); 42 C.F.R. § 405.1803(c).
A provider dissatisfied with the fiscal intermediary's determination may appeal. Depending on the amount in controversy, the provider's appeal is disposed of through a hearing before the fiscal intermediary or by appeal directly to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB). 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(a). Board decisions are final, 42 U.S.C. § 1395oo(f), and may be appealed to the federal district court, 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). The statutes require exhaustion of administrative remedies before a federal court has jurisdiction over a Medicare Program related matter. 42 U.S.C. § 405(h).
Medicare payments to suppliers may be suspended, in whole or in part, when overpayments are found or reasonably suspected. 42 C.F.R. § 405.370(a) (1992). The suspension must protect the program against financial loss. 42 C.F.R. § 405.370(b) (1992). Generally, suspension requires prior notice. 42 C.F.R. § 405.371(a) (1992). However, where fraud or misrepresentation is suspected, notice may be provided concurrently with the suspension. 42 C.F.R. § 405.371(b) (1992). Amounts suspended are segregated. Once imposed, a suspension remains in effect until either the overpayment is returned, a liquidation agreement is reached with the supplier, or the agency determines that no overpayment was made. 42 C.F.R. § 405.373 (1992).
The Medicare relationship is generally not considered a contractual one. Memorial Hospital v. Heckler, 706 F.2d 1130, 1136-37 (11th Cir. 1983) (Existence of the provider agreement "did not obligate the Secretary to provide reimbursement for any particular expenses."), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1023 (1984); The Germantown Hospital and Medical Ctr. v. Heckler, 590 F. Supp. 24, 30-31 (E.D. Pa. 1983), aff'd, 738 F.2d 631 (3d Cir. 1984) ("There is no contractual obligation requiring HHS to provide Medicare reimbursement."). Cf. Hollander v. Brezenoff, 787 F.2d 834, 835-39 (2d Cir. 1986) ("Signing a provider agreement does not convert statutory mandates into a contract claim;" "[a]lthough the [Medicaid] relationship may be effectuated by means of a provider contract, all rights to reimbursement arise under the applicable statutes."). But see In re University Medical Ctr., 973 F.2d 1065 (3d Cir. 1992) (holding that Medicare provider agreement is an executory contract for bankruptcy purposes).
The Medicare statute, 42 U.S.C. § 405(h), bars judicial relief until a party exhausts administrative remedies. See, e.g., Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602 (1984); Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749 (1975); American Fed'n of Home Health Agencies, Inc. v. Heckler, 754 F.2d 896, 897-98 (11th Cir. 1984). Thus, unless a provider exhausts its administrative remedies, federal courts do not have jurisdiction over claims arising under the Medicare Program for reimbursement. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395oo(f), 405(h), 1395ii; see, e.g., Westchester Management Corp. v. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 948 F.2d 279, 282 (6th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 909 (1992); Bodimetric Health Services, Inc. v. Aetna Life & Casualty, 903 F.2d 480, 483-84 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1012 (1990); Charter Medical Corp. v. Bowen, 788 F.2d 728 (11th Cir. 1986). But see In re University Med. Ctr., supra (exhaustion of administrative remedies not required where adversary proceeding is based on Bankruptcy Code and does not involve issue inextricably intertwined with any dispute within agency's normal review process); In re Town & Country Home Nursing Services, Inc., 112 B.R. 329 (Bankr. 9th Cir. 1990), aff'd, 963 F.2d 1146 (9th Cir. 1992) (same).
Fiscal intermediaries are merely conduits between the government and the Medicare providers. 42 U.S.C. § 1395(h). Thus, while a fiscal intermediary determines amounts to be paid on claims and disburses funds provided by the government, the United States is the real party in interest in Medicare litigation, and the claims against the fiscal intermediaries should be dismissed. Bodimetric Health Servs., Inc. v. Aetna Life & Casualty, 487-488 supra; Matranga v. Travelers Ins. Co., 563 F.2d 677 (5th Cir. 1977); Peterson v. Weinberger, 508 F.2d 45, 51-52 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 830 (1975); Pine View Gardens, Inc. v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 485 F.2d 1073, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 1973).
B..
The statute of limitations is a serious factor in many of these cases. Thus, the government should obtain a waiver of the statute of limitations from the provider if administrative consideration of the overpayment determination is delayed.).
Consult with HHS with respect to all compromise proposals and keep HHS apprised of developments in these cases. USA should contact the HHS Regional Counsel if support from HHS is requested.

Your urgent inquiries about the world, answered.
Q: I've heard that the most poisonous snakes on the planet have mouths that are too small to bite us. What gives? —Tim Russell, Seattle
A: Swallow your pride, bub. Humans are barely a blip on most poisonous snakes' radar screens. Many of the world's deadliest serpents, for instance, live in remote, unpopulated stretches of the Australian outback. They evolved for millions of years without the threat of marauding sheep ranchers, and thus had no great need to puncture the human epidermis.
Consider the irony of elapids, the snake family that includes the western brown, death adder, and black tiger—often described as the world's deadliest reptilian triumvirate. Each snake packs enough neurotoxins to paralyze an adult, but their nickel-size mouths—designed to fit around small lizards or snakes—only open just wide enough to nip (not chomp) a human limb. And their fixed quarter-inch fangs have difficulty penetrating a pair of jeans.
Experts are busy debating which snakes are the most poisonous (the ones that kill you quickest, or the ones that kill you deadest), so the question of whether they could even bite you in the first place remains unsettled. But as Penn State–Hazleton biologist J. Brian Hauge warns, "It's very dangerous to assume that the most venomous snakes have mouths too small to do damage to you." Indeed, being wrong would really bite.1 August 1, 2015

7 days ago ·.The gauchos are finally done! It's about time, huh? Let's have a little parade to celebrate. LOL!
Pattern: Simplicity 4135 Threads Pants
This is a Threads Magazine Collection pattern for boot leg pants in two lengths, city shorts, wide leg pants, and gauchos. The sizes are misses' 6-14 with a petite alteration option. The pattern includes "perfect fit techniques" as well. I liked the waistband of these pants as well as the bootcut look, so I made View D, the gauchos and used the petite length.
Having never made pants before, I agonized over what size to cut. I finally decided to cut a size 12 waistband, a size 12 for the top 3 inches or so of the pants, then tapered to a size 10 at the low hip and legs. In hindsight, I possibly could've pulled off a size 10 or even a 12 may have looked nice. I ended up taking in the waistband quite a bit more than I expected and it is still quite roomy. I wasted too much time trying to decide what size to make when probably either one would've been OK.
I made these gauchos out of some black cotton wrinkle-resistant pant fabric I found at Wal-Mart. I'm sure I'll have to deal with lint, but you almost always do with black pants anyway.
These pants went together surprisingly easy! I was surprised at how good the pattern instructions were. They didn't assume you know everything about sewing pants and were pretty darn good about leading you through step by step. The waistband pieces can be confusing, but if you mark which side is which, etc. you should be OK. (Also, don't take 5 months to make the things and you won't forget where you're at in the process!)
I did have some problems with the fly. The instructions for making the fly and inserting the zipper were pretty good even though I had a hard time seeing how it all fit together before doing it. However, once I was getting toward the end and was sewing the crotch/back seam, I ran into problems with getting the bottom of the zipper to lie flat and not pucker. I don't know about you, but I don't particularly need to draw attention to my crotch with a puckered zipper! So, after many seam-rippings and rebastings, my mom suggested that I take out part of the top-stitching on the front of the fly--basically the curve at the bottom. Then, I resewed the crotch/back seam and voila! A flat fly front! Next time, I'd like to try Sandra Betzina's flat fly front zipper directions, but at this point in the gaucho-making process, it just wasn't possible.
I'm happy with how these came out. I hope they last and I'll get some good use out of them. I have a blouse to make that just might look pretty darn cute with these, so sometime I'll get a good full-body pic of me dressed in them.
Have a great weekend!

.-  Ten Must Have Trends For Spring
New York Fashion Week may have been sometime in September, let's face it, the likelihood of you remembering a fraction of what sashayed down the runway is pretty slim. Perfectly forgivable, but with February upon us, and the big spring melt only mere months away, this is the perfect opportunity to get a little refresher. Spring 2013 is shaping up to be one of the most interesting seasons for fashion in a very long time. Get glam, get graphic and go bold with these top ten tantalizing Spring trends.
Automatic Monochromatic
There is nothing more classic than black and white, but this spring, designers are shaking things up with edgy seams, peek-a-boo cuts, and strategically placed detailing. Every woman loves versatility and monochromatic is a design that effortlessly transcends the notion of trend and season, giving you all year round wearability.
Peek-a-Boo
Your date night wardrobe line-up is about to get a serious overhaul because for this spring season, skin is in! Edgy peek-a-boo cuts are a plenty and designers are giving you the option to be as daring or as modest as you wish. Perfectly placed sheering, sexy slits, and saucy separates are certainly one way to ring in spring, not to mention bring a little sass to the endless number of mundane mid-week date nights you've got lined up!
Short Suits
The short suit is the epitome of office chic and go get ‘em gams! Sure, pantsuits exude a certain sense of power and prestige, but a short suit says, "I mean business, but I'm fun!" From gauzy cottons to luxurious silks, the short suit is the new power piece. The color palettes are as varied as the styles which is good news for you, because it means that transitioning your look from spring to summer will be a breeze.
Get Graphic
Last year it was bold, deco and ethnic prints, and this season it's all about channeling your inner child with a twist. Graphic cartoon prints have made their way from fashion editorials, onto the department store racks and up and down the streets of LA, New York and London. Classic cartoon imagery from the golden fifties to edgy comic book graphics are all on show this season, and make for fantastic personal statement pieces.
Sunglass Statement
For the past couple of seasons, designers and stylists have been working feverishly to get us all glammed up in statement jewelry pieces. It wasn't unheard of to build your entire outfit around a particular piece of jewelry, and this season, it's all about the peepers. Say goodbye to boring and, hello to sunnies with big bling, bright colors and unusual shapes.
Now You Sheer It
Shed the modesty ladies, it's all about being daring and bold this spring season. If you're looking to take that peek-a-boo look to the next level, sheer is clearly one of the hottest trends going. From breezy chiffons to barely-there-silks, live a little and let yourself bare it all or just enough in a sheer piece.
Life in Technicolor
Last season we were all loving the bright color-block trend and for winter, palettes that included bashful berry's and captivating cobalts set our wardrobes ablaze. This spring, we're getting yet another flavorful taste of the rainbow with rich navies, dazzling purples and gorgeous greens. Give the gray's in your wardrobe a season off, it's all about color!
Slip into Something Slinky
Every woman has that signature little black dress, right? Well, it might be time to give your LBD the night off and opt for something a little less Audrey Hepburn and a little more Boudoir Betty! The slip dress is making a fierce comeback and is the perfect solution to a last minute romantic night on the town. Think you can only don this in the evening hours, think again. This little gem is a fantastic day dress, just pair it with a blazer or cardigan and voila, daytime diva.
From Brocade to Beadery
Luxurious brocades, metallic hardware and embroidery could be seen everywhere these past few months, and it seems as though the adoration for embellishment isn't going anywhere. Get earthly this spring with one of the hottest trends, beading. From simple beaded trim, to full beaded blouses, we're getting back to our crafty yet fashionable roots.
Sport a Skater
The sport dress or ‘skater' dress as the Londoner's call it, made it's way into our wardrobes earlier this year, but is just now hitting the mainstream with a vengeance. The ultra feminine design is fun, flirty and delightfully distracting. Keep it casual or glam it up, it doesn't matter, you're going to want a handful of these to keep on rotation this season.-

We both speak a tad of Spanish but the in-laws, who hooked up with us from a cruise don´t.
Entering the main bodega building is stepping back in time. It´s a small museum with origins dating back to the 15th century and houses old advertising posters, antique bottles and other items all above the 12 meter deep caves where wine is aged. Interestingly, Rovellats was the first bodega to base it´s caves on a radial design. The bodega includes a chapel of the Virgin of Montserrat with a reproduction identical in size, although our tour guides shared they believe the face is slimmer.
I happened upon the winemaker passing by stainless fermentation tanks. Being inquisitive I marched up to him. He was measuring density of the wine, a way of assessing sugar in the juice. I couldn´t turn down an offer to taste it! A sweet white grape juice with a tad of effervescence, it was tangy like grapefruit reminding me of the German neuwein- young wine that is partially fermented and immediately drank. He then took me for a gaze into to the top of the tank. Fermentation was starting. The juice looked like busy bees humming in a hive.
We tasted two cavas; Brut Rose and 2006 Gran Reserva Brut Nature. The Gran Reserva is made with 60% Xarel·lo and blended with Macabeu and Parellada grapes. The aroma was one of granny smith apples joining the palate with dry toasted almonds. This was a clean sparkler with a refined taste and small glorious bubbles. It´s hint of yeast smelled like yeast melting in warm water when making bread. It was aged sur lie (the spent yeast, or yeast that dies off falls to and remains at the bottom of the aging vessel).
The rose, made primarily with granacha (grenache) and a hint of Monastrell smelled and tasted of raspberries and blackberries. It was bright on the palate like taking a drink of cold mineral water when expecting still water. Quite worthy.
Our tour and tasting lasted three hours. We ended up socializing, finding out the regular English guide was on vacation. The bodega manager didn´t speak English so she invited her two English speaking daughters and a boyfriend of one.
This was one of those great traveling experiences; our hosts kind, funny and generous (they opened a second bottle of Brut Grand Reserva we all enjoyed while talking). We left with bottles and memories.
What a tease! I’ve had Cava in the states but it isn’t so great and I hear they don’t necessarily import the good stuff. Spain has been on my list to visit for a while, not to mention tasting in their various wine regions. Where else have you tasted there or will you taste?If you like them preppy shorts but can't or don't dare to wear too short shorts, then here's your saviour; the mid-length shorts! Not exactly three-quarters, but they fall just above the knee to not cut your legs off. Nice, isn't it? Very preppy looking too; I can just imagine wearing this and a very fitting white shirt with the sleeves rolled till the elbows, and three to four buttons unbuttoned. Tee hee. Do hurry, as this is only still available in size S!
I don't know what's with the black sash there, but other than that, I think we can all quite agree that this tank top is uber awesome! Take your pick from either a lace-bibbed victorian style tank, or a very forest-fairy like flowery tank! Psst, my favourite the the Floral Jewels. This top looks pretty long, so I guess if you're petite, this can very well become a short dress. Other than that, pairing this with them glossy leggings look good too!
I know I'm like, super late in posting this up, and this is all gone, but she's taking restocks for this! So for the girly girl and the Juicy Couture fans, get your hands on this cute mini camera. Comes in baby pink; I think Xia Xue would love this very much. Hop on to Princess Feverlicious to check out the specs of this camera.
Now ladies, focus on the bag. The. Bag. Yes, that Union Jack flag bag. It's shiny, it's small, it has chain straps, and the straps are adjustable! Now wouldn't this be the perfect item to brighten up a drab outfit? Or perhaps, a deliberately drab outfit. Let's see, an all black combo with this bag? Awesome-ness.
My jaw literally dropped when I saw this blazer. I. So. Want it!! I mean, I already have one. *twiddles thumbs* But! It doesn't really fit me. :D Actually, come to think of it, no blazers will ever fit me nicely because of my thin frame... :( They all hang loosely. See, being thin is no benefit sometimes. Le sigh. But you should totally get it if you don't have one. Fashion these days are so unpredictable, blazers are no longer limited to formal functions! Yay for that. This is a pre-order, so hurry before it closes!
I have found yet another OL dress! I'm not sure if it's bat-winged sleeved, but it sure looks like it though. At first glance, it kind of looks like a sleeveless kimono, eh? Nonetheless, this is so plain it screams to be accessorized. Let me list down the possibilities; scarf, cincher, necklaces, bangles, lace tights...wait! Don't put all of them together, okay?!
Now, isn't this a cute floral sundress? Very bustier-like in the front (low cut too, wink wink wtf), but the back is the most appealing. Sexy with a hint of skin without being slutty. The best part about this dress is that it's not supershort, so you can still pass this off as pretty decent. I like it! One question though; would I need to wear them NuBras for this dress?
Forget the 280 deniers; glass tights are the second skin now. Like, literally. Legs are meant to be showed off, not covered up! I have to say though; this blue makes your skin looks alien-like. Really. But I guess they'll be pretty cool if you wear these with a supershort white skirt. Going for RM10 only!
Find it crazy irritating when people wake you up when you just want to sleep in peace for as long as you want? Yeah, I should know. I turn into a monster when people disrupt my sleep. =/ Anyways, get rid of this problem by getting this eye mask. How so? They're both actually one mask; turn it one side for a, "YES, please wake me up" or turn it the other way for, "NO, don't wake me up or I'll f*cking kill you!". Ahem. You get my drift.
Cute ickle ballerina flats! I don't think they're suitable enough to be worn as real ballerina slippers; but don't let it stop you from dressing up like that! I'm thinking white flowy dresses, white tights and these flats.
See that paisley skirt? It can also be worn as a tube top/dress. Or a high-waisted skirt. Or a boho skirt. And that yellow top? It's free. Now have I given you enough reasons to like this combo? :D！Today I have a circle card to share with you.

Thanks, Anita. 🙂Locations > LG Health Physicians > Seasonal Advice > Spring
Milder weather, more daylight and the world is just starting to turn green….they’re all signs that spring is here. As nature gets a fresh new start, it’s time to renew our commitment to staying active and healthy. Here are some tips to help you do just that—and the doctors and staff at your local Lancaster General Health Physicians practice have more ways to help you stay well throughout the seasons.
After a long, cold winter, you’re glad to see the trees start to come into bloom—unless you’re allergic to tree pollen. If tree pollen or molds trigger your allergies, stay inside with windows closed when pollen counts are high. Ask you doctor if nasal washes and over-the-counter remedies are appropriate, or if you need something more to manage allergy symptoms.
Many people react to urushiol, an oil found in poison ivy and some other plants. It can cause itchy, red or blistering skin or more serious allergic reactions. If you touch poison ivy, wash your skin, your clothes and anything else that may have come in contact with the oil. Cool showers, calamine lotion or a baking soda bath may help the itch. If you’re not sure it’s poison ivy, or if the rash covers your face or genitals, call your doctor.
Whether your child plays second base or runs the 50-yeard-dash, chances are he or she will need a physical to participate in organized sports activities. Our physicians know the requirements for area schools and offer convenient evening and weekend appointment times that are convenient for you and your young athlete.
Having the right safety gear and taking time to warm up and cool down can help prevent many types of sports-related injuries. Rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE) can help many sprains and strains, but call a doctor if the swelling doesn’t go down or if the pain won’t go away or is severe.
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), children need an hour or more of physical activity every day and adults need at least 150 minutes a week. For adults, exercise should include both aerobic and muscle-building activities. Ask your family doctor about starting an exercise program safely. The more you exercise, the greater the health benefits.

The structure has been historically known as a boarding house, primarily for black railroad men. Though other businesses have been located here, its connection to Dr. Toomer is certainly the most significant aspect of its history. Sadly, it was demolished in the spring of 2017.

This structure was a boarding house, owned by my grandfather, Mr.Saint Clair Coffee Sr. , across the street was a pool room, restaurant, and upstairs slot machines. No one consulted any family members before tearing this structure down.
The house looked in good repair. Why would they destroy it when it was architecturally attractive and had a tie to black history–particularly as a place for black railroad men to stay. That alone would seem an interesting story to pursue. Thanks for saving the photo.
What is the matter with us as a people that such a structure would be simple demolished with barely a whimper?Tag: how to store guns safely at homeSince registration screen is displayed. Try using full text search function When entering "shameful" on the search.

BMW is recalling more than 130,000 vehicles because they said the rear lights can fail.
The recall covers 528-I, 535-I, 550-I and M5 vehicles made from 2008 to 2010.
Officials said drivers should get visual and audible warnings from the car if there is a problem with the lights.
Owners will be notified of the specific recalls in November.The Trashion Fashion Show at St. Bonaventure University will mark its fifth showcase this year with the addition of a panel discussion on globalization and our fragile forests.
The annual runway show, dubbed “Bona’s Gets Trashy,” will feature outfits designed from 90 percent post-consumer materials and will be held at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, April 19, in Rigas Theater of the Regina A. Quick Center for the Arts on campus.
The environmental fashions will be created and modeled by St. Bonaventure students along with a number of students from area high schools. The students are challenged to combine high fashion with environmental awareness.
When the first Runway Show opened five years ago and the third floor Loft space was filled to capacity, “I knew we had stumbled onto something amazing,” said Sean Conklin, assistant curator at the Quick Center. “Five years later, my expectations are still shattered and something happens in each and every show that still surprises me. That, to me, is the highest form of success an awareness program can achieve.”
He believes the success and growth of the annual event is a testament to the importance university students, faculty and staff place in sustainable practices and demonstrate how St. Bonaventure is leading the way for the area in terms of upcycling and recycling efforts.
“Trashion Fashion takes something common like recycling, something that people are more or less assumed to be doing, and gives it renewed purpose — makes it fun again. We are a highly creative and socially conscious community and the complex, jaw-dropping designs that step onto our stage every year prove that,” Conklin said.
Students interested in participating should contact Conklin at 375-2494 or sconklin@sbu.edu by Monday, April 3, for more information or to register.
A Plenary Discussion Panel will take place before the fashion show starting at 6 p.m. in the Loft, third floor of the Quick Center. “Fragile Forests: Globalization, Our Changing Planet, and the Future of Our Wooded Spaces” will feature panelists from the surrounding areas of New York and Pennsylvania.
Panelists will include:
The event is done in collaboration with the celebration of Earth Day on Saturday, April 22. The panel and fashion showAccessMedicine App Now Available

On Tuesday night, MTV aired a Teen Mom farewell special. It was an hour and a half long and treated fans to some unseen footage, including the original casting tapes! That’s right, before these girls were famous for being pregnant, they were normal teenagers submitting tapes for an up and coming show.
It was interesting to hear how the girls found out about the show. Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra were already considering adoption when their counselor heard about the show. Cate wasn’t too keen on submitting a tape at first, thinking that they didn’t have a chance to get picked. However, Tyler talked her into it, hoping that they would be able to give teens a look at the adoption process.
As fans know, the two were picked to tell their emotional story, and Catelynn admitted that at first, she didn’t know what she had gotten herself into! One day life was quiet, and the next there were cameras everywhere. Luckily, she said that after a few days of filming, it got easier.
However, she never took into account the fact the amount of attention that she would get from the show. At first, she thought it was “cool,” but soon realized she would get recognized anywhere she went. Tyler Baltierra and Catelynn Lowell are both easy-going, though, and have handled the fame (something that they don’t like to say they have; they also don’t like to be called celebrities) well.
Farrah Abraham was busy being a model and dabbling in acting when she found out she was pregnant. She submitted her casting tape to MTV and got picked. Her first day of filming was awkward, especially since she hadn’t been telling people that she was pregnant.
Perhaps the most interesting, though, is Maci Bookout. The Teen Mom‘s mother found the casting ad on Craigslist of all places. Maci submitted her tape where she talked about being pregnant and her excitement to move out and get married. The only problem was Ryan Edwards and his parents had no idea that Maci was submitting a tape for the show.
Of course, much to Ryan’s dismay, the teens were picked to share their lives. Ryan has never liked filming, and he has never been shy about it. Needless to say, their first couple days of filming did not go too well. The fame that followed irked Ryan Edwards (and still does to this day). Maci Bookout says she didn’t realize the fame that would come.
Then, there is Amber Portwood, whose casting tape was fun to watch. On her tape, she admitted that she broke the news about her pregnancy on her mom’s birthday (Happy Birthday, Mom!). She even revealed that she and Gary Shirley were having troubles back then (but no one could have known how bad things would get).
Having watched the girls for the past four years, it was neat to see how things started. Watching their tapes, one can’t help but wonder what was going through their heads. Did they think they would get picked? Would their lives have been different had MTV not cast them?

£8.99
Sorry, this item is now out of stock.
More than 80 years after its first publication, HH Scullard's acclaimed overview of Roman history still offers much to students and professional scholars alike, as Tim Cornell demonstrates in his new foreword to this fourth edition. Covering six centuries from the city's foundation and the establishment of the Republic to the Punic Wars and the fall of Carthage, Scullard examines the Romans' predilection for law and order, organization and administration, which enabled them to build the foundations of a great empire.Here's the official Press Release for the event:
CELEBS GO PURPLE FOR PURPLE DAY USA LAUNCH MARCH 10
NEW YORK, NY – Paul Shaffer of the Late Show with David Letterman and a host of celebrities join the fight for epilepsy awareness with the launch of Purple Day USA. Purple Day founder, ten-year-old Cassidy Megan will host the exclusive Purple New York Party in NYC on March 10, 2009 at Dylan’s Candy Bar, 1011 Third Ave from 1-2 p.m.
Motivated by her own struggles with epilepsy, Cassidy created Purple Day to let other kids with the disorder know they are not alone and help educate the public about epilepsy. She designated March 26th “Purple Day”— named for the internationally recognized color for epilepsy,lavender. Now her grassroots effort is going global.
Epilepsy affects 3 million Americans and over 50 million people worldwide (one in 100). Yet, many people living with epilepsy face barriers due to a lack of awareness about the disorder.
“I always thought I was the only one with epilepsy and I was afraid to tell people because I thought they would make fun of me,” says Cassidy.
This year, the New York-based Anita Kaufmann Foundation—a charity dedicated to educating the public about epilepsy—is helping Cassidy launch Purple Day USA. “Purple Day is a powerful step toward demystifying the disorder that plagued my best friend,” says the foundation's executive director, Debra Josephs. “Anita used to tell me that she felt the stigma and misconceptions were worse than the condition itself. The Purple New York Party is the perfect way to get the message out there—with the help of some incredible celebrities to boot.”
Celebrities attending the event include:
• Paul Shaffer of the Late Show with David Letterman
• Project Runway Season Five winner Leanne Marshall
• Former NY Giants Super Bowl Champion & current Cincinnati Bengal, Geoffrey Pope
• Harlem Wizards player “Mighty” Mike Simmel
• Model Jaime Paetz (one of Maxim Magazine's “10 Hotties”)
• Paul Green, founder of the acclaimed School of Rock
• Dr. Alan Greene, pediatric expert for WebMD
• Cassidy Megan, founder of Purple Day
Here's Eric, setting up his drumkit, while simultaneously watching the staff at Dylan's Candy Bar set up this amazing chocolate (well, it was white chocolate colored light purple for the event) fountain where you could make your own s'mores.
Julie, Eric, and Chris, warming up the crowd:
And who is that now standing next to Eric in the photograph directly above? Why, it's one of the day's special guests of honor, Paul Green, founder of The Paul Green School of Rock Music...and the man pretty much responsible for launching J&E's career, other than their insane hippie father and mother, of course, and introducing Julie and Eric to Adrian Belew. As I've mentioned here several times in the five years since this blog began, Julie and Eric were Paul's original fourteen students, taught in his apartment, and that was the start of what would become 49 schools worldwide and yes, yes, the total life story ripped off in the Jack Black film, School of Rock. Of course there is also a pretty famous and now cult documentary produced in 2003 called Rock School in which, if you watch that trailer, you'll see a very young Julie and Eric trashing bands like Bush and 311...I believe there are also shots of young Eric both starting and ending the clip...I forget, haven't watched it in a while.
In talking with Paul, wow does he have some interesting plans for the future but I'll let that news come from his camp as it's pretty exciting stuff. But of course I'd be remiss if I didn't once again add that if you really want to read about the beginnings of Rock School, I have just the book you need...and it's doing quite well on Amazon, thank you very much.
Obligatory sales pitch: You can purchase it right here.
Moving on, it would be nice if I actually resumed promoting Purple Day, so here is Ms. Julie Slick, holding a banner with the guest of honor who brainstormed this entire day, the angelically beautiful ten year old Ms. Cassidy Megan:
Some notable guests in the audience - uber agent Dan Conaway and his brilliant, stunning client, my pal Susan Henderson:
Here's the woman who organized this event, Debra Josephs, along with Cassidy who is thanking the crowd for being there and supporting the cause:
Another shot of Julie and Cassidy because you can never have too many photographs of beautiful girls:
Speaking of beautiful girls, here's another guest of honor (and yes, she also has epilepsy), Jaime Paetz, one of Maxim's Top Ten Hotties:
Jaime's purple dress was designed by the most recent winner of Project Runway, and here's a shot of said winner with Jaime and her gorgeous creation, Ms. Leanne Marshall:
And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the main event...Paul Shaffer! (who, by the way, follows me on Twitter, but more importantly, gave Julie, Eric, and Chris a big thumbs up while they were playing and snagged a copy of both their (Adrian Belew Power Trio Side Four Live) CD and Chris' as well as my book!
Now this is pretty cool and insane. Debra's hairdresser (I am pretty sure that's who she said he was) is also a sculptor, and he presented Paul with a special gift...what else...a purple brain (you can figure out the epilepsy tie in, I'm sure):
Naturally, after receiving this gift, Paul did what only a brilliant musician would...he burst into an impromptu version of "Purple Rain" by Prince...only of course he sang "Purple Brain, Purple Brain"...I think it's going to be up on You Tube soon so I'll add it here as soon as it's available:
It turns out that Cassidy is an aspiring drummer and naturally she was smitten with Eric Slick...I mean, who isn't...and Eric happily obliged her request to join him and Chris Opperman on a little percussion:
But Chris got, um, a little distracted by Jaime Paetz and you know I had to grab the camera for that one:
Eric the healthy vegan caved and could not resist a luscious purple cupcake, courtesy of the Corner Bakery:
So we had an absolutely fabulous day which ended with probably the best goody bags I've ever received - not only stuffed with my favorite chocolate (Cadbury bars...they have purple wrappers so there's that tie in), face creams, eye make-up, nail polish...ooh, I want to give a special mention here - that polish is really spectacular stuff and I don't usually do my nails but I had to make an exception when I saw the pale colors...this is the brainchild of a lovely woman, Jacqueline Saulsbery (allstarnails@gmail.com)...and Jacqueline's fabbo daughter, Denise Saulsbery Williams, filled our bags with these absolutely outrageous chocolate almond cookies (chocostilettos@yahoo.com)...these ladies do not have websites but they'd better get with the program...they are amazing!
And that was the Purple Day Kick Off Party in New York City. Do I have the coolest life or what?
But all banter and gossip aside, I don't want to diminish the importance of that day and urge you all to offer your support by wearing something purple on March 26, 2009 in honor of Purple Day.
Oh, and let me add that the whole reason my family was there is because I am great friends with another one of the supporters/organizers of this charity event, the extraordinary author and fiction editor of Agni Literary Magazine, Jessica Keener! Thanks, Jess!
Finally, in case you haven't had a chance to watch the incredible hour long television show featuring the Adrian Belew Power Trio, here's an outtake - one of my favorite songs from Side Four Live...Of Bow and Drum:
Oh, and over at Lakland Bass, whom Julie is proud to sponsor, they have updated her artist page to include not only new newest, fretless bass but a link to the entire Rockpalast movie. Cool!
I think that's it for now, but if not, you know the drill...

Now, imagine you’re actually in the room with Venus, as depicted in this painting. You suspend your astonishment long enough to conduct a quick test of the principle of how a flat mirror works. Consider what would happen to Venus’ face in the mirror as you approach it. As you walk towards the mirror, would the proportion of the reflection taken up by Venus’s face increase or decrease? In the painting, the face takes about 2/3 the width of the mirror. Would that proportion get bigger or smaller as you get closer? Let’s make this a poll:
Now imagine the cupid moves the mirror so you see your own reflection in it. As you walk away from the mirror, what happens to your reflection?
We have an unusually savvy and educated readership here, but for most people, those questions are quite difficult, despite the fact that we see mirrors every day.
In fact, as Marco Bertamini pointed out in a comment on last week’s post, his team of researchers got it wrong in their article about the Venus effect. Even art critics discussing the role of mirrors can make incorrect generalizations about how mirrors work, a point Marco Bertamini’s team of researchers made in their article about the Venus effect.
As you get farther away from the Venus, the projection of her face in the mirror approaches the actual size of her face. As you get closer, the proportion of the mirror occupied by her face decreases. So the face in the mirror is only too big if you assume the viewer is located relatively close to the mirror. If the experts can’t get this detail right, what chance do non-experts have?
Bertamini has continued to investigate our perception of mirror images. In 2007, a team led by Rebecca Lawson and including Bertamini and Dan Liu, came to a startling conclusion: “There is no percept for the 2-D projection on the surface of a mirror or window.” In other words, we don’t ever directly perceive the image on the mirror — we see only the object that’s reflected.
We are quite good at judging the size of objects if we know their distance from us. We almost automatically take distance into account when judging an object’s size, and despite the fact that objects literally appear smaller when they are farther away (they take up a smaller portion of our retina), we believe that they are the same size. In other words, we don’t think cars get smaller as they drive away. But when looking at a mirror, most people are suddenly much less accurate at judging the size of a reflection.
Lawson’s team had students stand two meters away from a large mirror. A researcher held a bamboo stick above the student’s head, behind a piece of wood so that the student couldn’t see the stick directly, only via its reflection. Students were asked to judge the length of the stick itself by extending a tape measure held at their side to match the length of the stick. Then they used the same method to estimate the length of the image of the stick in the mirror (as if they were holding the tape measure directly up to the mirror). Here are the results:
The purple bars show their estimates of length (the sticks were of varying lengths; they’ve all been normalized to 1 for this illustration). The correct answer is shown with the arrows. As you can see, while responses were very accurate for the estimate of the physical stick, respondents thought the image of the stick in the mirror was much larger than it really was.
As a control, the researchers also held the stick directly against the mirror, and as you’d expect, the students could accurately estimate its length.
In a second experiment, the students viewed the sticks from two different viewpoints — 1.5 meters away from the mirror or 6 meters away (the sticks were always held directly over the viewers’ head). The same error was repeated, no matter how far away the observers stood from the mirror. The students were also asked a question similar to our first poll question: would the proportion of the mirror taken up by the stick increase or decrease as they moved away from the mirror? Most respondents said, incorrectly, that the proportion would decrease.
In two additional experiments, the researchers kept the sticks in the same place while asking the viewers to estimate their size and the size of their reflections. No matter how far away viewers stood from the mirror, their estimate of the size of the reflection didn’t change significantly, despite the fact that it changes considerably.
In several of these experiments, students also looked at the objects through a window (with the same relative distance to the physical object and its projection on the window). The results were similar (and the physical principles, in fact, are also essentially identical).
As this diagram shows, we’ll instinctively move closer to a window to see more of what’s outside:
If someone is the same distance from the window as we are, we can see their whole body even if the window is only half the size of the person we’re looking at — their image in the window is only half their actual size. But if we move away from the window (as in the bottom panel), we can’t see their whole body — their image as a proportion of the window has gotten larger.
Of course, if we’re looking at our own reflection, it’s impossible to be a different distance from the mirror as our reflection, which means the reflection itself is always half our actual size, and it doesn’t change, no matter how far we move from the mirror.Twelfth Night at CSN

Objectives: Postmarketing studies of drugs forms an essential part of safety surveillance. In particular, this concerns new drugs as safety information of these by large rests on randomized clinical studies conducted on a limited number of subjects before licensing. Pharmacists in community pharmacies are in a unique position for detection of user experienced adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in relation to drug dispensing. The study reports from a research initiative exploring prompt and proactive ADR detection of liraglutide and reporting facilitated by pharmacy students undertaking internship in a community pharmacy in Denmark.
Methods: Nineteen pharmacy students undertaking regular 6 months’ internship—eighth semester—in a Danish community pharmacy participated in the data collection. Before the data collection, students attended an interactive training seminar addressing ADRs in general, organ symptoms, diagnostic classification, and pharmacovigilance systems. Pharmacy students approached recurrent drug users purchasing liraglutide. Participating users were asked about experienced ADRs linked to liraglutide use. Reported ADRs were collected and analyzed.
Results: Sixty-two liraglutide users participated in the study, of whom, 38 reported 84 ADRs possibly linked to liraglutide usage. Nausea was by far the most reported ADR followed by decreased appetite, diarrhea, fatigue, and abdominal pain (upper). The reported ADRs are in accordance with previously reported ADRs.
Conclusions: The study has demonstrated the feasibility of community pharmacy driven pharmacovigilance. The study supports the thesis that community pharmacists in the future may play a proactive and prominent role in patient-centered pharmacovigilance. drug reactions, community pharmacy, liraglutide, pharmacy students, pharmacovigilance

How the THE Rankings work.
The THE Ranking itself says that the deterioration in UZH’s position is primarily due to its performance in a survey of teaching. With no access to the survey data or precise details of the evaluation, UZH cannot verify this indicator..
While the decline in UZH’s citation rate since last year is only minimal (0.5 out of 100 points). Since the universities are very close together in that field, this has had a major impact on its ranking, which has fallen from 101 to 133.

Six days after the Malaysia Airlines MASM.KL..
"NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK"
But having conquered space, orbital nations have been rendered helpless by the sheer scale of the task back on earth.
".
With no firm evidence about where the plane was heading, whether or where it crashed or if it landed, authorities have yet to launch an official probe. Until those questions are answered, it remains uncertain which country would be responsible for such an investigation.
Even so, sources close to the informal investigation encompassing the world's leading space-faring nations as well as naval and air assets said on Thursday a brief "ping" sent hourly five or six times had been received by one or more satellites.
As they try to wring more information out of these faint carrier signals, experts will need to analyse the exact time of transmission and the strength of the signal. The number of satellites spotting the faint electronic blink will be crucial.
"If you have three or more data points, it should be relatively easy to triangulate where the aircraft is and the direction in which it is going in," said Elizabeth Quintana, Director of Military Sciences at the Royal United services Institute.
"However, the sheer number of aircraft operating in the area may make it difficult to pinpoint where the signal was coming from."
Satellite experts say the process of triangulation used to pinpoint the whereabouts of mobile phones might help narrow down the search, but would not be nearly as accurate as navigational results from the Global Positioning System.
"It will not be easy to find the position exactly because these are telecommunications satellites, not position-locating satellites," said Pircher. "To track positions by triangulation you need extremely accurate computer clocks."
Most aircraft are equipped to send and receive automatic text messages on any glitches to the airline via radio or satellite links, using either the medium-orbit Iridium (IRDM.O) constellation or the higher, geostationary satellites operated by Britain's Inmarsat (ISA.L).
Certain single satellites can also detect a position from, say, a distress beacon by taking advantage of the Doppler effect. But this is not available on either network used by the airline industry to handle fleet communications, Pircher said.
One industry source said it was possible to figure out the location of a ship or plane that is the source of a "ping" by calculating the distance from the satellite to the item and the angle of elevation. The source said that such information about Flight 370 could become available in the next few days.
Another U.S. government source did not rule out presence of some garbled data from the "ping."
DIFFICULT TASK AT BEST
Canada, France, Russia and the United States are also co-operating through in a satellite-based search and rescue venture called COSPAS-SARSAT, an official involved in the work said.
Inmarsat, whose systems were on the aircraft, said "routine, automated signals" were seen on its network during its flight from Kuala Lumpur, but Malaysian officials said none of them came after the Boeing 777 vanished.
Iridium said the "pings" from the aircraft were not handled by its satellites.
People close to the investigation into the disappearance of Flight 370 acknowledge gleaning clues from the plane's flight path and whereabouts from satellite data can prove to be a difficult task.
In at least two instances so far, officials thought they had run across satellite imagery that might have pointed to the location of wreckage from the 777 off the east coast of Malaysia, only for the information to be discredited.
A complete veil has been drawn over what co-operation, if any, has been provided by military or high-powered satellites.
The jet vanished in an area of regional sensitivities not far from the South China Sea and near the Malacca Strait, where the region's main actors have historically disputed over island ownership and maritime boundaries.
"It is possible governments have satellites looking, of course," Greaves said. "The question is, will we get to a point were people will come under pressure to come forward."
High-end electro-optical satellites may in any case be of limited use when so little is known about the jet's whereabouts because they are designed to look at very small, precise areas.
"You are essentially looking through a soda straw at a given area. So you have to know where you're looking," a U.S. government source said.

DIY Natural Food Dyes
DIY Natural Food Dyes. Molly Watson
Whether you want to dye frosting (as pictured below) or cake batter, milkshakes or pancakes, there's no need to turn to artificial colors—plenty of common, everyday fruits and vegetables can get the job done. Some specific examples are below, but feel free to work from this assumption: if something stains your hands while handling it, it can dye food.Continue to 2 of 8 below.

Beets = Pink to Magenta
Beet Food Dye. Molly Watson
If you just want a light pink, you can grate beets into a piece of cheesecloth or muslin and squeeze the juice out. For deeper, more intense coloring, use the juice rendered by roasted beets.Continue to 3 of 8 below.

Blackberries = Lavender
Blackberries as Food Dye. Molly Watson
With all their dark, rich natural color, blackberries lend a lovely lavender color to foods. As with other berries, you can simply squeeze fresh blackberry juice to make a dye. For a bit of frosting, simply put some blackberries in a piece of cheesecloth or muslin, twist and squeeze out the juice into the food to dye, and add more to reach the color you want.Continue to 4 of 8 below.

Blueberries = Light Blue
Blueberries as Food Dye. Molly Watson
Blueberry juice comes out purple but will dye to a light blue shade. You can see the difference in this photo between the juice still on top of the frosting and that which has been stirred in. For just a bit of color, put fresh or frozen blueberries in a piece of cheesecloth or muslin and squeeze a bit fo juice out; for more dye, whirl blueberries in a blender or food processor and strain. Use fresh for more delicate, but a bluer color; or boil down to half its volume for a more intense but... slightly more purple-shaded dye.Continue to 5 of 8 below.

Cherries = Pink to Red
Cherries as Food Dye. Molly Watson
Cherries, like other berries, make for excellent natural food stains. As with blueberries, for just a bit of dye and a lighter pink color, simply put a few cherries in a piece of cheesecloth or muslin, and twist and squeeze some dying juice. For a more intense color, pit the cherries, whirl them in a blender or food processor, strain the purée, and boil down to about half its volume. Let cool before using.
For a delicate pink, strawberries work too!Continue to 6 of 8 below.

Red Cabbage = Blue
Blue Natural Food Dye. Molly Watson
Red cabbage requires a tiny bit of extra effort to turn it into food dye, but the pure blue color is totally worth it. Chop about 1/4 head of red cabbage; put the cabbage in a saucepan with about 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to maintain a simmer, and cook 20 minutes. Strain or lift out and discard the cabbage pieces. Stir 1 teaspoon baking soda into the purple liquid to turn it blue. Boil to reduce to about half its original volume, or even more for a deeper and more intense blue,... let cool, and use as blue food dye.Continue to 7 of 8 below.

Spinach or Kale = Green
Spinach as Natural Food Dye. Molly Watson
Just as spinach and other dark leafy greens such as kale will stain your cutting board, they will stain other food. Whirl them in a blender or food processor, strain the purée through a fine-mesh sieve, and use the juice to dye food green.Continue to 8 of 8 below.

Turmeric = Yellow to Orange
Turmeric as Natural Food Dye. Molly Watson
The spice turmeric is used mostly for its color, and as a straight-up food dye it does not disappoint. You can use turmeric straight, simply stirring the powdered form into things. If you want to make a more traditional dye, dissolve 1 teaspoon turmeric in 1/2 cup water, bring to a boil and reduce by half. Use a little to make things yellow, and more to turn things orange.
Note that saffron also works for the yellow-to-orange section of the color spectrum. […]

"We have found out that Gaddafi is now several kilometers southwards of Sirte. He is constantly moving," Anis Sharif said.
He also said that the colonel was probably looking for a corridor to escape to Sabha, one of the few Libyan cities controlled by pro-Gaddafi forces.
"Death, suicide or a trial for Gaddafi - is a matter of time. And he's got little time left," Sharif said.
On Saturday the chairman of the rebel council, Mustafa Abdel Jalil gave a one-week ultimatum to Gaddafi loyalists to leave the cities of Sirte, Sabha and Bani Walid. The ultimatum expires on September 10.
Earlier on Monday rebels said that Gaddafi could be in the besieged city of Bani Wal)Weekend Stay-over at Parkroyal

Comment: And to tack onto Gould's point, presumably the pilots would begin an emergency landing at the nearest airport as soon as the attack began, so the hijackers would have limited time to do anything. The pilots could even manuver aggresively to make it difficult for the hijackers to work on electrical systems if they tried that.4 Recommendations
Comment: David,
You're right that I never served, but I don't see how that disqualifies me from pointing out flaws in your argument. All I can say is that I'm just as opposed setting different standards for women (or lowering the overall standards) as I am in favor of allowing women in combat roles if they can meet the requirements. Do you disagree that there are some women who would make better combat soldiers than some of the men that are currently serving? If the DoD is as bad as you say (and that's the problem you have with this whole issue), let's focus on fixing it, rather than keeping women out of combat.
Comment: I think you've got your facts mixed up. The Caracal Battalion is an infantry battalion in the IDF that has women and men serving together. It was formed in 2000 and is still in existence.Recommend

May 8, 2011, 3:59 PM EDT
The Detroit Red Wings play Round 2 of what they hope will be four elimination games against the San Jose Sharks tonight, but they might need to do it without two key weapons. The team didn’t hold a morning skate today, so there are some doubts about whether Pavel Datsyuk and Johan Franzen will play in Game 5.
Datsyuk is dealing with a wrist injury while Franzen has been hampered by ankle problems.
Actually, hampered is probably an understatement. Helene St. James probably put it the best when describing Franzen as “nearly immobilized” because of that sprained ankle. As much of a force as Franzen can be in the playoffs, I wouldn’t be surprised if he sat out tonight’s game. (Except that he’s a hockey player, so that throws almost all of the rules out the window, anyway.)
I would be a little more surprised if Datsyuk misses Game 5, although the St. James reports that he did miss Saturday’s practice. Many people make the case that Datsyuk is the best hockey player in the world, mixing outrageous stickhandling skills with crafty takeaway abilities to form a frightening on-ice skill set. He leads the Red Wings with 10 playoff points, so no doubt about it, he would be missed.
The most interesting nugget is that head coach Mike Babcock reportedly told Drew Miller and Mike Modano to be ready to play tonight if one or both of Datsyuk and Franzen cannot make it. Before Game 4, we speculated that Modano might end his career as a healthy scratch. Perhaps that would be the silver lining: at least one more chance for the future Hall of Famer to finish his career on a high note.
Of course, there’s no telling if either Datsyuk or Franzen will miss tonight’s game. We’ll let you know if any official word surfaces regarding their status, but it’s likely that both will be tough game-time)The Southwestern Historical Quarterly, Volume 62, July 1958 - April, 1959 Page: 132

Southwestern Historical Quarterly
The above seems to be true except for one major exception,
that is, the essay on "The Western World Frontier." It appears
that the author here accepts the thesis that the frontier has had
great effect on both the frontiersman and the region from whence
the frontiersman came. He reserves to himself the privilege, how-
ever, of determining how great the influence actually was. This
eminent historian not only accepts the theory of the frontier influ-
ence in American history but he is ready to apply it to all fron-
tiers. Instead of the significance of the frontier in American his-
tory, as Turner wrote it, he would make it The Significance of the
Frontier in World History. Thus he would extend the ideas ad-
vanced by Turner to include all the wide world.

States: Something about History and Philosophy of History.
By James C. Malin. Lawrence, Kansas (James C. Malin,
1541 University Drive), 1955. $3.50.
The later historical work of James C. Malin has dealt with the
North American grassland, studied from the most comprehensive
standpoint, as one among several of American regions. It has
taken seven volumes for Malin to report his historical findings
thus far. These volumes have appeared in an orderly sequence as
his thinking in the premises has unfolded. In 1944 he published
Winter Wheat in the Golden Belt of Kansas: A Study in Adapta-
tion to Subhumid Geographical Environment. This book was de-
voted to a four-county area in Kansas and exemplifies in telling
fashion his application of the ecological approach to the facts of
time and place in history. Essays on Historiography, issued in
1946, contains a notable piece on Nathaniel S. Shaler, who during
the 188o's and 189o's produced ideas of his own on the frontier
and on the grasslands. This essay deserves a careful reading by all
historians concerned with the region of the plains, high or low.
In 1947 Malin brought out The Grassland of North America:
Prolegomena to its History. This work of 335 pages treats of the
relations of the several sciences to the grasslands considered as a
region, with grassland formation and grassland equilibria as the

"That was a great caper o' yours Dan," they told him. "You want to practice that an' get it just right. It's useful."
He noted with a faint surprise that none of them remarked a significance in the fact that it was the Finn who had saved him. But when dinner was over and the men were getting to bed for the afternoon's sleep, he slipped aft to the sail-locker for a word with the Finn.
The doors were open now, and the place had light from both sides. The Finn did not look up from his work as Goodwin entered and sat down among the sails.
"You done me a good turn this mornin', Nick," said Goodwin quietly. "If it hadn't ha' been for you, I guess I wouldn't ha' seen 'Frisco again."
Nick's answer was his usual throaty grunt.

Director, Safe Motherhood Program
Adjunct Professor, Maternal Child Health Program, School of Public Health, UC Berkeley
Dr. Miller was the principal investigator on multiple studies of the Non-pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment (NASG) for the management of obstetric hemorrhage in Nigeria, India, Egypt, Zimbabwe and Zambia. These studies include comparative projects in hospitals in Egypt and Nigeria, and randomized cluster trails at midwife-staffed primary health care centers in Zimbabwe and Zambia.
Dr. Miller is a contributing investigator to the Continuum of Care for Post-Partum Hemorrhage Project, a multi-phase community-to-facility maternal health project in Nigeria and India. She is a co-PI, along with PIs from University of Illinois, Chicago, KNM Medical College and Gynuity Health Projects on a health delivery systems study of two approaches for using misoprostol to prevent postpartum hemorrhage at home deliveries in rural India. She is PI on an innovative, mixed methods study to develop a tool to measure reintegration among women with fistula repairs who return to their communities.
Dr. Miller’s expertise is called upon for international technical consultations by bi-lateral organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. She is on the Expert Panel on Induction and Augmentation of Labor, the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative’s (CMQCC) Hemorrhage Task Force, the Prevention of Post-Partum Hemorrhage Initiative’s (POPPHI) First Interventions Task Force, and the WHO Partnership for Safe Mothers’, Newborns’, and Children’s Health Effective Interventions Working Group. She was on the Technical Advisory Board of No Woman, No Cry, the global documentary on maternal mortality. She sits on the Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health Committee of the International Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (FIGO), for whom she has recently co-authored guidelines on the management of second stage labor, post-partum hemorrhage and best practice guidelines for NASG implementation. She is currently FIGO representative for the global Mother Friendly Facility Initiative, providing criteria for facilities to protect the human rights and dignity of women during childbirth.
She conducted a study funded by the National Institutes of Health to test traditional tibetan medicine vs. misoprostol for prevention of post-partum hemorrhage. Dr. Miller’s work in Tibet was the first randomized controlled trial ever conducted there, and included two years of ethnographic research and multiple publications, including some on the ethics of informed consent in research-naïve populations.
Dr. Miller has published over 65 journal articles and is co-author of the Hesperian Foundation's A Book for Midwives. She wrote, directed and narrated a training video for Pathfinder International, "Saving Mother's Lives: Community and Clinical Action to Address Post-Partum Hemorrhage." A new web-based toolkit for policy makers, clinicians, and trainers was recently launched on the NASG website.

With all the celebrations that revolve around the Christmas season, you are sure to end up needing some little gifts with the personal touch!
At Little Yellow Bicycle the Biker Chicks are sharing ideas for gifts that feature our brand new Once Upon a Christmas Collection.
Decorating a charger is a quick, easy and inexpensive. I picked this one up at Hobby Lobby for $2.
The great thing about chargers is that they come in so many different colors lately. I found this glossy black one and thought it would go perfectly with the black houndstooth and elegant damask papers that is included in the Once Upon a Christmas collection.
The paper crafting kit includes the beautiful poinsettias. I added large fabric covered brads to the centers of the large ones to pull in a bit more of the black. That beautiful little frame was picked up for $1.50 at Michaels. I pulled off the backing and framed a tag from the collection for the picture. After that, all you have to do is glue it down!
For the sccallops around the edges, I used punches. After I punched the edges, I trimmed them to 1 inch strips. To make it easily go around the circle, just give it a pinch below each scallop. It makes it easier if you use a scoring tool to score a line at each place the scallops meet.
Be sure to stop by the Little Yellow Bicycle Blog for more gift ideas!
When I saw this on the LYB blog, I fell in LOVE! What a gorgeous idea Robbie!!!

Bomb cyclones have been referred to as “winter hurricanes.” Our science reporter explains how they really work.By DREW JORDAN and CHRIS CIRILLO on Publish Date January 3, 2018. Photo by Alba Vigaray/European Pressphoto Agency. Watch in Times Video ». It was expected to bring more headaches to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast overnight when New York City was forecast to receive five to eight inches of snowfall and up to 10 inches in Queens and Nassau Counties.
The National Weather Service said blizzard warnings would take effect along the Virginia coast Wednesday, with travel “very dangerous to impossible” in the highly populated Hampton Roads region, which they said could receive up to 12 inches of snow in places. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia declared a state of emergency. Blizzard conditions were expected to begin on Thursday in parts of Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, according to forecasters.
“We’ve got plenty of bags of rock salt,” said Vic Kintanar, the manager of Waterman’s Surfside Grille, a restaurant by Virginia Beach’s boardwalk, hours before the storm hit. Workers had already closed off patio sections and were preparing for a smaller-than-usual crowd on Thursday.
Though much of the South is accustomed to occasional winter snowfalls, Wednesday’s storm was setting records, and setting teeth on edge, in a region where even a couple of inches of snow has the potential to hobble an entire metropolis — as was the infamous case in Atlanta in 2014, when a mess of snow and ice stranded thousands of cars on major roads for hours.Continue reading the main story
In Georgia, where Gov. Nathan Deal declared an emergency for 28 southern counties, snow fell across rural areas and in Savannah, a city that normally swelters. On Wednesday, Savannah’s temperature hovered in the 20s as the city recorded about an inch of snow.Continue reading the main story
In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency, and his office said the National Guard was on standby. The Raleigh-Durham area tied a record low of 9 degrees that had been set in 1887.
Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said the storm would move beyond his state overnight, but he warned that temperatures would remain frigid through the weekend.
Mr. McMaster urged residents to ensure people and pets were safe. “If they can’t get into heat, they’ll freeze to death, and they’ll be gone,” he said. “And the same thing will happen to people who are outside.”
At a grocery store in Charleston, S.C., Chris Brown, a father of two daughters, stocked up on food to prepare to be snowed in. “I can’t believe how heavy it is,” he said of the snow. “I’m heading home to play with the kids.”
An E.R. doctor in Atlanta says ‘this is the most challenging winter.’
The new round of shivering prolonged what has already been a difficult period in the country’s emergency rooms. more about one or two patients a day whose core body temperatures had fallen into the low 80s — normal is about 98.6 degrees — and required “aggressive re-warming” techniques.Continue reading the main story
So, what’s this about a ‘bomb cyclone’?
When discussing the storm, some weather forecasters have referred to a “bomb cyclone.” Calling it a bomb sounds dire, but such.
Why is it so cold? What’s the influence of climate change?
The Times’s Henry Fountain takes a look. Read more here.
The north, too, had begun buckling down for a major blow.
The Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with heavy snowfall and wind chills of up to  on Thursday. It was the second time in a year that the city made an early call to close schools ahead of a storm. Last March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced at noon the day before a predicted snowstorm that schools would be closed; in the end that storm was less severe than expected, but the mayor received little criticism for his caution.
Chilly gusts of up to 50 m.p.h. are likely to whip eastern Long Island and southeastern Connecticut starting late Thursday morning, with the potential for downed tree limbs and scattered power failures, the National Weather Service said. blizzard conditions along the New England coast.
The storm will follow a long period of deep cold that has already taxed transit systems, fuel supplies and homeless shelters in the region. Residents were preparing while insisting they had been through worse.
“It’s good to have at least four major meals ahead of you,” said Forrest McFarland, a retiree from Cambridge, Mass., as he made the rounds at Market Basket, a busy grocery store in nearby Somerville. “Since ’78,” he said, referring to the legendary blizzard that ground the Northeast to a halt, “everybody stocks up.”
Some like the cold: ‘Right now, 8 degrees is what we want.’
Washington, too, remained firmly in the grip of a winter that has already proved treacherous. The District of Columbia government activated its cold emergency plan on Dec. 27, and on Wednesday, it extended it further. Around an inch of snow is expected in the morning, with a winter weather advisory in effect until 11 a.m. Thursday.
While visiting, Hamlet Diaz, 38, said the temperatures were exactly what he was hoping for as his family drove home from an Ontario vacation to Pembroke Pines, Fla.
“We wanted to be cold,” he said of his wife, Rachel, and two daughters. “Right now, 8 degrees is what we.

The reason for this is simple…
“The implied value in graphic design is to train our students to perform ‘real’ projects as opposed to theoretical exercises. We continue to give our students basic problems to encourage them to think on their own. It is the charge of industry to supply the next generation of students (future designers) with the applied research in the field. The commercial designers are better equipped and funded to supply this end of the students’ education.”-Michael Kroeger
Kroeger gives us a basic chart on what the difference is between the two, to see it click on the link below.

As promised, we’re answering some of the questions on the HTC Inspire 4G that you guys sent us via our Twitter account. We were hoping for a few more questions, but since the Inspire is nearly identical to the HTC Desire HD, we realize many of you may have already has some hand-on experience with the hardware and software already.
To keep things simple, we’ve listed out your questions and given our answers directly below them. If any of you have any additional questions to ask, feel free to leave them in the comments and we’ll update this post to include them along with our answers.
When will the HTC Inspire 4G come to Sweden?
Never, the HTC Inspire 4G is an AT&T exclusive. European countries should all have access to the HTC Desire HD
What data speeds can the HTC Inspire 4G get over HSPA+?
We ran a few tests and found that average download/upload speeds to be around 2Mbps/500Kbps.
Can you install applications from “unknown sources”?
Yes, we have installed applications from our SD card and directly from Gmail. However, this may not carry over to launch since we don’t have any guarantee that the phone I am using is on the final software build.
How long does the battery last?
So far, the battery is at 45% after being unplugged for 7 hours. The 1250 mAh batter should last you an entire day.
Goes the HTC Inspire 4G support LTE?
No, the HTC Inspire 4G supports HSPA+, not LTE
Will the Inspire be updated to Android 2.3?
Looking at HTC’s track record, we assume that it will eventually get updates to android 2.3 and beyong. Just keep in mind that updates to any HTC phone are managed by the carrier and AT&T does not have the best track record.
Does the phone have a font-facing camera?
No, the Inspire does not have a front-facing camera like the HTC EVO 4G and upcoming HTC Thunderbolt
Is the HTC Inspire faster than the EVO?
In terms of processor performance? Completely! Check out our HTC Inspire 4G benchmark scores for more details
Does the HTC Inspire come with SWYPE pre-installed?
Unfortunately not, but since you can install applications from other sources, SWYPE can easily be install on the device.
Does the HTC Inspire come with headphones?
No. The box we received did not include headphones. Typically, T-Mobile is the only service provider to include headphones in the box.

Among the most commonly used strategies in the APiCS languages, we find cleft constructions. A cleft construction is a biclausal construction consisting of a focus clause and a background clause. The focus clause consists of the focus (i.e. the focused noun phrase) and normally a highlighter, either a copula or a focus particle).If you’re looking for stocks staging a huge year-end rally, look no father than Argentina.
But only look — don’t touch.
Yes, Argentina’s equity market benchmark Merval index is up a staggering 28% since late November, or ever since a U.S. appeals court stopped the countdown to a possible default on the country’s debt.
Too bad the proximate cause of the jump — a relief rally — and the country’s extreme economic problems and political uncertainty make the gains look unsustainable.
Unlike other sovereign debt crises, the fear with Argentina isn’t so much that a default would shut it out of the global debt markets. After all, the country hasn’t tapped external credit for more than a decade, or ever since it defaulted on $95 billion back in 2001.
However, another default would likely make it harder and more expensive for import/export companies to get critical credit in any currency — exacerbating already trying economic and corporate conditions.
A default would also be yet another black mark for a government that seems to go out of its way to scare off capital. The Argentine government’s renationalization of oil company YPF (NYSE:YPF) in early 2012 sure didn’t do itself any favors in reassuring already skittish foreign investors.
Indeed, global investors have been pulling up stakes and fleeing in droves. The flight of foreign capital accelerated to a three-year high of nearly $22 billion last year — and was stanched only when the government cracked down with strict foreign exchange controls. Had it not acted, the central bank was at risk of running out of dollars (which it needs to pay the foreign creditors it deems worthy of repayment).
Meanwhile, sluggish growth in Brazil, by far its largest trading partner, has Argentina’s economy coming in for a hard landing. After expanding at a torrid 9.2% rate in 2010 and 8.9% last year, GDP flatlined in the second quarter and will be lucky to hit 2% for all of 2012.
And then there’s inflation, which has been averaging 20% a year for years, even if the government won’t admit it. Heck, the official stats on this count are so dodgy that The Economist stopped printing them earlier this year.
Most important: Even if you wanted to plunge into Argentine stocks — that is, after missing the nearly 30% rally — it’s not all that easy.
You’re sure not going to invest directly — using dollars to buy pesos to buy stocks on the Merval — because capital controls would make that a roach motel: Your dollars will go into Argentina, but they won’t come out.
Furthermore, the only country-specific exchange-traded fund, the Global X FTSE Argentina 20 ETF (NYSE:ARGT), is rather illiquid and tiny, with an average daily volume of just 4,000 shares and net assets of about $3 million.
It also doesn’t help that because the ETF tracks only a small subset of the Argentine stock market, it has missed most of the upside. The Merval may be up 28% since Nov. 22, but the FTSE Argentina 20 Index, as tracked by ARGT, gained just 11%.
Even worse: For the year-to-date, the Merval is up about 15%, while ARGT is down about 15%. The FTSE Argentina index just isn’t a good proxy for the broader market in that country.
Sure, you could put together a basket of Argentina ADRs on your own, but why would you? Only 16 Argentine companies are listed on a major U.S. exchange. You get 25% more diversification just by buying the ETF, which captures those ADRs anyway.
There’s simply no good reason — or good way — to dive into Argentina at this point. The easy money has been made. And it could all come crashing down when Argentina and its bondholders go back to court in a couple months.

"I wanted to go BOOM and leave shrapnel on the wall."
John Sterling’s emotions are high at the beginning of his story, narrated by Don Eminizer, and the force of John’s youthful energy is felt by the readers well before they witness the young man’s emergence as a songsmith and guitarist. In the homeless American nights, John’s anxious spirits are soothed by two means: drugs and the company of his friends. Abandoned by his parents in his teens, there is no permanent place for John to settle down, and moving on is synonymous with life itself. John’s passion for music grows silently, and his artistic ventures are but brief forays; we come to know John as a walking volcano of creative energy, highly prone to self-destruction. But this will change when he becomes the lead figure of the musical band The Shattered Mirror, a channel that will at least stay him from erupting into death. As their band gets exposure, John finds his soul mate. He is close to seeing peace and success at last, but things hardly go the way he has dreamed.

Midnight In America
is inspired by, and based on, real life events of the author, and everything is seen through the eyes of the protagonist who is modeled on the author’s life in his younger years. In his interview with me, Don Eminizer speaks of John Sterling as a ‘quasi-fictional character’ based on his early years. The book captures a whole mode of existence in modern American society as a young man without a home or family. The loss of the good old days, when family life and controlled behavior were the ideals of happiness, is reflected in John’s discontent with constantly shifting places and one-night stands. There is no question that moving on is filled with the warm spirit of adventure and the pleasure of discovering and experimenting; and yet it lacks the soothing permanence that our artistic hero will choose, in the form of his love for his would-be mate Chris, a fictional character created out of the author’s imagination to make John’s aspirations more compelling and partly-fulfilled. The tragedy of life is that it comes without a guarantee. How John is drained of energy and passion for life after losing his beloved to a road mishap puts our very love of life to question. Is it worth the giving of our passionate soul when we may get no more from it than the corpse of our love?
Midnight In America
is a grasping tale of love, loss, and recovery. As John witnesses the fact that "bringing up pain and rage was easy but putting it away was a nightmare," we discover that love is not all about losing one’s self to passion but just the contrary: getting in control. This is the essence of John Sterling’s story: moving on with greater control in the face of all the recklessness with which life may smite us in the face. So there you can spot John, sitting by the grave of his beloved wife and playing his soul out to her through the strings of his guitar. He does not care about how odd he may look to the world. What he may not know is how the beauty of his love and passion for Chris and the creative spirit of his artistic soul will live on to inspire countless hearts who have loved, and have lost.
At the end of the book, the author includes a brief interview with Drew James, one of the author’s pals, about John’s erratic behavior and the rumors of his suicide. Given the quasi-fictional nature of John’s character, the reader might be confused about the accuracy of information and the way John is referred to as a real-life figure. From Eminizer’s interview with me, however, it is apparent that our hero, while his life tragically ended suddenly in the story as the result of an accident, was not as unsteady and out of control as we might suspect him to be after suffering the wounds of bereavement. The author leaves the rest to the readers to arrive their own conclusions. The story of the book itself, however, is not baffling; it is consistent and makes its point convincingly, leaving a lasting impression and a reserve of energy to enjoy life in a new light.
Don Eminizer’s
Midnight In America
is a captivating read, carrying, besides John’s life story, some original lyrics and sketches from the author’s musical group. As the light of John’s passion lingers after the book closes, the darkness of night gives way to meaning and peace.So I'll go month by month and last January just like this one I took barely any photo's.

Áreas de NegocioThe Contagious Gospel: Jesus as a Friend to Sinners
Christopher J Wiles
writer | speaker | servant
To finally put the last piece on this week’s series of posts, we need to go back to Luke 5. It’s right after Jesus heals the paralyzed man who’d been lowered through the window. And, as we saw, Jesus calls Levi away from his life as a tax collector to be a disciple of Jesus – and the “establishment” is a bit concerned about the company that Jesus seems to be keeping.
If your memory is really good, you’ll remember that we learned in Luke 4 (when Jesus read the selections from Isaiah) that Luke’s gospel intertwines the ideas of forgiveness and healing. It’s what Wright calls “the gift of shalom:” restoring God’s original goodness, or shalom, to each individual, both physically and spiritually.
CONTAGION
But the metaphor of healing can be taken another way, too, can’t it? You could easily see how sin might be viewed as a contagion – something “dirty” in that culture. That was the attitude of the Pharisees. They’d already started whispering rumors about Jesus behind His back. Jesus even picks up on it: The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ (Luke 7:34)
See, the central lie of religion is this: when the sacred encounters the profane, the profane always wins. Jesus spent time with some people religion tended to frown upon. The religious leaders assumed that if Jesus spent time with these people, He must be one of “them.”
QUARANTINE
Religious moralism is so concerned with keeping up appearance that it avoids broken people at all costs. The problem, as Jesus identifies it, is that healthy people don’t need doctors; sick people do.
Which means that when we look at Jesus, we don’t find a guy who’s actively trying to pursue the “wrong crowd.” He had a message of hope and healing, and that naturally drew people to Him. Craig Blomberg, a New Testament scholar, writes:
“Jesus thus defies the conventions of his world by his intimate association with a group of people deemed traitorous and corrupt in his society. Still, he does not condone their sinful lifestyles but calls them to repentance, transformation and discipleship.” (Craig Blomberg, Contagious Holiness, p. 102)
There is no “quarantine” procedure for Jesus. He gets right in and heals their brokenness. And He does so not by overlooking their sin, but by absorbing it.
JOHN COFFEY: ABSORBING EVIL
Most are familiar with the film The Green Mile, the film based on Stephen King’s serial novel. The main character is John Coffey, a death row inmate who proves to have an extraordinary power to heal. When the prison guards discover this power, they sneak Coffey from prison temporarily to see if his power can heal the warden’s wife, who is dying of terminal brain cancer in her home:
The clip shows an unexpected healer, bringing a shocking level of intimacy to this broken woman’s home. The fracture of the clock, the shaking ground – these things almost seem to call to mind the events of the cross: the earthquake, the tearing of the temple curtain. John Coffey’s initials are no accident, allowing the film to present us an unlikely Christ figure who absorbs the evil around him, bringing wholeness and purity.
We don’t have time to analyze all of the films themes (including where the film ceases to harmonize with Christianity), but Jesus does something like this: He can offer healing only because He takes evil on Himself through His sacrificial death on the cross. “The deformity of Christ forms you,” wrote St. Augustine. “On Him is the punishment that brought us shalom, [wholeness, goodness, peace].” Isaiah wrote. “By His wounds, we are healed.”
HOW GREAT A DEBT
This is something that no other religious system before was capable of. Even the various sacrifices of the Jewish legal system were meant only to point to the day when Christ would be sacrificed once-for-all.
In Luke 7, we see Jesus interacting with a “sinful woman.” The scene is right after Jesus’ complaint that the Pharisees think Him a “drunkard.” Luke places the story here because he has a point to make: the lie of religion is not always right. The Jewish laws stipulated that certain people were clean and unclean, just as we saw yesterday. But when the profane encounters that which is most sacred, the sacred wins. Jesus brings cleanliness through forgiveness of sins: He is the true and better sacrifice who can do this.
So it’s actually quite shocking when a woman of a “sinful” reputation (many believe her to have been some sort of prostitute) is associating with Jesus. She anoints Jesus’ feet not only with expensive perfume, but her own tears. But here’s where it gets messy: she lets her hair down. In Jewish culture, this was a level of intimacy that was potentially scandalous:
“The woman’s actions…need not be viewed as inherently erotic, but the observers would have viewed that at best as culturally inappropriate…and at worst as so sexually suggestive as to be shameful. [One commentary writer] points out that loose hair did not in and of itself link a woman with prostitution, and if she were unmarried it produced no stigma at all. But Simon’s response…clearly implies that her behavior here gave the assembly reason to disapprove of it.” (Craig Blomberg, Contagious Holiness, p. 133)
When questioned, Jesus tells a story about the magnitude of forgiveness. Two men owe a great debt: one owes just over two months worth of wages. The other owes two years. Obviously the one who had been forgiven the greater debt was the one who showed greater love. Jesus acknowledged the woman’s “many” sins (7:47). But because of this great relief she could show love in a way that the Pharisees could not.
INFECTING WITH LIFE
In chapter 8 we see this pattern continue, and Luke gives us two stories back to back in Luke 8:40-56. One is a woman with some type of bleeding disorder – apparently some type of menstrual issue. The other is a young girl, only 12, who dies before Jesus can even get there.
Both women remain nameless. Both are ceremonially unclean: the woman because of her menstrual bleeding, the daughter because she is dead. And notice in verse 43 that the woman had been bleeding for 12 years, the same amount of time the little girl had been alive.
But despite her uncleanliness, she reaches out and touches Jesus’ robe. And that’s when the miracle happens. Jesus does not become unclean from her touch, but by touching Jesus she becomes clean. When she confesses what she had done, Jesus tenderly calls her “daughter.”
Jesus’ healing does not stop there. When he gets to the little girl’s home, she has already passed on. But a touch of Jesus’ hand and the command of His voice lift her from the dead.
The Pharisees were worried that the unclean would infect the clean. Jesus infects everyone around Him with life.
SPREADING THE CONTAGION
This means that we have a whole new paradigm to look through. We don’t have to be like the Pharisees, sneering at others while we perform our quarantine procedures. The gospel teaches us that there is no division between the “good” people and “bad” people, only a division between the proud and humble, the forgiven and the broken.
This is a powerful theme of Luke’s gospel, one that is central to his entire portrait of Jesus. It is a message that Jesus’ followers are to carry out in their own day and age – to spread Jesus’ message of hope and healing in our own communities.
We’ll close with the testimony of Brian “Head” Welch, former guitarist for the band Korn, now a follower of Christ:
Christopher J Wiles
writer | speaker | servant
Chris is a writer and speaker from the Charlottesville area. He regularly serves as a research writer for Docent Research Group in addition to doing some guest speaking.
the women with the issue of bleeding was never unclean
the religious Jews judged her as unclean
as you said “the lie of religion is not always right”
Jesus saw her as God created her: in the image and likeness of God
the woman took on the judgment of her from the religious authority and culture in which she lived
She could sense innately that this man was different: he was unconditionally loving and unconditionally accepting with no fear or judgment, just LOVE, pure true Love
Christianity must start cleaning up its house: judgment must be replaced with LOVE and follow the true teachings of Yeshua HaMashiach, not the Pharisee-like behavior that I am seeing and experiencing far too often today.PhD - Psychology, MA - Psychology, Behavioural Medicine, Psychology and Mental Health, Forensic Psychology, Understanding Autism, Genomic Medicine, Understanding Depression and Low Mood in Young People

I'm a Software Engineer working at an Investment firm in Bangalore. Lately, I had been facing many issues at my workplace as well as at my home. At my workplace, I had begun to feel that my seniors have lost their faith in me and my colleagues don't see me the way they used to. I would avoid any social interactions as much as possible. I would be listening to songs on earphone all the time. I would eat my lunch alone and forget about me participating in any team activities. I could see my work quality deteriorating and I felt helpless. I couldn't even mutter enough strength to walk up to my peers and ask for help.
At my home, I have my parents who are both in their old age fighting with diseases like diabetes and thyroid. Every other day, I'd hear about one thing or the other going awry at my home, water flowing into the house, incorrect electricity bills by corrupt government officials. I care for them. And, I know they care for me too. But, when I know they are going through so much problems everyday, how can I expect them to provide me with emotional support. Heck, I wouldn't even feel comfortable sharing my problems. It would only add to their troubles. They certainly try their best when they find out someway that I'm struggling through some personal problems.
Everything just about everywhere around me is going wrong. Where do I go? What do I do? Some mornings I'd wake up with such clouded thoughts in my head that it'd take me hours to just leave my bed and start my day.
Luckily one of my very close childhood friend who lives in Delhi told me about Prof Singh. And, she made such a case that I decided to visit him. I called him, explained him the issue and told him that I want to meet him in person. After hearing about my problems, he explained me that he only follows the best scientific processes out there that he follows and how he would try his best to help me. So, I made travel arrangements and flew to Delhi from Bangalore. Our first appointment went for over 4 hours where he kept listening to me patiently, asking questions and giving answers. In those 4 hours itself, he untied so many knots that had become tied in my head over time, that I was already feeling very relived. And, I had not felt like this in months.
Next, Prof Singh recommended me to go for a test called the MMPI test. He explained me how it would help me understand myself much better, how it would make me aware of issues that I'm prone to and what measure should I take to keep my life in balance. I decided to go for it as my friend had also gone for it and she found it to be an eye opener. Next morning, I gave the test. Later in the afternoon, Prof Singh helped me understand the report, what it said and what that meant. And, I could now see many things that I wasn't even aware of earlier. Many things that I had been doing with a positive outlook were actually the ones that were hurting me. Then, there were issues that I felt had less importance but no it was high time for them to be addressed. An eye opener indeed.
It's been 3 months now. Things at my home are not so much better now, but thankfully, I have the energy to manage things at my workplace. And, I have the energy to figure out ways to help my parents back home and keep them happy too. I'm writing this feedback to serve as a thank you to Prof Singh for helping me out.
Also, I should mention that when my friend told me about the Prof Singh's consultation fee and the cost of test, I was in two minds about going through all this trouble. But, today, it feels like every penny was worth it. In fact, I feel that Prof Singh actually charge less for his time than he could.

On my way home from the U.S , we had made an appointment with Dr Singh. This is our 2nd trip home and our relationship is completely confused. I actually feel that life does not care about relationships and it has its own agenda. Our meeting with him was a lengthy regression into the past , the current and the future. The problem is that maybe we all want to draw from our relationships. When I gave Love I expected nothing, but we both complicated it by playing games with our relationship.
What i appreciated most was that this meeting was a therapy session that was a transpersonal experience with immediate bonding, and personally speaking, without bonding I cannot be congruent or feel genuine. It was quality counselling of depth with healing and something I call soul searching therapy. I would say, that as we were open to all forms of discussion which helped Dr Singh also to be able to speak freely, he assisted us in knowing a lot about ourselves through exposing vulnerabilities and it was relaxing to talk to a therapist who conversationally created healing to bring out the sene of awareness we had buried away somewhere.
Both my wife and I would be very happy to use his services again when we are back in India again.

Happy withDoctor friendliness, Explanation of the health issue, Treatment satisfaction
When my daughter was having her therapy, I asked prof singh about what I could do to help. He was really helpful, and he actually invited me in to have our own session. And that was really helpful in me understanding how Nupur had these dark thoughts, and how I was supposed to help her start thinking for herself. Nupur would be having, would be feeling a little low. And I would ask her what was wrong, and she said, I text my friend, and she's not texted me back. And she would have these thoughts that, effectively, she'd jumped to the conclusion that her friends didn't like her.
Pro Singh would help Nupur to recognise that there's a different way of thinking about why her friend hadn't text her back. The battery was dead on her phone, or her friend was busy. The more often we did it, the more often she would start to lift herself out of those thoughts herself. And that would help, help her think in a different way.
Whilst everything was going on with Nupur, I realised that I was depressed as well. I was suffering the low moods, irritability, tired, no energy. Just seemed to be sinking, spiralling out of control. Just wasn't getting any better. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, everyone was there. Not overbearing or anything, but a phone call, how are you doing? And I found that so important. Because soon as I started to look after myself, that impacted Nupur. Because if I was happy, and positive, and energised, she became positive and energised. And as we learnt in our sessions even when you don't feel like it, you've got to lift yourself up. And if you keep doing that, it will pay off. They will feel it.
You've got to look after yourself as Prof Singh repeatedly emphasised.

Simple Help
When I was very low or depressed, I would engage in self-harm behavior. You may be surprised but this meant I would start cutting or burning my skin even banging my head against my table. Parents were not very calm in order to try to understand what might be going on for me. My self-harm was transient and did not last for a long period of time, but normally took place when ever I felt anger, distress, fear and overwhelmed or hopeless. I think I just wanted to cope with something that feelt very difficult.
I think with Dr Singh I learnt that my trigger was a variety of things, including relationship difficulties, trauma, abuse, bullying, negative life events and general pressure around exam time. Cutting for me release all the built-up anger and frustration and pain I felt. School is stressful, home life I can’t handle sometimes. What Dr Singh taught me was something I wish my father had. how to Feelanything else apart from the distressing emotion, not escaping from fear, depression, fear or guilt or distressing images. How to relieve feelings or anger and frustration, and how to regain a sene of control to gain a sese of belonging

Living in India
I was looking for something to refresh our marriage, to bring us where we used to be, to find ourselves, and our love and our interests. We were just moving along and everyone thought we had it all. Success, children, expatriate living and we even had what everyone believed to be the ideal marriage.
Everyone we knew thought we were the lucky ones. Nobody knew that my husband broke the big one. We visited with the doctor nearest to our farmhouse in Gurgaon in the biggest hospital complex and true to word in 2 minutes flat I had a wonderful prescription for antidepressants that I could have easily got from Toronto. Our friends who had been here in a french company and had visited Dr Singh referred us to him and it was absolutely amazing. There we were with a doctor that understood and we could relate to. The manner he shed a light on our marriage that we wish we had seen a years prior, and helped us was amazing.
There was no intrusion and asking how something makes us feel or telling us what to do. It was all about us, and what mattered most was that we were together again and that was more of an anti depressant than what I had got. Did it help us? To say yes would be an understatement. It helped us achieve a relationship that is now better than it was something I never thought would be possible after the incident.

A few says ago I decided to visit Dr Singh as I am going to Europe for an MBA and wanted to understand the situation i find myself in. A lot of depression where all these dimensions of my life have proven too much for me. I have had this feeling that I’m not good enough to handle them and that I’ve never been good enough. I have been feeling even more stressed all the more by memories of how my parents coming from a small town in UP used to boost my brother while I was the star of the school. When I came to Dr Singh I have had threats I’ve run from, challenges I couldn’t meet, self-destructive actions, like locking myself in my room for days on end.
When I came to sir, the person I am, I’m certain, I was continuning to lose control to the pressures of living. The strange thing is that when I’m not depressed, everything looks different. I feel I can live the story of victory over challenges. Over time I have learnt how not to start to drift into emptiness with sir, how to manage an imbalance, tipping me into a spiral. One spiral takes me deeper into depression until it spins itself out. From the bottom of the whirling storm, I start to spiral upward on the other side. Some time ago I realised I have made a good choice in coming to sir. I saw how when I was there, two doctors had come to meet him for their child and how they were trying to aggresssively manipulate Dr Singh. In all the stress of meeting me and reassuring me as a doctor, as a father, as a psychologist as a well wisher , I saw sir handle them with the perfection that only a professional of experience and calmness can. These are qualities worth sharing and as I leave for my MBA I want to say, I will always be in touch with him, wherever I am. I really wish him the best for all the kindness he holds in his heart.

Like many other things in life, there are simply no easy answers to the problems I have been facing negotiating through life’s vicissitudes.
Truth-telling can be tricky when we talk about it within certain contexts. I have been struggling between being transparent or not, as instances of infidelity, I know can be terrible, and had been living with the thought that what my husband does not know, won’t hurt him. However, like most things in life that do not have easy answers, this proved to be more detrimental to me than anyone else. The last thing I wanted was for my partner to leave our marriage being the offended party. As Prof Singh put it candidly when I met him that the revelation may prove life-enhancing to one, but despairing to another. Yes, I was suffering as an individual, and as Prof Singh said - make your own decision based on the circumstances you are facing and what you want in life for I as he said would know more about the people involved and the surrounding circumstances, than him.
I wanted the guilt off me and all I wanted was for him to help me handle myself with dignity when the time came to say this to my partner. This he did and both my husband and I are glad we came to him, because truth-telling can be liberating and useful to a relationship, but also can lead to a lot of hidden hurt and loss of family ties. When my husband asked me why I wanted to share our incident on this forum, I knew that I wanted to close this saga and try to share with others in my situation that don’t suffocate yourself. If you need help, get it and work with your therapist to understand yourself and why things happened. That way you can save a lot of trauma to yourself, even before any issue.

Visited for marriage counselling. my husband and I were facing severe conflicts. We didnt know how to handle hence came to prof GB for help
Some context: My husband and I belong to two parts of India, which though unified and culturally very different (I belong north India and my husband from south). Our marriage was a love marriage. Unfortunately our parents didnot apporve our marriage when we were dating and decided to get married, thereby leading to isolation from our families. We tried to win them over because we really believed in each other and more importantly because we were really in love. Unfortunately despite our countless attemps, they didnot approve. Sadly, We had to go ahead with our marriage without their support.
Now, it had been 2.5 years since we got married, and the reality of life hit hard on us. Coupled up with the "lost spark" in our relationship and mounting work pressure, we faced a major financial setback. All this took a major toll on our relationship. Now without a lack of social and family support our relationship was falling to pieces.
As a last hope to save our relationship, we came to prof Gb to help us.
He patiently listed to what each of had to say. I really liked the way he listed to us without any judgement or bias, just pure and calm listening ears (all we wanted at this point in time).
After listening to both of us, like an orchestrator in a symphony he guided us to sort our problem by discussing with each other. At the end he gave us a few very insightful tips about how and why we should stay together . He was even willing to talk to our families ! (which we humbly declined, as we felt stronger to face them on our own)
The purpose of this note is a deep heartfelt thank you. Prof GB you really helped us save our marriage.

It is a myth to say that sadness and depression is a middle age persons or a rich man’s illness. A stereotype insulting to young people like me facing the same battle, albeit with greater difficulty since we may not be directed to the correct access to information and services. Also I have been putting up a smile face and at times a expressionless face since class XI. Now in a high pressure job in a law firm, I am capable of maintaining relationships with people I love and can smile and laugh and have a good time, but the extent of loneliness I go through I know.
Most parents and friends don’t know that if you live, love, or work with someone like me with depression, just remember that each person has a different story, the science of their depression could differ, the experiences and triggers vary, but the point remains: everybody deserves care and understanding. Honestly this is what I found when I came to prof singh. The comfort in seeing that he knew that everyone deserves care and understanding. I can say stress and loneliness chooses no age. I started working only a week after graduation. I was lured by promises of fame and a hefty salary. Everything went well for the first few months until the job felt like a beating and i felt that the job title, salary, and stability were no longer worth the stress, mental and emotional.
With constant care from Prof Singh, I am now able to manage myself much better. At times I feel like I am talking to a father figure, at times a Psychologist and times someone who just knows what to do and how to handle me.

I visited Prof Singh because, I am a chartered accountant and after finishing my studies, and my chartered accountancy I found myself working in a firm where I did not even know what I am doing. When I was studying I had a goal, when I was doing my chartered accountancy I had a goal, and suddenly here I was working for a company where I expected my seniors to be teaching me, but more than teaching me I was being given numbers to check, and the agitation and frustration was when I had to leave for my house at 730 Pm and my boss would come and give me work which would keep me back to 10 o’clock in the night.
I did not know what to expect when I came to Prof Singh, but the one thing that I began to understand after doing a clinical assessment was that, I had lost complete structure in my life, and was becoming a victim of my own thinking, where I was notable to say no to my boss neither was able to say yes and the net result was that I was extremely stressed out all the time.
Prof Singh with all his empathy, virtually treated me like his kid, and explain to me that at my age how things should be, how they should evolve and how I need to take care of myself personally as well as emotionally, for me to feel wonderful from inside as well as outside. he has been a wonderful help, and more than a psychologist she has been and has become a kind of mentor where you can go to him and ask him about everything you want to do, and he will guide you so perfectly that what he says is exactly what will eventually happen.
I want to thank you so because, it is now after four months I realise why you wanted me to look at myself from the outside as well as from the inside, and why you wanted me to broaden my horizon, rather than being stuck in a narrow tunnel, and I think I am now much better off because I am able to take the risks that I would have never taken had I not been guided by him how to look at life, with a broader perspective.

Get the free Practo AppRed Rooster is very pleased to announce its first line up of artists, including the Friday night headliner for 2018, Pokey LaFarge
Hailing from St. Louis, Missouri, Pokey LaFarge and his band capture the authentic dust-bowl era sound of American roots, blues and swing. His new album, ‘Manic Revelations’ epitomises this honest southern-style commentary. Whether it is about controversial shootings or personal experiences the focus is on observing all aspects of modern life. Reflecting the current maelstrom of noise everywhere in the world he says the music this time is bigger and louder. It certainly demands your attention.
Alabama 3 acoustic will be headlining the Thursday night, getting the party started with their riotous mix of blues, gospel and country. Larry Love's gravelly ash-stained vocals and Nick Reynolds bank robber melodies on harmonica guarantee a raucous show. Well known for their theme tune to hit US TV series “The Sopranos.”
Also, on the first run of acts, are Red Rooster favourites Daddy Long Legs, who make a welcome return to the festival having last played in 2016. New York City's most beloved blues bashers have been huffing and puffing and blowing houses down on a nightly basis on their infinite world tour and always bring an elevated level of rough and ready intensity to contemporary lo-fi blues.
Staying on a New York theme, catch the hottest late-night underground night - Jonathan Toubin and his New York Night Train Soul Clap & Dance Off. Awarded ‘Best DJ’ in the Village Voice 60th anniversary ‘Best of NYC’, Jonathan Toubin brings the late-night underground and retro cool to the dancefloor. Lost Sixties soul tracks and rare retro gems will be guaranteed to get the Red Rooster boys & gals into the groove.
Austin, Texas-based songwriters Brennen Leigh and Noel McKay make a welcome debut at Red Rooster to perform their craft story songs. Their duets comprise equal measures of heart and humour reflecting that rich country tradition. Their debut collaboration spotlights these celebrated troubadours in peak form (“Before We Come to Our Senses”). “These are modern day country duets à la George Jones and Melba Montgomery.”
Born into a world of creativity, the daughter of renowned artist Olivier O, Sarah Olivier brings an explosion of Chanson, Rock 'N' Roll & Blues, straight from Paris – one of France’s top rising stars.
Northern Ireland’s The Bonnevilles will be bringing their heavy licks and head-knockin’ back beats to Euston Hall. They don't so much play punk blues as use it as a springboard to create a completely new genre.
London’s brilliantly quirky duo Worry Dolls, having supported Joan Armatrading and received praise from Paul McCartney, will be serenading the Red Roosters with their sublime harmonies and tongue-in-cheek, honest lyrics.
Then five-piece all female led group Dana Immanuel & the Stolen Band join the party with their bourbon soaked alt-country eccentricity, whilst Norwich’s 4D Jones are also checking in at Euston Hall. They’ve been tearing up the Rhythm & Blues rule book for many decades and showing no sign of settling down anytime soon.
Rootin’ Tootin’ Kids Commotions for 2018
Red Rooster is welcoming to families. There’s an array of fun activities for kids: from mask-making workshops where they can deck their face out and partake in the Mardi Gras parade, or how about trying to puncture the Piñata, or maybe go along to a hula hoop class? There’s traditional country-style games - ball in a barrel, hook a duck, the coconut shy - and, for the more daring cowboys and cowgirls out there, how about learning to dance with Daisy Duke or rodeo riding with some of the most rootin’ tootin’ kids around? Don those cowboy hats and boots and shake a leg.

Chris, Thank you very much for your candid and complete reply. Mythweb is up and running, mainly due to the contents of conf.php. That is, your instructions are quite good and I thank you for giving the MythTV users a very useful tool. Ten months ago, I had Mythweb up and running on an old system that used all RPMs. I knew nothing of how anything worked then, everything just worked! This year, I am using all CVS versions and want to know how everything works, so I pressed (a bit too hard) for an answer to the conf.php item. It took me three tries to get Mythweb up this time. After each try, I went back to the conf.php file, compared my work with the steps you have in there. Each time, I had to correct something, and one less error message came out. Finally, Mythweb came up beautifully, and I was able to accomplish the ultimate goal of deleting a channel, using Configure -> Channels. Thank you again for your kind, considerate reply. -- MMMary Wollstonecraft Shelley

Just a moment...What do you look for at garage sales?
THE COASTER asked these bargain-hungry Shore-area residents, “What do you look for at garage sales?” this week…and here are their replies (and some of their found treasure):
FOLLOW The Coaster on FACEBOOK here.
Lauren Van Patten & Reece Brutsman, Avon – Reece: Computer stuff. I like old computer stuff. Lauren : Some antiques. Old things.
Tom & Abby Anton, Bradley Beach – Today we were looking for rowboats and guitars. We look for unusual furniture, collectible furniture. We’ve scored some really good tools, bicycles and musical instruments. Sometimes we keep it and use it. Sometimes we give it away as a unique gift.
Liz & John Cappaluni w/Charlie, Avon – Liz likes antiques. John likes tools, golf items and baseball cards.We like Victorian era furniture.
Louis & Carl De Pazzo, Bradley Beach – Anything that’s collectible. We go out every weekend except when we’re fishing. Today we found a blown glass seashell and a music box made in England. Louise collects cookbooks. The nicest thing we found were old barber bottles. Louise bought a $3,000 grandfather clock for $75.00.
Burke & Joanne Ellmers w/Mugsy, Bradley Beach – Typically antique items. We’re looking to turn a profit. We like to buy low and sell high, like commodities. We love the Coaster. We get it at the Buttered Biscuit.
Joyce Gentile & Donna Bobertz, Pt. Pleasant – Joyce: I look for bargains, things that are nice, but cheaper then in the stores. Books. Sometime you can repurpose for crafts. Donna: I look for unusual things that you can’t find in the store. Unusual things, different. This time of year things for the yard, planters and such.
Ira James w/Elvis, Ocean – I look for my wife, first, because she drags me here and she does a lot of antiquing. And a happy wife is a happy life.
Marie Johnston & Beverly Johnston, Avon – We look for anything and everything.But you have to shop around at garage sales. You have to look around. We’ve made wonderful finds.
Charlotte Kirk, Avon – I don’t look for anything, at my age. I host garage sales now. i’m downsizing, getting rid of all the stuff I thought was so important at one time or another.
Neil Moschel, Spring Lake Heights – I look for old trucks. I buy for fundraising. It’s for a good cause. It keeps me out of trouble. I have a shop with cable TV in my garage. I meet nice people.
John & Jacquie Olson, Neptune City – We look for toys for our niece. Things to play with the family. We bought a fooseball table last year. We bought a nok-hockey game today. We’re looking for old furniture that we can refinish.: Vehicle Covers. 
A Carport for Every Situation
No. 
Thinking Outside the Box with Your next Carport
Are you having an event in the near future and are looking for a cost effective way to bring shelter to your venue? Our carports are not only for the usual car storage, but can be used for numerous things such as your next special event. Whether it be a family reunion, graduation picnic, wedding reception or corporate day luncheon; your carport can, in all actuality, be dressed up or dressed down to meet any need you have. 
The Advantages of Carports
A carport is a strong and durable structure that is designed to protect a vehicle, truck, or even boat from different types of nature’s elements that could occur. Carports come in all shapes and sizes, and they come in a number of materials as well. Metal carports are the most durable for long term use or heavy duty protection. They can either be freestanding or attached to a wall or your home, whichever you prefer. There are many advantages to adding a carport to your home: Back And Forth About Wilson

"I hate each and every one of you media dirtbags"
Editor
If there's any doubt right now about whether the Leafs are in free-fall mode, there shouldn't be. This is the definition of plummeting. The team is torpedoing down through the standings, and right now it's the goaltenders who are rightfully taking a lot of the heat.
But now, as expected, the head coach is taking his fair share as well. Whether it's warranted or not is still up in the air, and will be debated over by many in the next few days until either (a) Wilson is canned, or (b) the Leafs turn this thing around.
Personally, I'm undecided on what I think should happen with the head coaching job in Toronto right now. While many have chosen to pick a side, I'm not sure I can say for sure whether the Leafs should rid themselves of Wilson or just stand pat and let things carry on. But regardless, there are certainly two sides to be explored here.
In the realm of pro-Wilson - which is losing residents at an alarming rate - it can be argued that the head coach has still yet to have a solid team on the ice, and many of his problems lie in brutal goaltending; basically something he cannot control. Fair enough.
From my own view, one of the things that would bother me about being in Wilson's position is that he's sort of handcuffed in terms of his own roster. Since Burke has failed in some recent signings - mainly Komisarek and Armstrong's 7.5 million dollar pressbox salaries - Wilson has been put in a tough spot from time to time when trying to get the right group of guys on the ice. He has to deal with guys being pissed off about whether they believe they should be playing, as was evidenced earlier this season when he had that little media spat with Cody Franson. It's hard to have sympathy for super-rich athletes and coaches in that type of situation, but it still makes things tough - players want to play, and whether it's in the media or not, you know the guy who sits isn't pleased.
Another pro-Wilson argument would quickly point out the successes of players like Kulemin, Grabovski, and MacArthur who have all, at one point, found new levels to their game during his tenure. Luke Schenn used to be part of that group but we're unsure what to think about him at the moment (same can be said for Kulemin I guess, but he's lower profile). Most recently, Jake Gardiner has been given a boatload of responsibility despite his young age, and it's good that Wilson recognizes his skills, so one could point to that in a "Save Wilson" campaign as well.
In the "Fire Wilson" party there are a lot of folks who will point to the penalty-kill woes, the lacking defensive system that may be burying the Leafs' own defencemen and goaltenders, and a dearth of communication between player and coach. Wilson has been criticized in the past for not being a "player's coach", so his detractors could load that one up in their arsenal.
I'm not saying either side is right or wrong, and there are solid arguments from both..
There's no doubt that Wilson absolutely has to be fired for this reason should the Leafs miss the playoffs, and I'll revisit with a Fire Wilson article of my own at season's end. If he's let go before that, perhaps the best route would be to keep Scott Gordon around in the interim and then make a decision on Gordon, Eakins, Carlyle, or whoever else's name may pop up in the summer months.
Through all of this, whether you're on the "Fire Wilson" team or not, it's only right that these questions are being raised at least.
February 26 2012, 01:59PM
I agree that if he's gonna go, it's not necssarily because it is all his fault, but because something has to change. One thing about this season is that despite the recent slide, the team is not out of it yet. I suspect the passing of the trade deadline with either something or nothing happening will rejuvenate the team. Then we will see.
I see a couple possibilities.
1) Fire Wilson, put Gordon in for now, and them go with Eakins next year. Maybe a coaching change will shake things up. I think someone did a post on that somewhere.
2) Give Wilson the rope to hang himself. Basically, if the Leafs make the playoffs, he can keep his job. If they don't, next fall, it's Eakins time.
I really want to see Dallas Eakins get a chance to coach this team. He seems like the perfect next fit. But Wilson casts a long shadow.

Since then, he’s played nine games with his new club and is slowly starting to settle in.
From Dean Lombardi saying his coaching staff needed to give him a foundation, to coach Darryl Sutter reminding everybody Ellerby is still a young player and needs more seasoning before becoming a full-time NHL player, it probably hasn’t been quite the party he expected since hearing he’d be joining the defending Stanley Cup champions.
Still, it’s been nothing but a positive experience for the 24-year old former first round draft pick.
“Bernie (Jonathan Bernier) and Doughty, we’re kind of all the same age and we played together before a little bit,” said Ellerby. “So, I’ve bonded with them pretty well. But, this room is just so tight, such good guys, it’s just a good locker room to be a part of. Everybody is so welcoming and warming, so it’s been a pretty easy transition getting to know everybody.”
Outside the room, he credits assistant coach John Stevens – who typically works with the guys on the blueline – as one of the people helping him make the adjustment from the Eastern Conference to the much different Western Conference style of play.
“He has been amazing,” Ellerby remarked. “We’ve done video every day, and have just sat down one-on-one and been looking over shifts, other team’s tendencies, and that kind of stuff. He’s been an amazing help so far and is obviously going to continue to be a big help with my development and my progression over the rest of the season and hopefully for a long time down the road.”
That evolvement of Ellerby’s game is a work-in-progress. Brought into the Panthers organization with high expectations, his role is different in Los Angeles. He doesn’t have to be one of the saviours of the franchise. Here, he just needs to be a solid, defensive-minded defenseman. Make a good first pass and shut down the opposition. That’s not asking for too much, is it?
Oh, and learn the Kings’ system while still playing games just about every-other night due to the compacted, shortened season.
“Going from one team to another there’s always going to be ups and downs and different things,” he began to explain. “The system here is the opposite of what it was in Florida. It’s a whole learning curve, and it’s all part of the game. It’s like going back to school, learning on the fly. I’m just really focused on what I need to do defensively, and doing it within our system.”
Statistics don’t always tell the whole story, but for the most part, his numbers haven’t been a problem. After averaging about 18 minutes a night over his first four games with the Kings, things have been cut back to about 13 minutes, and part of that has been situational.
He’s also only had one game where he was a minus for the night (minus-2 at Chicago) and is a plus-3 since the trade.
Better yet, to hear him tell it, he’s starting to find his groove.
“I think the Alberta trip I was a little – I don’t know if I was nervous, I had never played in front of my family and stuff like that before. So, I was over thinking things a little too much and I think it affected my play a little bit. Since we’ve been back, I think I’ve settled back down to keeping things simple and just playing a good solid defensive game. I think with this homestand it’s (allowed) me to keep building my game, and work on things that need to be worked on and just keep getting better.”
One game at a time. That’s all a coach can ask for.

He really looks like he’s improving. He’s got good hockey sense and reads plays well. I know he’s an RFA this summer, but I kinda hope he sticks around for a while
Elerby was such a good pick up. I can see him as a future #33. Mitchy plays one hell of a game but this guy has all the tools to take the reigns. This trade seems to be right place right time for Elerby.
Loktionov for Ellerby? Advantage Dean!
Not so fast. Loktionov has 3 goals in 6 games for the devils.
He could score 50 goals this season, he wasn’t going to be on the Kings roster. So, a trade for a defenseman at a time of need seems like a win.
agreed. it would be typical of the kings to not have a 50 goal scorer on their roster.. play to your strengths > play a “complete game”.
im just heckling and proding. to be more to the point i just dont believe the kings see their players for what they are. sorry for my immaturity. been a kings fan since ’97 and i simply think this roster is the best. there is no present roster set up like this one. could be doing more offensively.Photos with tag: Royalty

Pea-barley intercrop N dynamics in farmers fields.
In:
11th Nitrogen Workshop - Book of Abstracts, INRA - National Institute for Agricultural Research, 11th Nitrogen Workshop - Book of Abstracts.
Knowledge about crop performances in farmers’ fields provides a link between on-farm practice and re-search. Thereby scientists may improve their ability to understand and suggest solutions for the problems facing those who have the responsibility of making sound agricultural decisions. Nitrogen (N) availability is known to be highly heterogeneous in terrestrial plant communities (Stevenson and van Kessel, 1997), a heterogeneity that in natural systems is often associated with variation in the distri-bution of plant species. In intercropping systems the relative proportion of component crops is influenced by the distribution of growth factors such as N in both time and space (Jensen, 1996). In pea-barley intercrops, an increase in the N supply promotes the growth of barley thereby decreasing the N accumulation of pea and giving rise to changes in the relative proportions of the intercropped components (Jensen, 1996). The pres-sure of weeds may, however, significantly change the dynamics in intercrops (Hauggaard-Nielsen et al., 2001). Data from farmers’ fields may provide direct, spatially explicit information for evaluating the poten-tials of improving the utilisation of field variability by intercrops.

From the newly revamped Saint-Roch neighborhood to the historic streets of Quartier Petit Champlain and Vieux-Québec, this French Canadian city has many faces. If you have time, try to visit these major neighborhoods but otherwise, this guide should give you an idea of which spots you will gravitate toward most.
Saint-Roch
Let’s start with my favorite neighborhood. If you had visited Saint-Roch ten or more years ago, you might have wondered why you wandered here in the first place. Since then, the neighborhood has seriously been revamped and nowadays it’s a bohemian hub for avant-garde art, trendy restaurants, bars, fashion boutiques and hair salons. In reality, everything you need is within a block or two of St-Joseph Street. Eat lunch at Le Cercle which actually doubles as an indie music venue or grab a beer at one of the local breweries like La Barberie or Korrigaine.
Vieux-Québec: Haute-Ville (Upper Town) & Vieux-Québec: Basse-Ville (Lower Town)
I’m lumping these two areas into one because Lower Town is basically an extension of Upper Town. Château Frontenac is one of Haute-Ville’s major landmarks and it’s pretty hard to miss. Around this area there are often street performers, restaurants with small town charm and side streets where vendors sell artwork. From here, you can either walk like I did or take the funiculaire to Basse-Ville, which features similar style architecture. Wander through the cobblestoned streets, visit the Museum of Civilization or hop on the ferry for an evening view of the city.
Parliament Hill
This area of Québec City is a few minutes walk from Vieux-Québec and is also close to both Battlefield Park and the Plains of Abraham, a massive public park. Within the park you can watch the Changing of the Guard at La Citadelle. The main street around Parliament Hill is Grande Allée and it’s sometimes referred to as the Champs-Élysées of Québec City. There are eateries for every budget and big hotels like the Hilton and Hôtel Château Laurier among others. Compared to the rest of the city, Parliament Hill may feel a little less exciting but there is still plenty to do here.
Saint-Jean
Another bohemian-worthy neighborhood, Saint-Jean has enough boutiques, cafés, restaurants and grocery stores to keep you entertained for hours. The laid-back, friendly atmosphere is reminiscent of Saint-Roch and in fact, you can take the elevator or stairs from one to the other. History buffs should visit J.A. Moisan, the oldest grocery store in North America, dating back to 1871. I also enjoyed waking through the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Church and St. Matthew’s Church cemetery. If you stay on Saint-Jean street you will eventually hit Haute-Ville.
Montcalm
This district, particularly Avenue Cartier is bursting with personality. The district includes a couple major attractions like the Plains of Abraham and the Musée National des Beaux-Arts du Québec. To give you an idea of where Montcalm is located compared to the rest of the city, it is southwest of Old Québec and runs from Salaberry Avenue to Belvedere Avenue and is mainly a residential area. I visited this neighborhood twice during my trip and I found a slew of restaurants with outdoor seating, lively bars, gallery spaces and even a few street artists.
Quartier Petit Champlain
Translating to “Little Champlain Quarter,” this area is believed to be the oldest commercial district in North America. While it’s technically it’s own little neighborhood, it’s part of the district of Vieux-Québec, which means romantic cobblestoned streets, art galleries, restaurants and souvenir shops. The Breakneck Stairs is Québec City’s oldest stairway built back in 1635. Don’t worry though, the stairs are sturdy thanks to continuous restorations. Make sure to take a look at the Rue du Petit-Champlain that visually tells the story of the district’s history.

"Nomination Oversights May Be Obama’s Biggest Sin"
Ezra Klein things a FHFA-driven mass mortgage refinancing scheme is unlikely because FHFA Acting Director Edward DeMarco seems skeptical and back when Obama tried to replace DeMarco with a permanent director “Senate Republicans blocked the Obama administration’s nominee, Joe Smith, after he expressed some support for using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to heal the housing market.”
What’s striking if you follow the link is that Obama didn’t even send Smith’s name to the Senate until November 12, 2010—basically two years after the election. The fact that the FHFA Director, though not the most important person in the universe, had an important role to play in managing the economic crisis seems to me to have been perfectly foreseeable. And it also seems to me to be overwhelmingly likely that had a nomination been made in a timely manner, confirmation by the 111th Senate would have been possible. Like the failure to make timely nominations to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors this isn’t something that people saw as a big deal at the time, but that in retrospect has enormous consequences.Are you sure?

ABSTRACT The embedded technology is now in its peak and its uses are mind blowing. Embedded technology plays a vital role in integrating various functions and thus it reduces man power, saves time and operates efficiently without human intervention. RFID is a new technology and takes a major role in the embedded system. This project describes about design and Implementation of Advanced Student Tracking System. It is designed to track the movement of the students within the college campus as well as automatic Attendance monitoring without human intervention using RFID technology. The proposed system has hardware and software components. The hardware architecture consists of an RFID active tag, RFID transceiver, systems interconnected and database server. The transceiver is distributed around the open area within specific limits. The tags which are given to students consist of unique id on it which cannot be duplicated. The PC can be connected to the transceiver to read the tag id .Software architecture COMM program, an Application Programming Interface (API) that handles and analyses the data, a friendly GUI and a database that saves as well as retrieves all the student information. General Terms Active tags, Passive tags, RF Readers, Local server, Backend system (Master) Keywords Radio Frequency Identification, Authentication, Tracking system, Graphical User Interface. INTRODUCTION Our project Domain is Wireless Network and we are working on connecting a Wireless Network to a Centralized Server via RFID. RFID is abbreviated as Radio Frequency Identification. It is a wireless technology. It is a technology that uses communication through the use of radio waves to transfer data between a reader and an electronic tag attached to an object for the purpose of identification and tracking. Radio Frequency Identification can be in the form tags or chips. Based on it Radio Frequency Identification is generally of three types: Active Passive Semi-Passive
Active - An active has its own transmitter and a power source to power the microchip’s circuitry and broadcast signals to an RFID reader. The power source is either connected to a powered infrastructure or uses energy stored in an on-board battery. Active tags are usually very costly.

The battery is usually used to power a sensor. The existing system present for the purpose of human tracking is Mobile RFID Tracking System. Semi-passive tags have longer read range than ordinary passive tags. It gets the request from the client and then sends the electromagnetic waves to the reader. A passive tag also has an indefinite operational life and relies on reflecting back the electromagnetic (EM) field generated by the reader and modulating the reader’s EM incident on the antenna to send information back. the reader then sends the electromagnetic waves to the tags.The complexity. like a passive tag without a battery. Thus the tag which has the information about the object sends the information about the requested objected to the reader and the reader in turn sends the info to the backend systems. in general. When a tag passes through an electromagnetic field generated by a reader. the reader’s function is to generate an electromagnetic (EM) field to power tags and facilitate communication with tags. BACKEND SYSTEMS .A passive do not have its own power source and scavenges power from the electromagnetic fields generated by readers. However.This EPC is a unique identification code for identifying the objects.The Backend Systems is used as a Centralized Server. 2012 Passive . using RFID technology. the tag communicates back to the reader the identifying information. RFID readers communicate with tags using a radio frequency interface. The data stored in the tag is usually referred to an Electronic Product Code (EPC).The antenna communicates with the tags via the radio waves. EXISTING SYSTEM We made a survey on various tracking systems that are being employed for the purpose of tracking the goods and tracking the children within a specific limit. Semi-Passive . The external construction of RFID tracking system has the following three main components: Tags Readers Backend system TAGS . It consists of Integrated chip(IC) which are used to store the information about the objects to which the tags are attached as an electronic code .
Park . Traceability is nothing but to track the current position of the object and by doing so we can trace the past history about the movement of object and also we can predict the future movements of the object.This system’s software architecture concentrates on both in the establishment of the network and to produce the output which shows the location of the individual through GUI and the information about the individual is also been published.

The tags are programmed with kid’s profiles and are worn by the kids.g.etc. The Fig:2 simple demonstration of Mobile RFID Tracking System PROBLEMS IN EXISTING SYSTEM The major problems in the Mobile RFID Tracking System are as follows: The system is designed only for the children with specific age limits In this system single rfid tag is used by many users frequently and hence there will not be any type of privacy constrains involved here This system is exists only for limited area This system will be employed only to spot and to trace the movements of the users within a specific limits e. The main motto of using RFID in our project is Tracking or Traceability. SOLUTION Our proposed system deals with the construction of wireless network and connecting it to a centralized server for the purpose of effective human via wireless LAN. 12 & 13 April. park.
This system has high data rate and long range of transmission since the RADAR is been used in the system instead of transceiver.

CONCLUSION Since our system uses the external type of RFID it lacks in some part of authentication and hence we have found the system which uses an internal type of RFID called the RFID666 which provides cent percent authentication. The special feature of this system is The chip here used is an internal rfid chip It will of small in size say 11mm and can be easily embedded into the internal part of the human body without causing harmful effect and hence no way of malfunctions can be done. 2012 The following are the major advantages of our proposed system: This system has higher performance rate than the existing system Since each individual will have their own rfid tags data privacy will be maintained.International Conference on Computing and Control Engineering (ICCCE 2012). These system also consist of the application like automated smart attendance system and also the system which is used to spot the students who leaving the college campus during the college hours.

results can be disappointing and costly. In addition, schools risk vendor lock-in that can be difficult and expen- sive to resolve. WiFi does have some drawbacks, however. While WiFi networks are a good way to offer broadband connectivity and some mobility to students, they use unlicensed spec- trum that can become overloaded from too many users, degrading the quality of the service. One of the biggest differences between WiFi and cel- lular service involves emergency calls. WiFi was not designed to provide location information required when an emergency call is made to 911. For DAS vendors, this is a key selling point, especially since the Federal Communi- cations Commission estimates that about 70 percent of 911 calls are made from cellphones. "Parents want assurances that, in the event of an emer- gency, students can contact 911," says Seth Buechley, president of SOLiD, a provider of DAS and optical net- work solutions. "Similarly, they want to know that commu- nications from first responders and school administra- tors-- car- riers, and neutral-host providers are needed to manage expectations among the parties involved. While a univer- sity may want the best possible service in every building and around campus, such a goal may be unrealistic, says Tormod Larsen, CTO of ExteNet Systems, a neutral-host MOBILE INFRASTRUCTURE DAS DEPLOYMENTS can require large upfront capital investments and be financed in a number of ways. There are three basic ownership models, but all require carrier approval: 1) In a carrier-owned DAS, a wireless service provider pays for the equipment and installation costs, as well as any maintenance and upgrades. While often built for exclusive use, the operator may charge other operators to attach to the DAS. 2) Building owners and managers are responsible for all the costs. In this scenario, it is important to get wireless service providers to approve the design and installation. 3) A neutral-host third-party provider bears the costs of the DAS. In this scenario, the DAS company aims to get more than one wireless service pro- vider on the network and split the costs among the service providers. Where's the Cash in DAS?

Capacitors are electric devices that get an electric motor running at start-up or that help keep a motor running once it has started. If the capacitor has failed the most common symptom is that the motor won't start..
[Click to enlarge any image]
The starting capacitor helps a motor start spinning by creating a high-torque, rotating, electrical field in the motor.
If the start capacitor has failed the symptom is that the motor won't start. If either or both start and run capacitors are defective the motor may try to start but will hum and won't keep running. t.
Watch out: If you observe a humming electric motor that is not starting we suggest that to avoid damage you turn off the system while waiting for repairs.ugal switches: a mechanical centrifugal.

I.I have an Uncle named Bob. Robert actually. I tell everyone Robbie was named after him but in reality, Robert's name is the middle name of my first love. But shhhhhh, don't tell hubby that! Sorry Uncle Bob. Robbie's middle name is Aaron. Yup, Aaron. Same as Elvis. You know, the King of Rock. There you have it, how Robbie got his name.
Now for Ryker's story. Ryker was due in one day and we still hadn't settled on a name. I told my husband I was not having this baby unless we had a name for him. I loved Joshua David. David is my father's name. Hubby did not like it. He wanted to use all our other children's middle names which would have been Aaron James Edward Pries. That's alot of names! I wanted him to have his own name. We were watching The Taking of Pelham 123. John Travolta played a crook named Ryder. I said to Bill "How about Ryder?" He did not like that name. I thought for a few minutes and I said "You probably won't like this name either but how about Ryker?" He liked it! At the time, neither one of us realized this is the name of a jail in New York City. Now the middle name. Bill said Lee and that was it. And that is how Ryker got his name.
How did I get my name? Rebecca is from the Bible. I have no idea where the Jean comes from. I believe that is the name of one of my mom's friends. I'll have to ask the next time I talk to her.

Precious boys! Had my son's name picked out but when he got here it just didn't seem to fit him so we changed at the last minute.
Nice story, lol ! We choose our son's name out of a first name book. Both had to make a cross on the name we liked and we choose the one where both of us had made a cross.
We chose our third and youngest son's name out of a baby book while sitting at Marie Callendar's a week before his birth and feeling very desperate.
It's Todd. And we love it.
=)
I'll have to get myself a middle name too. thanks for sharing.
Thanks for sharing! Naming is always such an intersting story.
My third son is Keil, a family name, but he was really named after a friend's husband, Kyle. Actually that was his last name, and I never even met him, but I liked the name.
Choosing children's names is SO hard to do! Thanks for sharing!
This was a neat story. Your family is really lovely Becky. It's always interestig to learn more about a fellow blogger.

A+This year at Smiths’ in Oberlin we wanted to start a new tradition. We wanted to reward some of our loyal customers (and bring in new folks to our great store) by selecting a pattern every month and giving you the opportunity to receive 10 percent off your materials to make that pattern.
Going further we thought, why not have a super duper way to reward one of our yarn friends……. We tossed around the idea of doing a 12 for 2012 project similar to several Raverly Knit a Long groups, where you knit 12 socks, sweaters, shawls etc. in the upcoming 12 months. Then we heard the reality alarm going off in the background. While some of us yarn junkies may very well finish 12 projects a year, for most folks that is just crazy talk. So we decided to sponsor a SIX in TWELVE. A person who purchases their yarn at Smiths, and completes 6 finished objects has the opportunity to throw their name into a raffle for a grand prize at the end of the year. Once names are thrown into the pot , the winner will be chosen strictly by luck of the draw at the annual holiday party.
Alas, there are a few restrictions. A pair of socks only counts as one project, I personally feel the second sock is anti climatic and unnecessary, instead of the two I feel it deserves. If you haven’t seen them, Kathy S. is knitting the cutest little fish toys for cats. She generously donates them to Gingko for use in their kitten rescue project. As these are very small, less than 2 inches long and 1 inch high, they have been disqualified. Yarn must be purchased from Smiths. Projects are your choice. Kathy S. has generously donated her time to provide suggestions and will showcase a Project of the Month. March is the gorgeous Mara currently on display in the shop, April will be the stunning Wingspan. Patterns are available from Ravelry. Kathy S. used Liberty Wool for the Mara and is currently knitting Wingspun with Poems Sock.

.BeanShell has a few advanced features that we haven't mentioned yet. They will be discussed in this section.
We noted earlier that BeanShell syntax does not require that
variables be declared or defined with their type, and that variables
that are not typed when first used can have values of differing
types assigned to them. In addition to this “loose”
syntax, BeanShell allows a “convenience” syntax for
dealing with the properties of JavaBeans. They may be accessed or
set as if they were data members. They may also be accessed using
the name of the property enclosed in quotation marks and curly
brackets. For example, the following statement are all equivalent,
assuming
btn is a
JButton
instance:
b.setText("Choose"); b.text = "Choose"; b{"text"} = "Choose";
The last form can also be used to access a key-value pair of a
Hashtable object.
BeanShell uses special keywords to refer to variables or methods defined in the current or an enclosing block's scope:
The keyword
this refers to the
current scope.
The keyword
super refers to the
immediately enclosing scope.
The keyword
global refers to the
top-level scope of the macro script.
The following script illustrates the use of these keywords:
a = "top\n"; foo() { a = "middle\n"; bar() { a = "bottom\n"; textArea.setSelectedText(global.a); textArea.setSelectedText(super.a); // equivalent to textArea.setSelectedText(this.a): textArea.setSelectedText(a); } bar(); } foo();
When the script is run, the following text is inserted in the current buffer:
top middle bottom
As discussed in the macro example in Chapter 14, A Dialog-Based Macro, scripted objects can implicitly implement
Java interfaces such as
ActionListener. For
example:
myRunnable() { run() { System.out.println("Hello world!"); } return this; } Runnable r = myRunnable(); new Thread(r).start();
Frequently it will not be necessary to implement all of the
methods of a particular interface in order to specify the behavior
of a scripted object. To prevent BeanShell from throwing exceptions
for missing interface methods, implement the
invoke() method, which is called when an
undefined method is invoked on a scripted object. Typically, the
implementation of this method will do nothing, as in the following
example:

When searching for a property one in every of the important thing issues is, in fact, price. Many individuals reject a property simply because it’s out of their price vary – even when only a bit. They don’t consider the possibility of negotiating all the way down to their funds.
In the appropriate scenario and beneath the correct situations, nevertheless, that is solely possible. Here we look at some nice ways to negotiate on home worth.
Initially, it’s good to have the proper brent crude oil quanto person doing the negotiating. If you are shy or don’t feel you are robust sufficient to put ahead your case for a decrease price and keep on with it, then ask your accomplice, a relative or even a friend you suppose could be higher suited.
This is especially important with a property that has a several individuals fascinated. The agent will scent any weakness and use it to their client’s advantage. You may should compromise barely, however you don’t want to provide in to the agent completely.
Now consider the areas you’re prepared to search for a property. City centres are more likely to be over supplied and so costs are most likely decrease – and room for negotiation a lot larger!
If you’re looking in Manchester, visit a number of completely different Manchester metropolis centre property brokers and see what number of properties of the kind you want they have on the market. If all of them have rather a lot, it is a consumers market and the ability is with you. In the event that they solely have a number of each, consider a different area or sort of property.
Any property you consider placing on offer in for that is over your finances should only be over by 5-10%. It is uncommon you will negotiate down by more than 10% and it’s prone to be less. There are distinctive circumstances the place this is feasible – a really dangerous housing market or a property in serious want of updating for example – however you’ll more often than not find yourself dissatisfied when you can’t get a property value down to your degree.
Start with an opening bid of 10-20% beneath the asking price, depending on the level of demand, and be ready for it to be rejected. The smartest thing to do is deliver your supply in written type and in individual to the estate brokers. That method it is possible for you to to tell by his reaction how near the mark you might be.
The agent will name the vendor with your provide and if she or he appears to be reluctant to take action, you’ll know he is more likely to advise them to reject your offer. If he calls straightaway, you’ll be very close to what they – and the agent – were on the lookout for.
Should your opening supply be rejected, increase next provide solely by a small quantity – 1-2% – and see what kind of response that will get. You’ll get a a lot better idea of what the seller is willing to just accept that method – and whether or not you must pull out now or keep going till you attain your value ceiling.
One other approach to negotiate a discount in a property price is, as an alternative of bringing the value down, get the vendor to add to the value of the property. Get them to offer you an incentive to purchase at or just under the asking value.
This could embody fitting a new bathroom or kitchen to change an outdated one, fit new carpets, leave appliances…a complete host of issues. Remember, you don’t get if you happen to don’t ask!
If a vendor is decided to not budge on worth, they might view providing you requested incentives as a extra acceptable option.

Speaking statistically, paying attention to the ins and outs of advanced metrics, a player working in isolation in the clutch is at best a shakey proposition. At worst, it not only loses the game, but pisses off teammates. And yet it happens all the damn time.
Take the game this past Easter Sunday between the Knicks and the Bulls. Once the Knicks blew their gargantuan lead, they found themselves down three with thirty seconds to play. And they drew up a beauty of a play that you can read all about here, but for now, just watch it:
Just look at that: solid screens, fake action, Melo being generous with the rock, an unexpected player getting a wide open look. And the shot doesn’t go in.
By way of contrast, let’s watch Carmelo Anthony’s game winner in overtime:
This is by any definition hero ball. Just a spot up three-pointer by the team’s best player and it won them the game. This was, by the way, after an earlier Anthony three that was just as flagrantly heroic tied the game to send it to overtime.
And we loved every single minute of it. Anybody who’s ever argued for the sanity and reason of running well-designed plays should admit that they were as floored by this as any casual fan who still judges players by their rings. We loved it because we’re more Kirk than Spock, more Han Solo than C3PO. We don’t want to know the chance of successfully navigating the asteroid field is is approximately three thousand, seven hundred twenty to one. We don’t want to hear that the odds of getting out of here are approximately seven thousand eight hundred twenty four point seven to one. When the game is on the line, we don’t want a fancy plan. We want:
And I’m not citing those pop culture examples just for fun. See, our stories teach us to go against the odds. They tell us that against all reason, one hero must emerge from the rabble and lead the good guys to victory against every expectation we have for failure. When people say they want the ball in Kobe’s hands with the clock winding down, it’s not even really because they think he has a better chance of hitting that last shot than another player. It’s because the story demands that he take and make that last shot.
None of this is to say that attempting to make mathematical sense of the game or indeed that any attempt to bring more reason and clarity to the game is ill-advised. The game needs to evolve, to become something new in response to new ideas. But isn’t its wild ridiculousness what lies at the core of our love for it? Isn’t this ultimately why sports are so great in the first place? Truly great games like the Knicks-Bulls tilt this past Sunday stand on the border between the real world and fiction. The stories inside them lash out at the rules that give the game structure, at the probabilities and plans and diagrams. Hero ball doesn’t make statistical sense, but it makes narrative sense for people who grew up on stories of heroes overcoming fantastic odds. Can it demonstrably be shown to hurt your team’s chance to win? Absolutely, but one need look no further than the trials of LeBron James to see that there are a lot of people who would rather see him lose with the ball in his hands than make the smart play.
Basketball is not just a sport, not just a reflection of percentages and points and metrics. It’s a reflection of our culture, of both its best and worst aspects. Every buzzer-beating three affirms it in our blood: we might take a Steve Novak jumper home to mom and dad, but we want to stay out all night and party with a Carmelo Anthony iso.240 comments found

Hello,

Just wanted to know where you got your icons from? The ones on the homepage. I looked through all of the ones provided, but wasn’t able to locate them..
Thanks!
Ok, just sent a question to support but as I have had to change from metrika to standart it now pulls the title of a really old post and puts it at the top of the page! Why?! There is no link just the heading with unclickable text. Really frustrating. If I am in the metrika theme which I would prefer, it has no links to pages and if I use the appropriate link the page does not scroll. $40 and so much hassle. Need to test these things before you create it

Is there any way to achieve this? Could I also some how incorporate a services page to mention the different services I offer through the website instead of the “Our works” page? Thanks
Nathan

Just to update, I realized that if I upload the png versions of the icons from the download file, they display on my site. However, I wanted to use icons from the menu options within the Wordpress editor. Can that be done? Another concern I have is that the blog date is not in the proper format. I have tried to change it to no avail. All in all, I really like this template. Thanks for your help!

Most of our native oak species are adapted to fire, which means that they can live through fires of light to moderate intensity. Wildland fires were frequent in California before modern fire suppression activities. This means that most of the large beautiful oak trees that grace our hillsides and valleys have lived through previous fires. More than 20,000 acres of the Laguna de Santa Rosa watershed burned in the Tubbs fire alone. Add in thousands more burned acres from the Nuns fire. The Pocket fire burned many thousands of acres in the Russian River watershed. These fires had some areas with extremely high burn intensity. Add up the total acreage and the areas of high intensity and the net sum is that there are likely some areas in Sonoma County where our oak woodlands did not fare so well.
Acorns do not fall far from the tree, as the saying goes. So if post fire assessments revealed large areas of high intensity burn and high mortality of oaks, it will be difficult for the oaks to reestablish in the short term without a little bit of help. Immediately after the fires people were concerned about how our oak woodlands would respond to the fires. What would survive and what would not? We knew that it would take a while to make assessments. Mother Nature does not wait. The fires occurred in the middle of the season when most California native trees and shrubs are dropping their seeds in anticipation of rain.
Within a few days of the fires, the Laguna de Santa Rosa Foundation and the Milo Baker Chapter of the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) teamed up to mobilize and collect acorns from unburned areas throughout Sonoma County’s watersheds. We knew that if we needed seeds and acorns to grow plants for fire recovery then we needed to get them NOW! Seeds need to be collected and processed when they are fresh in order to be viable. Tan oaks and Blue oaks had already dropped their acorns by the time of the fires. The clock was ticking in order to collect acorns from Black oaks, Valley oaks, Oregon oaks, Coast live oaks, and Interior live oaks.
Acorns and seeds were collected from trees near burn areas to maintain the integrity of local oak populations. Research is showing more evidence that oaks adapt over generations to the conditions on the site in which they are growing.
More than 350 individual batches of acorns were collected, processed and catalogued by trained CNPS volunteers and Laguna Foundation staff. CNPS volunteers spent more than 400 hours of their time alone. The acorns and seeds are properly stored and awaiting propagation in the nursery (to be planted next winter) or they can be directly seeded into the ground this winter. We are working with funding and support from the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District and teaming up with the Sonoma Resource Conservation District to find suitable burned properties. We are now ready to plant.

The hotel itself is small, however, the owner is on hand to answer questions and help with information about Montreal.
The room we had was at the front of the hotel, but it was not noisy.
It was a good sized room, with a comfortable bed and excellent bathroom. The shower was huge, toiletries gorgeous, towels replenished daily.
There was a safe in the room. There was a TV but we did not watch it...remote didn't work from the bed.
There was a coffee machine....we prefer tea so water not hot enough....but not an issue.
The room had ac which was very efficient.

For the first time, Jessica Simpson opens up about her relationship with Smashing Pumpkins’ front man Billy Corgan, and RadarOnline.com has the audio.It's a sunny Saturday in Southern Humboldt and a dozen or so people are seated on folding chairs in a windowless room, listening to two enthusiastic young San Francisco lawyers talk about race, gender politics and the history of feminism. Oh, and marijuana. Welcome to 707 Cannabis College, where "higher learning" takes on a whole new meaning.
Of course, it's easy to poke fun. And the college -- tucked in the Meadows Business Park between Garberville and Redway -- doesn't immediately snuff out the stereotypes. Enter the two-room building and you're greeted by a faint but unmistakable smell, plus a plush moose head on the wall across from a framed Reefer Madness poster. Pot-leaf earrings and tubs of Sweet Sticky Fingers scrub ("helps remove dirt, stubborn residues and odors!") are for sale, near a desk laden with volumes like The Big Book of Buds and a pamphlet titled "Cuttings Made Simple." A cardboard cutout of President Obama bears a Post-It speech bubble that reads "I love cannabis."
But speak with the people behind Cannabis College-- co-founders Kellie Dodds and Pearl Moon -- and it quickly becomes apparent the place is no joke. "When we first started, people laughed," recalls Moon. "They were like, ‘Nobody's going to come there, they already know how to do it.' Now those same people love us."
"We don't have classes on how to load a bong, or vaporizer 101," adds Dodds. Instead, Dodds says, the college focuses on four main areas: medicine, science, law and horticulture. Upcoming classes include "Light Deprivation Techniques," "Soil Preparation and Fertilization" and "Cannabis for the Cultivator and Medicinal Baker."
Then there was last Saturday's seminar, "Accessing Power: Gender Related Issues in the Cannabis Movement." Taught by Bay Area attorneys Kyndra Miller and Alexis Wilson Briggs, the class began with a broad overview of the push for women's equality through history, then compared that with the effort to normalize and ultimately legalize marijuana. Lecture headings included, "Lady Liberty," "Lady Justice" and "Mother Cannabis."
"I was a U.S. history major as an undergrad, and I studied race movements [and] gender movements in the antebellum period up to the ‘60s," Miller told the class. "And I didn't want to see happen with the cannabis movement what happened with the civil rights movement -- a fracturing along gender and race lines."
Safe to say when you're casually name-dropping the antebellum period, this ain't a haven for spaced-out stoners.
Indeed, attendees were mostly middle-aged women, though a couple of intrepid (and attentive) men did show up. Two women identified themselves as cancer survivors. Everyone took notes; nobody nodded off.
Briggs called it a "survey course," and said she hoped people would return for more targeted, in-depth classes in the future --ultimately producing papers "to become publishable books."
Though the class focused on big-picture cultural questions, we asked Dodds afterward if she felt there was a need for feminism within the marijuana industry. Is there a grass ceiling? "It's a male-dominated world," Dodds acknowledges without hesitation. For women, "it takes a lot of strength to do this." Other than trimmers, she and Moon agree, women are a minority in all aspects of pot production. Dodds compares it to the medical profession, where women were traditionally relegated to less glamorous, more subservient roles.
"There is a certain amount of sexism that persists," she says, "but I think it's changing. [We] are very happy with what we've built. We'll always be looking to partner with the best people, whether male or female, but to be honest, we're quite proud of what our female energy is producing, and we do think it's a good healthy shift in this industry."
Throughout the class, Moon and Dodds sat in the back, smiling and occasionally injecting their thoughts. Students also piped up frequently, sharing anecdotes and insights (mostly related to the material). The vibe wasn't too different from, well, a college seminar. About pot. In Garberville. Who'da thunk?
Not county and state officials, at first. "It took them a little bit to get their head wrapped around the fact that we don't sell cannabis," says Dodds. "Just the name threw people into, ‘Alright' [winks] or, ‘Heavens!'" But after slogging through the permitting process, the college now enjoys at least tepid support. It has an open dialogue with the sheriff's office, says Dodds, and she considers District Attorney Paul Gallegos a "friend of the school."
Of course, there's always the threat of the federal hammer. "I think Obama is really feeling the pressure," says Moon of the administration's recent, harsher anti-drug stance. But she hopes he'll ease up once re-elected. (Perhaps in anticipation of that, the college has issued the president an honorary degree; it hangs right next to plush moose head.)
Speaking of legality, what's the protocol on, um, "visual aids"? Dodds says instructors with valid 215 permits can bring in medicine for educational purposes, but students can't interact with it directly and no one but the person who brought the plant can leave with so much as a leaf.
Dodds and Moon have lived in Garberville for five and 22 years, respectively. They acknowledge they'll never be "locals" in the eyes of some ("we're both newbies; I'm newbier," is how Dodds puts it), but they feel like it's home. Still, why open a school in the heart of the Emerald Triangle if your goal is to be taken seriously by the rest of the country? Didn't they realize they'd be the butt of a million Harold and Kumar Go To Pot College jokes?
Dodds nods like she's heard the question before. "This is my community. This is the motherland. This is where it happens; this is where it has happened. This is where there's years of knowledge." And, she says, despite initial skepticism, growers have begun to share that knowledge and to gain some -- be it about organic fertilizer or suffragette Susan B. Anthony.
Showing 1-2 of 2Maybe it was a case of the "not-invented-here" syndrome — the common phenomenon where organizations aren't open to innovations or ideas they didn't come up with — in Washington. Or maybe it was just the pressure of time. But, whatever the reason, one thing that wasn't included in the financial-sector bailout package that Congress passed was extensive perspectives from many academic economists, suggests an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education. Titled "Washington Puts Academics on Sidelines in Bailout Plan" (subscription or day pass required), the article describes how academic economists drafted plans and working papers in response to the crisis — but many felt they didn't have much influence in the debates over the bailout plan. On September 25th, one Senator did wave a petition signed by 200 academic economists skeptical of the proposed plan and the haste to pass it. Then, one of the petition's signers who works in the Washington area was called in at the last minute to testify to the House Republican Policy Committee — on a Sunday afternoon. But, overall, according to The Chronicle, Congress's attempts to reach out for academic counsel were "apparently sketchy and last-minute."

No, this is not some new hobby. T was playing violin before and after. She has only been playing for a few months so she only knows a few songs: Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, Michael Row The Boat Ashore, I think that there was a piece by Debussy in there, and maybe a study from her teacher. Oh, there were two others, but we told her not to play them because they were a little too happy for a memorial service.
The preacher welcomed everyone and encouraged them to speak a bit about the man who had passed away. Then came some family members: one of his sons (wow! he had a lot of children for only being fifty. All but one seemed to be under the age of ten, and they were spread out over several different states!). Anyway, there was hardly a dry eye when the boy stopped talking. Then one of his mothers in law spoke. She was very sweet. More family members. Then the preacher came and told funny stories about the man. Funny, but not embarrassing. He liked to laugh. He liked to make other people laugh.
So it was only appropriate when T played the violin at the end, she played the Can-Can. This was made even funnier by the fact that she messed up partway through and when her mother started laughing, she put down her bow and said, “Mom! Curse you!”
Other people started laughing.
“Curse all of you!” Nothing quite like seeing a ten year old girl indignantly cursing the congregation.
Most of the rest of the day, I spent cleaning. But last night, I finally got a friend to come salsa dancing with me! It was honestly the most fun that I have had since I left New Mexico. It will not be a regular occurrence. She lives in Dayton. Furthermore, at the end of the summer she will be moving with her new husband to Florida. Still, for just a little while I was almost home.Liverpool's Sadio Mane stars as Senegal book World Cup 2018 slot

DO NOT speak to any insurance company before consulting an experienced attorney. Insurers are concerned with profits and their bottom lines, which equates to minimizing your compensation and denying your injury claims.

This week, California-based I AM READY Foundation, spearheaded by founder Jason Lee, announced the launch of and its #ForTrayvon social media campaign, rallying widespread national support for social justice to “Unite One Million People for Change.” Reportedly, the goal of the campaign is to directly benefit The Trayvon Martin Foundation and assist in creating awareness of how violent crimes impact families of the victims and provide much-needed support for those families, in light of the fatal shooting of 17-year-old.. To participate in the campaign or become a Youth Ambassador, please visit.
Thanks for sharing this Jasmine. We need to support this movement 110% #ForTrayvon
I AGREE! This is definitely a movement that needs our support. Team/Support Trayvon.
Trayvon’s death brought so many issues to the forefront that we didn’t realize were there or we just chose to ignore. I think that’s why so many people are passionate about this cause.Author: E.B. White or Elwyn Brooks White was born on july 11 1899 Mount Vernon, New York. He gratuaded from Cornell University. James Thurber once said "No one can write a sentence like White." Elwyn was 86 when he died in Main.
Summery: The story begins with Mr. Trexler in a shincs office. The Doctor asked if he had ever had any Bizarre thoughts before. Mr. Trexler had to think for while about this question. He know if he answered yes and told him some of his thought then the doctor would be more concered about him. But he also knew if he said no then the doctor would know that he was lying. After a while Mr. Trexler said "no." After twenty mins of theropy the doctor came up with a conclusion. Mr. Trexler was was scared. He came up with the conclusion because when ever he asked Mr. Trexler a question he would move it back little by little. Trexler started to think about how the other patients must fell while they are waiting. The Sesson was then over and Trexler left. Trexler went to see the doctor routinly. The doctor was trying to convince him that it was all fear nothing else. The Doctor said this to Trexler "What do you want". Trexler could not reply. When this session was over Trexler walked down Third Avenue and thought what did he want. After he thought and came to a conclusion he felt much better and his sickness seemed to heal. He felt like a brand new person.
Themes and Meaning : The theme of this story was to find out who you were. Trexler didn't know who he was at the beggining but in the end he found out who he was and he felt much better about himself. The author of the story was trying to say don't forget who you are. Also if you do forget who you are then you always can remind yourself.
Questions: Why did the doctor not try to figure out what else was wrong with Trexler? Why didn't Trexler say what he wanted to do? What made Trexler feel better about him self and heal his sickness?
Reader Reasponse: I like this story because it had to do with Phycology and trying to figure out someone. I Also like the story because of all the asspects it went through.7 months of unemployment, a rambunctious 2 year old and a stack of bills have me starring in a new role… aka the at home Momma.

This has got to be one of the best I have had the pleasure to deal with.Work and finish is outstanding.Took a second hand kitchen and transformed it into a new one/situation. Nothing is too much.Don't want to carry on with the positives,in case he gets so busy that he won't be able to do any more work for us. :-)

If you are looking for a thoroughly genuine builder who maintains excellent communication, can solve problems with sensible solutions, efficiently deliver exactly what you have agreed upon, and do it all at a reasonable price, then Karl is worth contacting. Thank you so much, we will certainly make use of your services again.
I am delighted to report on Karl's efficiency and quality work. He did a smallish job for us at lightning speed - we had been waiting for another builder for many months, and had given up. Karl checked the site, gave us a very reasonable quote, and the job was done almost immediately. The quality of workmanship is exceptional, the site left clean and tidy, and communications were excellent.. We are hoping that he will do another job for us shortly! I'm going to recommend him to the whole whanau

Karl did some exterior building work for us. It was a tricky and unusual job and we worked together developing the plans and Karl did the construction. We are very pleased with the quality of the result! Following that job we we had no hesitation asking Karl to build our house extension. We worked with Karl from the ideas stage, and we are very happy with the building. Karl is an honest hard worker, an excellent communicator, and a pleasure to work with. Highly recommend -- 5 stars!
I contacted Karl to complete some work on our relocated house, which was in need of repair. Karl efficiently finished the work and left the workspace tidy. I was amazed that he removed a whole trailer load of rubbish from the renovation site, other tradies just dumped it all over the place. He has an eye for detail, which was a major reason why I employed him. He is a credit to the building trade and its unfortunate there are not more tradesmen of his caliber. Many thanks!
I contacted Karl recently regarding the replacement of my deck. He viewed the deck and produced a quote which I accepted. By the time I got home yesterday he had completed a majority of the work. I arrived home today to a stunning deck that was expertly finished. He had removed all rubbish as well as some garden waste that was on my lawn. Karl is prompt, highly skilled and his work is exceptional. I recommend Karl to anyone. Karl's work is worth every cent of your investment. Thanks Karl

Karl is an Impressive Builder with his ability, insight and professionalism he constructed my hallway exactly how I wanted it to look and more. Nathan was also very efficient and professional and an asset to Karl. If you are looking for a great builder this is your man. AWESOME +++++
Karl was totally professional in his attitude and ability to carry out the task assigned. He worked at a job that proved quite difficult in places. He demonstrated a high level of skill and worked well with his apprentice. The finished product looks absolutely fabulous. The insulation has made our elderly house so much warmer and to say the least, we are absolutely thrilled. We thoroughly recommend Karl as a person who will always go that extra mile. We wish him well for the future.
The job was finished quickly and at the quoted price. It was only a small job but he communicated well with myself ( I am an overseas landlord ) the tenants and the managing agent. He even sent me a photo of the finished decking. It is great to find a tradesman you can trust when you can't be there to supervise.

Ranchslider installed in garage door cavity. Communication was very prompt, quote and explanation of work was great and date that was set for work was kept. Great quote, work was completed to a very high standard, all rubbish removed (even the old door which we removed before work began). You could not find a better tradesman for honesty and workmanship. I recommend K Paterson Construction to anyone. EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY. Thank you Karl and team.I.

About.com Political Humor went to work with my Honda Civic. It is very interesting that the same thing happened again. When the Civic passed 30 MPH, I heard the "wind noise" on the "new constructed, smoothly" cement road. But the noise disappeared under the coarse highway. The noise with the Civic is almost the same as the Quest (not that much on both case).
Why did I not notice the noise with the 2001 Civic before? I think I did never pay any attention to it and most of the time I turn my radio on. But with new Quest, I paid "too much" attention. LOL.
I did check the air-Conditioned Vent and other rattle noise as well. Luckily, I did not find any problem on my wife's new Quest. I received a call from Nissan dealer yesterday and they wanted me to give the "survey paper from Nissan" to them in exchange of a full tank gas. Weird. They could fill the survey with all "excellent" remarks, I think. However, it seems they do care about the customer's opinion.
Has anyone else encountered this problem?
The engine service light on our 2004 Quest S model came off after 1,200 miles. Does anyone here have the same problem ? Can we reset it ? or we have to take the van to the dealer for them to check ?
Thanks in advance !
Have a wonderful day !
I have the SE and I noticed some rattles inside the van.
As I started hunting them down I was able to get rid of most of them.
First, sit on the 3rd row and notice some of the plastic covers that hide the screws for the skylights are a little loose. These vibrate when the car is moving. There are 4 of these things, one per sky-window. Also, the same thing on the column that goes up into the ceiling (a round lid/cover). If you open these up you will be able to stuff some "filler" inside that will push against the cover to prevent it from vibrating. ( I used paper for this but you can get more creative ... dry silicone?).
After taking care of these, I noticed that there is only 1 rattle left. Its minor and only happens on really bad roads. It comes from the front of the ceiling console. There are some screws there and I might try to tight them up.
I have not experienced sliding door rattles. My Van has two electric sliding doors. Could it only be happening to "non-electric" doors?
The treatment that I did was for rust prevention, road noise reduction, paint protection, and interior protection (carpets, seats). The paint feels so smooth now to the touch and dirt does not seem to stick to it as much...
I paid $895 for it in case you are wondering.
And we also noticed the big noise the rear wiper makes! To add to our vow, we noticed the paint chipping from the front dash! Did I get a lemon?
Don't know if it's the big doors or what, but we all need to start making noise to Nissan so they will get on the stick and issue a fix.
Saw a lot on the issue of unwanted driver side feet heating. Called 1-800-NISSAN1 since the dealer I bought the Quest from (Stevens Creek Nissan) was being absolutely abnoxious. The service professional, Jason, I spoke with claimed that he heard this from only one other customer. He also claimed that there was no official word on this problem. Can anyone comment on that?
At speeds between 25-35 MPH, there's noticeable drag and the gears don't seem to downshift. Did the others with the problem get it fixed?
A couple of instrument panels (radio controls over the driver side sliding door, bottom runners, etc.) keep popping out! Others seen this too?
Finally, mileage does suck (have a bad commute though).
I am looking for a better dealer to take the vehicle to and will post after I get back.
On the plus side, haven't had any problems with cabin noise (could have decent conversations with a full load on the freeway at 80 MPH) or AC cooling.
Thanks,
Vee Gee
The dealer inadvertently left a circuit breaker (rather than a fuse) in the slot. I decided to keep it for awhile and the thing hasn't blown in a week. Hmmm?
We just took the van on an 830 mile road trip--an even mix of high-speed interstates and semi-rough side roads. I noticed no undue wind or road noise (never have) and no rattles. I may have lucked out on those problems but I think the undercoating probably helped to reduce the road noise. Car performed fantastically!--tons of room, smooth ride, great handling, and plenty of power when I needed it. We averaged 24 mpg.
Well after weeks and weeks of reading these posts and doing much research, we decided on the Quest. I just picked up mine yesterday after a long search for the Smoke SE fully loaded. No one has been able to get it here in the bay area for the price I wanted. I got mine for a few hundred over invoice and am very happy with it. It drives like a dream, and everyone who sees it is totally impressed.
My friends that own the Ody., want this one. Everyone so far thinks it is cool and we as a family of 5 are happy. This is our first mini van (if you can call it that). As I said before I did do much research and reading all of these posts have helped.
I do have a few comments. I knew that I might encounter a few problems, but also knew that it would probably be with any of the vans I picked. I do notice the obvious rattle noise coming from the drivers side sliding door. Happens all the time, bumps or not.
I did also notice something strange today. You know when you start the vehicle up, the nav goes on (if you have nav.) and the accept part is highlighted. You can either push the toggle button to accept it and then you see the map as you are driving or you can just ignore it, and it will go away after a few seconds and then just go to a blank screen. Well today it didn't go away. The warning message just stayed on my whole 10 minute drive. Got to where I was going, turned off the car, then started it back up 30 minutes later. This time it worked again, I ignored the message and it went away. Just something to keep an eye on.
I have not experienced any other problems, including the air conditioning issue a lot of you have posted.
I just got out of a Lemon with my 2001 Chevy Suburban and so I am very aware of any problem a vehicle has. Have it all documented and hopefully these are just some minor bugs.
I really do love this van!!
As for hear2ear post....I know what you are talking about with Stevens Creek Nissan in SJ, Ca... I delt with them in August and had a problem with one of the people there in Sept...Needless to say I went somewhere else. I called a lot of dealers in the bay area and ended up with Hayward Nissan. It was a little farther drive, but Shah is awesome there.
He kept me posted on the inventory and never played games with the price. Infact, Falore Nissan upt the price as they said they found one somewhere else, and would have to do a dealer trade. I called Shah and told him there was one in the bay area. He said he would try to track it down, and he did. He faxed over his inventory to them and they wanted a 04 350Z for mine. He drove out to Salinas, Seaside Nissan and got me my van. He called me at 9:00 pm and said he had my van. I went down the next day and got it.
Keep me posted with the door squeek. I will let Shah know and hopefully we can get this fixed. I just crank up the radio!!
My wife drives the van 90% so the only few chances I get it, I try to spend as much time as possible. We did however notice something strange today, something that has been reported on this forum. The sliding doors don't open all the way if you manually open them. They stop after about a quarter of the length. Both of them. But, if we use the remote, they go all the way back. Also, if we use the buttons inside the van (the black buttons to open and close the sliding doors), they don't open/close. Initially I thought it might be because all doors weren't unlocked. But even after that, the buttons did not work. Didn't have too much time to research it today. Perhaps over the weekend.
But we haven't heard any door rattles (we've had the van close to 2 weeks now). And it drives wonderfully. No major complaints!
As for the doors, I guess I haven't noticed the problems you are experiencing. I do use the remote to open and then the kids love hitting the black button to shut the doors themselves. It's like when we are on vacation at the hotel and they fight over who gets to push the elevator buttons and open up the room with the key.
Keep us updated with your door situation. My little black buttons do work. Just have a rattle in the one door.
This van is amazing for those of you out there trying to make a decision.
You seem to have got to the "bottom" of the problem coming from the top ..
Edmunds need to step up and so does Nissan.
I am waiting for my van and should be able to get it this weekend..
vax
This is retarded. Once the warning light comes on that's when you really care about the number of miles you can before running out of gas!!! Please let me know if someone has this issue or not. Thanks.
Problem is that it came on first for one tire and then yesterday all the tires were showing a pressure of < 27 PSI @ cold. We do leave the van outside these days since the garage is sort of cluttered. When the van and tires warm up, the pressure goes up to about 32 PSI. Finally this morning, I topped all 4 tires to 35 PSI (since the gas station is less than a mile away, I am assuming it is cold).
Anyway, does this seem unusual to anyone that all 4 tires have low air pressure? Recommended is 35 PSI @ cold. Could this have anything to do with my drag problem I talked about before in 71?
I am taking the van in on Monday to Falore Nissan and will ask them to look at this as well. I know spoiledleo1 didn't have good things to say about Falore, but I am hoping that was the sales dept.
Will keep you all posted when I get the van back after diagnosis or repairs.

He said that there is a clip inside the door panel that was broken. He had replaced the clip.
When I get the car back, it was better than before but there is still noise when the car is moving but it is much much less noticeable than before.
After back home, I keep searching for the source of the remaining noise. Later, I suspect the door is not closed properly when in close position. If trying to pull the door by the handle inside, I can hear the noise. There is no noise from the passenger side slider door when pulling the handle from inside. It seems that there is a very very thin gap between the car body and the door but it is not visible either from outside or inside. So when the car is moving, the door is kinda hit the body with the noise.
Anyone have the same situation or not i.e. the door is not close tightly when in close position?
I probably will bring the car to the dealer again (next week or so) and see whether this theory is correct or not.
I have set it for 1 minute but it didn't lock the doors after 1 minute by itself.
If I do not open any door for 1 minute, it should lock all the doors by itself. It is the expected behavior?
Did I miss any step in order to make it work?
Consider the gas warning a conservative estimate and don't expect more than that.
I have noticed the behavior that others reported, where on a warm day, with the a/c on, there is hot air blowing from the front floor vents. However, the volume of airflow is very low, and it didn't bother me. I also noticed that it only occurs when the car is fully warmed up.
To experiment, I decided to override the auto system, and direct all of the airflow to the floor vents. The air volume increased considerably at the floor vents (as expected), and it became cooler, but not nearly as cool as when the air was coming out of the dash vents. I wonder if the floor ducts might be routed near some hot parts that heat the air as passes through.
Last night, I also experienced a different problem. It was cool outside, ~60deg outside temp, and I had the auto temp setting at 72. Well, there was nice toasty air coming from the floor vents, but the dash vents were blowing cool air. I let this condition persist for a while, to see if it would adjust itself, but it stayed that way. The only thing I could do was again manually override the auto system to direct all of the airflow to the floor vents. Anyone else experience this?
Had the same problem.
My Suggestions:
Go with all the details: Let them know that you "know" what costs are. Research Invoice and
MSRP prices..
And if the dealer is rude next time - just tell
him keep ur car and walk out. Call Nissan consumer affairs and give the guy ur piece ofmind. This worked for me too.
Vax
well picked up my SE last morning.
( stephenwb and pulisubs were right about waiting)
dealer called and gave me the vehicle i wanted.
started talking about the review.
One thing - I read and re-read the manual
Is there a way to get hot air from the "console vents" Those vents get cold air blowing.
I guess Nissan trusted the "Hot Air goes up "
and let hot air come out of foot vents only.
The A/c is confusing to operate and I should get used to it over time..
Am taking it for a drive and shall let you know
how it behaves. The small rattle came from the driver side sliding door. Since I had read about it here , I did not panic. SHall make a problem list and show it to the dealer when serviced.

I agree to the suggestion to make some noise about this rattler. I already called Nissan, and they suggested taking it back to the dealer. I am a bit concerned about they experimenting something if they cant fix a manufacturing defect, or applying some glue (?) to stick up the panels. I will post my experience when I take it back.
I do have door noise and warm air issue. The dealer doesn't know much and they called Nissan Hot line. They couldn't help. But said Nissan know there is concern from customers regarding Warm Air issue. They are not working on any fix.
If more customers call and register this issue Nissan might find a fix. So Please call. I have a call open for 2.5 months now.

The white bear in Shipston seems to be populated by folk who support Aston Villa and England. Given that we are on South Warwickshire that should be no great surprise but as a West Ham and Ireland support I have had enough. And it is going to get worse.
West Ham lost 2.1 and were useless. This is the third time this season that we have given hope of a kickstart to useless sides (Reading, Wigan and now Villa). I hope that we stay up although that is by no means guaranteed. But surely no-one can want another season of this nonsense. At the end of May Fat Sam’s contract is up and he has got to go. West Ham will finish this season between 12th and 18th and with two early cup exits to our name. Enough is enough.
At half time Ireland are trailing and our captain could not catch a cold at the North Pole. So much for the Lions Jamie. My father is earnestly praying for divine intervention at Church right now but I fear the worst and if we are to be vanquished by the Old Enemy I’d rather watch in misery alone than surrounded by cheering England supporters.

Oh, my sister Tabby and her family (England, Man United and deluded on all matters) arrive for supper. I have a long list of restricted subjects which I am not allowed to mention but she has none, I am under orders not to respond on any matter.
Postscript: No rows with Tabby. I bit my lip once but all very amicable. Her husband opined that only aristocrats read the Daily Telegraph ( theirs is a Guardian reading household, natch) and I was unable to hold back then generally all peace and brotherly love.
15 Amazing Coffee Facts to Share While Having a Cup
You know whether you like your coffee black or with cream and sugar. But how much do you really know about that delicious brown beverage that has become a part of your morning routine? Pour yourself a cup and find out with these 15 delightful coffee facts.
1. Coffee lovers have a herd of dancing goats to thank.
According to legend, an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi noticed that whenever his goats munched on the bright red berries of an unusual tree on his property, they’d become euphoric and energized. So Kaldi did what any curious goat herder would and tried some of the berries himself. It wasn’t long before he was dancing along with his herd, earning himself the moniker of “the happiest herder in happy Arabia.”
2. Coffee was originally chewed, not sipped.
A cup of Joe may be your preferred method of consumption, but coffee has not always been a liquid treat. According to a number of historians, the first African tribes to consume coffee did so by grinding the berries together, adding in some animal fat, and rolling these caffeinated treats into tiny edible balls of energy. It wasn’t until 1000 CE that the beans were turned into a beverage (a special wine, to be exact).
3. Not everyone was a quick coffee convert.
As recently as the 18th century, governments were trying to stamp out coffee because it stimulated both drinkers and radical thinking. In 1746 Sweden took things to an extreme when it banned both coffee and coffee paraphernalia (i.e. cups and saucers).
4. Beer tried to take coffee’s spot at the breakfast table.
Three decades after Sweden locked down ceramics, Prussian officials grew worried that coffee consumption was interfering with citizens’ beer-drinking habits. In 1777, Frederick the Great of Prussia issued a statement encouraging Prussians to drink beer—not coffee—with their breakfast.
5. Instant coffee is nearly 250 years old.
Convenience has long been a concern for coffee drinkers, as evidenced by the fact that instant coffee made its first appearance in England in 1771. The process evolved over the years until the first mass-produced instant coffee was introduced—and patented—in the U.S. in 1910. And it continued to evolve into the 1960s, when freeze-dried coffee (still a popular method) made its debut.
6. Americans don’t drink all that much java.
It may seem like there’s a coffee shop on every corner of every major city in the U.S.—and usually another on the other side of the street—but Americans place 25th when it comes to the amount of coffee we consume.
7. Finland is the world’s coffee king.
The world’s most caffeinated country? Finland! Though the country doesn’t produce any beans of its own, Finnish drinkers still manage to consume almost three times as much coffee as Americans each year. Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and the Netherlands round out the top five (in that order).
8. All the hippest cats drink it.
The record holder for the title “oldest cat ever”—a cat named Crème Puff—lived to be 38 years and three days old. She drank coffee every morning of her life, plus bacon, eggs, and broccoli, too. Before you dismiss that as just an unrelated coincidence, consider this: the cat that Creme Puff beat out for the record—34-year-old Grandpa Rex Allen—had the same owner, and was fed the exact same diet.
9. It could fuel your car someday.
More than 100 million Americans rely on coffee to get their personal motors running each morning. And at some point in the future, it could be the fuel that gets their cars’ motors running, too. Researchers have had great success in converting coffee into biodiesel. Best of all, used grounds work just as well.
10. The coffee break has a hometown.
Stoughton, Wisconsin bills itself as the place where the coffee break originated. Every year the town holds a Coffee Break Festival to celebrate this major contribution to the days of workers everywhere. According to local lore, the area’s coffee-loving Norwegian immigrants created the breaks in the late 19th century.
11. Beethoven was a barista’s nightmare.
Beethoven enjoyed a cup of java, and he was particular about its preparation—he insisted that each cup of coffee was made with exactly 60 beans.
12. Balzac knew how to toss it back.
French writer Honoré de Balzac didn’t have time to be that picky. He allegedly drank upwards of 50 cups of coffee a day.
13. Coffee has been high fashion.
During the Civil War, Union blockades of the South kept the Confederacy in a permanently under-caffeinated state. Confederate troops tried their hand at creating substitutes using chicory and dandelions, but nobody’s taste buds were fooled. Coffee eventually became so prized that Southern jewelers used individual beans as gemstones in their creations.
14. “Mocha” is more than just a fun word to say.
It’s also a port city on the Red Sea in Yemen. Until the 17th century, nearly all of the world’s coffee was produced in the Middle East, and thanks to its ideal location for shipping, Mocha was the world’s top coffee marketplace. Although the expansion of coffee cultivation to European colonies in South America and Asia eventually diminished Mocha’s commercial power, beans exported from Mocha had been so popular in Europe that “mocha” became shorthand for any top-flight coffee.
15. Asian palm civets make great baristas.
Kopi Luwak, the world’s most expensive coffee, earns its pricey distinction thanks to a surprising step in its production: digestion. In Indonesia, a wild animal known as the Asian palm civet (a small critter similar to the weasel) cannot resist the bright red coffee cherries that abound, even though they can’t digest the actual coffee beans. The beans pass through the civets' systems without being fully digested.
Eventually, some brave coffee farmer collected these beans from civets' droppings, thoroughly washed them, and tried brewing a cup. Surprisingly, the interaction with the civets’ digestive juices did something magical to the beans, resulting in a cup of coffee that was intensely flavorful and lacked any trace of bitterness. The process may not sound very appetizing, but the really tough thing to stomach is the price—a single pound of Kopi Luwak can set you back more than $600.

Take Care: When you’re unwell,
do you allow others to take care of you,
or do you prefer to soldier on alone?
What does it take for you to ask for help?
I have a unique relationship with my health. Can a relationship be marked by a complete lack of communication? Half the time I am unaware that I am sick so I just carry on. Finding out something is broken, requires xrays because a broken bone feels the same to me as a simple bruise. If I do notice I am unwell then I will just soldier on – there may be some moaning, groaning and whining but essentially I just keep going. Oddly, I know when I am really sick I have this irresistible urge to clean the house. All of it, immediately!
I get frustrated when people try to help me. It makes me feel incapable or dependent and being sick is already breaking my spirit. I hate feeling even more vulnerable than normal. I get very grumpy and hubby often just has to lay down the law. Like at the moment with my ankle being injured Hubby is being very clear that I use the crutches and slow down. Crutches and housework are incompatible, let me tell you!
I frequently end up in an ambulance on the way to hospital because I didn’t notice and it got so bad I don’t protest Hubby calling for help. I HATE the pain scale because with a high pain threshold and fibromyalgia I am always in pain. I can rarely differentiate the specific pains because I lump them all together and unconsciously suppress them. If I say I am in pain – why is that never enough? I also get sick of comments that I look well – what I look is PTSD affect and it doesn’t change. I refuse to fake what they believe to be the “appropriate” look for what is wrong with me.
When I am admitted to hospital I get out early. And yes hospital feels like prison to me. I explain that I have a nurse at home but not that this nurse is actually me. Hubby keeps quiet lol he is only so brave… I always prefer being at home to recover and away from prying eyes – which I consider the medical profession to be. I ma just used to dealing alone and HATE being helped to function.
I was charmed recently when my mother – in – law sent me a gorgeous get well card. It was such a surprise and for all my grumpiness I really loved this acknowledgement of my current disposition. I have it sitting beside me on the couch my current second home after the bed at the moment… sigh. It makes me smile each time I see it.
I am not sure I get to the point of asking for help. I can go to the doctor on his request for a follow up and be half dead and still not refer to my condition. I just hate acknowledging illness or pain or I just don’t realise. More often than not someone else points out I am sick and need a doctor or I collapse and that forces the issue.
I am working on this and it is or it feels really slow. When my ankle was diagnosed as having a hairline fracture it was the only part of me not hurting after I collapsed to the floor. I just laughed … which of course just confused the nurse. At that stage I had given up on explaining the pain I was in and how it would not match my affect … plus the meds I was on keep my mood and blood pressure fairly even, whatever the stress.
I often reply, I am f.i.n.e. to questions on how I am feeling. The funny thing is that people believe it even when I am standing in front of them on crutches and grimacing. I guess we believe and hear what we need to, even in that moment when we are with someone and could be listening to their words, rather than interpreting our meaning in them. F.i.n.e. was once explained to me as feeling, incapable of normal emotion and some days that is fairly accurate.Phoenix pay scandal blamed for donation shortfall One of the biggest workplace fundraising campaigns in Canada will fall short of its $19-million goal this holiday season – and the Grinch in the works is the federal pay system that handles most of the donations. It's a snafu that the country's top bureaucrats predicted over the summer, weeks before the annual United Way campaign kicked off, documents show. It's also just one more consequence of a problem-plagued payroll system that has been causing migraines for public servants and senior officials since the calendar first turned to 2016. Approximately 70 per cent of the funds that are raised for the United Way through the federal workplace campaign come from payroll deductions. The deputy minister in charge of the campaign warned his colleagues at a July 27 breakfast meeting of a ``serious impact on our ability to raise funds'' if the Phoenix payroll issues weren't resolved. The details are contained in speaking notes provided to the clerk of the Privy Council, the country's top bureaucrat, and obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act. On Wednesday, the top civil servant at Public Services and Procurement Canada, which is in charge of the Phoenix system, confirmed that the fundraising campaign will fall short of its $19-million target. “At the end of the day, I think one thing we have to remember is the amount of money that the public servants do raise to the campaign is a tremendous amount of money,” said deputy minister Marie Lemay. Phoenix has upended regular pay for more than 80,000 federal workers who have been underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all for weeks or months because of human and technological glitches. Clearing the backlog of cases is now two months behind schedule with some 10,000 cases yet to be fixed. The government has ordered a review and has called in the auditor general to figure out what went wrong. The results of the review, which won't be known until at least the spring, will determine whether senior managers who oversaw the Phoenix rollout will receive performance bonuses for 2016 - a possibility that appeared to leave NDP MP Niki Ashton apoplectic during question period Wednesday. “With the holidays around the corner, Mr. Speaker, this adds insult to injury to the so many who are still waiting to get paid,” said Ashton, demanding the government nix bonuses for all involved. Public Services Minister Judy Foote said the government is doing everything it can to solve the remaining cases, which she said are the most complex. “There's no one more concerned about this issue than I am, as the minister responsible,” Foote said. “We are working very hard, we have put measures in place...to deal with these issues.” The cost of doing so could extend beyond the $50 million the government previously estimated, because officials don't know if temporary pay offices established as a workaround will need to remain in place. The new system was supposed to save taxpayers millions of dollars annually, but those savings won't arrive until early 2018, the end of the government's next fiscal year at the earliest, Lemay said. There won't be any savings this year, she added. “We will end up saving some money,” Lemay said. “Will it be the same amount that was planned? I'm not sure because we'll have to see how many people do we need to keep at the end or not in terms of our satellite units.” - The Canadian Press Recent stories: Fox hires new HR chief Senior exec returns to job despite racist slur Top leaders join forces to “hack” diversity gap Leave a comment SHARE Belarus is Belarusian Ruble 790,880 (US$40),

Paul Lee, ABC’s group president of entertainment, met with reporters this morning during the Television Critics Association semi-annual meeting in Hollywood. Not unexpectedly, the subject of “The Goldbergs” came up.
Lee,who recently renewed his own contract with the network (though ABC has languished in fourth place for the last four years), recently renewed the Jewish-themed comedy for a second season. It joins black, Hispanic and Asian-themed comedies that the Hollywood Reporter said “ambitiously mine cultural and ethnic diversity.”
Lee, who is a British Jew, was asked if “The Goldbergs” needed to become more specifically Jewish. He responded that what aired was the vision of its creator, Adam Goldberg. “It’s Adam’s show. I’m not going to sit there and say, ‘From one Jew to another, I want a bar mitzvah.’”Radler EnterprisesView All Tags

I have fallen into a rut in the past few days, which you probably picked up through following my blog or talking to me directly. I am stuck. And I have let myself sit in the state of ‘stuck’ for a bit too long. I need to pry myself out of it.
So, here’s my plan.
This week, for the next 7 days, I am going to blog about things that inspire me. I am not going to focus on all the negativity I feel, I am going to start to move forward with it. I will write about people or events or how I am coping day to day with trying to find motivation. I am so used to complaining on this blog. A lot of my posts have to do with me feeling dull or bitter or depressed. But this time, I don’t want to do that. It sometimes helps to vent and throw everything into the universe but I don’t always feel better. I am making a change today. I need to fuel myself with positivity. And I hope that you’re willing to take this one week of MO-TI-VA-TION with me.
I thrive off motivational talks. I love, love, love videos that make me want to get up and do things. I feed off the energy of the person speaking and I want to be like them. Thats’s probably the reason the 5 fictional characters I love tend to be highly positive people. I want to be more like them for that very reason.
Today, I decided to seek ‘professional’ help via the Internet in the form of Marie Forleo. She is much like what Emma Woodhouse from Emma Approved was suppose to be: a life coach. I have watched a few of her videos and I find her very suited for her job (is that weird to say?). A Little Opulent has links of their favourite videos but here’s one that’s not on the list:
In this video, Marie Forleo and her guest, Todd Herman go through the 5 steps needed to make a change in your life and how to make it stick. I always feel so gung-ho about making changes but making them stick is something I have battled for so many years. I have things I would like to tackle and I am going to give these 5 steps a try.
That is a simple summary. I highly recommend listening to the whole conversation, although it’s about 25 minutes; if you’re struggling like me, you’re likely to find it useful. They expand on how to do each step, and it’s not as vague as it may seem.
Here’s to taking the right steps in life. xx
P.S. Happy Birthday to the amazing Melanie Jane. I love you dearly. 🙂The Boston Bombing Was An Inside Job - Complete Evidence!
The Boston marathon bombing has the signature of the shadow government written all over it! "...
"Boston marathon bombing happened on same day as 'controlled explosion' drill by Boston bomb squad", Mike Adams reports for Natural News.
." [1]
This is the EXACT modus operandi of the secret brotherhood ruling the world from the shadows! 'live fly' exercise using REAL planes. Drills also apparently included the injection of false 'radar -- .'" [7] & [8]
7. The 2004 Madrid train bombing.:
"WARNING: Laws being written to screw you.
I work on a security commission and I've just received word to start campaigning."  'the global war on terror', with very limited diplomatic success. Now expect to hear continually about  'planned 'Operation;
So, one more "Illuminati Card" filled with controversy! Good find and thanks for sharing!
There were no drama ! there were people in pain who got their legs blown off ! Have a little compassion for humanity!
On another special event day as well. If people cant see this one for what it is then they never will.
Oh, the games people play... one day it will come back to bite them in the ass... it always does.
So the US government has started killing its own citizens. Wonder how would the DHS make use of those millions of rounds in store.
Don't forget; on the same day, at the same time as the shootings in Aurora, Colorado, there was a DHS-sponsored anti-terror drill specifically aimed at this scenario: to prevent and/or deal with a massacre in a movie theater. Armed police and members of SWAT teams participated in this exercise in a theater across the street from the theater where the shooting was actually occurring.
i live near the theater and there is no other theater across the street.
Now! Who can we blame for this crime???
Assad maybe? Ahmenidejahd?
We could blame some white right wing, racist, supremacist, militia?
Forget about Kim. He's got some nukes!
Let's not forget that the explosion occurred on the same day as "Israeli Memorial Day".
Pay no attention to the dancing Israelis here to "document the event."
Watch out this one ^^
People start pages for one thing, then decide to use them for something else, it's easy, just change the page name, delete what few photos and posts there are and start with new stuff. They are just saving some time from starting from scratch. I've seen this same thing over and over, especially with memorial pages.
This seems to be a new strategy by the Zionist elites, attacking sporting events. The Banksters are getting very dirty now, the parasites !
Zionist elites? These were Russian criminals, there is no conspiracy theory.
Indeed, there is more than a conspiracy theory, it is a conspiracy fact. The US Government is conspiring with elite groups against its own people. And there is evidence everywhere you look.
Regarding your 13 other comments, please bring evidence to support your claims and refrain from insulting everyone, otherwise it's called trolling.
You praise Obama, Israel, MOSSAD, the system and the troops, so it's clear that we are not on the same page (to say the least).
But we can always agree to disagree, so please, enjoy a fine weekend!
We cannot allow ourselves to be murdered and lied to over and over again. The time of revolution is near, ready your families.
I don't know where to post this, so here's an article about newly discovered giant pyramid you might be interested:
Looks like the best way to avoid becoming a casualty in this country is to check and see if law enforcement is running a "drill" that coincides with the date/location of the event you want to attend. If so, don't go.
YES,I TOTALLY AGREE
The Oath Keepers are coming to Boston for an April 19 gathering. There is a good chance that this staged event is an attempt to discourage the Oath Keepers from coming to Boston. It is also an opportunity for the Oath Non-Keepers to demonize and discredit the Oath Keepers. Look for a possible followup event to put the city in lockdown just before April 19.
wow, you completely called it.
Mossad-op.
What else have they done?
9/11, US and Israel:
Oh, please! Everybody knows the US gov. is the terrorist. To the people of the United States, and to the whole world. As V in 'V for Vendetta' said, 'but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.'

Boston Obamabing, The man in charge is ultimately responsible, full stop. He doesn't mind sending planes to bomb innocent civilians in the middle east, but he is too gutless to arrest the bankers who cause all the problems. Obama IS the problem because he has the power to arrest the guilty and he does not even mention them. Why? Because he is one of them. A big, fat, lying, criminal, terrorist. May he receive all he deserves.....
Obama is a puppet, just like ALL other world leaders. The Babylonian Brotherhood dictates everything from the shadows. Who are they?
All "royal" families across the globe, all the high ranking secret society members, all the high ranking priests (e.g. the pope and the cardinals), and all those filthy rich families of the elite (e.g. Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Astors and so on).
KRS One said it best; and I still use his explanation to explain presidential power to people who are unaware of the truth.
Say I go to McDonalds & I order a bacon double cheeseburger. I get my food and I open it up but theres no bacon. I go to the counter and I say "yo theres no bacon on this" and who do I get to talk to? The manager; not the guy who owns the franchise. The guy who gets paid to take on the camera and customers. Thats the President."
So even with all the money spent on re-elections, etc; your still choosing someone the bankers chose. All of em have the same mission, goal and orders. They just put on a blue suit or a red suit. Its quite simple. Like Televangelists preaching from their Bentleys. Stop the bullshit & come clean. We allll know whats really going on.
so show us were you seen this news report showing donna on fox news post the news story up
Thanks for sharing! From the start of hearing about this tragedy I knew it was the doings of our own government. Gun laws will be put into place and we will see police and screenings like TSA everywhere. They are taking our freedom slowly. Just like with a frog in pot, you turn the stove up a little at a time.
They only win if they can control the mass.... and so far they have done exactly that for more than 12 years. It are small events that remind us of the big event. It doesn't matter if you are right or left... the government has it's own plan. Obama is a puppet for a small group of right wing people who want to safe their own people. And to shut up the anarchists in this world... they used propaganda. High emotional events to let the right wing do whatever they wanted. I wonder what they are planning to do next... because the world will probably think about their actions and think "well that is supposed to happen, let them do it"... like the war in middle east. The only way we can fight back is to spread the facts.... or use propaganda for our own plan. The average man will probably never find out about all of this... because he doesn't understand the global picture.
Regarding Update 4: ABC News used the wrong image, and later corrected it.
It was only logical for them to try and correct their blunder, as soon as the internet begun exposing it. But what I am doing is exposing the modus operandi of the "elite". It is possible that this person, Donna, was entirely invented by the MSM, in order to put out there a information they were interested in.
Presenting the picture of Dawn in correlation to this bombing is probably one more signature of the same people who staged Sandy Hook.
Imagine them laughing behind the close curtains. There is more to this world than most people know.
One more thing, are you sure you saw this on ABC News? Cause this picture is from FOX News.
One thing i noticed was how quickly the Army were there. In a video I have seen the bomb went off and within 1 min 40 seconds the army were trying to pull the fence out of the way. They may have been there for security, I dont know. This scares me alot
oh i see what's going on. Perverts like you using deaths and victims to cause fear. You're no better than da killers themselves. If anybody did this for an agenda, it's people like you who did it.
I'm causing fear by exposing the secret societies who cause these events?
So, you are not worried that your government is killing thousands of American people, in order to use it as a pretext to invade, terrorize and kill innocent people across the globe, while using trillions from your money, BUT you are worried that I am exposing them?
Great set of values!
This was not a terrorist event. It just doesn't make sense. Terrorists kill as many people as possible in attempts to prove their points. There was only THREE deaths; in a location where there was PACKED stands across from the explosions. This leads me to believe one of two things. 1-Really bad terrorists were able to bypass a "secure" country since 9/11 to set off small explosives OR 2- Its an inside job, aimed to minimalize casualities but maximalize fear; resulting in more of a police state which the NWO is clearly working towards. I can think of numerous events which happen while drills are "going on."
These events are designed to do two things. One, they are vilifying gun owners by portraying them as crazed serial killers, so in the name of public safety,they want gun control laws that basically make it impossible to own and carry a fire arm,which will in reality make the public easy to take over. Two, they are deliberately egging on the American public by causing horrifying events that defy rational reasoning, and then they display complete stupidity and brazen audacity in providing lame cover ups in an effort to make angry American's who can't stand having their intelligence insulted to revolt. This will enable the government to enforce Marital Law upon the populace. Eventually, thanks to media bombardment,low I.Q.'s, and engineered financial and social pressures, the public will either give up their guns, or they will revolt. You see, either way, they win.
The reality of all this is frightening...!!! Imagine the World in Total Chaos and innocent civilians paying the price...
Can we ever begin to trust any form of leadership when civilian targets are easy game...
Tis like swatting out a fly...
No, guilt, no inner remorse...
The young brain washed male is termed "mentally unstable"...
When horror erupts...
The evil deeds are perfectly timed...
ONLY GOD KNOWS...
AMEEN...
There's only one problem. This website is being run by the Elite.
This is my personal blog and I am the sole writer. No elites here.
How do we know it's not the other brothers(tamerlan) bad tho??
You are not asking the correct question, bro. The correct question is "how do we know either of them is related to this event"? To this moment there is NO piece of evidence incriminating them. All we have is footage of two guys walking on the sidewalk, carrying backpacks that do NOT match the ones used in the bombing.
Each human being is INNOCENT until proved guilty in a court of law.
After spending days glued to my laptop following this tragic story and finding it so hard to believe, I can honestly say your blog has assembled parts to this horrific event perfectly,.
Excellent work Alex.
Sure is nice ALL my thoughts are validated by other folks. So what do we do? We can't stop it.
Good job. Too bad there's nothing the public can do anything about it. Average Americans don't mind giving up all of their rights as long as they have a job and a steady paycheck from the super elites. I'm sure if the government wanted to drag someone from their house for no apparent reason, the neighbors will just standby and watch. After all, it's the government, they know what's best for us.
There is one thing all of us can do: spread the truth. This will hopefully help our species in the long run.
Inside jobs are normal in Italy too for many decades. Search Italicus, Bologna station etc.
Uh wow. I was believing everything the media was saying, but as soon as I read they weren't reading the Meranda rights to him, I thought that this was such BS. Then I found this site.... thanks for posting this.
Damn we're doomed !
I also wondered about the home owners just letting the police in. I would not have done that unless they had a warrant. You people are giving into the agenda of the socialists. Use you heads and wake up to whats going on. These two poor men were setup. Shameful, we are all controlled.
Any site that only publishes positive comments is suspect!
Suspect of what?
This article represents my documented opinion, backed up by evidence. I ask the same in return. I will publish any documented opinion against my claims or against what I publish.
Approving the comment of someone calling me names will never happen on my personal blog, because it's not constructive in any way.
How do you stop the government from just blocking your site?
You don't. If they do block your site, you sue them. That's about it.
You nailed it all! these two young kids were setup! Patsies! For our sick govt. too bad we are awake and we know what they are up to!
Awesome job Alex, I really appreciate you aggregating all the REAL information about this false flag.
Just something else to consider: He apparently tried to commit suicide, or somehow injured his throat which conveniently now makes him unable to speak. There is a leaked picture of him stepping out of the boat and not being "scooped up because he was so weak" as is the official statement.
The implication is that there is NO blood on him as he is stepping out of the boat, which means his injury must of happened POST being captured and taken into custody. Maybe I'm missing something, but anyone feel free to play devils advocate on this one.
You may be right. I have addressed this in Update 32. Personally, I think he might have been shot during the "target practice", where up to one hundred assault rifle rounds where shot at the boat.
It is also possible that he was shot while in custody -- after all, there is evidence that his brother was mutilated and KILLED in custody.
Great research mate.. I check this site very regularly for updates on this story. Keep up the good work! Cheers
geez, so when and where is the next drill taking place?
Well done Alex, this is make more sense to me. Enuff said.
You are actually using the fact that his tweets seemed calm as evidence he is innocent?
No, I am using the entire article as evidence. Have you read it?
So I'm ignorant because I don't think the government staged the bomb? What if I said your insane for thinking that. Its funny how anyone who opposes you is somehow some dumb ignorant blind idiot. I've travelled to over 25 countries across the world and seen more real shit then you and your computer screen can dream of
I am not trying to convince you of anything and we don't have to agree. Each one of us is a free human being, with the right to have their own opinions.
Please, stop spamming my inbox and move along. Peace!

Not sure if you seen this one.
I have addressed this aspect, thank you. Please see updates 19 and 36. I have also included a link to your suggested article. It is good. See [40].
Your blog is without doubt my favorite blog of all due to my interest in mysteries and the truth. Through the last 3 years I have read so many of your articles, Alexander, but this one.. wow. I'm speechless! I'm very excited these days because this terrorist attack just doesn't make any sense at all! It feels like we're so close to exposing someone who has been hiding in the shadows for decades. (maybe even longer) This is the kind of stuff I feel confident in sharing with both sleepwalkers and the awakened ones because of the fact that it's impossible to deny the strangeness of all these "coincidences". In other words..- This is hotter than a genuine picture of the loch Ness monster! ;) I hope this will help people to have a more open mind towards other cases so that we can finally solve this great puzzle all together! --And if we do, we will have you to thank like I'm thanking you now for this article and all your other articles. - Thank you!

The problem with claiming that Jeff Bauman Jr isn't in the picture you highlighted is that you are wrong. He is in it. You are missing him. His shredded leg with bone and shredded pants are hanging behind the African American lady in red's head, his pulverized other leg is on her chest. She is basically sitting up between his shredded legs. His hair is just visible behind her head. She was thrown into a pile with Jeff Bauman Jr and Christian Williams (the man in the grey hoodie and black jacket that people accuse of laying there too casually) who has just managed to shift his weight off of the woman and turn/roll over to the right where previously his girlfriend had been but has run away. Right after the blast, they had to try to untangle themselves from each other with Jeff missing both legs, the African American woman's arm being almost torn off and with a leg injury and with Christian with open wounds on his legs and three finger of one hand being de-gloved. Sorry to burst your bubble, but these people are real and their injuries are real too.
He is not in the picture:
When he was finally deployed to the scene, the black woman shielded him from camera, until he fixed his fake prosthesis.
The FBI has released only very small segments of their fake bombing scene. The released pictures are not only snapshots of a staged event, but they had also been photoshopped.
why is there a need to photoshop? Obviously the photoshop artist doesn't know a thing about perspective.
here's definitive pair of photos proving the still shots taken prior to the explosion event on Apr 15.
This is not the only proof that Jeff Bauman is not the Iconic Victim the Lame Stream Media keep telling us.
I believe in all this page. I'm absolutely terrified of the secret that has encompassed all who live. Life is undoubtedly fragile and the strings have the blade sawing through it evermore so by an evil beyond comprehension. I'm afraid to say that its our own fault and for my part, I am truly sorry. Maybe I'm only allowing doubt consume me, letting it win, when I say theres absolutely nothing can be done by any of us to redeem ourselves. I believe this is the duty of the HIGHER POWER that we have been warned about in that book we call.......... The Bible. It's ironic that we look for truth, only to wish to be blind once we find it.
This latest false flag atacks, have been full of flaws on purpose.
They want us to find proof, they want us to tell others what they've been doing for several years. They want to know who we are, who we know, and who believes in these conspiracies.
Why is this?
Because of CISPA.
They will be able to find out all they want about who they want.
They will treat all of the unofficial information (like the ones on this site), like terrorist information.
Another interesting video:
Hi, I just saw this page and IF the cops used rubber bullets, they were not all using them ! I listened to the police on their radio from 4am throughout the day (taking a few hour nap) and then continued listening while they were trying to get him out of the boat .. I also continued to listen even after, for about an hour or so and the cops requested that the officers who had used the "less lethal guns" return them and please remove the regular bullets and reload with the less lethal ones.
Also they were worried throughout the day, they expected him to have on a suicide vest with a deadman switch - that being the case, why would they have been throwing flashbangs at the boat, knowing that could possibly cause an explosion.
I trust nothing of that day/days.
I'm not saying all the cops were crooked, but I wouldn't be surprised if some were.
Oh and the night of the shootout, a news reporter said that the older brother came out on his hands and was not resisting arrest.
Thank you for compiling this all
you need to include the object thrown by the woman in the green top caught by the falling spazz-man, and the fact that the MSN is now pushing the fiction that the brothers were involved with 'conspiracy theorists'
God bless you man, for taking the time and effort to put up all of this information to help people cut through the SMOKESCREEN the government has SHODDILY put up to mask their own fucking involvement in this STAGED EVENT. These kids had NOTHING to do with this false flag perpetrated by MURDEROUS TRAITORS to America.
This sloppily run psyop shows that the powers that be care less and less about details as their grip on public consciousness strengthens....but they have fucked up in some big ways on this one....from NO PROOF that these kids dropped their backpacks that didn't match the exploded one to the media's OBVIOUS COMPLICITY in reporting this GARBAGE story so full of gaping holes it boggles the mind. All they've done with this is show EVERYONE the way they did 9/11. The concurrent government run DRILLS. The media COOPERATION. The following freedom-grabbing LEGISLATION. The convenient 'Muslim' PATSY. The patsy who 'magically' evades security detection in SEVERAL COUNTRIES and ends up in the USA unmolested. All adding up to the story that makes no SENSE.
Here's how they did it kids: The ISRAELI guy wearing the matching backpack to the one that exploded was one of a few rogue elements in the AS YET OFFICIALLY UNIDENTIFIED paramilitary security force present at the marathon that worked in conjunction with rogue elements in the FBI and MOSSAD to perpetrate this murderous FRAUD.
PERIOD.
I was at the Boston Marathon, close to the finish line. You are incorrect, the marathon was not finished. Many people were still running.Following on from the our recent story on the healthy market for film, we contacted a leading second hand camera retailer, The Camera Exchange, Melbourne, which confirmed that film camera sales had also taken off recently.
‘In the past 18 months there’s been a real uptick, particularly for 35mm manual focus cameras,’ said Ross from The Camera Exchange. He mentioned the Nikon FM2, FE2 and F3, the Olympus OM series, Canon FD, Minolta STM and X700.
The M3 and younger Leicas never lost their appeal into the digital era, and are even more popular now.
On the other hand, there is way less enthusiasm for autofocus film cameras.
‘I can’t sell a Nikon F801 or a 90X, but if you brought in an FM2 I would happily buy it,’ said Ross.
But its not just 35mm, Hasselblads such as the 500 CM are in big demand, as are the Mamiya 645, 7 and 7 ii, and the Rolleiflex range.
Demand for lenses from the film era has also picked up. Some buyers are using them with compatible digtial (‘lots of guys are happy to put them on new cameras’), some for their film cameras. Once again, they are discerning crew: Fast primes are where the action is and ‘zooms are a dime a dozen’.
With demand up, prices are as well. Ross said that a Canon FD 50mm f1.4 – a classic, but not compatible with Canon’s digital range – used to sell for around $95. ‘Now we can get $250 for it,’ he said. (‘Vintage’ lenses like the Canon FD 50mm have also been rediscovered – combined with an adaptor – among some professional videographers.)
The launch of the new full-frame Pentax K1 this week – compatible with a massive base of K-mount lenses from the film era – will only add to the interest in fast, high quality ‘legacy’ optics.
The trend towards analog photography has expanded out to an interest in darkrooms, as well, with The Camera Exchange also selling the occasional enlarger, ‘and I know Vanbar and Michaels are selling a lot of chemistry and paper.’
The supply side
On the supply side, the most active distributor in this thriving niche is Independent Photographic Supplies, which distributes Kodak consumer and professional film, along with the Agfa and Rollei brands.
IPS brings in a lot of film products in small quantities. Above is a typical monthly delivery from just one of its suppliers, Kodak.
‘There wouldn’t be a day we don’t ship out film to our customers,’ said managing director, Stuart Holmes. ‘We stock an enormous range – black and white film, colour print and slide films in consumer and professional ranges up to 4×5-inch, infrared, and Single Use Cameras!
‘We also have black and white home darkroom chemistry, and even E-6 CPAC chemistry too, which is the the only brand still available in convenient packs for today’s E-6 slide film shooter.
‘The E6 Rolliechrome is quite popular, and we also offer it in 120 format. In fact, a far as I know it’s the only 120 slide film anywhere in the world,’ he said.
The increase in home darkrooms is also accommodated, with Adox black and white RC Multigrade Printing Paper – the same stock as the former Agfa Multicontrast RC Paper – and Rodinal black and white darkroom chemistry.
‘Our approach is that If you make all those products available there’s no reason have to have a premature demise,’ he said, adding that there were good retail margins in film-based photography ‘because you are dealing with a completely different market in Gen Y people doing it for the first time.
He said there were very few commercial photographers interested in film, but rather it was colleges, schools and enthusiasts which were driving demand.
‘In reality the issue for the film customer is not how much it costs, but can you get it.
‘It’s a little like vinyl records – they command incredible prices these days. But I think the music industry has handled the renewed interest in old technology a lot better than we have.’
He said demand for film products from IPS was definitely growing, but wasn’t sure how much of this was increased demand for end-users and how much was retailer customers coming back to the local suppliers ‘because it’s growing too expensive to grey market from B&H.’
Exotic film stock like Rollei ‘Crossbird’ (available in SUC and as a 35mm roll) – an E6 film which can also be cross-processed in C41 chemistry – help keep newfilm fans engaged.
‘We have more retailers in Camera House group buying film products, some photo independents and Kodak Express stores. It depends on the store owner whether they will support film or not,’ he said.
‘We have to make it easier to have stock available all the time to “built the habit”. So for instance with reliable supply, Fotofast in Brisbane now stocks B&W darkroom chemicals, offering the products online as well.
But for a wholesaler, there is a real balance between constantly having stock of low-demand products on hand, and basic inventory management. This is particularly so with date-limited film products.
‘- So we can’t have six months stock on hand – we are just getting in what we know we can sell. If someone is buying 20 rolls of Tri-X a month then, yes, you can keep it in stock – but with dating issues you have to be careful you are not bringing in unproductive inventory.’Facebook is reportedly pushing back its planned initial public offering (IPO) following a series of high-profile deals. Citing unnamed sources close to the company, CNBC is reporting that the company has moved its target date for the IPO from early to mid-May to as late as mid-June.
The report credits the delay to a series of acquisitions which have occupied the attention of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The report claims that executives have been unable to devote the time necessary to prepare for the launch.
A Facebook spokesperson delcined to comment on the report citing the company's ongoing IPO quiet period.
Facebook made headlines earlier this month when it agreed to acquire photo-sharing service Instagram in a $1 billionn cash and stock deal. When word leaked that Zuckerberg largely brokered and negotiated the deal without input from the company's broad of directors, analysts expressed concern about the company's management structure.
The company later made a second strategic transaction when it purchased a series of social networking patents from Microsoft to further strengthen its patent portfolio. The former AOL holdings could help the company fend off a legal challenge from Yahoo.
Facebook's IPO has become the most eagerly-anticipated public offering since Google began trading in 2004. Industry pundits believe that the outcome of the Facebook IPO could shape the landscape for other IPOs in the coming years.By HO HOFFMAN
Special to The Gazette
WESTFIELD TWP. â€” Who called the play?
That was the question Friday night when Cloverleaf converted a 52-yard fake field goal in the fourth quarter into a 36-yard touchdown pass to beat visiting Green 14-13 in the Suburban League opener for both teams.
â€œKyle Juszczyk made the call,â€ Colts coach Kevin Gault said. â€œHe is the holder on the play and has the option to fake the kick if he thinks we have the opportunity for a big play. He is extremely intelligent and understands the game just like he was another coach.â€
Trailing 13-7 at the time, Cloverleaf (4-0, 1-0) set up for what would be a 47-yard field goal attempt, but a 5-yard procedure penalty moved the ball back for what would have been a 52-yard try by Chris Matejka.
Juszczyk took the snap from center and started left, then reversed back to the right. He had two receivers wide open, one on the left and the other on the right. He chose Andrew Weese on the right side and the senior ran untouched from the 20-yard line into the end zone.
â€œIf we had not received the penalty, I would have let Chris go ahead and kick it,â€ Juszczyk said. â€œAndrew was wide open on the play and I was just worried I would throw it too long or too short. I just tried to guide the ball in.â€
The only person who wasnâ€™t surprised by the play was Green coach Tom Stacy.
â€œHeck, yes, I knew it was going to be a fake,â€ Stacy said. â€œI think everyone did, but we just blew the coverage on the play.â€
After that it was up to the Cloverleaf defense to shut down Green (1-3, 0-1), and the Colts did it in grand style. Green managed just 17 yards in seven plays and was forced to punt the ball away. The Bulldogs never got it back.
Defensive end Kyle Sirl came up huge a number of times. In the first quarter, his pressure forced Greenâ€™s Tyler Chaboudy into an 11-yard punt, which led to Cloverleafâ€™s first score, a 2-yard run by Adam Cepik. Sirl also stopped a first-quarter drive by sacking Jesse Mason for a 10-yard loss.
For good measure, he tackled Greenâ€™s Jason James (22 carries, 130 yards) in the backfield on the Bulldogsâ€™ final possession of the game.
â€œIt wasnâ€™t just me, it was the whole team that was coming up with big stops tonight,â€ Sirl said. â€œWe are concentrating on playing good team defense this year and it is really showing.â€
Greenâ€™s touchdowns came on a pair of 1-yard sneaks by Mason, the last in the fourth quarter with 9:40 remaining, but the snap on the extra point was fumbled and the kick never got off the ground.
Offensively, Cloverleaf relied on the two-headed quarterback duo of Juszczyk (60 yards passing, 62 yards rushing, 60 yards receiving) and Cody Roberts (17 yards rushing, 87 yards passing, 12 yards receiving) to supply most of the offense.
â€˜I think it works well with Cody and I sharing the quarterback spot,â€ Juszczyk said. â€œIt gives the defense different formations to worry about and we can catch them by surprise.â€
Like on a fake field goal.
UP NEXT: Cloverleaf (4-0, 1-0) travels to Copley. Green (1-3, 0-1) travels to Wadsworth.

Tamra Barney Fires Back At Her Ex In Ongoing Legal Battle
December 19, 2013 02:00 PM by Suzy Kerr
Sh*t just got real in the OC. Tamra Barney, star of The Real Housewives of Orange County, has fired back at her ex-husband Simon for his inflammatory claims about her hard partying ways, which he was using as part of his justification for why the pair’s three children should not appear on the show. Obvs, Tamra didn’t like his mention of her use of sex toys, among other things, so now the reality star has headed back to court to file her rebuttal.
Previously, we reported that Simon had prohibited the children, Sidney, 15, Spencer, 13, and Sophia, 8, from participating on the hit reality show, against the wishes of his ex Tamra. Tamra took him to court, citing that what happens during her time with the kids is up to her, and since then, the bitter exes have been busy trying to make each other look like complete a-holes.
After Simon blasted Tamra – and The Real Housewives of Orange County – earlier this week in court with mentions of strippers, sex toys and other adult-oriented material on the show, T has fired back with her own rebuttal, which is actually pretty lame. “The Petitioner utilizes the majority of his declaration to diminish my character while at the same time he is living with his girlfriend, who is twenty years younger than him,” Tamra says in court documents.“I am requesting the court admonish the Petitioner regarding his tactics. The Petitioner should take a moment to reflect on how he is damaging our children instead of utilizing all of his energies toward alienating them from me.”
Um, seriously Tamra? That’s what you’re going with? Half of the OC probably consists of men shacking up with hot young things. I seriously doubt anyone cares.
Tamra Barney did manage to make a few good points in her rebuttal, however, including that the adult-oriented stuff is ONLY done when the kids aren’t around, and that what happened at her bachelorette party (the bit about the sex toys/strippers) happens at bachelorette parties everywhere, so what’s the big deal? She also implored the judge to consider the fact that Simon’s entire argument seems to be built upon defaming her, rather than a genuine concern about what’s best for the children.
So whose side are you on? Should Tamra and Simon Barney’s kids be allowed to appear on the show? Tell us what you think: tamra-barney.com

Although great tits can live for nine years [GW's note: presumably from 18-27], breeding success declines rapidly after the age of two [WAIT, WHAT?!]. Nevertheless, older great tits keep on breeding every year...
Such hardworking great tits do age more swiftly than tits that get going at a more relaxed pace, but despite this early aging being costly...
Although the decline of the great tits is measureable by their breeding success, it's not easy to spot the older ones by eye [BULLSHIT!]

Forging a joint-venture is a means to leverage the skills, resources and relationships of the partners involved. In fact, many of the world's most successful companies were built on a foundation of a partnership between their founders. Examples include:
- Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak (Apple)
- Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google)
- Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce (Intel)
- Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield (Ben & Jerry's)
- Bill Gates and Paul Allen (Microsoft)
However, ill-conceived or ill-structured joint-ventures can lead to the implosion of the business, the loss of invested capital, the destruction of friendships and litigation. When crafting a joint-venture agreement the following are among the issues that should be crystalized:
- Legal entity
- Purpose and scope of the joint-venture
- Capital structure and capital contributions
- Governance
- Dealings between partners and joint-ventures
- Human resources
- Puts and calls
- Transferability of interests
- Dissolution / termination
This webinar provides guidance relative to questions such as:
- Is it prudent to operate the joint-venture as a trial before negotiating a joint-venture agreement?
- Should one lawyer be retained to negotiate the agreement with both partners?

I doubt very much that any build system will need the services of
numarray, which is not even a standard module ;-)
Because you can't turn off its C++ features, HP aCC can't compile
Python, but I'm pretty certain you can build an HP Python with GCC.

CAMBRIDGE -- Two top deans have asked Harvard University professors to reduce student expenditures on textbooks and other course material by putting those items on line or by deciding earlier if they plan to use the same textbook in subsequent semesters.
Jeremy R. Knowles, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, and Benedict H. Gross, dean of Harvard College, said the average amount Harvard students spend on textbooks, compact discs , course packets, and other related materials is pushing $1,300 a year.
"Many of our students either skimp on daily expenses to purchase course materials or skimp on their books to make ends meet," the deans wrote in an e-mail to staff last week.
Many Harvard students interviewed yesterday applauded the effort and said they hope it leads to a universitywide initiative to reduce student spending on course materials.
"I personally don't buy all the texts because prices are absurd," said Roy Cohen, 22, of Israel.
"I feel if Harvard is trying to open it s door more to people with diverse financial backgrounds, they could do more to help subsidize book costs," said Cohen, who has not declared a major.
The deans said they sent the e-mail this year because of concern over the growing cost of textbooks, as well as to remind faculty that more written material is available on line and licensable for institutional use.
The deans estimate that students collectively spend $8.5 million a year on textbooks and other course materials.
The move by Harvard deans follows attempts in Congress and state legislatures in Maryland, New York, and elsewhere to rein in rising textbook spending.
A US Government Accountability Office study two years ago found that textbook prices have been increasing about 6 percent a year since the 1987-88 school year because of the frequent updating of editions and bundling textbooks with materials such as CD-ROMs.
The study found students spend about $900 a year.
State Representative Steven M. Walsh, Democrat of Lynn, has filed a bill this year requiring publishers distributing textbooks in the Bay State to make them available for sale without forcing students to buy CD-ROMs, workbooks, and other materials.
But complaints about costs, particularly among students, go beyond materials sold by publishers. Students also are annoyed by the cost of course packets, which are compiled by professors and include photocopies of copyrighted materials, such as academic journal articles. The packets can run more than $100 at Harvard, students say.
"The course packets have no resale value," said Rick McKellar, 18, a freshman from Tennessee who has not declared a major. "I'd rather spend more on a hard cover book."
The deans said that faculty could help students by deciding in early spring whether they intend to use the same textbook in the fall.
A quicker decision could allow the Harvard Coop to buy back books from students enrolled in spring classes .
The students would receive about 50 percent of their payment back, while students next fall would have the benefit of buying a used book at a discount.
Some Harvard students, outraged by textbook costs, have created websites that list required readings for various courses and links to such places as Amazon.com, where students can buy books for less than area bookstores charge .
But even buying on line has its pitfalls, one student said.
"Sometimes, when you buy on line, the books don't get here on time," said Stephanie Shing, 18, a freshman from Cambridge.The world sets us up to fail. We are ALWAYS wrong.
“Colour within the lines” “think outside the box.”
“You look so pretty!” “Everything worthy is on the inside.”
“Be nice to girls.” “Don’t call them girls, and don’t even think of gender.”
“Go into highly paying jobs to make a good life.” “Do what you love! Work is not life.”
“Speak your mind.” “Don’t be pushy.”
“Be a man and don’t show emotions.” “Please listen empathetically.”
Because marketing is all about making us feel incomplete, inadequate, and in dire need of their product/service.
The way to avoid all this hurt? There are only a few choices. 1. Be perfect – we know this isn’t possible. 2. Trick myself and everyone into believing I’m perfect – this worked for a few years. 3. Denounce these messages. 4. Protect myself.
#3, denouncing these messages is what we are supposed to do. But they didn’t set us up for that either, did they? I was raised to doubt myself. How?
I was supposed to laugh when an adult shook a toy in my face regardless of my feelings.
When aunts came into the house, they did everything to get me to jump up and scream like it’s a competition, then next moment shouted at me to be quiet now because they want to have tea with grown-ups.
“Don’t be upset” when someone broke my favourite toy.
I told my mother I got bullied for having pigtails. She fixed my hair.
You know me. I’m naturally a strongly-opinionated, determined, confident person who has no trouble denouncing…anything. And even I couldn’t fight it all off when I was younger.
So option #4. we look for protection. The cape, as discussed in this clip. Everyone has a cape, she says. What is yours?
I personally don’t think we have to shed it completely. The world is too dangerous not to have an escape. But I do think it’s healthy for us all to know what our cape is and when and how we use them.
And to acknowledge that the ones we have the urge to criticise and make fun of – the ones with all their unglies hanging out – are the bravest ones.A new law school’s parking lot may encroach on the historic Candler Oak, a tree so old it was likely here when Gen. James Oglethorpe founded the city.
Plans drawn up for the Savannah Law School, an arm of Atlanta’s John Marshall School of Law to be housed in the old Candler Hospital across from Forsyth Park, show 14 parking spaces around the 300-year-old live oak. The rendering has the Savannah Tree Foundation nervous.
The oak’s branches extend beyond the dimensions of its easement drawn up in 1985 to protect the tree, said the foundation’s executive director Karen Jenkins. And they hang low.
“You physically cannot park in some of those spaces,” Jenkins said. “The minute an SUV with a roof rack and a surf board on top comes in it’s crunch.”
The school expects to open for its first 60 day and 35 evening students in August, with plans to increase enrollment to 400 to 450 in following years. Renovation at the site began last month and the tree is fenced off with chain link. Plans drawn by Lynch Associates Architects of Savannah show 10 parking spaces east of the trunk and four to the south. A note on the drawing
indicates “No work is to be done within the 100’ x 65’ Candler Oak easement.”
The Savannah Tree Foundation is looking into the legal question of whether the easement covers the entire tree or only the portion within the defined dimensions, Jenkins said.
Architect Andy Lynch said he and school officials are concerned about the tree but must also comply with city zoning requirements that dictate the number of off-street spaces the school must provide for students and faculty — 70 for this phase. Lynch initiated discussions with the Savannah Tree Foundation about the tree, he said.
Richard Lynn, dean of the Savannah Law School, noted the Candler Oak is already part of the school’s identity.
“We’re concerned about the health of the tree, too,” he said. “The tree is our logo. We want the tree to be happy and thrive.”
The proposed parking spots have been there a long time, he noted, and were used by previous tenants, the last of which left the Drayton Street side of the complex in 2000. Still he vowed not to use spaces that prove problematic.
“If tree branches are hanging down, then where there are branches we will not park there,” Lynn said.
“From our standpoint it’s not an issue. We’re not going to do anything inconsistent with the health of the tree.”
Jenkins estimates that where the plans call for 14 spaces around the oak, only five spaces would fit without disturbing the tree. A solution may arrive next week in the form of noted University of Georgia arborist Kim Coder, who was already scheduled to speak at a foundation event. He’s agreed to give his expert opinion about which, if any, branches can safely be pruned.
“We’re holding out for a professional arborist to make some kind of a judgement,” Jenkins said.
In the meantime, the foundation is looking at ways to reconfigure the parking lot to squeeze more spots out of the rest of the property and keep vehicles away from the oak, Jenkins said.
That's all we need to say: Protect that tree!
Savannah has a unique heritage in its trees, the people and the city care for and maintain them. This is not the case in the rest of Georgia and in particular in metro Atlanta. Where trees are seen as an obstacle, something to be removed for development. Savannah's streets are lined with them and they are not seen in a like fashion anywhere else either in this state. In fact the DOT forcibly removes them from roads elsewhere to keep a drunk recovery zone. Removing trees from at least 15 feet from a paved surface. So when the drunk passes out and goes off the road there is a chance he or she will wake up and recover. Savannah is a living picture for what it should be like. The rest of Georgia a poster child for what it should not be like.Article Text
Abstract
Background The coexistence of infection and anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) has been increasingly reported in the literature under the assumption that infection may be a triggering factor for the development of APS.
Objectives To conduct a systematic review of case reports documenting the development of primary APS after a prior infection, and to describe and categorize the clinical and immunological phenotypes in these cases.
Methods We conducted a comprehensive search in electronic databases from inception through October 2013 (Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL). We selected publications of case reports: 1) describing APS development after an infection; and 2) published in English, French, or Spanish. Study selection, quality appraisal, and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. We extracted data on the potentially putative infection, the cases' clinical presentation, and their anti-phospholipid antibodies (APL Ab) profiles.
Results Out of 2,278 citations, only 200 case reports met our inclusion criteria. Two different groups of patients were identified. The first group included patients who presented with specific clinical and immunological findings that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of primary APS after a definite history with documentation of preceding infection. Various types of bacterial (including spirochetal), viral, parasitic, and fungal infections were reported as preceding or triggering APS. Most commonly reported infections involved Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Mycoplasma pneumonia. Thromboembolic events included neurological, respiratory, and peripheral thrombosis, often with persistent positive APL Ab. The second group included patients who did not fulfil the criteria for diagnosis of APS, but developed transient positive autoimmune APL Ab after an infection. Among this group, 60% developed thromboembolic attacks during the course of the infection, with or without other coagulation disorders. In these latter cases the causal relationship between the development of antibodies and thrombosis was not clearly established, since thrombotic events could also be attributed to the infection itself, or a separate co-existent hypercoagulable state.
Conclusions This review found many reports of APS or APL Ab occurring after a variety of infections, including bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic agents. A causal relationship cannot be established with these data, but the evidence supports that further longitudinal studies should be conducted to identify the risk of APS after infection with these agents.

Blivit – something for which one cannot find a word; something difficult to name.
Chicanery – the use of trickery to achieve a political, financial, or legal purpose.
Cumbly – benumbed with cold
Gambrinous – intoxicated by beer.
Gelid – f*cking cold, geezus could it get any worse.
Mardy – a sulky slightly aggressive moody teenager, usually female.
Mulligrubs – ill temper; colic; grumpiness.
Naufragous – something relating to or causing a shipwreck; something that creates a disaster.
Nescience – lack of knowledge or awareness.
Nudnik – a persistently dull, boring pest.
Potation – a drink or draft, especially of an alcoholic beverage.
Quisquillious – having the nature of rubbish (a splendid word indeed!)
Skiver – someone who skips or weasels out of a responsibility.
Viridity – greenness

3100
$41,995
5.7L LT1 MOTOR, 4L60E AUTOMATIC TRANS, NICELY FINISHED WOOD BED, VERY CLEAN PICK
What if you could have a truck that looks like 1956 but drives like a muscle car? Well, here's the answer to your question, a spectacular 1956 Chevy 3100 pickup with a modern Corvette LT1 inside plus a cabin full of luxury options. Talk about having your cake and eating it too!
Painted an updated, semi-metallic version of the old favorite Hunter Green, this Cameo and slightly rustic knotty pine bed with polished stainless strips that tie in with the bright chrome bumpers and brilliantly restored grille. Nothing has been deleted or shaved, which should tell you something about how right the original design really was. Instead, they focused on making it right and they've definitely succeeded in a very big way. This truck is incredible!
Black leather is the dominant theme inside, with the original bench seat reupholstered in modern leather and what appears to be ostrich skin for the inserts. It retains a '50s sensibility, but the modern materials will definitely attract more than their fair share of appreciative nods at shows. Simple door panels were covered in matching black leather and beautifully bound black carpets soften the interior considerably, and help control noise and temperature inside. The dash uses a set of Dakota Digital gauges in the original panel, and A/C vents have been discreetly tucked underneath. A tilt wheel with a custom billet wheel adds to the 21st century feel, as well as the Pioneer AM/FM/CD stereo head unit in the dash, with speakers scattered throughout the cab.
Underneath that beautiful green sheetmetal, you'll find a very OEM-looking chassis. Up front there's a 350 cubic inch Corvette LT1 V8 that looks very much like a factory installation. Instead of flash, you get function and reliability, along with easy serviceability. It's clever that the painted it Chevy Orange, so it looks right between the vintage truck's wheel wells. Power steering and power front disc brakes make this truck a pleasure to drive, and the Mustang II style front suspension gives it agile handling, particularly for a pickup. A 4L60E 4-speed automatic clicks through the gears, feeding a GM 10-bolt rear hanging on a set of stout leaf springs that mean this truck can still work for a living. Long-tube headers and a 2.5-inch dual exhaust system gives it just a little bit of rumble, but it doesn't intrude, making this truck an easy long-distance hauler. Staggered chrome wheels emulate vintage Torque Thrusts and wear 225/50/18 front and 275/40/20 rear performance rubber.
This is a no-compromises truck built to very high standards, and you'll be proud to call it your own. Call today!

SEC Charges Insider in EMC-DOCX Deal
Here's the SEC's complaint.
Yeah, you know what's coming next...Yeah, you know what's coming next...
DOCX executives asked Xie in late November 2007 to participate in a meeting with EMC representatives concerning a plan to further extend the pre-existing partnership between EMC and DOCX. DOCX executives asked Xie to compile information about DOCX’s source code and other documents in anticipation of the meeting with EMC. Xie also worked on the project with a due diligence firm hired by EMC.
On December 7, 2007 at a meeting between EMC and DOCX employees in Oakland, Xie made a presentation and answered related questions. After the meeting, Xie asked his DOCX supervisor what would happen if someone were to buy DOCX shares in a time period when they thought something was going to happen to that company. Xie’s supervisor told Xie that would be a bad thing to do, that it could be traced, and that it was prohibited and illegal. As late as December 19, 2007, Xie continued to work with EMC and EMC’s due diligence firm.
Sigh.Sigh.
Xie began acquiring shares of DOCX common stock prior to the December 7th meeting, while preparing due diligence materials for EMC. These initial purchases of 6,892 shares were made at prices ranging from $8.39 to $8.68. Despite the warning from his supervisor on December 7th, Xie continued to acquire DOCX common stock up to the day before the merger announcement, purchasing an additional 3,607 shares. In total, between December 3, 2007 and December 26, 2007, Xie purchased 10,499 DOCX common shares for prices ranging from $8.10 to $8.81.The sweet potato is one of nature’s amazing foods.

I recived a paper in the mail addressed to me that said I was eligible for a $10,000 dollar platinum credit card to order items from their catalog.
All I had to do was reply with my signature and a $37.00 check/money order and I would receive a card in the mail. I signed the form with a money order inside and sent it back. I recived a paper with a cardboard credit card attached along with some adds and an order from.
I have tried to access their website several times, I have also tried locate a way to order their catalog, I have also tried to call the number provided in the letter but all I get is a recording and when it's finished it hangs up automatically. [continued below]....
Something needs to be done about this they have scammed me out of my money. Who know how many other innocent people have been scammed by this.
I would love to get my money back but somehow I have a feeling I will not see it again. This so called "company" or "people" needs to be faced with the penalties. If any action is being done about this please let me know. Hopefully they don't just get away with this!

Before I was diagnosed with cancer, I couldn’t care less about my birthday, but now, it’s something to look forward to. Why? Because every birthday now, means I made it one more year after being told I had cancer.
But that’s not the only milestone now. Oct. 8th is the anniversary of the day I went into the ER with severe abdominal pains, which led to my emergency surgery, temporary ostomy and cancer.
Feb. 18th is the anniversary of my MOAS. Feb. 22nd is our wedding anniversary. For the rest of our lives (which I hope will be a very long time), those two events will be forever linked.
July 6th is the anniversary of my exploratory surgery and ostomy reversal, which, believe me, was a big day.
So, every day, that is somehow related to my cancer, is an occasion I celebrate. It is one more reminder that I am alive, and I made it to one more milestone.

M.I.A. on Pitchfork
More M.I.A. (Don't snipe me.)
No intentional overload here, but Maya has been making her rounds lately.
From a Pitchfork interview posted this morning:
."
This is a specific reference to the media's approach to Wes (Diplo) and his output in her music. She vents her frustration on how he is identified over and over as her chief collaborator and the mastermind behind a large part of her work. She points out that he only contributed one track for Arular and two for the forthcoming Kala. She also claims that Switch (if anyone) should be pointed out as her chief collaborator on Kala.
I don't believe Maya meant any genuine disrespect toward Wes or anyone else in particular with these statements. But it's quite a fiery interview.

I have never seen a crepe that I did not like, except my own.
I prepared the batter, which was so easy and chilled it for a few hours.
The problem is trying to cook them. I used a heavy duty frying pan
and everything seemed to get too hot. I either burned the bottom or,
when flipping it over, it fell apart.
I attempted the recipe three times in the last week trying to perfect
them for photos. (not too much of an effort since we enjoyed them anyway.)
The sauce was really easy. I whisked the juices and the butter by hand
and it turned out very smooth. When I first tasted the blend I thought
there was too much of a lemon flavor, but then realized it just
worked when served with the crepes.
I served one crepe to Jim with nutella inside and drizzled some on top.
He said he preferred the sauce I had made with the honey. That surprised
me because he loves nutella. One of my fondest memories is my mother
preparing crepes for us when I was young. They were served plain
with a sprinkle of sugar on top. Simply delicious.Per Tricia~
This week brought together everything I love about French Fridays.
The recipe for crepes was a classic French dish, one that my family
and I love elsewhere but for whatever reason I had not been making
at home, and one where Dorie's wonderful tips guided me in the
kitchen and provided me more than just the "ingredients and instructions".
Specifically ? Her suggestion that to use your fingers to gently flip the crepes.
While I have no pride about getting something done in the kitchen,
I can clearly admit that this was not a technique I would have even
thought of. But it worked like a charm. In fact, I feel quite confident it
saved every crepe I made. So there I was, husband dying over the
aroma of the citrus and crepes and patiently waiting to fulfill his role
as taste tester - and I am bragging to him about how wonderful Dorie
is because she tuned me in to the using my fingers.
"Check this out.
It works perfectly.
I never would have thought of this myself.
This is why I love Dorie.
This is why this book is fun."
Welcome to French Fridays in my kitchen :)
The crepes were served with the wonderful honey citrus sauce and
I filled several with some homemade whipped cream. And all along
I wondered why I had not made these in such a long time. I can't wait
to make them for the boys when they are home. Crepes = love.
These shots are from the 2007 trip we took to Paris with the boys. Nana and my
Dad were there as well so it was a very special vacation memory for all of us.
And there was no shortage of crepes.
At 20 and 17 now, you can imagine that a lot has changed in the last 7 years.
One thing that has not - their love of crepes.
Happy French Fridays
I LOVE the pics of the boys and the crêpes in Paris :) Happy French Friday!
Plain or fancy, they both look delicious!
What fun! Using my fingers was great except for the burning them part. ;) It sounds like these tasted great even if more batches were necessary for pictures. Fun pictures of your boys!!
Great post ladies! I also have fond memories of my mom making Palacsinta…which are Hungarian crepes. These were a winner in my house…everyone loved them! I actually made them three times in the last few weeks. Tricia, I love the pictures of your boys enjoying those crepes in Paris…wonderful memories! Happy French Friday!
What a great post! I wouldn't throw away anything from Paris, either!
Ro, we are just too self-critical. I always say I know how to make food that tastes good but it doesn't always look pretty. I think of Julia Child's saying about if a plate is immaculate, too many hands have handled it. The most important thing is how they taste - and these were good!
I love your family photos, too!
I used my fingers, too! Think I always have. Nana, my mom used to make us crepes, too...I liked them so much better than pancakes.Tricia, loved your old family vacation shots. I finally got my kids to try crepes on our LAST day in France. I wouldn't let them leave the country without that experience!
Oh I just loved the pictures of your "little" boys in France doing the crepe detail with their Dad. (That is Dad, right?) Wasn't it fun to pull up that picture? I also love crepes and long ago (30 years) used to have luncheons and would make crepes all morning before my guests arrived. I must have been out of my mind! But, they were fabulous. Everyone is loving Dorie's recipe for crepe batter and I am anxious to try it. Daughter Melissa is coming to visit for a week (yeah, an entire week without kids and husband) and she is bringing her crepe pan. It's going to be crepe and garbure week at the Hirsch/Place household. Nana, your crepes look wonderful. Susan is right, we are tough on ourselves. I know this brought back childhood memories for you also. Nope, in Iowa, Mom never made me crepes!
That IS in fact Dad :) Otherwise known as "St. Peter".
Well done ladies! Nana, I think your crepes turned out beautiful. Tricia, thank you for sharing your photos. I favorite place to get crepes is Paris too!!!
Nana & Tricia: Fancy or Plain, you gurls rock!
Wow! Your crepes look wonderful (both of you!). The only thing I have in common is that I never make them at home. Mine were pretty much a disaster, but then again, I only made 1/2 recipe once... I did not try and try again - look at that perfection! My only win was my citrus vanilla sauce to go with - yummy enough to make a "mess" still tasty.
Both of you did an excellent job on making the crepes even with your trepidations. Tricia I found the finger technique a charm too that I would never have thought of… love the boys with the outdoor crepe makers… you gotta love their crepe makers.
Nana, yours look just fine Nice job, both of you. Yes, Tricia, that sugar rubbed with citrus smelled just magical! I think I need to practice these again to get them to look right, but fortunately the mistakes still taste pretty good. Loved the family pix.
I used my fingers also! It burned but it was worth it! I love your pictures!!! and is that Laduree lemon curd I see in the background? yummy!!
Love the pics from France. And love the look of your crepes as well. I probably would have liked the ones from Nana's mom best though. Simple is better when it comes to pancakes for me.
Nana, I'm amazed that you made these 3 times. What dedication! Your final photo is beautiful. Tricia, I'm so interested to know that using your fingers worked. I might try that next time. I was worried about burning myself.
Three times, wow! Impressed.
Loved the Paris pics - things do change in seven years, don't they? (except for the love of certain foods, I hope)
Both sets of crepes look delicious ladies. Nana, I admire your stick-to-it-iveness. I would have made one batch, and if they were ugly, I would resign myself to it and photograph it. Hope you both have a great week.
Your crepes (both sets ) look delicious:) I loved the sugar technique with the citrus - priceless. Thanks for sharing your pictures of your trip to Paris.
Love the pictures from Paris - I included one too of crepe making and one with our beloved Mardi who I was lucky enough to have dinner with summer before last. I loved this recipe - her little additions made them so special.
Nana and Tricia, it looks like you both succeeded with this week's recipe! I love the photos from Paris, too. The boys may be grown up, now, but I bet they still love crepes.
Nana: your crêpes look fabulous - how nice that you enjoyed the citrus/butter sauce with them as well - I agree that a bit of tartness is nice with the slightly sweet crêpes.
Tricia: looks like you more than enjoyed this recipe - the crêpes all filled with that whipped cream and served with the orange slices and sauce look just fabulous! And your photos from Paris are a real treasure!
Tricia, what lovely memories of crepes and family and Paris. I noticed your Laduree jar lurking in the background and was jealous! Nana, I had the same issues with my crepes. My fire either too high or too low. My crepes either sticking or falling apart!
You both made beautiful crepes! My husband thought they were OK but didn't love them - I think it's because he has never had them on the streets of Paris like your family!
How wonderful! Both of your crepes look fantastic. I can't believe Nana made them three times. Well, they say, three's the charm! And the previous batches made for yummy tests I am sure! Love your Paris pictures!
Great memories. Crepes look so good. Nutella, huh. Next time.Direction:

"Pay close attention to your personal security at all times and monitor the media for information about possible new safety or security risks. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time anywhere in India with little or no warning.
"We continue to receive reporting that terrorists plan to attack public places, including hotels and tourist locations, in New Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities. Terrorists may also be planning attacks against Indian political and security interests," the advisory stated.

'Exercise a high degree of caution in India'
Australia's Sports Minister Mark Arbib, also urged the athletes to exercise "extreme caution" during the Games.
"The government travel advice urges Australians to 'exercise a high degree of caution in India, including in New Delhi'. We continue to receive reports of possible terrorist attacks in New Delhi, Mumbai and other cities."
The words of caution came after two Taiwanese tourists were injured in a firing incident in Delhi on Sunday. The Games Organisers immediately issued a statement assuring fool-proof security during the Games.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said the situation is being monitored but the country remains committed to participating in the Games.
"We are providing the best advice we can to the New Zealand Olympic Committee who have to make that decision by September 24 whether to travel to Delhi or not," Key told Radio New Zealand.

'It's important to remain reasonably calm'
The New Zealand Olympic Committee said information is being sought on Sunday's firing incident.
New Zealand Athletes' Federation chief Rob Nichol, however, said the attack should not trigger panic reaction.
"It's important to remain reasonably calm and continue to have a bit of faith in the process," he said.
"It's definitely concerning, but it's not something that should necessarily result in a 180 degree shift. We always plan and ask questions around the worst-case scenario, because the reality is Delhi and India are at high risk of terrorist attack and there is a Commonwealth Games being staged there.
"If the athletes are going to go and if the Games are going to go ahead then you have to have security measures in place," he added.

articleThis isn’t going to fly as an alternative to LeBron for the New York faithful. But there’s a chance that the Knicks – who are always assumed to be willing to exceed the luxury tax – would like to bring in Tracy McGrady as a one-year mercenary. It would sell some tickets, some jerseys, and would possibly keep the Garden entertained while waiting for 2010.
That would work out best for both the Knicks and McGrady, who has a year to prove that he’s worth a monster deal when he becomes a free agent along with the rest of the world in 2010. He’d have the spotlight on him in New York, where he could show the rest of the League that he’s still a viable 24-point per game scorer.
The Knicks could put together a package that would save the Rockets some money and include a veteran shooting guard with an expiring contract — Larry Hughes ($13.6M) — along with Cuttino Mobley‘s 80-percent insured $9.5M deal. Mobley could then officially retire with the team that drafted him (and originally knew about his heart condition). Call it full circle.
There are some issues with that scenario, though. First of all, Mobley retired in December. Even if he magically unretired and made himself available for a trade back to the squad that drafted him originally, there’s a rule explicitly prohibiting the trade of an injured/sick player.
But even if there were some scenario in which these two teams could work out a deal, principally sending McGrady for Hughes, would it be a good move for New York?
“I like it a lot”
First!!!!!! I think it would be a good deal for NY but not for houston. Htown could make another run at it n they are bound to be healthy at lwast for a year(see 09 nuggets)
i would not trade for mcgrady , ever.
anyone in the tri-state area who watched a decent chunk of Knicks games can tell you that they are plenty exciting without T-Mac. and it’s kinda insulting to NYK fans to assume they would get excited about an injured-as-hell-coming-off-microfracture-surgery T-Mac. come on now…
TMac is going to be a man on a mission next season. He has a chip on his shoulder and many trying to guard him will pay. If I were Houston I would make the trade only if it included a draft pick.
I like it if the knicks are as committed as they seem to trading away any and all talent they have in the name of shedding salary to sign nobody in 2010.
Or if McGrady is gonna sign a deal for significantly less than the $20 per he’s been getting.
I cant see any team or scenario where he would get more than 10-15 on his next deal, but im sure he and his agent dont see it that way.
Dude too fucking frail i cant get with him.
Trade for T-Mac, but instead of mobley’s contract give them jared jeffries. The contracts match, and make this a possible trade. They are a defensive minded team and he would fit in perfectly, also ridding the Knicks of his contract. This trade probably wouldnt fly in houston but as a Knicks fan i’d do this in a hearbeat.
Then trade the #8 pick and David Lee plus mobleys contract for Amare Stoudemire. McGrady can keep the seat warm for Lebron or Wade, and Stoudemire is sure to entice either one of them to come.
@3
don’t you mean he has a chip in his knees?
mcgrady is a has-been.
@Buffalo
I agree, hell he’ll be REALLY lucky to get 10-15 unless he has some freakish monster year next season. He has to convince everyone he can play a full season and into the playoffs without injury if he wants anything close to 10 per.
Win-Win situation! Go do it now!!! :p
McGrady is done. We’ve been sayingthis for at least 3 years now. McGrady even said it himself when he announced this would be his last NBA contract.
You can talk about motivation all you want but anyone who watched him last year saw a player who’s body and heart are no longer NBA ready to be an NBA player.
NBA teams need to stop trading for/signing names (Ben Wallace, Shaq, AI) and start trading for/signing good basketball players.
Trevor Ariza could be had for 1/3 of T-Mac’s contract and at this point is twice the player.
This will not go well for NYK if they acquire him. There is no guarantee that he will even be healthy for majority of the season. But then again, the knicks have a history of throwing away money (eddy curry, jerome james,, etc.)
good deal for both.
worst case scenario, NYK gets a big expiring contract. Best case, they get the benefits of hosting Tmac’s comeback tour, which really would be big news in the NBA given how good he used to be and the fact that everyone’s tired of hearing about kobe/lebron.
Houston gets rid of a monster contract. If he gets healthy they wouldn’t need him anyway since they’re better without him.
Either way no one is giving Tmac more than the midlevel exception.
I dunno who’s on NYk’s roster to offer, but they should get a first rounder and whatever contracts match at least.
T-Mac would kill in NY. All he has to do is run and shoot?! That’s all he’s ever wanted!
T-Mac to NY, another 1st round exit if that!
I’d love it as a Knick fan.
One year to keep it interesting until 2010.
Much better than Hughes and Cuttino’s ghost.
Allen Houston’s ghost
As long as it doesn’t negatively impact the salary cap, I don’t see the problem. I doubt that McGrady will ever play a full season again, though.
Hmmm.. As a T-Mac and Houston fan.. this is not a good trade!
Houston should at least keep T-Mac for a while to see how good the team is with all players in place. If not, then they can try and trade him if they can get a good deal of youger players and maybe a draft pick.
Don’t just trade the guy, even if he’s not healthy this season, yo can pay him his money and let him walk. If he has a monster year that would be great for Houston, and they can try and make a run at it one more time.
Just Wait!
The Rockets don’t need more role players. If they trade McGrady for anything, it would need to be another star (preferably a scorer). That money could be used for Chris Bosh, Ben Gordon, etc. Most teams, despite what the NY media and fans believe believe, aren’t all that excited about $20M worth of Knicks in return.
TMAC IS A BUM.
If I were Houston I’d hold onto T-Mac and what see what happens as the February 2010 trade deadline comes closer. Some teams may have a need for either another shooter or big expiring deal. I think Houston can get more for T-Mac during the season when teams start to panic than they could during the summer.
he’s such a little bitch
didn’t they get enough of that with marbury, francis, and the rest of those clowns?
It’s a good argument but I don’t think this really pans out as a great deal.
And this is why Knick fans are sleeping soundly tonight.This is a crazy “what if scenario”,good for convo and at the worst case makes the numbers work.
i bet you my next paycheck Isaiah woulda signed T-mac to multiyear contract with a trade kicker and an opt-out clause.
Ps:Tmac’s heart gave out long before his body did.
want proof-look at this season.Wait till he has to prove himself.Coz he’ll want to.
THEN,trade him asap.
I think that this trade is perfect well get rid of some dead weight contracts. if they give up jefferys would could try and sneek in a draft pick for em as well then trade up in the draft and try and loose maybe curry(BUST) or somebody who can move well in d atonis system
This would be a solid deal as long as they dont give up neither danilo or chandler or draft picks. But i think walsh is focusing on more important things like moving up in the draft and obtaining ricky rubio.
nah, you can’t send tmac to a bad knicks team. Thats how he started gettin hurt anyone. Having to do everything by himself on a ass magic team. And guys need to chill cuz even a 75% tmac is better than almost anyone the knicks have not named lee. I still say if hedo leaves, tmac goes back to orlando and plays second/third fiddle to dwight/jameer. Hes a better closer than hedo is since he can actually create his own shot. Won’t be injured as much since he doesn’t have to carry the team and he creates the same size issues hedo did.
As for the injury, he should be pretty find since he got the micro pretty early this season and didn’t jump back into it like other guys did.
watching mcgrady leave has to be a welcome site until larry hughes pulls up
talk about worthless
only guy in the league that wouldnt give up a little game to mesh with LeBron
its all about numbers and jumper attempts with this clown
Can T-Mac affect a team positively? Is that possible? Cause all I can see is him being booed mercilessly in NY as he shoots 8 straight awful jumpshots.
Donnie get done.
It would be like buying expired cheese at the supermarket (and knowing it)
Larry Johnson, Spreewell…Mcgrady. As long as a player loses his hops, he is welcome in NY. I’m slitting my wrists, now.
Don’t forget mcdeyess…
This is exactly what Houston needs. Ditch McGrady, whom is seldom healthy, in the decline in his career. And, a player whom cannot deliver the goods when, after the 82 games are finished (most of which he sits out, recently), loses immediately during the NBA playoffs.
If I was the Houston GM, Nate Robinson and David Lee would have to be in the deal, and then I feel empathetic to hansosword:
hansosword says:
Larry Johnson, Spreewell…Mcgrady. As long as a player loses his hops, he is welcome in NY. I’m slitting my wrists, now.
The Knicks are in the top three for most retarded management moves, so this fits right. Tmac a mercenary, from where his bed? He doesnt even attend ten games a year does he?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
T-Wac is 100% garbage. His glass knees and cardboard back have set me off as a Houston fan… Trade his @$$
Knicks are getting Kobe and McGrady…maybe even Nash or stoudemire..knicks didn’t dump (rose,j.James,randlolph,Crawford for no reason…bosh mite also be a possibility…all I gotta say is KNICKS fansbe ready for something exciting!!!!!!!
Gooooo knicks!! I could see Kobe and mc grady on the knicks
As a T Mac fan. If he stay a 100 %. He will do good anywhere. He still got it. At 100% !
Hang in there t mac. Only u no what u can do. Where ever u be do what u love 2 do. Play with you heart. U can’t lose!
I think Rockets need McGrady. They need to see how McGrady do in the first couple of games and see how he do first. If McGrady shows progess keep him he has one more contract left but if he don’t show any progess then get rid of him for a small forward and a center thats if was Manager i’ll GET Micheal Redd and Boget or Caron Bulter and Mcgee. If you give McGrady for anybody like Wilson Chandler who’s also have surgry Rockets giveing up alot with tought a scorer and another thing get a Center like Rasheed Wallace out the free agency since Yao Ming is also having problem. Sign Artest back maybe a four year contract. Allen Iverson can play Shooting Guard spot as well as McGrady can i’m sure Iverson don’t want to be sitting on the bench for Pistons like last year and had a back problem please read this note its good.
Who ever picked up big mac would be in for a surprise! please get him off our hand. Big Mac (T-mac) is what its name stand for. It’s pricey but ain’t all that good. T-mac is a man on mission to injuries. and that will make it that much more interesting..
Fuck man t-mac my fav player adn the rockets my fav teamAnother reader submission for From The Terraces, as COS reader Mick reckons This Is Anfield might know better than a highly paid professional manager.
This Is Anfield are proposing a radical solution to Liverpoolâ€™s problems this Premiership season. Bring back Roy Evans? Sort of. What they actually want is a return to 3-5-2 – with wingbacks and everything – which they feel would suit the current crop of players better than Rafa Benitezâ€™s current formation (whatever that is).
Itâ€™s currently in vogue to laugh in the face of 3-5-2, the evidence being:
1) No one has ever won anything playing it recently
2) Croatia 2-0 England
But thereâ€™s a fairly convincing argument to be made in Liverpoolâ€™s case. And here it is:
Sami Hyppiaâ€™s tortoise pace could be covered up if both Carragher and (particularly) Aggers played alongside him in a back three. The big Finn could head balls away all day long, without getting skinned alive by any forwards who are under 40.
Wing back wise, John Arne Riise should rule the left side. Heâ€™s flitted between left back and left mid all his Anfield career, so maybe somewhere inbetween would suit him best. Steve Finnan is similar player on the other flank (minus the thunderbolt shot, obviously). Bad news for Mark GonzÃ¡lez and Jermaine Pennant though.
3-5-2 would also solve the never-ending Anfield midfield debate. Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard would both benefit from playing in a central midfield three with a holding player doing the defensive work. Ideally they could play with Momo Sissoko behind them, though the long legged Malian is recovering from that nasty dislocated shoulder (recently operated on by the way). The alternative is to let Alonso sit and dictate play while Sissoko and Gerrard do their headless chicken impressions up and down the park, knowing someone was covering.
Up front it would be the same old problem though, with Benitez struggling to choose two from Crouch, Kuyt and Craig â€œthe new Thierry Henryâ€ Bellamy.
Itâ€™s unlikely to happen of course, with only Steve â€œMad Macâ€ McClaren loopy enough to play 3-5-2 in the Premiership as a first choice tactic in recent memory. But maybe someone at Liverpool should dig out Vegard Heggemâ€™s mobile number, just in case.

To woo potential clients and reward the long-standing ones for their patronage, nearly each successful commercial enterprise these days employs loyalty programs of a few type. Statistically, you probably have participated in loyalty programs on numerous activities and used coupons, plastic cards and digital notes that had a few value in the network of the organization that determined to reward its clients. enamgi veel, from personal experience, you can possibly attest that conventional loyalty programs be afflicted by a whole host of maladies.
aga, there’s an apparent lack of a unified system, which results in low liquidity of loyalty points. Rewards are redeemable at certain institutions and frequently not effortlessly so. aga, digitization is necessary in the present day international. At the same time as a few loyalty rewards are even now trackable or redeemable on-line, nevertheless they’re not digital assets in and of themselves. enamgi veel, of course, there’s the need to use the intermediaries, like banks, which by itself will increase the expenses and introduces extra protection dangers. The ones are all much-acquainted problems to everybody who’s been following the development of Blockchain in the real sector of the economic system. Many industries have by now experienced the new disruptive paradigm of Blockchain and loyalty programs couldn’t stay an exception for long.
There are industries that may use Blockchain and there are industries that actually need it. Loyalty programs fall somewhere in between. The advantages are clear and real. Blockchain offers software providers simple and efficient equipment, which facilitate unmediated interaction between clients, managers and individual vendors. All of us realize by now that Blockchain is tamper-proof and very comfortable. aga, possibly the most compelling advantage of Blockchain is price-performance. Loyalty programs cost a fortune to increase and hold even as Blockchain solution can do the work better at a fraction of the cost. The remaining aspect that needs to be stated is the tokenization of loyalty points. Essentially, being created on a digital currency token, loyalty rewards may be freely transferred between people or even exchanged for fiat or different digital currencies on digital currency and bitcoin exchanges.
To the present day, some of solutions facilitating an interlinked loyalty reward network were created. Whole digitization offers an excellent possibility for integration of many unique loyalty programs on the same platform and that was the direction selected by the majority of the present start-ups.
Even though the decentralized nature of Blockchain compels each venture to create their personal economic environment, loyalty programs can grow to be an exception. As they’re not the primary business attention of any organization, becoming a member of a consortium attempt does not contain serious dangers that could mitigate the advantages. One of the most pressing challenges for a new Blockchain environment is attracting sufficient participants to the budding marketplace and a continuing loyalty reward area may be positive in conducting that task. A compelling argument not to be brushed aside without problems.
With just one wallet to build up all reward points in an integrated economic infrastructure, clients could not need to memorize every application ought policies and redemption alternatives and vendors not to worry about the liquidity of their reward points. The first client reward software based on blockchain technology is Ribbit, which was appeared in 2014. Since then numerous other platforms like Loyyal and Blockpoint have been released. The initiatives are very comparable and simplistic in nature but continually we see new iterations of this idea resurfacing every so often. So is it a fashion exploitation or does the marketplace really want more of these? One might suppose that becoming a member of an already existing huge conglomerate could usually be more useful for the members ultimately. Seems there’s nevertheless great value in decentralization in terms of reward programs.
To demonstrate why under positive occasions it is useful to create a very separate client loyalty system, one ought to check the latest participant in the marketplace, BioCoin. This startup based in Russia isn’t only a loyalty platform designed to incentivize clients with units based on blockchain technology of value. The platform’s broader aim is to facilitate the economy friendly and healthy agricultural paradigm international.
Briefly, BioCoin is supposed to assist eco-farmers and organic food stores and permit them to return value into their local communities through a system of rewards and discounts. To gain this, a separate economic system is important, as it will permit to keep and multiply value within the community.
To sum it up, there’s a clear incentive to construct loyalty platforms encompassing separate industries that rely upon nice remarks from the community. Blockchain nowadays is progressively permeating the loyalty programs sphere but its achievement relies upon ultimately on whether enough stores and clients in the world might dare to adopt this trending but unpolished technology.Invert the problem ;-) Sort descending by the time_stamp field and limit the result to 1, i.e. SELECT * FROM table_xyz ORDER BY time_stamp DESC LIMIT 1 Tim -----Original Message----- From: Brian J.

On what started out as a Monday with Mari, we explored PiChai Yuan, the Catholic Church, and then walked over to this Christian (Protestant) Church. Amazingly enough, we had not yet been to any of these sights, so this was a really great sightseeing day for us. We walked a lot, but since the humid was a little lower than usual, we weren’t quite melting. Sweaty but not drenched!
Elijah had failed asleep before we reached PiChai Yuan and slept right through our short stop at the Catholic Church. The poor little guy misses half of the stuff that we do during the middle of the day! We wanted to go up the bell tower so Nana said she would wait downstairs with the stroller. She had visited this church last year, while out sightseeing with Trent and Angie.
The view from the top of the bell tower was pretty. However there were some really obnoxious wedding photographers up there. They were hogging the windows and SCREAMING instructions down to the couples they were photographing. I found it quite disrespectful. Especially since there were “please be quiet” signs everywhere. Nevertheless, we sat down and enjoyed the bell tower anyway.
When we go downstairs, Elijah was awake (but still quite sleepy)…
We then had to decide where we were off to next. Usually Mariska and I only see two (maybe three) big sights on a Monday, but it seems that this week we were in an area that was packed with popular things to see. While walking with had spotted three dome-shaped figures on the hill closeby, so we pulled out our phones to see what they could be. Man, you gotta love modern technology! Before Justin and I had smart phones we would just walk and walk and walk. It was fun, and we always anded up having an adventure, but this new approach is so much more efficient.
Our next stop was Signal Hill Park. As you can see, in the above image, we were able to see the Christian (Protestant) Church from the Signal Hill Park. In fact, we could see almost all of Qingdao from that park. I was once amazed again that we had never been to these sights before, but so happy that we were finally making the time to see all that Qingdao has to offer. This old part of Qingdao is absolutely amazing. The architecture and quiet streets are charming!

While I agree with the article, there is one thing that tends to stand out in reviews of smartphones: while non-iPhone reviews always highlight the things the reviewed device lacks compared to the iPhone, the reverse is rarely - if ever - true.
Which has nothing to do with bias, and everything with a lack of empathy. Tech journalism is almost exclusively an American affair, and all of these reviewers carry iPhones themselves. This is perfectly fine, were it not that they seem to be incapable to put themselves in someone else's shoes and look at all the things, say, an Android user in Germany would have to give up were she or he to buy an iPhone.

Please also send us a head shot for the presenter’s page, send it to programming, or you can send it through facebook. We’d like to get the proposals all in before the end of July, although we may have a few spaces available- especially on Friday afternoon later than that. We’d like to be able to create and post the schedule by the beginning of September.
Speakers FAQ:
We want to create a balanced program between the many incredible subjects available (healing, divination, energy work, spirituality/religion/folklore, etc.), and we hope to both introduce people to ideas they haven’t encountered, as well as provide a venue for intermediate and advanced techniques.
This will be your opportunity to teach what you’ve always wanted to teach. Many of our attendees are well grounded in the basics, so rather than an “introduction to the Tarot”, a workshop on the court cards, or reversals or reading cards near each other is what the more experienced people are looking for. This is your chance to present the information or techniques that you’d like to share. You may offer a series, but make sure you tell us what order they are in.
- Please give us the name you want us to use on the website. We don’t need your legal name. We do need to know how to get in touch with you.
- The initial proposal form only asks for some basic information, the rest comes later once we’ve created the schedule. Most of what follows we won’t ask for until August or September.
- The bio is for the website. Feel free to include your accomplishments, links for your website, blog, your metaphysical shop, your books, let people know how wonderful you are! (Email us a picture- the website likes having one and so do we.)
- Eventually we want two versions of the description of each workshop: One, for the website, the other for the program book. The program book one must be brief (70 words), but for the website we hope you’d describe the experience in as much detail as you’d like, so people will know how great it is. (We also need a short version for the name of the workshop -30 characters-for the chart in the program booklet: 15 characters one above the other- if we need hyphens, we’d prefer you tell us where.) Also tell us what version of your name will fit in 15 characters. We also want a short (60 words) version of your bio for the program book.
- The description of your workshop for the website should include what kind of workshop it is, as well as what it’s about. Is it a class, a demonstration with exercises, a guided meditation, ritual, performance, discussion, or something else. Is it for beginners or more experienced people?
- Include prerequisites if there are any. Since we are having intermediate and advanced classes, you can say what people will need to know to understand your workshop if it’s not an introductory level.
- Let us know when you’ll be arriving and leaving, or other things that will help us schedule.
- Special requirements: limited number of participants, a lot of space for movement? tables or no tables, do you need extra time to set-up? Do you need a white board, or a projector and screen for a power point presentation?
- Spacing: if you are doing more than one class, or a series of related workshops is there an order in which they should be presented? Should they be one each day- or on the same day before and after lunch? Let us know what you’d prefer.
- Important:
- We want to have a full schedule of great workshops on Friday, but some people work Fridays and would love a chance to see them. Let us know if you can give your class before supper on Friday or after lunch on Sunday. We will try to make it worth your while, because we really want the good workshops in those “hard to get there” time slots.
We would love to comp our speakers fully, but cannot yet afford to do that. All we can afford is 25% of registration per class honoraria. (Help us promote this conference and in a few years we’ll have enough attendees to do more.) Meanwhile we will try to show our gratitude by being as good to you as we can.
One thing we try very hard to do is not schedule you against the classes you’d like to attend. We can’t arrange that until the schedule is up, but we will do our very best so that you can enjoy the conference as well. Let us know about any speakers, panels, or workshops you don’t want to be scheduled against.
Because we are running a panel and 3-4 workshops at once, our classes tend to be smaller and more intimate. Someday we may need to use microphones and amplifiers, but not yet.
Since no one has yet taught a workshop on bilocation, (and none of the vendors carry time-turners) we are making audio recording the as many workshops as possible, so people can get at least a recording of the ones they missed. Please let us know whether you are willing to be recorded (by class). We are doing this for the benefit of the attendees, and you retain the rights, and we’ll even give you the master so you can sell any copies yourself it you’d like. If you don’t want to give permission, we respect your choice. If you are willing to let us sell the recordings of your class here, it will help support the con, but either way, the rights to the material are always yours.
If you have any questions or suggestions, email Tchipakkan, Maryalyce, or use the contact form. Please do not hesitate to email us, contact us via facebook. We’ve tried to think of everything on this form, but anything else we’ll have to just handle individually.
We REALLY want you to use the forms here, but if you know a potential speaker who has disentangled himself from the web, you can print this and they can send the same information by or postal mail. If you do this, please include all the information, not just some of it. I’d rather work on the schedule and promoting the conference than chase you down for missing information.

It’s been four years since I started blogging when I lived in a house in Georgetown with James and six of our friends (man, that was fun!).

In honor of my blog’s birthday and the #1 category in the sidebar on the right, I made one of my favorite baked goods. Overripe bananas are ripe (pun intended!) for banana bread, so I turned to my favorite ol’ stand by from Baking Illustrated. This recipe is tested and approved by yours truly as being just awesome.

Awesome recipe,
I love banana bread :)
Here’s anther recipe you might like.
Thanks for sharing,
SophI’ve been avoiding this. I knew when I publicly announced our desire to adopt that this could happen but of course I hoped it wouldn’t. I pride myself in being a very open and honest person but sometimes I need to protect my heart. So, I’ve waited to share this. I think, I hope, you’ll understand why.
Two weeks ago, in the midst of painting every last square inch of every nook and cranny of our new home, I got a call. At first I thought I had accidentally called CCAI. I saw my phone trying to connect to our Chinese adoption agency and thought, “Oops,” then promptly hung-up. Back to painting. Thirty seconds later, CCAI showed-up on my phone screen again.
“Great,” I thought, “They’re checking-in because we haven’t done much for our home study since we bought the house.”
“Hello, this is Jaclyn” I answered hesitantly.
“Hello!” The voice on the other end rang with the most joyous of tones, “Jaclyn, I am calling with CCAI’s waiting child program! Is this a good time?”
My heart took a leap. Could this be it?? THE call?? No way. It’s way too early.
“Um, sure” I said while putting down a dripping roller of paint.
“Well, Jaclyn, I have some very exciting news for you! We think we have found a match for your family!”
Heart is leaping, tears are coming, anxiety is through the roof, confusion spinning, joy abounding.
“Wha..?! Wow! Oh my gosh! Really??” I sit down.
“Yes. His name is (can’t share for security reasons) which means (something lovely like peace and wisdom) and get this… He is EXACTLY two days younger than Luca!”
Ok, now I’m freaking-out. Ok, so it’s a boy. Oh man, he’s only two days younger?? Is that good? Is that crazy? What a wonderful coincidence! Is it??
“Wow!” Is all I can reply.
“Yes, now I know you wanted someone younger than him but you also said you’d be open to someone the same age so I thought we’d see what you think.”
“Yes, yes, ok.” My head is still spinning.
She gives me more information about where he is residing. She says he is in a foster home and seems to be very happy there. Then she gives me the diagnosis. There are multiple.
My heart sinks.
I had totally forgotten for a moment that our precious one would have a medical issue. That’s what we signed-up for.
“Now,” she instructs,”We highly recommend that you share his medical file, which I will send you shortly, with a cardiologist. I will also send you all of his updates, photos, and videos. We have to return his file to China in 7 days so please let me know as soon as you can what you have decided.”
We hang-up. My hands are shaking. I immediately call Caleb and he is super freaked-out. The timing seems all wrong. We’re knee-deep in renovations. We JUST bought a house.
I call CCAI back and ask what a realistic travel date would be, given that we haven’t even finished our home study. It seems that we would have about 8-12 months of waiting before we could go get our little boy. A mixture of disappointment and relief wash over me.
I let Caleb know and we think, ok, maybe we can do this! I was still nervous about the “twinning” thing but you better believe I was googling and reaching-out to other parents like mad! That night, I asked Caleb right before bed, “Do you think he is our son?” “Probably, ” he responded happily. I smiled and fell asleep with dreams of bunk-beds, twin Halloween costumes, and matching lunch pails in my head.
While we were contemplating and dreaming, a cardiologist- a friend of a friend- was looking over our little guy’s file. He called us two days after we received the referral but it felt like weeks had passed.
He started by asking us what our expectations were. We responded that we willingly signed-up for the special needs program and we expected that our lives would be changed somewhat by this decision. I jokingly said that I was perfectly fine with having a son who couldn’t play football. The doctor was kind. He informed us that this situation was beyond a life style change, this situation was dire.
I can’t quite remember all of the terms he used, but I can tell you that as he spoke, a dark cloud surrounded me. I became increasingly aware that we weren’t looking at an adoption, we were looking at being hospice. We both felt completely blind-sighted.
It turns out, adoption agencies aren’t always aware of the level of medical severity that a child may be facing. In addition, when we said we’d be willing to take on a child with a “major heart condition” we didn’t realize that we could be looking at a fatal condition. This was so unexpected, so agonizing.
That is the perfect word, we sat in agony for days. We wrestled with our conscience and our expectations. We cried out to God and lamented. Was this our calling? Was this for us?
We received more opinions and they were still dire. It seemed there was a chance that this little guy wouldn’t even make it by the time we could get him. Even if he did, I struggled with the thought of taking him from his foster family, whom he seems so happy with, to bring him here with only a short time to live. It seemed cruel in so many ways.
Ultimately, with broken-hearts, we told CCAI that we would not accept the referral. They were incredibly gracious and understanding. They thanked us for all of the hard work that we had put into the process of making this decision. Their kindness didn’t make either of us feel any better about the situation.
* * *
Now, weeks later, it still hurts. God has given me a peace that we made the right decision for that little boy and for our family but I’m still sad. It’s funny how we think that sadness must mean something is wrong. Well, something is wrong, there’s a little boy in China who is going to die from a congenital heart condition and there’s nothing anyone can do. That’s what I’m sad about.
I’m also sad about the loss of a dream. I had gotten so excited, admittedly nervous too, about having “twins.” I had fallen in love with his little photo and watched his videos multiple times a day. I was preparing to be his Mama. My heart broke when I realized this would never happen.
We’re contemplating where to go from here. This experience has made an international special needs adoption much more real to us. We don’t feel specifically called to international adoption, I just felt passionately about what was happening in China. We do however, feel called to adoption. Specifically, as Caleb puts it, we feel called to help “the least of these.” (Matt 25:40) We want to help a child in need and we want to grow our family. It would be nice if this was relatively soon so that we could still have another biological child later if we wanted to. China’s non-special needs program has a 7 year wait time currently. Obviously, that won’t work.
So, we’ve been exploring other options. Like: FosAdopt. Unfortunately, we’ve learned that we’d have to be willing to adopt out of birth order for us to adopt a child who has already been through reunification efforts with their birth parents. In other words, if we want to adopt from foster care without being foster parents first (which we do because the reunification efforts can be extremely long and stressful) then we would get a child older than Luca. We feel very strongly about maintaining the birth order in our family so that option is out.
At this point, I’m feeling frustrated and somewhat hopeless. The dark cloud that emerged a couple of weeks ago while talking with the cardiologist is still lingering. It’s not as dark but it’s still there. I know cognitively that when God calls us to something, He will see it through in HIS time. I just need my heart to trust that. I am praying for patience and peace on a daily basis. He certainly has been providing. I have been enjoying Luca now more than ever. I am so thankful for our son.
Thank you all for your support. Unkind comments will be deleted, my heart can’t take that right now. Prayers much appreciated as always.
In Him,
Jaclyn

Hey I’m feeling a little bit in the same boat as you. Bit frustrated and my heart is in a little bit of pain. My husband and I are doing the fostering process scenario which has taken a long time. But I think about it now and look back at my feelings. God really knows the right time and the right person . And I know that’s frustrating in its self but he is our father and wants us to be equipped at right times. My prayers going your way. Relax and focus on your new home and wait .
Thank you Jess. I think you’re right. It really feels like God is saying “yes” to adoption but “no” to right now. It’s wise for us to get settled before venturing further.
Jaclyn,
Your open heart and honest words are beautiful. What a test of faith you are in right now. You have such a lovely family that adores The Lord above all else and I truly believe He will bless you abundantly for praising His name with your lips and your life. Keep faithful and remain strong. You have my prayers.
Kat
Kat, Thank so so very much for your kind words and encouragement. It is so appreciated. At times I question whether we are honoring God. We do love Him but of course, we also love our selves. It’s a constant battle. I hope that this will all be used for further sanctification.
We are so sorry that things did not work out. However, being the child was happy where he was and under the circumstances we think you made the right decision.-
Love, Noni/Gp ——————————————
Thank you so much for your love and support!! I love you both.The following is a guest column from blingboy.
John Mozeliak plays close to the vest during the off season, which can be frustrating for the rest of us. A cryptic mention of low hanging fruit or dry powder is all we can hope for. That is why a couple of articles concerning Seattle Mariners general manager Jack Zduriencik and his frustration trying to get value for his top prospects this winter caught my attention.
Over the last few years, the Mariners, like the St. Louis Cardinals, have turned their farm system into one of the best, featuring some highly-rated prospects. Mr. Zduriencik was hoping to use prospects as currency in trade this winter. While that has been an effective strategy in the past, it isn’t working out that way this year.
The market for prospects is not what it was.
Reasons given for the devaluation of prospects include the second wild card and all the TV money sloshing around, but Mr. Hendrix of prospectinsider thinks the market will rebound in a few years.
“I’d expect the value of prospects to go up once the TV money begins to run dry, which could be within the next 2-4 years. Add in the fact that many teams will indeed get burned mortgaging their future for immediate success, and the value of prospects will again soar.”
I don’t know about that, but for now at least, Mo and the Cards are looking at a down market. If it is bad for Seattle, it might be worse for the Cards. I say that because the mlb.com 2012 Prospect Watch ranking, which includes results of the 2012 season, has the Mariners with two prospects rated higher than anything the Cards have to offer. RHP Taijuan Walker and LHP Danny Hutzen are ranked 4th and 8th, while Oscar Taveras and Shelby Miller are 12th and 19th.
Mr. Hendrix argues that recently-traded OF Wil Myers, 3rd, and C Travis d’Arnaud, 11th, did not fetch what similar top prospects would have in past years, and Mr. Zduriencik has been disappointed with the value of his top prospect Walker so far this winter.
As bleak as all that may be, the Cards are not the Mariners, and the differences may present an opportunity. Mr. Zduriencik, who is thankfully more talkative than Mo, says that the devaluation mostly affects prospects unproven at the major league level. Walker and Hutzen fall into that category, as do Myers and d’Arnaud.
Since trying to trade away a top prospect without major league experience is being on the wrong side of this year’s market, then trading for one is the right side. The right side of the market is where opportunity always lies and Mo is positioned to pounce.
Unlike the Mariners, the Cards have enough top young talent with MLB experience to be sellers if they choose. Although one can never have too much pitching, there are Miller, Lance Lynn, Trevor Rosenthal and Joe Kelly, all young and proven, and with others behind them who will be ready for a try in St. Louis soon. The rich pitching environment also features young(ish) veterans in the pen, and seasoned veterans in the rotation. There are also Matt Adams or Allen Craig (theoretically), and perhaps others.
We have seen for ourselves how expensive the free agent market is, in both dollars and years, and the opportunity is there for Mozeliak to use the present market for prospects to his advantage. It would involve risk of course, but being on the right side of the market helps minimize it. It seems like a golden opportunity to try to set the team up with a shortstop of the future or plug other holes. Hopefully he is ready to pounce while the time is right.
Walt gave away prospect Dan Haren for Mark Mulder while Mo was fleeced of Luke Gregerson for Khalil Greene and Chris Perez for soon to be injured Chris DeRosa. Three terrible deals. More happily, Mo unloaded veteran Jim Edmonds for prospect David Freese.
Zdurnieik helped the rise of the Brewers when they drafted Prince Fielder and Ryan Braun, so his promotion to GM was dependent on developing prospects. Once GM, signing veteran Chone Figgins to a big money deal backfired. Mariner prospect Adam Jones was traded to the Orioles and has helped Baltimore reach the playoffs.
Mo know how to trade with Zdurnieck. We unloaded vet Brendan Ryan and picked up prospect Cleto. Would the Mariners surrender Walker for Wigginton?
Previous Mariners GM Bavasi traded prospects Adam Jones and pitcher Chris Tillman to Baltimore, helping the decline of the Mariners and the rise of the Orioles. Not Zdurnieck’s fault.
During Jack Z’s first year, some members of the saber community prematurely anointed him as a genius. The reality is that Seattle was a mess and it would take time for anyone to recover. Jack Z has traded a lot of pitching for hitting, but the latter has yet to produce.
Z won a trade with the Yankees, picking up Jesus Montero for a pitcher Pineda, soon injured. Montero did ok for a rookie in that ballpark and will improve.
Chone Figgins was terrible, but maybe there are behind the scene factors. The previous Angel hero to go for Seattle bucks was Spiezio and he was a dismal failure for reasons that later emerged.
Declaring a winner in a trade after one season in which one of the two players was injured?
I keep thinking about how the Rangers are short a corner outfielder with pop, and about how they’ve got the prime SS prospect in baseball sitting there behind Andrus on their depth chart. A guy with no MLB experience. And about all that pitching, MLB proven pitching, that Mo is sitting on. And about Mo’s proven ability to structure a multi-team transaction to use what we’ve got to get what we need. It seems like the market this winter is absolutly perfect for Mo to do exactly that sort of thing.
Who in major league baseball doesn’t have “opinions” about what is going on in St. Louis? Matt Carpenter?…. Loved the way this guy swung a bat…… Then the power move came in…… and the “special emphasis” on the Cardinal’s “special swing prerogatives”. ……………. watch what Skip brings to the table in LA…if he even gets to the table………. Perez had an attitude….. still does ….. Geregerson was on a list in the Greene deal … SD didn’t miss it …. any St. Louis position players tearing it up with other teams?……………. Furcal has been hurt for years……..most everyplace but his arm…..now that’s questionable……… He was running like an old man by June last year…… he doing some intense off season work for this year?………….right!!!!! ………. Mo keeps standing Pat……. he is suggesting that what he is bring to ST in prospects is superior to what other teams have developed……….. Wigginton? plays many positions ……… He has a good cut………. does he end up playing often because of that?… poor defensive skills in exchange for a bat……. that going to make the starters last 6?………… face it…….. any moves Mo makes reflects on the quality of his prospects…. so he just doesn’t make them………… If the Brewers get Lohse, its not going to go well here….. IF Carp survives ST…….. he going to break his back trying to stay in games? Elevated pitch counts? Garcia can’t possibly make the regular season………. If the kids bog down….. BD going to trade and spend for pitching………. or finally get to that fabulous rebuild phase in his next 5yr plan……
DeWitt’s group has owned the team for almost two decades and we have yet to see that supposed rebuild phase you mention.
If Lohse ends up in Milwaukee, I will wish him well – but I can’t see it changing the Brewers status in the division behind Cincy and StL.
Stadium tax shelter in place…… Laundromat running at full capacities……. Bill retires from the “active” aspects of his interests, with the retirement of GB ……. to focus on a hobby…….. The first phase is done….. removal of AP/TLR….. second phase is on track ……….. Cardinals do not make the playoffs in 2013 …… your argument that they will be second is naive ………. For those that can’t objectively examine your first two weeks of last year…….enjoy this first two weeks ………. My complements.
If only those gamblers weren’t so naive, but I bet you clean up on them.
Odds to win 2013 World Series from Bovada:
Reds: 12/1
Cards: 25/1
Brewers: 35/1
Pirates: 50/1
Cubs: 100/1
Blue Jays are favorites at 7.5-1. Whoever heard of the Yankees avoiding the luxury tax.
“BD going to trade and spend for pitching………. or finally get to that fabulous rebuild phase in his next 5yr plan……”
Typical Westie, covering both sides so he can later claim he was right.
yep, Carpenter’s performance in the playoffs really showed how they messed up his swing.
Nice, thought-provoking article, bb. I hadn’t really considered those facets of the trade market, but when you bring them up, they seem reasonable. Thanks for sharing it!
Wainwright might leave in 2014. With the miles on his arm, Carpenter could break down in 2013 and retire in 2014. Garcia’s shoulder seems iffy. Mo may want to keep Lynn, Miller, Kelly, and Rosenthal around for 2013. We are not going to outhit the Reds, but we might be able to overtake them with better pitching.
Jake gives Mo some flexibility. Kind of expensive flexibility, but not much uncertainty about what you’re getting. Sort of like dry powder in a way, giving Mo the ability to pull the trigger on a move if opportunity presents.
The Cardinals outhit the Reds by nearly 100 runs last year. I wouldn’t be so pessimistic about their respective offenses…
Votto missed much of last year and is an MVP caliber hitter. The Reds dumped Stubbs and landed Choo, a big offensive upgrade. Frazier could improve, Mesoraco produce at catcher. The Reds could have immense firepower in 2013, while the Cards best hitter is gimpy kneed Beltran. Maybe Pete Kozma can be the equalizer.
Votto missed around 40 games for the Reds.Otherwise the Reds where very lucky and didn`t have any other injury problems.Will they be able to pull out 15 last At-Bat wins again this season or go almost injury free? I doubt it.Some bad Karma will get them.How often does a team get that lucky regarding everything 2 years in a row.
Frazier should improve. Choo is solid, though coming off of couple of down years. Ludwick probably lost one of his glass slippers when the clock turned midnight.
The Cardinals’ best hitter is perfectly healthy Matt Holliday. He, Beltran, Molina, Freese, and Carpenter all had OPSs well north of .800. Jay came in at .773. Craig, Carpenter, Matt Adams, and Oscar Taveras should all be improving at this point in their careers. I’m not worried one bit.
Mesoraco is the Reds top prospect. He is a good hitting catcher out of Punxatawney, PA. When he slides into the ML lineup, he will give them added pop.
How will Mesaroco hit away from the bandbox? So far in 2 limited stints in the bigs DM has not hit squat.
I for one would like to see the Cards make a play to use their aforementioned strength to set up the potential for a difference maker at one of their weak spots on the farm. Certainly shortstop is a glaring weakness, but there are other areas where Mo could take advantage as well, given the dearth most organization face at shortstop. Among the shortstops, it would seem the Cards best chance would be to go after a guy in the lower levels, such as Alen Hanson from Pittsburgh. Certainly that type of move represents the greatest risk, but would likely come at a lower cost than someone in AA/AAA. Another spot I think the Cards might do well to consider would be CF. While not entirely lacking in prospects with potential in CF, most of them are at the lower levels. Perhaps a guy like Brian Goodwin (Nationals), Aaron Hicks (Twins), or Adam Eaton (D’Backs) MIGHT be netted. While those guys would all come at a high price, their distance to the majors is minimal, and with the possible exception of Goodwin, they would provide the Cards with a much needed speed/potential lead off threat. The bonus is that upon reaching the majors, they would allow the Cards to either use Jon Jay as a superb 4th OF option, or see what his value might be on the trade market. I have long wondered why you don’t see more prospect for prospect deals, allowing teams with a surplus in one area to address other needs with an organization having the opposite issues.
I agree with your line of thinking in general jabbott, but I like our CF situation. It could be improved, of course, but I don’t think I’d want to give up something good to address something that isn’t really a problem. I’d also like to see Jay get the chance to continue in the leadoff spot that he took on late last season.
I too wonder why there are not more prospect for prospect trades. Nobody wants to risk giving up a future HOFer I guess.
The average MLB CF OPS last season was .748. Cards were .750. Where StL had the advantage was in OBP – 27 points better than average with the disadvantage in SLG.
Also, let’s not forget Jay’s lack of errors in CF.
Yes, I suspect the organizations are holding out hope their disappointing guys to date will become the late bloomers.
Maybe Mo should work something out with Scotty for Kyle Lohse. I say that because, so far, only two teams have been willing to forfeit their first round pick and the pool money that goes with it. The Angels signed Hamilton for 5 years, and the Braves signed Upton for 5 years. The Indians, having a protected pick, gave up their second round pick along with a lesser amount of pool money to sign Swisher for 4 years.
Maybe an everyday bat for 4 or 5 years can make it worth it. Good news for Bourn and La Roche maybe. Lohse and Soriano may not be hearing much good news. How many years would you need to get out of a pitcher to be worth the pick and the pool money? Kyle is 34, can he get that many years?
Several teams would only lose a second round pick and pool money, the Indians a third round. The Cardinals wouldn’t lose anything. Maybe we should sign him. Scotty and Kyle would have to agree that we could trade him if we want, to a team that would like to have him but not if it costs the pick and the pool money. That might be how Scotty can get Kyle the best deal given the rules and the climate this year. Mo should be able to peel off a useful piece for our cut.
I think the sign & trade will likely become a somewhat common occurrence in MLB now. Less for the picks, & more for the loss of that slot money. While the strategy of drafting has been made more interesting, the potential loss of draft picks for exceeding total slot money will hurt a lot of teams that allocate money more towards draft/development. That is something I (for one) strongly dislike. While I enjoy keeping up with the intrigue of FA movement every offseason, I don’t think clubs should be punished for choosing to allocate money more towards drafting/developing their own. I’m fine with the luxury tax element of exceeding total slot, just not the loss of future draft picks.
The problem with that logic for me is just as much as a team will not want to lose the draft pick and the slot money, won’t the team losing the player (such as the Cardinals) want to gain that extra draft pick and the slot money?
The lost pick just vanishes now, so I’m not following you CC. Could you re-phrase.
But we would get a pick if someone else signs him. We lose that pick if we do a sign and trade. If a pick is so valuable nobody wants to sign him, isn’t a pick also valuable to us?
My understanding is we do not get a pick if someone else signs Lohse. The team that does sign him (other than the Cards) loses a pick, but it just vanishes, we do not get it. They also lose the pool money.
So my thought is that we could sign him and then trade him to the team that wants him but doesn’t want to lose the pick and the pool money.
Absolutely, the Cards DO receive a pick when Lohse signs elsewhere. They made him a qualifying offer, which he declined.
Well, I get confused. Let’s see who wants to give up a high pick and pool money for the privilege of paying a 34 year old pitcher for several years. It will be interesting to see what happens with both Lohse and Soriano.My name is Tracie and I am the blogger behind Phenomenal Mama.

Awhile back I went to a wine tasting where they also had a cheese table. One of their samples was a cheddar with apple and pickled green tomatoes. Odd, but I really enjoyed it and inquired more. Turns out the pairing was based on a sandwich from City Feed, which I had to recreate myself :)
When I found pickled green at Marshall's Fenway Farmstand, I knew it was time! I tried one of tomatoes right from the jar, and boy were they tart :) The sandwich has such a unique combination of flavors, with the sweetness from the cheddar/apple and bite from both the pickled green tomatoes and dijon mustard. Different, but delicious, and if you'd like to kick it up a notch I implore you to give it a try!
Cheddar, Apple & Pickled Green Tomato Sandwich
Yield: 2 sandwiches
a grainy baguette, or 4 slices of a whole wheat bread
dijon/mayo blend (2T of a grainy dijon with 1T olive oil mayo)
red leaf lettuce
pickled green tomatoes
1 granny smith, peeled and sliced (I only peeled it for ease of eating)
2-3oz cheddar (I used Dubliner)
To assemble, spread half of the dijon/mayo blend on one half of the sandwich. Shred or slice on the other slice of bread. On top of the cheese, add apple slices then pickled green tomatoes. Top with lettuce, then the other slice of bread (the one with dijon). Toast the sandwich (either in the toaster oven or on the stove) to get the cheese warmed/melty, then dig in!

that sounds delicious! I've never had a sandwich with apple + cheddar, but I think I need to change that :)
I love apple, cheddar, and turkey... I have GOT to try the pickled tomatoes! :)
Yum. I don't know that I've ever had a pickled green tomato before, but this sounds like a really unique combo!
What an awesome sandwich and a unique combination of ingredients! I'd like to try those pickled green tomatoes!
For some reason, I've never been a huge fan of pickled things - but I'm sure pickled tomatoes covered in melted cheese could change my mind. ;) This looks incredible!
What a unique sandwich - definitely sounds like something you'd get at a restaurant! I'm very intrigued by the pickled green tomatoes.
That definitely sounds really interesting! I've never heard of pickled tomatoes. I recently discovered that I absolutely love pickled red onions.
What an interesting sandwich....although I like apples, like tomatoes and like cheese - so there really is no reason for me not to like that flavour combo!!!
Oh my gosh...this has my name all over it!!!
hey girl you're doing some rearranging on your website...looks good. and yes, thank goodness it's may, the winter was long and cold.
i'm so glad you're back to eating creative-kicked up sammies. love it, you know i love it.
Now I know what to do with green tomatoes next time I see them at the farmer's market. What an interesting sandwich!
I'm so excited for your trip to Italy.
I actually love making grilled cheese with sliced apple - love the savory/sweet combo - yours looks delicious!
I like sandwiches and I like sweet and sassy!
That sounds like a pretty funky combo. Are you sure it was good? ;) J/K. I need to try it!
I grew up eating pickled tomatoes - red and green ones. I love pickled veggies!!!
I don't know how it got to be May either! That sandiwch sounds divine :)
Yummm! Cheese and apples is one of my favorite combinations and this sandwich just sounds lovely. See you tonight :)

That sandwich looks amazing! I've never had pickled green tomateos before- very unique! You should submit the recipe to Recipe4Living.com!
The sandwich sounds really good - I like the 'extreme' flavors. Never had a pickled tomato! I'll be on the lookout for them now.
Cheddar and apples go soooo well together, like pear and brie...a match made in heaven :)Education Tools and Resources

This week I had the pleasure of driving the 2011 Nissan Pathfinder LE. Our friends at Nissan Canada provided us with a gorgeous, fully loaded red Pathfinder. To be honest, I have never been a fan of SUV’s. However, after driving the Nissan Pathfinder, I will definitely consider an SUV for my next vehicle.
Performance:
Nissan uses it’s standard V6 engine in the Pathfinder. The vehicle has a 4.0L engine, pushing 266 horsepower at 5600 RPM. The Pathfinder has a decent amount of torque, pulling at 288 lb/feet of torque at 4000 RPM. It sounds like it has plenty of power, however, despite the 266 horsepower, I feel the Pathfinder is slightly underpowered for it’s size and would benefit from a V8 engine and a little more horsepower and torque under the hood. For a vehicle of that size and weight, I feel as though 300+ horse power would be much more suitable than the current 266-horsepower.
Interior:
The Pathfinder’s interior is absolutely gorgeous. The seats are firm and comfortable, and the ones in my tester were 8 way adjustable. I am a big guy, and I found the seats extremely supportive yet always comfortable. Nissan has always used quality leather in their vehicles and the latest version of the Pathfinder is no different. The LE model we tested came loaded with a variety of features. The refined interior offers a range of amenities, including available leather appointed seating, heated steering wheel, Nissan Intelligent Key with twist start, Nissan navigation system with a 9.3 GigaByte music box hard drive, Bluetooth hands free phone system, Sirius/XM Satellite Radio, and a Rear View monitor. For me, when it comes to choosing a vehicle, the sound system is just as important as anything. The Pathfinder, much like the rest of the Nissan family, boasts a 10 speaker premium Bose audio system. The audio is crisp and clear, with a good amount of bass. No need to purchase an aftermarket system for this car!
While the rear view monitor is a great feature, it is still advised that you look before reversing. The rear-view camera isn’t the best in terms of clarity. I found it a bit blurry late at night. However, it’s a great feature nonetheless, especially considering how big the back end of the Pathfinder is!
The LE model also comes with the optional DVD player, 7.0-inch colour monitor for taking the kids on road trips, and if you don’t want to hear whatever they are watching, Nissan has even thrown in rear seat wireless headphones so you can have peace and quiet as you drive. Our tester had a power moonroof, dual-zone climate control, rear air conditioning, power adjustable pedals and wood-grain trim. Personally, I don’t feel as though the wood grain trim suits the vehicle. I would prefer a more youthful carbon fibre trim, but my parents definitely appreciated the wood grain. At the end of the day its entirely a personal preference, however the options are always there! The navigation system is fantastic and easy to use. The screen is a good size and easily visible to the driver.
Exterior:
Throughout its history, Pathfinder has maintained an iconic exterior design. The vehicle has a rugged, go anywhere look. The large headlamps are unique and distinctive, although adding HID headlamps would have been a nice touch and given the vehicle a more sophisticated look and feel. Other available features include side running boards to help the shorter passengers in and out, and heated outside mirrors. The LE model also comes equipped with some pretty 18 inch rims on BF Goodrich tires.
Final Thoughts:
The biggest knock on this year’s Pathfinder would have to be the fuel economy. Nissan rates the vehicle at 14.9L / 100km city and 10.3L / 100km on the highway. To say the Pathfinder has a rabid thirst for fuel would be an understatement. With the growing trend in the auto industry heading toward electric vehicles and saving money on fuel, Nissan could benefit from making a hybrid Pathfinder. However, other than the fuel economy, the Pathfinder is great for large families or for people that simply enjoy the comfort and luxury of a large SUV!

I love the beautiful colours of this fabric and how light the fabric is which is perfect for an Australian summer. The pattern is also perfect for summer, especially with the low back – the dress even has pockets! More photos on my blog!
I can’t wait to wear this cute dress now that the weather is warm and I would love to make a few more variations of it with different fabric as it is such a fun and flattering cut!

Great fabric!
gorgeous dress! i have a dress made in the same fabric – i think we got it from spotlight for full price. The backless style is very chic!
What a great dress! Don’t you just love running across fabric in the thrift shop? I just found a giant piece (like, four yards) of yellow striped taffeta for four bucks. But I digress…
I wonder how this dress would look in a knit fabric? Like, a 1970’s graphic print knit?
Oh my, how beautiful! I have a similar pattern and really want to sew it up asap, after this stunning make of yours!
So beautiful!
Love that print! This dress is lovely. Looks like you did a beautiful job!

They were plumpish and had wrinkles, glasses, white tinted-blue hair, and soft bosoms, yet the angry blue goose represents them well, for they were strong women in their own ways and worked diligently to protect their families. One was smiling and gentle and the other was formidable--and I loved them both. Everyone should have one of each in my opinion, because we need those examples. Neither grandmother jogged, swam laps or worked out, they just gardened. And their lovely gardens linger in my memory. The gentle one went to teachers’ school and loved to read. The formidable one obtained a degree in music, then became a high school music teacher in a northern town until she hooked the most eligible bachelor around, the doctor.
My formidable grandmother is the first person on the right in the third row. Certainly, the majority of readers cannot possibly be interested by old family photos, however the 1915 University of Minnesota graduating class in music is an interesting group. In fact, it's a noteworthy group because women students outnumber the men at a time when few had the opportunity of attending universities at all. The problem with history remains that women are generally forgotten and a major problem for women is that they do not have a history. As a researcher in cultural and women's history, I delight in bringing forward the forgotten achievements of women--our grandmothers--to demonstrate that women must not be described as victims, but as participants in our mutual history. If I had the know-how, I would insert a "one-hundred-gun-salute" here.
Back to "Grandma's Blues". My formidable grandmother did sophisticated embroidery and apparently had some notions of how to quilt because her daughter made a crib quilt for the new baby sister (my mother).
I particularly like the cat with his strange tail and perplexed expression.
My formidable grandmother also possessed a quilt of fine fabrics made by her mother, however, this is the extent of my grandmother's quilting history, as far as I know. Apparently, she wasn't a quilter.
This log cabin shimmers because of the fancy fabrics, however, they are disintegrating. It was draped on my grandmother's baby grand piano.
On the other hand, my gentle grandmother was a quilter who sewed only by hand. My mother kept several quilts carefully to pass on. Here is one of "Grandma's Blues," a nine-patch probably made in the 1930s or 1940s:
A lovely purple quilt with a basket design:
This bear paw quilt was made in the 1930s for my grandmother's youngest sister who taught primary school.
Age has not faded the bright yellow.
It contains some cute fabrics of the period.
I also inherited several worn out quilts that nobody wanted (fortunately for me), which I am slowly mending and restoring. Here is a second "Grandma's Blues."
It contains some cute fabrics of the period.
This much-used quilt still has my name tag on it, so I apparently took it to summer camp when I was eight years old. Of course the most wear has occurred at the top where there is the most pull. I have begun repairing it (upper left) by inserting a similar used fabric and then doing needle-turn appliqué to sew the frayed fabric onto the inserted fabric; I call it "sewing the holes." Truth to tell, my mother asked my grandmother if certain quilts were for everyday use or should be preserved and my grandmother told her to use them. On the other hand, one specific quilt was to be carefully preserved and passed on as it contains blocks from my great-great-grandmother.Translate this page into your language:Translate this page into your language:

In Dublin, Bank of Ireland has opened a branch in the heart of the university’s city campus. Aimed at students and university employees, this bank is more like a student society than a classic bank.
“The aim is to win over young people and earn their trust as soon as they enter the world of banking,” admits Elisabeth Sabbah, director of customer markets at La Banque Postale (Source: L’Etudiant).
Bank of Ireland has decided to get closer to its young customers by opening the Henry Grattan building in the centre of Dublin City University, DCU. The bank is innovative and digital. Split into five sections dedicated to different activities (information, deposits, withdrawals, appointments), the bank offers all the traditional services you would expect and even allows students to book a room to organise a meeting or work in a group. Four ATMs are spread around the building, both inside and out, and in two other buildings. Richie Boucher, a member of the bank says: “if we don’t provide for the unexpected, we guarantee to disappoint”. A team of four advise students in this digital environment where everything is available thanks to touch screens. The branch, more than just a bank, sees itself as a venue for exchanging ideas and communication.
Online financial magazine FinancialBrand believes this student branch of the bank is particularly innovative and avant-garde. The students are a crucial target because they are the customers of the future. The asset of a branch on campus is a great way of being more visible to this customer base. The concept store is available to 15,000 students and members of university staff as well as the 250,000 annual campus visitors.

And the Moral of the Story? Fighting = good.
We’ve been told our whole lives that fighting doesn’t solve anything.
It would appear we’ve been lied to.
A few days ago, the Marlins looked about as likely to reach the post season as I am to win the lottery this week. And then, well, a few of the Fish engaged in a clubhouse screaming match, and things have suddenly taken a turn for the better (well, things not including HLD&S’s skills with photoshop. Those have decidedly taken a turn for the very worst).
After Wednesday’s roller coaster of a win, Ricky Nolasco took the ball for the Marlins Thursday night in the series finale with the Braves. Ricky was looking to help the Marlins split the four-game series, and despite some struggles in the fifth inning, he had a pretty nice night on the mound.
The Braves scored a run in the second inning on a Brian McCann homer before Ricky got into some trouble in the top of the fifth when he loaded up the bases with one out. The inning could easily have gotten out of hand, but Nolasco limited the damage to two RBI singles that put the Braves up 3-1. Nolasco gave up three runs on seven hits and struck out seven before he exited after six innings, down two runs to Atlanta.
It’s pretty fortunate for the Fish that it took Braves starter Tommy Hanson 104 pitches to get through five innings, because an implosion of the Braves bullpen was in order, and his annoyingly quality start was getting in the way. In five innings of work, Hanson allowed just one run on two hits, one of which was an RBI double from Maybin that tied the game in the third.
With Kris Medlen out of the bullpen in the sixth, Brett Carroll got the fun started when he doubled to score John Baker and bring the Marlins within a run. Next, Hanley Ramirez slapped a pinch-hit single to score Brett and tie up the game. Cody Ross and Chris Coghlan both doubled in a run, and after a call to the bullpen, Nick Johnson and Jorge Cantu hit RBI singles to give the Marlins a 7-3 lead.
The Marlins would score once more in the game, while Florida’s bullpen put in a scoreless three innings to finish off the Braves. Sanches and Pinto each tossed an inning, Lindstrom closed it out, and the Marlins split the series.
The Fish are tied with Atlanta for fourth place in the Wild Card, and if we can keep the fire going that the clubhouse scuffle seems to have ignited, things might actually be interesting to watch over the next few series.
Um, Hanley? Did you hear what Uggla said about your mom?
Advertisements.?Recently I had the pleasure of attending the listening party for Chuck Brown’s new album entitled “Beautiful Life” at the opulent Baby Wale on 9th Street in NW Washington, DC. As you may know the legendary Chuck Brown passed away in May of 2012 after blessing the musical industry with over 40 years of soulful melodies. Known as the God Father of GoGo, Chuck birthed the funky rhythm and started a musical genre that has been spread by four generations of faithful fans. Throughout its ups and downs GoGo is still alive and constantly evolving.
Thanks to Automotive Rhythms I was able to showcase the 2015 Kia K900 at this spectacular event. As the Korean sedan was staged in front of the venue, the sounds of Chuck Brown’s classics were played from the vehicle. With the windows down and the sunroof open, the 900-watt, 17-speaker, 12 channel Lexicon Logic 7 surround audio system had patrons grooving before they entered into Baby Wale. The weather was beautiful so many attendees decided to sit outside and take a better look at Kia’s introduction to the luxury sedan market. The popular phrase from the night seemed to be “That’s a Kia, WOW!”
The exclusive listening session was filled with local tastemakers, musicians, Chuck Brown’s family and music lovers. Melodious sounds of the album blared throughout the venue as everyone partied with memories of the legend in mind. The crowd was in awe to hear new tracks from Chuck Brown since his energy was sustained in Beautiful Life.
The stellar evening was hosted by BET Centric and emceed by Jeannie Jones while food was provided by Baby Wale and Kind Healthy Snacks. Signature drinks entitled “GodFather” and “Beautiful Life” were sponsored by Sauza 901 Tequila and Bottega Champagne. Fun was had by all as I cannot wait for the rest of the world to experience this album when it releases August 19th, 2014!

The FC are seeking our views on Friston, so here’s your chance to tell them what you think…
The Forestry Commission is seeking the views of regular users and local communities on improvements for its mountain bike trails across Friston Forest in East Sussex.
As one of the most popular destinations for mountain biking on the south coast, the Forestry Commission wants to understand how its trails and access can be improved.
While Friston Forest already offers more than seven miles of cycle paths and trails for mixed-use mountain biking, a number of unofficial trails exist across the forest. These can have an impact on other forest users, so the Forestry Commission wants to know what can be done to improve the experience of mountain bikers on Forestry Commission managed trails and minimise the impact of unofficial trails on other visitors.
Running until 18 October 2013, a new discussion web forum will allow users to have their say on mountain biking in the forest. In particular, the Forestry Commission is keen to hear how regular users – cyclists and walkers alike – feel about safety, access, the number and type of trails, and whether they have any other comments.
Ian Bromley, Weald Beat Forester for the Forestry Commission, said: “Friston Forest is superb for mountain bikers and continues to be popular for tourists and the local community alike. In recent years there’s been an increase in the number of unofficial trails, so we’re keen to understand whether there’s anything more we could be doing to improve the Forestry Commission trails already in place to reduce the impact of cycling on other trails and on other users and the forest in general.
“The web forum is designed to encourage discussion over what we could do to improve user experience. We’re delighted to have such an enthusiastic group of regular mountain bikers, walkers and other users, so it’s important we’re listening to what people want. This is about what else we could be doing to make sure people continue to visit Friston Forest.
“Whether you’re a mountain biker or not, we’d encourage you to take part. We don’t have any firm plans at this stage, so your views really will count.”
The Forestry Commission’s online forum can be found at and gives users the opportunity to contribute to discussions, share ideas and rate and comment on the ideas of others.
If you would prefer to comment by post, please write to: Mr I Bromley, Weald Beat Forester, Forestry Commission, Bedgebury Office, Park Lane, Cranbrook, Kent, TN17 2SL
Please note that submissions made by post will not be added to the online discussion and will therefore not be able to receive support from other forest users.
This initial discussion will continue until the 18th October 2013 and once the Forestry Commission has considered comments aims to publish findings and proposals by 31st October 2013 on

Although this story is already finished, and God knows how long it's been done-I still just wanted to say...it's awesome.
I've never been able to read a story that's only sensual without getting annoyed until now. Absolutely amazing and greatly written. I'm jealous :]

Really glad you liked!
*sighs happily* I truly adore how you continue to make a story we all love so much yours without losing the....essence of it.
You're truly amazing.
My favorite so far... It's very rare when a writer can make something completely erotic without there even being some kind of physical contact.
AMAZING! :D

The through the (blasted!) unforgiving deck rails. In an instant, she regrets the enthusiasm with which she enjoyed last night’s second helping of chicken pot pie, delivering in response to her successful (if pitiful) whining. She wonders whether she might have managed the evening just as well with less, and whether that might have made all the difference right now.
Scene 3: She is so close to the object of her affection, yet so far. Whether she sings like a Siren to entice the tomato to her, or whether she cries in agony for the tragedy of it all ... is hard to say. Whatever the case, the tomato remains current spot on the deck. If you were there, you’d want to urge her to walk around the railing, hop into the garden from its short end, and seize the green orb as her own. You might wave your arms about like an air traffic controller on the runway, signaling a clear path. To resolution ... to victory! But even if you did, she wouldn’t respond.
Otherwise, this wouldn’t be much of a story at all. It wouldn’t tell a tale that’s fuller than an unripe tomato: A tale about want. And desire. And how -- in the end -- the shortest path isn’t always the most successful route to what your heart seeks most.

Another chapter in my recyling adventure. My son called and said that they were going to trash some blueprint file cabinets and asked if I was interested in them. I was there an hour later to pick them up. A few wooden drawer dividers and I have a great storage area for my tools. I was recently given a set of japanese pull saws and they found a home in this file cabinet.

YES! Over the years I’ve always scrounged metal fixtures and cabinets from offices, labs, machine shops and hospitals and re-purposed them in my woodworking shop. By keeping your eyes open for unconventional souces for furnishing your shop you can save lots of cash. Often this stuff is on commercial-grade castors, too!

ratchet, my handwriting is bad enough without trying to fit everything on a small sized card. If i did that even I wouldn’t be able to readI haven't done a review in a while, so there's no better time than the present. Actually, looking back through my blog posts, Ive never reviewed an actual restaurant, so this will be a first.
Several few weeks ago, my friend Anjelika introduced me to Balthazar Restaurant, which is a French restaurant in NYC's Soho district. After a leisurely brunch there, I was hooked. So when my mom visited me over the Thanksgiving holiday, I decided we should go back again. Wow, I'm glad we did.
As soon as my mom and I arrived, we were informed that since we were early (we showed up at 9:30am), we couldn't place an order until 10am, when Brunch is served. We chose to sit anyway and our server Carol came over to introduce herself. Best. Server. Ever. If you go there, you should request to sit in her section. For real.
My mom and I each ordered a cappuccino and Carol provided menus so that we could peruse the brunch possibilities. However the cappuccino kept stealing my attention. It was amazingly thick and creamy with just the right amount of foam on top of the espresso and milk. I heart caffeine.
Carol stopped by again and discussed each menu option with us so that we could make informed decisions. In the end, we chose two appetizers and two entrees. Carol received our order just prior to 10am and I think we were the first order into the kitchen for Brunch that day!
Appetizer 1: Onion Soup Gratinee
My mom thinks this is one of the best onion soups that she has ever had. And she's had a lot of onion soups. The cheese and bread were salty and thick. The soup underneath was rich and flavorful with onions and broth. This was a pretty filling appetizer, but we pressed on...
Appetizer 2: Warm Goat Cheese and Caramelized Onion Tart
This is by far my favorite appetizer at Balthazar. The mix of goat cheese and caramelized onions is exceptional and the warm flaky crust that goes along with this ain't half bad either. A small arugula salad with sweet, roasted tomatoes accompanies this tart.
So in short, we may have pigged out on cappuccinos and appetizers before getting to the big meal. Maybe.
Entree 1: Scrambled Eggs in Puff Pastry
This was my mom's choice for an entree. She really liked the fluffy eggs and the crisp, fresh mushrooms and asparagus that came with it. The buttery, flaky puff pastry was the perfect vessel in which to serve this.
Entree 2: Brioche French Toast
This was MY choice for an entree. I had it the last time I was there with Anjelika and I chose to have it again this time, since it was that good. The crust of the brioche was flaky. Yet the center of the brioche was soft and just melted in my mouth. And of course, it came with thick, warm bacon on top of it. (I moved the bacon to the side so you could see the brioche in this picture.) Everything's better with bacon. Drool.
All of the above was promptly devoured. As it should be.
I cannot wait to head back to Balthazar. There are so many other items that I would like to try on the menu. I just wish it wasn't so tempting to order tried-and-true favorites. I should really do these restaurant reviews more often. They're pretty tasty!
PS - Sorry about the dark photos. I took them with my camera phone and it doesn't have a flash!Also it's kinda weird that the workers were sitting and chatting behind us. Also the worker told me that I can't take pictures of the menu. She didn't say anything about taking pics of the food though..
Sweet potato milkshake (left) $5.50
I can't remember what's the other one. I did like my sweet potato shake, if you like sweet potato, I think you're gonna like it because it's very sweet potato.
Taro shaved ice (single) $6.99
I was hoping they serve with taro ice cream, but it was vanilla ice cream with taro powder on top. Oh well. Still, you can't go wrong with shaved ice.

I have been a big fan of Anderson Valley Pinot for years, thanks largely to the great buys that Knez has been turning out. Count Elke among my favorites from the region. Mary Elke moved from Napa (where she grew organic apples) to the Anderson Valley with her family in 1990 to plant and cultivate the Donnelly Creek Vineyard. They grow for other top producers such as Au Bon Climat, Copain, and Radio-Coteau, but keep some of the best fruit for themselves. Donnelly Creek is perfectly suited to Pinot Noir. It has a protective layer of fog that burns off mid-day, giving way to sun, before returning in the evening to protect the vines from the cold. The wine is unfined and unfiltered and is layered with beautiful red fruit and dusty earth. It is extremely well-made and is almost Oregonian in character. At $25.99, it is one of the best single-vineyard Cali Pinot buys I've seen. - Eric Genau

Better yet, the company will not only be hosting classes at their flagship store in Sydney, but they will be expanding to the store in New York City as well. Microsoft announced the news on the official Xbox website, alongside dates and registration links.
Here's a breakdown of the dates:
- New York City – August 20th – September 3rd – Register Here
- Sydney, Austrailia – September 25th – October 1st – Register Here
The classes are taught in partnership with the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE) and are split into three different categories, Development, Programming, and Design. Development teaches students how to make a game and run it on the Xbox One, Programming teaches how to build it, and Design shows conceptualization and pitch making.
All three skills are invaluable, and it's cool to see game development be taken seriously from an academic standpoint.With roster in place, who do the Heat dress every night?
Jul 30, 2010, 10:10 AM EDT
Pat Riley is gifted with supernatural powers. I don’t know that for a fact, but it seems the most logical explanation for how the Miami Heat not only landed all three of the biggest free agents on the market, but also filled out the roster with quality players.
Now the more practical question becomes: Who do they suit up? The Heat will carry 14 or 15 players, but come opening night they can only suit up 12. Then what are the rotations?
Our own Ira Winderman took a look into this in the Sun Sentinel..
The positions aren’t exact, but you get the idea. And that’s 10. Most coaches don’t go 10 deep in a regular rotation. So who would sit of that group? Big Z and the Heat go with a small lineup off the bench?
And then what about those last two spots on the roster?.
It also means guard Kenny Hasbrouck and forward Shavlik Randolph could have a training camp battle for the 15th spot on the roster. Or the Heat may carry just 14 players, leaving room for later moves.
See, there are interesting things on the Heat roster past the big three.
- Brad - Jul 30, 2010 at 10:56 AM
James Jones has to be in the rotation. He’s a big guy who plays like a lesser Raja Bell – defense & 3-pointers. He’ll draw assignments against Kobe & Durant so the superstars can save energy for offense.

Riley constructed a really nice squad within the limitaions of cap space. Sure they’re thin up front but they could still strenghten this area in the coming seasons with MLE. What I’m most curious about is how Wade and Bron co exist on a court in troughout the season (Olympics were a different thing, I wanna see if those two, who play wafuly similar basketball mostly with the ball in their hands can co exist and stay as effective as they were)

- J. McCann - Jul 30, 2010 at 12:45 PM
In the regular season I could see them going 10 or 11 deep on the rotation, or playing matchups.
Keep in mind, some of these big guys will be winded and beat up with only a few minutes action a night.
But by the playoffs, they will know who is over the hill.

AbstractSpatial. Carroll and lombard (1985, journal of american statistical association 80, 423-426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on n that is exploited by the n-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the n-mixture estimator compared to the caroll and lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.

I couldn't help it, though. I was powerless against the compulsion of the book. (The power of the book compels you. The power of the book compels you.)
I had just received The Summer After You and Me by Jennifer Salvato Doktorski Friday night. I had participated in the cover reveal and was offered the chance to read a review copy. I eagerly jumped at the chance! It was a Net Galley offering, but what the heck.
Now, I have nothing at all against Net Galley. In fact, I love the service that Net Galley provides. However, in order to be granted a review copy, one must be worthy. One must have the stats to be seen as worthy, which, let's be honest, I do not have. It's my own fault really and has a lot to do with the amount of time and energy I put into my job. Every request I have submitted has been denied with the exception of the BEA Buzz Books from 2014. Of course, I never read the samples, and so never posted a review. Again, my fault.
Anyway, I was sent a link and was told my name was submitted for approval. When I clicked on the link, lo and behold, I was able to download the book. Oh, frabjous day! I was so excited!!
I started reading yesterday morning and finished this morning. Although I had to put the book down for various reasons throughout the day, I could not wait to get back to the story. And I'll tell you why.
This, for me, was a very personal story. It resonated with me unlike any book I've read of late. While on one level, it is a contemporary beach themed romance, on another level it deals with the rebuilding of lives and communities in the wake of devastation of epic proportions. It was that more than anything that really hit home.
I grew up a Jersey girl. I spent my youth hanging out at the boardwalk in Asbury Park. I frequented beaches from Sandy Hook down to Belmar, but Asbury Park was where I spent most of my time. I lived in the next town over just a couple of miles from the beach. It was home. I played at those arcades. I saw concerts at the Convention Hall and at the Palace. I hung out at the Stone Pony. I've been by Madame Marie's a bajillion times. I even worked on the boardwalk at a candy store for a short while over one summer. Hated it. After I graduated college and worked for a couple years, I was offered a manager position. My bosses were expanding their business. It was a mall art gallery, but I jumped at the opportunity and headed north. I lived half my life at the shore and I can tell you, you can take the girl away from the shore, but you can't take the shore out of the girl.
I was devastated when Sandy hit. We had a friend staying from Scotland and all he wanted to do was go to the city. I couldn't work. We had no power for a week. Hubby had to go to work, though. Power generators I assume, so me and Lee sat on the couch eating Halloween candy in the dark most of the time. It was Thanksgiving when I finally saw what the storm wrought.
My family still lives at the shore, but before we could stop at my mom's, I had to see first hand. We were in my Mini. Stick shift. I was driving. I started at Asbury Park and drove up to the Atlantic Highlands and what I saw was just wreckage. Some towns weren't hit too bad, some were torn apart. The beaches were practically erased. I saw empty lots with refuse piled in a mountain three stories tall. And this is almost a month after the storm. It broke my heart and I knew it would never be the same.
While I no longer live near the ocean, it is always with me. The wounds are healing, people are putting their lives back together, communities rally, but this was a storm that has changed the profile of the Jersey Shore forever. And I think Jennifer Salvato Doktorski did a remarkable job conveying the heartbreak and the hope in the wake of what is called the Storm of the Century.
Book Description (From Amazon):
Publication Date: May 5, 2015
Will it be a summer of fresh starts or second chances?
For Lucy, the Jersey Shore isn't just the perfect summer escape, it's home. As a local girl, she knows not to get attached to the tourists. They breeze in during Memorial Day weekend, crowding her coastal.
My Thoughts:
Well, I'll tell you that I loved this story. It is probably my favorite book she has written so far. One of the things I love about the stories JSD writes is that I feel they are full of inside jokes just for me.
I've been to these places. I get the references. As I'm reading, I can see in my mind's eye exactly where she is talking about. And I couldn't be more excited about this being a story that takes place at the shore.
References like Madame Marie's, the twin bridges, bennies, Bruce, these are all things I know. And this book really felt like going home to me. It made me remember what it was like to get up while still dark to go to the beach and watch the sunrise. What it was like hanging on that hot sand with the sun beating down. And what it was like dealing with all the out-of-towners invading our turf.
In this story, Lucia (Luce) and her family have just returned back to their home after being evacuated for 8 months. They weren't far away, just over the bridge staying with her grandmother in a retirement community. Their first floor had to be gutted, but the upper floors were fine; however, the rental bungalow on their property was pretty much destroyed and needs rebuilding entirely.
Connor Malloy is the seasonal neighbor she has had a crush on for some time, but she knew she would never be in his league, so she worshipped him from afar. I mean, they were friends and all, but that's it. Connor had a parade of girls coming and going through his life and Luce knew she could never mean anything to him.
Until Sandy was on the way. They shared a moment, and in the moment was the promise of something more, but when he didn't call as he said he would and the only exchange they had were a couple of texts, she began to wonder if it was all in her head. If there was never a moment or if it meant nothing to him even though it meant everything to her.
A couple of months later and she still hasn't heard from him other than those texts when her best guy friend asked her out. Not sure if she should, afraid of ruining their friendship, she said yes. He was her first boyfriend. Everyone said they were perfect for each other, but I think it was a distraction tactic, to get over thinking about Connor all the time.
And it almost worked, until she opens the shade of her attic bedroom to see Connor shirtless doing repairs on the roof of their house next door. That starts a whole chain reaction of thoughts and feelings she thought she had buried over the winter. And she has Andrew. They get each other. But she realizes Andrew doesn't make her go all squishy inside the way Connor can by just walking in a room.
So, she's dealing with school work still, writing a junior thesis about the dating and mating habits of the local wildlife. She wants to be a marine mammalogist and volunteers to assist with the reclam effort in the bay. She is counting on a summer internship on one of the barrier islands, dealing with the fact that she has to take her driver's test, her house is still in repair. And, oh yeah, her old crush is back in town and he has brought his girlfriends along with him for the weekend.
Having all these feelings of Connor stirred up she thought were long buried makes her question her relationship with Andrew. She has never spoken to anyone about what passed between the Connor and herself. Her friends have the perfect summer planned out which includes her being with Andrew. To make matters worse, her brother is down rite hostile towards Connor, which causes a bit of a rift between Luce and Liam.
Underlying her relationship issues, are glimpses of the community rebuilding after the storm. People are coming back home, making repairs, businesses are re-opening. There a volunteer effort to build new houses to replace the ones destroyed in the storm and another effort to reseed the clam beds in the bay. Seeing the shore area through Luce's eyes, you are privy to her thoughts and feelings. It is a unique opportunity to understand just one person's perspective and how it changed her life and those around her.
This story was at times uplifting and full of hope and at others, sad and emotional, to understand the full magnitude of what was lost in the storm. It was also so familiar to me in so many ways. Like coming home.
Huzzah! Congrats on finishing a book in less than 24 hours! I seem to be in a slow-reading-rut. Going to hedge my bets and read Gaiman's new book next, as I know I'll love it and it will be a fast read for me.
Really enjoyed your review! I wondered if anyone would write a story about Sandy, so glad to hear that it was done so well! And how cool that you recognized so many of the places mentioned! That really adds an extra dimension to the story, doesn't it? Very cool!
I've really enjoyed her books. The first book I read was about a girl who torches her ex-boyfriend's car after he breaks up with her, he slaps her with a restraining order and she goes for a cross country road trip. A lot of fun! In her second book, she mention's the Tick Tock Diner which you used to drive by daily.
Cool! And I did actually eat at the Tick Tock Diner once. Still kicking myself for not buying a t-shirt when I had the chance. I really miss diners, as there's nothing like them anywhere else in the country!Warning: array_merge(): Argument #2 is not an array in /home/adwood5/public_html/buyaukulele/cont/xml.php on line 85
Martin Ukuleles
Martin ukuleles are some of the most sought after ukuleles around. There are many avid collectors of Martin ukuleles around and people who refuse to play anything but Martins.
Martin started producing ukuleles in 1916 and were the largest producer of ukes
There are a number of different styles (from style 0 to style 5 - but there's no 4). Generally speaking, the higher the number, the higher the price.
More knowledgeable sellers will indicate which style the Martin is. However, less well informed sellers, such as on eBay or in junk shops, will often not know what style the uke is. In this case, it's worth being able to identify which type of ukulele it is and how much it might be worth so you can tell if you're getting a bargain.
There are many details that can influence how valuable a Martin ukulele is. You'll find these discussed in great detail - down to the shape of the nuts used on the tuners - on the Martin Ukulele Forum. For our purposes, each page gives you a guide to the easiest way to distinguish the styles from each other.
On Video
This video, by ukulelezaza, has three different styles of Martin ukulele. From the beginning: Style 0, 1960s Style 1, 1920s Style 2, 1940s Style 3
On eBayDating Martin Ukuleles
Again, there you can go into minute, recondite information in this area, but their are two easy to spot features that will help you work out or confirm the Martin's age:
Peghead: The earliest Martin ukuleles (before '33) have a stamp on the back of the peghead. After this, they had a decal on the front (there was a slight overlap in these).
Soundhole: Inside the soundhole you'll see a stamp. If you can see the words "Made in USA" the ukulele was produced after 1966.
Martin Made Ukuleles
As well as making their own ukuleles, Martin also made ukes for other manufacturers such as Oliver Ditson. These ukuleles are identical to the standard Martin ukuleles apart from the maker stamps and decals.
eBay Ruses
Because Martins are so sought after, some sellers on eBay resort to shady tactics to get their ukes in front of buyers. One way you'll see regularly is people advertising the uke "w/ Martin strings" in the title. You see ukuleles refered to as 'Martin style' - even when they clearly aren't (Kiwaya are an exception to this). Another is people speculating that the ukulele is a Martin - it rarely is. Martin's are almost always stamped. Personally, I wouldn't buy anything from a seller that uses such desperate tactics.Lab talk

Rediscovered trapping mechanism favours smaller particles
A long overlooked aspect of electric field effects on small particles and molecules in fluid environments, dubbed AC electrophoretic (ACEP) phenomena, is in the spotlight thanks to the work of scientists in the US. In the study, the researchers note that the assumption that EP effects will vanish is only true for a spatially homogeneous AC field. The team goes on to show (both experimentally and theoretically) the non-vanishing ponderomotive EP effect in high-frequency electric fields and how to apply the phenomenon for trapping charged particles in aqueous solutions..
More efficient trapping
Until now, EP effects were not observed in any experiments due to the choice of experimental conditions, leading to a widely held notion that the EP effect is not important in high-frequency AC fields. The Yale-ORNL team realized that this common belief is only true for a spatially uniform AC fields (such as in the case of capillary zone electrophoresis). In fact, the researchers discovered that under the right conditions, the ACEP effect can dominate and lead to a more efficient trap, especially for smaller particles or molecules.
Various techniques (such as optical tweezers and DEP traps) have been developed to achieve particle trapping in liquids. The holding force (that is, trap strength) of these techniques, however, decreases as the size of the particle decreases. This makes it very difficult for DEP traps and optical tweezers to trap very small particles, or molecules.
If the particle is charged – almost always the case for particles in liquid – then the ACEP effect can be employed to trap particles. In the study, the team uses a planar quadrupole trapping device fabricated on an SiO2/Si wafer.
The advantage of the ACEP approach is that the trap stiffness actually increases with decreasing size, which makes it a very attractive candidate for single-molecule trapping.
A full description of the work can be found in the journal Nanotechnology.

OBJECTIVES:
Primary
- To assess the feasibility and toxicities of maintenance therapy with sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone after high-dose melphalan and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma.
- To assess whether administration of sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone can improve progression-free survival of these patients.
Secondary
- To assess whether administration of sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone can increase complete remission rate and duration of response in these patients.
- To assess the impact of maintenance therapy with sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone after transplantation on overall survival of these patients.
- To evaluate the influence of cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g., chromosome 13 deletion, 14 q32 abnormality, t [4;14], chromosome 1 q21 amplification, and chromosome 17 deletion) on outcome by performing conventional cytogenetic study and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies on baseline and post-transplant bone marrow specimens.
OUTLINE:
- High-dose melphalan and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -2 and -1 and undergo autologous PBSCT on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.
- Maintenance therapy: Beginning 4-8 weeks after transplantation, patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4; treatment with dexamethasone repeats every month for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 weeks after completion of bortezomib, patients receive oral thalidomide once daily until disease progression.
Patients complete the FACT-GOG neurotoxicity questionnaire periodically. Bone marrow samples are collected at baseline and post-transplant for cytogenetic analysis by FISH.

Although sin can be easily 'forgotten' in most religions through the
practice of some ritualistic processes such as confession in the
Catholic church where guilt remains a strong motivator or through the
realization that once one is 'saved' one will go to Heaven, as found
in some protestant interpretations.

So what if morality is a combination of historical pressures both
societal as well as evolutionary?

Aug 30, 2012, 6:06 PM EDT
The Edmonton Oilers did indeed give Jordan Eberle a Taylor Hall–type deal today, wrapping him up with a six-year, $36 million contract extension.
(Hall’s contract calls for the same $6 million annual cap hit, but it includes an extra year and thus totals $42 million.)
Eberle is just 22 and is coming off a breakthrough 34-goal, 76 point season.
That total topped the Oilers in 2011-12, giving him fantastic leverage.
With Eberle and Hall locked up for the long-term (both still have a year left on their current, cheaper deals), the Oilers cemented the future for half of their four brightest young forwards.
The Oilers can begin negotiating with Ryan Nugent-Hopkins on his second contract next summer and this year’s top overall pick Nail Yakupov in the summer of 2014.
Eberle and Hall represent the Oilers’ only long-term deals at this moment.
Aside from Shawn Horcoff and Yakupov being on the books until 2014-15, every other contract is set to expire in the next season or two.

A new treatment option for individuals suffering from severe, persistent asthma is now available at Upstate University Hospital. It’s called bronchial thermoplasty, and doctors say it can greatly improve the life of asthma sufferers, by lessening their dependence on harsh drugs and keeping them out of the emergency room for breathing troubles.
Upstate is the only hospital in New York state outside of New York City to offer this procedure.
“This is a group of patients we have not been able to help as well as we should have,” said Robert Lenox, MD, a pulmonolgist at Upstate who is one six physicians offering the procedure. “This new procedure will greatly enhance their quality of life.”
Here’s how it works: A long flexible tube, called a bronchoscope, is threaded through the patient’s nose or mouth into the airway. Once the bronchoscope is in position, the doctor then threads the thermoplasty device, called the Alair Catheter through the bronchoscope. Touching the tip of the catheter to the airway muscle, the doctor then applies radiofrequency waves that heat the muscle causing it to shrink, thus widening the airway passage for easier breathing.
The treatment is done in three stages, each focusing on a particular location of the airways in the lungs: the right lower lobe, the left lower lobe and airways of both upper lobes. A total treatment to shrink muscles throughout the entire airway system takes about three 90-minute sessions, which are spread out over three months.
The procedure is done with the patient under mild sedation. The patient is discharged the same day as the procedure.
Patients undergoing the procedure may experience some coughing, wheezing, sore throat and other minor side effects.
Bronchial thermoplasty may be recommended for anyone over the age of 18 who suffers from severe, persistent asthma. Some medical conditions and implanted devices may disqualify a patient from the procedure.
An asthma attack is what happens when muscles tighten around one’s airways making breathing difficult. Additionally, the inflamed airway produces thicker mucus worsening what can already be life-threatening symptoms.
The Alair Bronchial Thermoplasty System was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of severe, persistent asthma in April 2010. It’s the first device-based asthma treatment approved by the FDA.
In a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical study of bronchial thermoplasty, adults with severe asthma who were treated with bronchial thermoplasty had improved asthma-related quality of life out to a year compared to the control (sham-treated) patients. Additionally, when compared to control patients, patients treated with bronchial thermoplasty also experienced the following significant benefits:
•32 percent reduction in asthma attacks
•84 percent reduction in emergency room visits for respiratory symptoms
•66 percent reduction in days lost from work, school, or other daily activities due to asthma symptoms
•73 percent reduction in hospitalizations for respiratory symptoms
It’s estimated that more than 24 million people in the United States are diagnosed with asthma and as many as 10 percent of asthma sufferers are believed to have severe, persistent asthma. These individuals are commonly treated with high doses or cordicosteriods, with significant side effects, and routinely find themselves in the local Emergency Room because their asthma has greatly constricted their airways, making breathing difficult.
Caption: Bronchial thermoplasty features the use of a flexible tube with an expandable wire array at the tip that is introduced through the lungs by a bronchoscope. A separate radiofrequency controller supplies energy via the catheter (above) to the airway wall, shrinking the muscle to ease breathing.

I love a good debate and like to have my opinions challenged with spirited, thoughtful and good natured vigor. I learn from people that way.

Today, another beauty surfaced.
Stephen Hawking boycotted a conference in Israel to 'protest' Jews demanding that Palestinian fascists stop blowing up pizza parlors full of kids, showering rockets on neighborhoods and calling for a New Holocaust.
Hawking is the much afflicted physicist who operates from a wheel chair command center and who knows the exact quants in quantum mechanics.
JERUSALEM (Reuters) -.
However, his name was quietly dropped from the list of participants earlier this week, giving a major boost to supporters of pro-Palestinian groups that want to isolate Israel on the international stage over the continued occupation.
"This is his independent decision to respect the boycott, based upon his knowledge of Palestine, and on the unanimous advice of his own academic contacts there," the British Committee for the Universities of Palestine said on its website.
Hawking has joined the company of other public intellectuals and artists who proved to be absolute dumb-asses in world events, politics and living within the columns that make up history's personal pagination - Poets Ezra Pound and William Butler Yeats were tickled by fascism's trinkets -soaring rhetoric and mythopoeic imagery. Pound became radio traitor for Mussolini and Yeats formed his own Celto-fascist political party.
Semiotic totalitarian Noam Chomsky leads the pack as a dumb-ass, with all of hate of a Bill Ayers and all of gravity of MSNBC. The old clown is pathetic and no more of a public prophet than the now forgotten mope Ward Churchill..
Fourth—and this may be most important—he makes people stupid. In this sense, he's more like a cult leader or a New Age guru than an intellectual. He allows people to be comfortable with their prejudices and their hatreds, and he undercuts their ability to think in a critical manner. To an extent, this has to do with his use of emotional and moral blackmail. Since he portrays everyone who disagrees with him as evil, if you do agree with him you must be on the side of good and right. This is essentially a kind of secular puritanism, and it's very appealing to many people, for obvious reasons, I think. We all want to think well of ourselves, whether we deserve it or not.There is an intellectual side to this, as well. You see it clearly in his famous debate with Michel Foucault. Chomsky says at one point that there is a moral and ethical order that is hardwired into human beings. And Foucault basically asks him, why? How do you know this hardwired morality exists? And even if it exists, how can we know that it is, in fact, moral in the first place? We may feel it to be moral, but that doesn't make it true.Chomsky's answer is essentially: Because I believe it to be so. Now, whatever that is, it isn't thinking. In fact, it's an excuse for not thinking. Ironically, Chomsky later said that Foucault was the most amoral man he ever met, whereas I would argue that Foucault was simply pointing out that Chomsky's “morality” is in fact a form of nihilism.

Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Infection occurs through inhalation of the bacterium, which then travels to the alveoli of the lungs. In most people who become infected, the body is able to contain the bacteria and prevent it from multiplying. The bacterium can live in the lungs of an infected person for years, even a lifetime, without the person exhibiting any symptoms. This state is called latent TB infection. A person with latent TB is not infectious to others but the infection can develop into active TB disease in the future and usually exhibits a positive reactive tuberculin skin test.
Most people who have latent TB infection never develop active TB, but if they do not receive treatment for latent TB infection about 10 percent of latent TB infections can develop active disease over a lifetime.
This can happen when the person’s immune system is weakened allowing the bacteria to become active and cause TB disease (e.g., individuals with HIV, diabetes, certain hematologic disorders such as leukemias and lymphomas, prolonged corticosteroid use, and other conditions). Only a person with active TB can transmit the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed guidelines for preventing transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in health-care settings.1
Ask all patients about past history of TB or exposure to TB. Ask about TB signs and symptoms and medical conditions that increase their risk for TB disease when taking their medical history. A diagnosis of respiratory TB should be considered for any patient with symptoms including coughing for more than 3 weeks, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum or hemoptysis, hoarseness, fever, fatigue or chest pains. The ADA’s Health History Form contains these kinds of questions.
Because a person with latent TB is not infectious, he or she can be treated in the dental office under standard infection control precautions.2
Any patient with symptoms suggestive of active TB disease should be removed from the area of other patients or staff, instructed to wear a surgical or procedure mask, assessed for the urgency of their dental care and promptly referred for medical care. Standard precautions are insufficient to prevent transmission of the bacterium. Elective dental treatment should be deferred until the patient has been declared non-infectious by a physician. Urgent dental care for a person with suspected or active TB should be provided in a facility that has the capacity for airborne infection isolation and has a respiratory protection program in place. OSHA describes a standard for respiratory protection, which should be consulted if setting up a program (CFR 1910.134 Respiratory Protection). When treating a patient with active TB, dental health care personnel should use respiratory protection (e.g., fitted, disposable N-95 respirators). Standard surgical face masks are not designed to protect against TB transmission.
The CDC recommends that dental offices perform an annual risk assessment. Risk assessment involves:
Just because a dentist practices in a community with a high number of TB cases does not mean that that dentist’s office is medium risk. The likelihood of encountering TB cases in that particular practice determines its risk category.
The level of risk for encountering active TB in the dental office determines the types of administrative, environmental, and respiratory protection controls needed. Annual risk reassessment can also serve as an ongoing evaluation tool of the quality of the office’s TB infection control practices and allows identification of any needed improvements in infection control measures.
The CDC recommends that dental office personnel receive training and education on M. tuberculosis and TB disease that emphasizes the increased risks posed by an undiagnosed person with TB disease in a dental-care setting and the specific measures to reduce this risk. Training and education materials are available from the CDC
( and).
The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices does not recommend routine immunization (Bacille-Calmette- Guérin [BCG]) of U.S. health care workers against TB. However, the CDC does recommend that all persons in the dental office who have the potential for exposure to M. tuberculosis through air space shared with persons with infectious TB disease (which essentially means all personnel) receive a two-step baseline tuberculin skin test (TST) at the beginning of employment in low-risk settings, every 12 months in medium-risk settings and every 8–10 weeks in the event of potential ongoing transmission until no further evidence of ongoing transmission is apparent. By doing so, TST conversions (from a negative to positive result) following an exposure incident can be distinguished from positive TST results resulting from previous exposures. After baseline testing additional TB screening is not necessary in low-risk settings unless an exposure to M. tuberculosis occurs.
Individuals with a positive TST should consult with their physician to determine whether any treatment is required.HP DeksJet GT 5821 Driver Downloads

Here are some possibly options, according to Good Housekeeping:
- Roku 3 offers more than 1,000 channels for around $100. It also has a cool remote that allows users to plug in a headset while their partner sleeps undisturbed.
- Apple TV, like Roku, also offers a variety of programming for $99. But while shows and movies from iTunes are limited, AirPlay allows users to stream content directly from Apple products wirelessly.
- Google Chromecast is a new device that plugs straight into a TV and offers popular online entertainment from Netflix, YouTube, Google Play and Hulu Plus. Bonus! It’s only $35.
- Warning – streaming popular shows like Modern Family, Dexter, Orange is the New Black, Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad might come with additional annual costs. But watching those shows through a streaming device cost no more than $400 a year, which equates to an estimated monthly payment of $33.

As 'The Office' makes its march towards concluding, we're hoping that they at least have some good treats in store for us in these last episodes. But so far their final season has been pretty rocky. Last week's episode "The Boat" at least moved forward the possible Erin/new guy Pete relationship, and was thankfully Jim-and-Pam-drama free. So we're hoping for good things from this week's episode, "The Whale."
The episode starts with the office skyping with Andy, who's still on his cruise, and who tells them he's seen 'Dirty Dancing' now ten times, he's covered in sunburns, and is about to crack (even though it's only been two days). David Wallace calls Dwight and tells them that Scranton's white pages needs a new publisher. Dwight calls the white pages "the white whale," because of all its blubber. But the client's buyer is a woman, and Phyllis points out that Dwight can't handle women. They want Jim on the client, but he's got his other workthing.
Much of the office are growing mustaches for Movember, and it proves to be disgusting to women -- especially Toby's, which makes him look like a pedophile. Angela tells Oscar that her husband might be having an affair, which Oscar enjoys until he hears that the Senator is attending noonday Yoga lessons from someone named Blake, and so both plot to check out the yoga studio. Dwight shows all the woman in the office how he'll deal with women, which goes horribly, as expected.
Jim takes the conference call and is interrupted by Kevin, so he goes outside where he keeps being interrupted by noises. Dwight's education proves fruitless, though Pam - as a mother - wants to help. Oscar and Angela check out the Yoga studio, and Oscar is relieved it's a woman instructor, but that doesn't help Angela until they see that Blake has a boyfriend, but it gets worse for Oscar when he sees that the Senator has a male yoga partner. At the meeting with the white pages no one seems to know who the woman buyer is, until it's revealed that it's Jan. Yes, that Jan. Jan Levinson. So Pam tells Dwight to forget all their lessons.
Jan wants to meet David Wallace, who isn't there, so she yells at her assistant. Dwight, as a salesperson, thinks he's got this so Pam distracts Jan by getting her to show off a slideshow of her daughter. Oscar wants to keep watching the senator, which Angela interprets as him being turned on instead of jealous, but what Oscar says confuses the issue, and after they have to duck when the Senator makes a call, it becomes apparent the Senator's calling Oscar. Dwight comes back in to Jan's office with Clark, and Dwight says that Clark would be Jan's personal liaison, which - after Jan sizes Clark up, and it's made apparent she has a thing for underage boys - leads to Jan saying she'll make her decision within a week. Jim gets a call from his other job and is told that it's not working out without him there. Uh oh.
As the show closes, Pam tells the Jan's assistant to quit, while Dwight proves that he learned something.
With so many character (even with Andy mostly out of the picture) this is a stuffed 30 minutes of television, and it leaves most characters with 2-3 minute storylines, or - in most cases - a joke or line or two. This is probably the strongest Phyllis episode in a while, but even then she doesn't have much to do. Jim's other job feels like something to keep him busy, but the return of Jan Levinson and the final solution to get her business was pretty good. This is one of the better episodes of this last season, but it looks like the show's going to end with more of a whimper than a bang.Astrology : Daily Panchang – November 28th, 2017

Photo Credit: Ajith_chatie, Flickr Creative Commons Attribution License.
With all of the bad news we're hearing about overzealous local governments infringing on people's right to garden (from Michigan to British Columbia, and, undoubtedly, several places in between), a bit of good news is welcome.
Last summer, the Oliveira family of Toronto planted a front yard vegetable garden. Their four children loved it, the neighbors admired it, and the Oliveira family enjoyed harvesting home grown food from their yard. The city of Toronto's Traffic Planning Department did not share their enthusiasm.
They issued a letter telling the family they had to remove the garden.
Local newspaper columnists and media picked up on the story. The family received support from all over the world. Letters and phone calls poured into the Traffic Planning department.
And the city saw the light. As of this spring, they're rewriting the city ordinances. Previously, sod was the only acceptable material for the front yard of a residence. The city is now adopting an ordinance which will permit the use of "soft landscaping" -- plants other than grass, including flowers, shrubs, and -- (yes!) vegetables.
A combination of media coverage and the support of people from around the world made the difference for the Oliveira family and their garden. Here's hoping the same is true for other gardeners dealing with overzealous city bureaucrats, intent on maintaining the status quo rather than adapting to a new reality. Growing our own food was once common, and it is becoming more common again. We should have the right to grow food, regardless of what bureaucrats and nosy neighbors think.

Keeps on rebooting without any useful error message?
Gives you a BSOD on boot up?
And let me guess, you did all the right things. Inserted the usb key with the Intel RAID drivers on them when you did the install. (because otherwise you could not see the drives in the first place to install to)! All installs well, and when you boot into the machine nothing wants to work?
Resetting the BIOS back to AHCI mode seems to solve the problem. Or does it? I think that only solves the symptom. not the problem. Especially if you have a dual boot scenario where your Windows 8 is expecting the RAID configuration and crashes in AHCI mode. Looks like you'll have to enter the bios and switch modes each time you wish to boot into a different image? Get out of here!!!
A possible solution:
For whatever crazy reason, Windows Server will think it is in AHCI mode, even if you give it the right RAID drivers on install. There is a simple fix for this if you aren't afraid of mucking around in the registry a bit.
Step 1) install the OS while in RAID or AHCI mode. Load the drivers. complete the install. wait until the reboot hangs (if in RAID mode)
Step 2) go into bios and chance to AHCI mode (temporarily)
Step 3) boot into the windows image to complete install
Step 4) download and install the latest Rapid Store Drivers from Intel and install (will expect a reboot)
Step 4) open regedit (if you don't know how to open regedit, stop reading and keep your bios on AHCI mode)
Step 4) look for following entries in your registry
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\msahci (sometimes not there depending on how you installed WS2012)
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\iaStorV
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\iaStor
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\iaStorIntelManagementEngine
One or more of those keys will have the Start Value set to 2 or 3. change the value for the Start Entry to 0 for each one.
Step 5) shut down, boot up, enter BIOS, change to RAID mode, Save&Exit
Done. next time the system boots it will pick the correct driver depending on your BIOS setting and will not crash and burn.While Anthony Davis will return to the New Orleans Hornets' lineup Tuesday night, recent news surrounding fellow former No. 1 overall pick John Wall hasn't been as promising.
That doesn't bode well for a Washington Wizards team that saw a couple of other key players go down last week.
The Hornets try for a sixth win in eight matchups against the injury-plagued Wizards, who are still seeking their first road victory.
Having lost 12 of 14, New Orleans (5-14) is surely looking forward to getting Davis back on the court. The former Kentucky star missed the last 11 games with a stress reaction in his left ankle, but he was cleared to return Tuesday.
Davis averaged 16.0 points, 8.3 rebounds and 2.2 blocked shots in his first six NBA games.
The NBA-worst Wizards (2-15), meanwhile, have struggled mightily without Wall, who was originally expected to return in late November following a stress injury to his left knee. The first overall selection in 2010, also out of Kentucky, isn't ready to practice and coach Randy Wittman isn't sure when he'll be able to return.
Things aren't about to get any easier for Washington, which lost Trevor Ariza to a strained left calf during last Tuesday's 105-101 win over Miami then suffered another big blow Saturday. A.J. Price, who's started 15 of 17 games in Wall's point guard spot, fractured his right hand four minutes into a 101-97 loss to Golden State and will miss four to six weeks.
"It leaves kind of a salty taste in your mouth," said Price, averaging 8.5 points and a team-best 4.9 assists. "We haven't been 100 percent all at the same time, so it's difficult right now but it's still a long season. We need to continue to try to get ourselves better, get ourselves right so we can get on the court together."
The Wizards, who also continue to play without power forward Trevor Booker (knee), figure to rely on Jordan Crawford all the more with Price out. The guard matched season highs with 22 points and eight assists off the bench Saturday while filling in at the point.
"Definitely tough, unexpected," said Crawford, averaging a team-leading 14.2 points. "Hopefully we can pull it together. I'm just trying to do what I can to help the team win."
Crawford may need to come out with an especially big game Tuesday if he hopes to lead the Wizards to their first road win. Washington, which started 0-25 as the visiting team in 2010-11 and 0-8 last season, has begun 0-8 in opposing arenas again and is the league's only winless road team.
The Wizards had dropped five of six in this series before pulling out a 99-89 victory in New Orleans on March 15 behind 26 points from Wall and 17 from Crawford.
The Hornets are coming off their third straight loss, 106-90 at Miami on Saturday. Ryan Anderson had 24 points while Robin Lopez scored 20, but they couldn't slow down a Heat team that shot a season-best 58.0 percent from the floor.
"We just need to come out and play with energy every night and play with effort. That is what our group is about," Anderson said. "Each night we're focused on us and getting better with this group. We know how good we are when we play right. We're a relentless team. No matter how much we're down we're going to try and fight back."
Tuesday marks the first matchup between these teams since New Orleans traded Ariza and Emeka Okafor to Washington this offseason. Okafor is averaging career lows of 6.6 points and 5.5 rebounds for the Wizards.

Westinghouse Atom Smasher History
In 1916, the Westinghouse Research Laboratories were established in Forest Hills PA, just outside of Pittsburgh, as the company's mechanics department. Divisions for metallurgy, magnetics, physics and chemistry were created in order to improve the water turbines and electrical generations they were producing.
When the Great Depression struck, the company was forced to lay off numerous scientists and thousands of workers, causing labor unrest at all their plants for a number of years. Westinghouse executives decided to enter the field of nuclear physics not only to improve its public image and acquire scientific talent, but to also ensure the company had a strong presence in this new field, and stay ahead of the competition (particularly General Electric).
A $42,000 research program was initiated, with the main focus on building a particle accelerator to study the effects of high speed subatomic particle collisions. During this time, cyclotrons were the most efficient type of accelerator being used, but the Westinghouse corporation needed something grandiose and flashy to help restore their public image. It was decided that an electrostatic accelerator would pack enough punch to grab people's attention.
Electrostatic accelerators are a type of Van de Graaf Generator, which uses a moving belt to accumulate electric charge at the top of a hollow dome that sits above an insulated column, creating very high voltage DC electricity at low current levels. They can often be seen at science museums or fairs, where touching the globe causes one's hair to stand on end.
Of course, Westinghouse needed a Van de Graaf generator larger than any other that had been built to create both the voltage needed for accelerating particles, and the prestige the company's executives desired. In 1937, a 60 foot (20m) tall pear-shaped tower was constructed at the Forest Hills plant. It utilized two belts which traveled up a 47 foot shaft to energize a domed electrode at the top. The high voltage electricity was then used to accelerate subatomic particles back down through a vacuum tube that ran down the center of the shaft, where they struck a target to create nuclear reactions (see cutaway drawing below). The generator alone would be limited to producing about 1 megavolt due to arcing and corona discharge, so the entire apparatus was enclosed inside an air tank that would be pressurized to 120 psi. This effectively insulated the generator, and allowed it to reach a voltage of 5 megavolts. Although 10 megavolts were hoped for, it was still the most powerful accelerator in the world at that time.
When the atom smasher was unveiled, it was picked up by major national publications, and the company was commended for a farsighted vision into the future of civilian nuclear research. While it helped Westinghouse's publicity, the apparatus saw relatively little use during the first few years. In 1941, the company focus shifted entirely to defense work for the war and nuclear research became highly classified; these operations were moved to secret locations such as Los Alamos. The smasher was too large to be moved however, and was decommissioned, although the massive tank surrounding the generated was used to store compressed air used in jet propulsion research that continued at the Forest Hills lab during World War II.
In 1943, a huge explosion rocked Schenectady NY when a hydrogen storage tank exploded due to internal pressure blowing apart its brittle steel casing. It was built by Chicago Bridge and Iron Works, the same manufacturer as the atom smasher, and many were concerned about the integrity of the atom smasher's massive pressurized air tank. All work was halted at the Forest Hills lab until every weld was x-rayed and all defects were repaired.
After the war, the smasher was once again used by researchers but was beginning to show its age. When Westinghouse built their own smaller and more powerful cyclotron in 1956, the smasher soon became obsolete and was permanently decommissioned in 1958. The lab itself continued working at the Forest Hills site until Westinghouse took a financial nose dive in the 1990s. It sold off its share of power distribution and merged with CBS in 1995; the entire lab facility was shuttered the following year.
The lab remained vacant, with several buildings being demolished as the property changed hands numerous times, until it was bought by D.C. developer Gary Silversmith. Planning to build apartments on the site, he had promised to restore the smasher's iconic "bulb" to its former glory, but to the dismay of many, the generator was knocked off its base and crashed onto its side in 2015. The developer claims the building supporting the smasher was in a state of "severe disrepair" which required its demolition, and he still vows to restore it, but it is unclear how much damage was sustained in the fall, and how the 90-ton steel tank will be relocated due to its massive size and weight.
As of 2016, all the lab buildings have been razed and the smasher is lying on its side in a field of rubble, but the nostalgic can see a scale model of it on display at the Miniature Railroad & Village at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh. Detailed history of the smasher was culled from this informative opinion piece and a great article on the Physics Central blog.Corporate Profile
The Maju Institute of Educational Development (MIED) was established in 1984 as a private, non-profitable organization which administers an Education Loan Programme to help students and families who are not able to achieve their life-long ambitions pay for education beyond high school. MIED has tremendously contributed to the educational and career dreams of needy and well deserving students. Since its humble beginning in 1984, MIED has carved a niche for itself as an organization that serves the community.
The Tireless March Forward
Over the last 26 years, MIED has gone through many exciting progress in loan disbursements, education and development of world-class campus. Millions of ringgit is allocated for these purposes. As part of our efforts to build a cadre of future leaders, we are offering financial assistance to students in post-secondary programmes at universities, community colleges and private colleges in Malaysia and around the world.
The establishment of a technical institute, the TAFE College, in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, and a world-class university, The Asian Institute of Medicine, Science and Technology (AIMST University), in Semeling, Kedah has been the maiden effort of MIED since its establishment.
Tafe College
Tafe College has been a long established provider of technical education in Malaysia with the aim to make education available to every Indian youth. The college has developed an exceptionally diverse student body and strengthened the excellence of its curricula.
TAFE College plays an active role in enhancing the image of private education in Malaysia by developing a sustainable mode of training and education for community programmes. TAFE endeavors to contribute in making Malaysia a centre of educational excellence by providing critical human capital that drives the country’s economy. Being a non-profitable entity, surpluses are reinvested for educational purposes and for upgrading campus facilities.
When it comes to quality and industry recognised education, affordability and conducive environment, TAFE stands in the forefront of the Malaysian education industry.
AIMST University
AIMST University is the brainchild of its Founder & Chancellor, YBhg. Dato’ Seri S. Samy Vellu that came to fruition in the late nineties when education became the mainstay of Malaysia’s development in a global economy. His belief that education is the only way a society can formulate its own purposes, be able to organize its own means and resources, thereby shaping itself with definiteness and economy in the direction in which it wishes to progress spurred him to find the way to create AIMST University.
Success in the eyes of the world and academia will not come overnight. With hard work on our part and with patience and tolerant understanding from our supporters, the University will eventually stand out as a beacon of education and influence and thus enhance the reputation of Malaysia.
The MIED Administration
The employees of MIED are the most prized resource and the backbone of the administration. We at MIED strive to provide employees with a dynamic work environment that will challenge, motivate and reward them.
The disbursements of loans are overseen by the Chairman of the Board and the Board of Trustees.
The major departments of MIED are:
- Loan Processing Department, which handles the processing of the loans, preparation for issuance of payment, handling of enquiries.
- Recovery Department, which handles credit control and repayments.
- Accounts Department, which handles payment preparation for students and suppliers, and
- Administration Department, which handles staff welfare, administration and event coordination.
The MIED administrative office is located on the first floor of the Menara Manickavasagam, the MIC headquarters. It is well equipped with meeting and counselling rooms as well, which among other things facilitates interaction between the MIED officers and staff and students and their parents.
MIED Loans
The MIED loan applications usually open once a year in July.
In order to collect the loan application form, the applicant have to submit a copy of the university or college letter of offer, an accreditation letter from the Public Service Department and National Accreditation Board (LAN), and a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Higher Education (for students who wish to pursue an education overseas). The fees structure of the tertiary education need to be submitted together with copies of their academic certificates and copies of guarantors Identity Card and payslips. All these are the required documentation to apply for a MIED loan.
Certain criteria need to be adhered to by the loan applicant when making the application. A PSD or LAN accredited course need to be selected prior to the loan application.
Completed application forms will be updated into the computer system at MIED. The application will be processed and verified with the relevant university or college and a report will be prepared for the approval of the Board.
The Board of Trustees will then consider the application by an interview session. The success rate of the application is determined by the past records if the applicant had taken a previous loan, credit checking and applicant’s socio-economic background and eligibility to apply for a PTPTN (National Higher Education Loan Fund Corporation) loan.
An applicant will know whether he or she has been successful in getting a loan within two to six weeks of applying. Successful students or parents will be notified via telephone or correspondences.
MIED does not encourage students to study abroad, particularly if the courses are available locally. Applicants who choose to pursue courses at Tafe College or AIMST University are MIED’s priority in loan applications.
Loan applicants are given a loan repayment schedule six months prior to the completion of their course of study. The file will be closed if the student makes regular payments and fully settles his/ her loan. However, if a students defaults on the repayment, three reminders will be sent and then a telegram, after which legal action will be taken.
Source of Funds
When it was first established, MIED received a small government grant and public donations as the source of funds. Subsequently, a revolving fund was established with the sum from the loan repayments. The other source of funds also comes from the various buildings rental, interest from fixed deposits and ad hoc donations from various organizations.

The field exported about $6.9 billion worth of gas condensate, a 28-percent increase in the value of exports of that product over the same period last year, Ahmad Pourhaydar said.
Other exports included methanol, propane and polyethylene, he added. The bulk of its products went to China, Japan, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.
Frances Total signed a deal with Tehran last month)Baking soda and baking powder are easily confused because they have similar names and appearance. Sometimes they are used in the same recipe, but it is important to know their individual uses. So, they are both leaveners but chemically different. Here is the difference between baking soda and baking powder.
BAKING SODA
This ingredient is also known as bicarbonate of soda or sodium bicarbonate. The baking soda is a base mineral, which, when combined with something acidic, produces carbon dioxide. Therefore, when a recipe needs baking soda, it actually needs some type of acid. When you use baking soda in a recipe, you also need something acidic, such as brown sugar, lemon juice, molasses, cream of tartar, yogurt, and buttermilk. So, they react together.
Baking soda is stronger than baking powder. However, too much baking soda doesn’t mean more lift and when it doesn’t react with any acid in the recipe there will be leftover baking soda in the recipe. Moreover, when it isn’t neutralized with acid, the recipe will have a metallic taste.
In order to decide the exact measurement of baking soda in a recipe, you should know the rule of thumb.
Good rule of thumb: Use around 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda per 1 cup of flour in a recipe.
BAKING POWDER
Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda and other acids, such as cream of tartar, and sometimes cornstarch. When preparing a recipe, the first leavening occurs when baking powder gets wet. While the second leavening occurs when the baking powder is heated. Therefore, it already contains an acid. So, in order to know how much baking powder to use, try the following rule.
Good rule of thumb: Use around 1 teaspoon of baking powder per 1 cup of flour in a recipe.
WHY DO SOME RECIPES CALL FOR BOTH?
There are certain recipes which are prepared by using both these ingredients. These recipes usually have some sort of acid and the carbon dioxide created from the acid and baking soda is not enough to leaven the volume. Therefore, baking powder is used as well. It is simply about balance.
REMEMBER THAT THEY EXPIRE
Remember to always use fresh baking powder and soda and to change them at least every 3 months. Moreover, if you are hesitant about the expiry date you can check their effectiveness before using them.
In order to test baking powder, pour 3 tablespoons of warm water into a small bowl. Add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and stir it. If it gives some reaction, it is a fresh one. On the other hand, in order to test baking soda, pour 3 tablespoons of white distilled vinegar into a small bowl. Then, add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and stir it. If the mixture rapidly bubbles, it indicates that the baking soda is fresh.
One last tip because we know that it is hard to remember the difference between these similar ingredients: Think baking soda = single ingredient. Baking powder = poof in the oven.
We really hope you enjoyed this article and don’t forget to share it with your friends and family. Thank you and have a good one!
BAKING SODA SHAMPOO: IT WILL MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW LIKE IT IS MAGICHello my almond butter loving friends. If you're new to HEAB, you may like to subscribe to my RSS feed or receive my posts via email. Thanks for reading!
Hi – I miss you guys! Just a quick update…
The above photo was from last week. So, I’m officially 32 weeks along and still feeling pretty good. Fortunately, I’ve been able to remain active throughout my pregnancy with no complications. Summer and I walk almost everyday, and we’re loving the pool!
I’ve even been cooking more…
Tonight we dined on Ashley’s Quinoa Broccoli Casserole, and it was wonderful. Thanks for another great recipe Ashley.
And thanks to everyone who has checked in with me and for your thoughts and prayers. According to our ultrasound yesterday, the twins are growing right on schedule, and my doctor thinks the babies will arrive in another three to four weeks. We can’t wait to meet them!
Hope you all are well. Enjoy the holiday weekend!

Glad to hear you’re doing well! I hope you update us when the twins are born!
Thanks Chelsey, and yes, I will definitely let you guys know when the babies arrive. Hope all is well with you.
so happy to hear all is well. you look absolutely amazing! good luck in the coming weeks
Thanks Alli!
Love an update from you, Heather! I’m so glad that everything is going smoothly and that you’ve been able to remain active – that’s so awesome. Summer could not be sweeter, and I can’t wait to see pictures of your two new bundles of joy in just a few short weeks!
Thanks Jenn, I can’t wait to see those babies either!
Oh my gosh! I was just at your website looking for your gluten/dairy free tuna casserole recipe (which by the way was awesome!) and I was wondering how you were doing! You look amazing and so healthy
Praying all goes well and can’t wait to see pictures of the twins
Thanks so much Colleen and happy to hear you’re enjoying the tuna noodle casserole. It’s been way too long since I’ve made that one – would be a good one to make ahead and freeze for when the twins arrive!
oh heather i didn’t know you were expecting again.
congrats to you.
that is just wonderful news.
you are such a good mommy.
enjoy the time off…..
Vanilla,
Thanks so much. Hope all is well with you…and so wished you lived close by! All of your recipes have been so tempting throughout this pregnancy.
It was so nice to see you pop up on my newsfeed! Glad to see all is well and I look forward to seeing pictures of the little ones upon arrival
Thanks so much Irina.
Thanks for the update, and so happy to hear you’re doing so well
Thanks Katie!
So so so good to get an update
take care!!!!
Thanks Carolyn.
Yay I’m glad to hear you’re well
Thanks Joy.
You look amazing! I am glad you are staying active. I am too, but man, being on my feet is getting harder and harder (I’m at 34 weeks). I’ve been doing less walking and more swimming for sure.
I have a good friend from college who is 31 weeks with twin boys, and she’s probably going to go in the next few weeks too. She’s on bed rest. I’m betting you both deliver before me. My 6 yo was 2 weeks early, but I’m hoping to go closer to full term this time.
Marcia,
Ahhhh, you’re almost there, and yes, doesn’t the pool feel great! We went swimming yesterday, and I have no trouble floating these days.
Hope that all of our little ones stay in a few more weeks. Here’s to some big healthy babies!
you’re absolutely glowing! i’m so happy that you and your family are doing well!
Thanks so much Teabagginit. Hope all is well with you too.
Thanks for the update! I am so glad you pregnancy has been going well!
It is great you are able to enjoy this time with Summer actively before the twins come.
Take care of you, and your family! Thanks for sharing how you are doing with your online blog family! I come back and check to see if there has been an update often, well and to get a recipe or three from your archives! <3 Hugs!
Thanks Nikki and thanks for checking in every so often. Happy to hear you’re enjoying some of my recipes – we’ve been enjoying some new ones ourselves, and I need to update my recipe page soon. Take care, and I’ll be sure to let you guys know when the twins arrive.
Thank you for the update Heather! Can’t wait to meet the twins!
Enjoy your holiday weekend!!

Aw, Heather you are glowing! So glad to hear you are doing well. Coincidentally, I was poking through your archives just earlier today and wondering how you were
Are you still instagramming? I saw that you’d changed your pics to private and didn’t want to be too much of a stalker!
Jennie,
Thanks so much and yep, still instagramming. I sent you an email about it.
I was so happy to see this update! You look beautiful as usual and I am so glad to hear that everything is on track. Cool photo effects too, btw
Love you Heabie! Love, Lara, Matt, and “America”
Lara,
Ha – Deb has turned me on to all of her iPhone photo apps – it’s a bit addictive! Love you too, and I hope you are feeling well. He’s going to be here soon, and I can’t wait to see pics of your little baby boy.
You are just too dang cute my friend.love you
Aww, thanks Donna G. Love and MISS you!
You are the cutest pregnant lady ever. I mean, you were always cute, but this puts you over the top. Love it!
Thanks Katie.
Heather!! HI!!!!!! I was actually thinking about you, so.very.much this past week. I didn’t want to bug you b/c I know when you’re on a break from blogging and growing two humans, you don’t need your email overflowing but I’ve had you on my mind all week. Thanks for the update and you look beyond awesome!!! Wow, can’t believe the show is almost over in 3-4 weeks…WOW!
Averie,
I think about you often too and have been wondering how you’re doing. Looks like your blog is keeping you super busy – yay, and good for you! I miss hearing from you though – please email me anytime!!
I’ve been thinking of you lately, darling! Have realised that my gallivanting around your country may well coincide with the brilliant expansion of your family, so I may have to hold back on my hyperactive need to commandeer you to myself
Anyway, we’ll see! Sending wonderful wishes to you for the final pre-meeting-the-baby weeks! xo
Thanks again for the well wishes Hannah, and I hope you had a wonderful birthday! We will meet someday.
Sounds like you’re doing so well, Heather – thanks for the update and all the best wishes for the next month or so
Thanks so much Georgia.
So happy to see that things are going well, Heather! Thanks for the update– feel free to keep ‘em coming
Thanks Brittany, and I promise another update when the twins arrive.
I hoped you’d be back! You look great, obviously. I’m so glad you and Summer are still going outside and such.
I actually just bookmarked that quinoa and broccoli dinner in hopes of getting over my dear of quinoa’s texture!
It is hard to believe the twins will be here soon- I remember when you were just waiting for Summer!
Thanks so much Hannah, and I hope you try the recipe. I’m sure it would work great with any other grain like rice or maybe millet. It was so good!
such a nice saturday morning surprise to see you in my reader. miss your posts but so happy to hear that you’re enjoying time with summer and that you’re doing well with the twins. sending you lots of love!
Aww, thanks Jen. That made me smile and thanks for all the love as well. Much appreciated!
I keep thinking of you and wondering how you are! So very glad to hear you’re well (and the twins too)! All the best for these next few weeks- I hope it’s smooth sailing! Sending my well wishes to you and Chris as you get closer to the beginning of another big adventure.
Thank you Rachel.
So glad I kept your blog on my reading list. Thanks for the check in! You look amazing for 31 weeks. Congrats!
Cecilia,
Me too! Thanks for sticking around.
So happy to hear you are well! Glad the whole family is well! You look so great! I can not believe you have two babies in that belly!!
Happy weekend! <3
Thanks Katie, and trust me, they’re are definitely two in there…they are kickers!
Heather, you look great and I am so glad you are feeling good!! Think of you often and praying an easy and safe delivery:)
Thanks so much Kimberly. Hope all is well you!
So glad to hear things are going well! You look great! Not much longer!
Thanks Julie, and yep, not much longer. I can’t believe the twins will be here so soon!
Hi Heather,
I was just thinking of you on my walk today and wondering how you were doing, so when I saw your post I just had to check in! Sounds like things are going wonderfully. My boy/girl twins arrived at 36 weeks and they were absolutely ready to be born (they will be 8 years old the end of June…how time flies and my oldest will be 11 next week!). Enjoy! Would love to hear periodic updates from you when time allows!
Best,
Jonna
Hi Jonna, hoping we make it to 36 weeks. I feel like these babies are ready to come out now, but I know they need some more time to grow. Just doesn’t feel like there’s much room left for them in there!
Time does fly – I can’t believe Summer is already 18 months old. We plan on savoring every second with our babies when they arrive as that sweet newborn stage ends so quickly.
So funny you would post this today, because I was just thinking about you yesterday and browsing around some of your old posts!
You look fabulous, Heather!!! You really do. Congrats, congrats, again and again, and have fun with your new twins when they come!
Lots of love,
Alex
Alex,
Hi! I’ve been thinking about you too. I miss keeping with everyone. Hope all is well and thanks for thinking about us!
sooooo lovely to here from you again!!
fab to you are are doing well! you look great in that pic!
Thanks so much Michaela.
You look amazing! Especially while toting around *two* little ones! I jumped when I saw you had an update – great to see how things are progressing!
Thanks for sharing!
Thanks Rachel.
You are one adorable pregnant lady!
So glad to see a post from you and to hear that all is well. I can’t believe the next two HEABlets will be with you guys do soon! Will be thinking of you guys. Have a great rest of your pregnancy!
Thanks Monica, I can’t believe it either. Thanks for the thoughts, and I hope all is well with you and your precious family.
you look great Heather, still quite small bump for carrying twins!!! I miss your blog posts so much and your food!
all the best for the new family to come!
Thanks so much Coco. I miss all of you guys, and I hope you’re doing well. I think of you and your bump often.
loved reading this update! I’m so happy to hear that everything is going well and you look great.
Thanks Ida.
Thanks for giving us an update, Heather. Miss you but hope you’re having the best
time enjoying the time with your little one/getting ready for the new little additions.
You look great.
Thanks so much Jennifer. I miss all of you and hope to post more regularly again someday.
A very sweet and happy update!! You look Fabulous:-)
Thanks so much ClaireRose!
Copied down that quinoa recipe…thinking I’ll make it tomorrow for us and Nate to eat this coming week during his recoveries. What pool are you going to? I want to pool it! and see you! Love. Tonya
Tonya,
I’ve been thinking about Nate, and I hope he is healing well. Sounds like you are taking good care of him! We’ve been going to the indoor pool at the Bellevue Y as it’s super kid-friendly, but now all the outdoor pools are open too. Summer loves the water, and so whenever you want to join us, just let me know!
You look wonderful! Miss hearing from you and seeing you. Love, Denise.
Thanks Denise. Hope all is well with you. Hopefully we’ll run into you soon – we’re always at the Frothy Monkey!
Yay….come back… !!!
Whoohoo!!!!! Radiant as ever Heather! I can’t believe there are twins in there either! You’re so tiny for 32 weeks! I’m so happy you’re feeling great and stool walking with Ms Sweetness Summer. Love to CD, Summer and you and pats to the pups, Marty
P.S. Definitely two babies in there, and wow, are they active. I think they’ve both got CD’s energy for sure!
…STILL walking with Ms Sweetness Summer!!!
Marty,
Thanks for kind words and much love to you as well.
Hehe, darn spell correct!
And I don’t know who misses who more!!!!
Thanks for the update, you know you’ve been in my thought so often, but didn’t want to bother you! I really miss you too! You look so great Heather! Glad to hear that you and Summer have been able to spend time going out walking together. I’m sending lots of love and will pray that this next month goes really well for you and the twins! I look forward to the next update!
Thanks so much Cherie. The love and prayers are much appreciated.
I think and pray for you and your growing family often. I was in Nashville a month ago and looked for you LOL.. every pregnant woman I saw got the “once over”.. you just never know. I am sooooo glad you’re doing well and that you gave us a glimpse of you AND a recipe! YEAH!!
Annie, thanks so much for your prayers. That is so funny you were looking out for me. If you’re ever in town again, please shoot me an email. Would love to meet up. Hope you enjoyed your time here!
aww! you are looking so great! 3 to 4 weeks is so soon, that is wonderful
How does it feel to get to end the pregnancy a little bit earlier than with Summer? Sounds good to me! Thinking happy thoughts for the next few weeks!
Natalie,
I’m hoping the twins stay in as long as possible for their own sake, but I must say, I don’t think I could ever make it to 40 weeks with all these kicks. I’m pretty grateful twins arrive early as I just don’t think there is much more room for them in there. Hope you are feeling well yourself!
So good to hear from you! You look wonderful! Twins are the most amazing thing ever! Enjoy them. Our twin boys just turned 7 on the 24th of May. How did seven years go by so fast!?! Enjoy the last few weeks of your pregnancy. Thanks for keeping us updated.
By the way, that quinoa and broccoli looks AMAZING!
Melissa,
I only hear good things about being a mama to twins, and it just makes me so happy. Happy (belated) Birthday to your boys. It does go by fast, no?
I never wanted twins – it sounded like too much work! But it was sooo much easier than I expected. They are our 6th & 7th kids, and it still was easier than I thought it would be! They are the biggest blessing. I love watching them together. Y’all are going to have the best time!
Melissa,
I know – I pretty much freaked out at our 6-week ultrasound. I was excited and very happy at the thought of two babies but also completely overwhelmed thinking about how much work it would be. Thanks so much for the encouragement – I can’t wait to see our little ones playing together.
You look amazing Heather! Amazing. I can’t believe you are 32 weeks already.
So glad you are doing well. It’s good to “see” you!
Thanks Ameena. Honestly, I can’t believe I’m 32 weeks along either. They’ll be here so soon!
What a wonderful surprise to see your post in my email! You look terrific. Good luck and look forward to more updates!
Thanks Help4NewMoms!
yaay!
Hi Heather,
It’s wonderful to hear from you and know that all is well! Thanks for the update. Miss your posts but am glad that you are looking terrific. take care and wishing you a very smooth pregnancy!
Hope to hear more good news soon!
Be praying for you and your family!
Thanks so much Lena. I miss you guys too and hope to get back to posting someday.
Not sure what motivated me to check your blog today (May 27th). So glad I did as it was nice to see you and read your update. You look superb and I am glad to hear that all is going well. You are missed… Selfishly, I hope you return to active blogging again.
You and yours are in my thoughts and prayers all the time Heather. Be well.
Thanks Anita.
Sooooo happy to see a post and update from you Heather!!
And you look AMAZING girl, what a beautiful pregnant woman you are, once again!!
Please keep us posted when the twins arrive, I am sure your readers are all cheering for you all during this pregnancy!
Hugs,
Ana
Thanks so much Ana, and yes, I promise an update when the twins arrive. Thanks for all the love and support.
Omgosh, I can’t believe you posted an update, I have visited your blog for a few times a month to see if you have something new to share with us, and am so happy to see everything is well
You look beautiful
Thanks so much Marina and thanks for checking in. I promise another update when the twins arrive.
You look amazing! I was as 60 inches around and I am only 5’4″ tall! Enjoy every second! Write a short note to yourself every day! Or try…I made it about the first 6 months!
My son was 7.6 and my daughter was 5.10, 13 lbs of baby! I did not look like you:) I am now 55 and the twins are 24, life is good!
Kay,
Oh my goodness – 60 inches! You must have been quite uncomfortable those last few weeks, but that’s awesome your babies were such healthy weights. I’m hoping/praying for the same!
Heather!
I am just reading your blog since the very first postt!
The last week I’ve been reading day by day… (and drooling – watching all those yummy foods!!!)
You look amazing…So good to hear you healthy, happy and twins are healthy… Thank you for this email, it TOTALLY made my day!!!!
Love to your family and doggies,
Tita from Slovenia
Tita,
Oh goodness – all those old posts. Definitely some drool-worthy recipes, and definitely some NOT so photogenic meals in my archives. Ha! Happy to hear you’re enjoying them none the less.
Much love to you as well my friend.
I’m so glad to hear from you! You look completely wonderful
I’m so glad it’s all going well. I can’t wait to hear about how it goes with you and your twins
Thanks so much Sylvia.
heab! you have the TINIEST belly ever for twins. where are you hiding them?! glad to hear you are doing well! best wishes for your last few weeks! x
Melissa,
You’re too kind – trust me, there are two in there. The girl is hiding up under my ribs, and the boy is enjoying bouncing around on my uterus. It’s one big dance party in my belly every night.
Miss you, and I hope all is well!
Hey gorgeous mama, you look great. Was a nice surprise this morning to check on you and see an update. We miss you too! Can’t wait to meet the twins! Continue taking excellent care of you and them!
Hi Nolita,
Thanks so much – we can’t wait to meet them either!
So nice to hear that you’re doing well!
Thanks Samantha.
Hi Heather,
When you do return to active blogging, will your inaugural post be a “Pancake Sunday”. Boy, I sure miss those…
Be well! Howard
Howard,
Haha – I will do my best to coordinate the twins’ birth announcement with a pancake post.
So good to hear from you! You look amazing for 31 weeks and I wish you the best for the remainder of your pregnancy.
Take care!!!!
~Rebecca
Thanks so much Rebecca.
Thanks so much for the update, Heather! I’ve been visiting your recipe site quite a lot lately … and today I thought of you and clicked on your website – and yay, there’s an update!
So happy that everything is going well – all the best for the rest of the pregnancy & the birth of the twins!
chocolate hug from Germany!
Marie-Sophie
Thanks so much Marie-Sophie. Next time I enjoy some chocolate, I will think of you…so probably about 5 minutes from now.
Happy to hear you’re enjoying some of my recipes!
So happy to see a post from you and glad to see you are doing so well. Very excited for you guys! Miss your posts and best of luck in the next few weeks
Thanks so much Syndie. We’re excited too.
Just had to post a comment for old times sake.
You look fantastic, ma lady! (in my best/worst Irish accent)
Thanks Scott! Hope you guys had a good time at the lake this weekend. Miss you both!
You look amazing as always! I’m so glad things are going well, that you are feeling better and you have found some interest in cooking (and eating) again! We were in TN this weekend and while the weather was beautiful, it was HOT! I hope you had a great weekend! Hugs to you!
Sarena,

Xiao Chen had already accomplished something to the equivalent of the first and second layer of the Dragon and Tiger Body Sculpting Art, 'Strong and Healthy Body, Great Increase in Qi and blood' and 'Birth of Divine Strength, Cutting Mountains and Splitting Stone'
So, when he cultivated the Dragon and Tiger Body Sculpting Art he did not run into any barriers. He was able to immediately cultivate it to the second layer. Then, he started to cultivate it to the third layer-Tiger Roar Shaking Forest, Dominating Hundred Beasts.
Cultivation Techniques were different from Martial Techniques. They do not require high comprehension abilities; one only needed to follow the method. Having a good quality body was what people referred to having good aptitude. Those with good aptitude would be able to cultivate very quickly one with poor aptitude would be slower.
After seven days, Xiao Chen finally cultivated the Dragon and Tiger Body Sculpting Art to the third layer. The main reason Xiao Chen's cultivation was so fast was that he had previously laid good foundations for his physical body. If a regular person cultivated this, no matter how good their aptitude was, it would take them at least a month.
After the Dragon and Tiger Body Sculpting Art was cultivated to the third layer, Xiao Chen only needed to circulate the Cultivation Technique and his bones would give off a 'pi li pa la' sound. The muscles of his four limbs had a reserved appearance, but they were filled with explosive power.
When Xiao Chen punched out, aside from wind coming from his fist, there was a tiger's roar. The roar was loud and long; it was very energetic. It was like there was really a tiger roaring and shaking the forest with it, hundreds of beasts dominated with none daring to challenge it.
When the third layer was achieved, there was an objective benefit. Xiao Chen's strength had increased by another 500 kilograms. His full-powered strike could achieve 4,000 kilograms of force.
The fourth acupoint on his arm, the Neiguan Acupoint, also instantly opened.
After this, Xiao Chen spent one day to solidify the foundations of the Dragon and Tiger Body Sculpting Art. Only then did he start practicing the Inferior Grade Earth Ranked Fist Technique-Great Dragon Tiger Fist.
Martial Techniques were different from Cultivation Techniques; they relied on one's comprehension abilities. One had to think about it in order to comprehend the essence of the Martial Technique and bring out its complete might.
The first move of the Great Dragon Tiger Fist was Fierce Tiger Leaving the Mountains. Xiao Chen had never see a true fierce tiger before. He was unable to understand the movements and aura of a fierce tiger. As a result, as he practiced it, he felt it was not progressing smoothly.
Xiao Chen thought for a while, and he remembered that after coming to this underground world, in the first forest he came across, he had seen the Rank 5 Spirit Beast-Raging Flame Tiger in the depths of that forest.
Xiao Chen used the Gravity Spell and started to look everywhere. When he was in the air, he heard a resounding roar.
After he rushed over, Xiao Chen was pleased to discover that it was a Raging Flame Tiger hunting for food.
A day went by, but Xiao Chen did nothing. He only stayed in the distance and observed every move of the Raging Flame Tiger.
Two days went by.
Three days went by...
In the blink of an eye, Xiao Chen had lingered in this forest for seven days. Like the first day, Xiao Chen did nothing. He only observed the lifestyle of the Raging Flame Tiger, every move it made.
He seem to have gone mad as if he turned into a Raging Flame Tiger. Great Dragon Tiger Fist? Fierce Tiger Leaving the Mountains? He had long since forgotten about all of these.
On this particular afternoon, Xiao Chen, who went mad for a week, suddenly roared loudly. He leaped down from the top of a tree, as though he was a huge tiger, pouncing. All the creatures were startled; groups of birds flew from the trees.
Xiao Chen punched out in midair. Before his fist could reach the ground, an intense wind from his fist blew away all the loose leaves on the ground. The air was filled with leaves being blown around. Eventually, he landed.
In the next instant...
There was a loud sound, a large pit 20 meters in diameter appeared on the ground. Countless piece of dirt flew into the air, covering the sky. Then they fell like hail.
"Hu!" Just at this moment there was a huge gust of wind. The pieces of dirt and stone in the air turned to dust when blown. It turned out that Xiao Chen's punch had reached a point where he understood the fine details of the technique. These pieces of dirt and stone were all destroyed from the inside.
Going mad for a week and instantly comprehending it, this was the first move of the Inferior Grade Earth Ranked Fist Technique-Fierce Tiger Leaving the Mountains. In the end, Xiao Chen
Xiao Chen withdrew his fist and stood straight. He used his Essence and gently jolted off the dust that landed on him. He revealed a smile filled with joy. The might of an Inferior Grade Martial Technique was indeed extraordinary.
Now that he learned this move, he would have another trump card for when he was in close combat, aside from the Inclined Body Strike. This way, he could exhibit the advantages of his physical body.
Underground world, natural herb field:
Xiao Chen hid in a thick bush, withdrawing all his aura. He stared at a Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape 500 meters in front of him.
The Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape was a peak Rank 5 Spirit Beast. It was equivalent to a peak Martial Saint. It was a primate type Spirit Beasts. Its intelligence was much higher compared to most other Spirit Beasts.
It had a horrifying strength, was quick-witted, and intelligent. The Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape was difficult to deal with.
There was a stalk of nearly three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi. It was a herb that nourished the body greatly. A three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi would be sufficient for Xiao Chen to train with for a period of time. It would be able to strengthen him by another 250 kilograms. Xiao Chen was very tempted by it.
The second move of the Fierce Tiger Leaving the Mountains, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was a type of defensive Martial Technique. Like before, he would not able to comprehend it in a short amount of time. So, Xiao Chen temporarily gave it up. He went back to his original plan of searching for herbs that could strengthen his blood and Qi.
The three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi was his first target.
The Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape was about five meters tall when it stood straight. It patrolled around the surroundings of the Blood Lingzhi cautiously. Its bloodshot eyes stared at its surroundings with murderous intent.
Under the influence of the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape's strong aura, a few Rank 5 Spirit Beast eyeing the Blood Lingzhi fled far away.
Xiao Chen had already remained here for two days. He personally saw a peak Rank 4 Spirit Beast-Silver Winged Wolf be torn in half by the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape's bare hands. The scene of blood splattering everywhere was extremely cruel.
Xiao Chen observed every fight the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape had been in for two days. This allow Xiao Chen to gain a good understanding of its strength.
The Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape mainly relied on its keen senses, its speed, its arms which contained close to 5,000 kilograms of force, as well as its red fur, which was as hard as steel; regular blades would not be able to slice it apart.
Xiao Chen calculated carefully. If he relied on the strength of his physical body, he only had a fifty percent chance of success. However, when he included his various Martial Techniques, Movement Techniques, and the Purple Thunder True Fire, his chances were increased to seventy percent.
Xiao Chen scooped up a small amount of dirt from the bottom of the bush. With a thought from Xiao Chen, he executed the Life Bestowal Spell. The loose dirt emitted a light; after a while, it turned into a small bird, which flew out.
With Xiao Chen's current cultivation, he could use anything to execute the Life Bestowal Spell to make some small animals. However, something that could be used in fight would still required objects that contained Spiritual Energy as their base.
The small bird circled in the sky before he flew towards the Blood Lingzhi behind the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape. After it flew past the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape, it dove down at the Blood Lingzhi, rushing towards it.
The Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape had a very similar face to humans. The corners of its lips curled up and revealed a horrifying smile. He leaped up gently and turned into a scarlet flash, heading for the small bird.
"Pa!"
When the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape swung its arm in the air with great force, one could see a faint ripple appearing in the air. However, the small bird seemed to have anticipated it and had flown higher, dodging its palm.
Xiao Chen smiled faintly. After two days of observation, he was very familiar with how high the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape could jump; whether be it a gentle leap, a leap with some effort, or a full-powered leap.
The small bird dodged continuously. The Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape felt provoked and was completely furious. It chased the small bird as the it flew towards the bush where Xiao Chen was hiding.
"Pa! Pa!"
The Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape leaped with all its might; its body flew about fifty meters in the air. Its speed reached its peak, only a red flash could be seen. The small bird could not dodge in time and was smashed into mush.
"Pu Ci!"
Just as the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape was feeling satisfied and was about to land, Xiao Chen leaped out from the bush. He roared loudly, as though he were possessed by a tiger. He pounced towards the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape.
Xiao Chen timed this fist very well. It was right after the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape made a full-powered leap and was in the midst of landing.
It could not move in the air. There was no way for it to dodge Xiao Chen's sudden attack.
"Bang!"
The huge body of the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape was knocked back by this punch. It reacted very quickly by somersaulting in midair. It landed on its four limbs and skidded several meters before it managed to stabilize its body.
"Zi Zi!"
There were deep gorges left in the ground when the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Apes' four limbs tried to grab the ground, causing dust to fly everywhere.
Xiao Chen did not stop to think; he did not care whether the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape was injured or not, or how injured it was. In the instant after he punched, he chased after the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape, quickly rushing over.
"Shua!"
The instant the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape landed on the ground, a human figure pierced through the cloud of dust. With a 'hu xiao' sound, the dust was blown away. The images of fists appeared, punching toward the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape.
"Bang! Bang! Bang!"
The Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape, which already stood up, moved its arms very quickly; it was so fast, it could not be seen. It blocked Xiao Chen's punches. One man and one beast... they were fighting in the most primitive way in an open area.
There were no fancy Martial Techniques, only the images of fists flying, creating shockwaves. The two figures flickered around; they were so fast only shadows could be seen.
"Wu!"
The Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape roared angrily. Its red right hand emitted a scarlet light. Its speed and strength doubled instantly.
"Fierce Tiger Leaving the Mountains!"
Xiao Chen roared loudly as he circulated the Dragon and Tiger Body Sculpting Art. There were cracking sounds coming from his bones. His strength instantly increased by 20 percent, reaching 5,000 kilograms. The Qi and blood in his entire body were surging, burning hot.
Xiao Chen turned into a ferocious tiger and welcome the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape's huge red hand without fear.
In the next instant, the two fists met and gave off a loud sound. That was a total of almost 10,000 kilograms of force. There was an explosion in the air; it sounded like a clap of thunder. The entire natural herb field trembled.
If someone saw this, they would laugh at Xiao Chen for competing his strength against a Spirit Beast. Everyone knew the quality of a beast's body was better than humans, be it recovery or strength.
They were of different races; naturally they had different advantages. Going against these Spirit beasts that relied on strength, most cultivators would use techniques to obtain victory. No one would be silly enough to compete in strength.
"Sou! Sou! Sou!"
Several Spirit Beasts rushed over from a distance. They waited somewhere nearby, watching Xiao Chen and the Blood-Thirsty Demonic Ape fight.
These Spirit Beasts were not foolish either. They were waiting until the both of them were injured so they could take advantage of the opportunity to obtain the three-hundred-year-old Blood Lingzhi.
After receiving an attack, blood leaked from the corner of Xiao Chen's mouth. He retreated backward by ten steps. Every step would leave a deep footprint.

Previous｜ NextFor those of you that read this blog on a regular basis, you know I have been working on getting vegetables to grow for the past several Summers. Our Summer garden was a bust. I did get to eat one tomato and something else ate the others. Same with the cucumbers. The biggest issue in the summer, is not only the heat, but the bugs that eat the plants. Since I am trying to grow without the use of pesticides it is quite a challenge. So, I decided we could try a Winter garden, when most of the insects and other pests are hibernating. I will tell you about each item below. I did not take pictures of our flowers, but most of them are thriving quite nicely. If I did not mention in previous posts, any natural garbage, like peelings, coffee grounds, etc, I save and then toss around the bases of the plants. This adds much needed nutrients to our awful dirt, without any added expense. Roses especially need extra potassium so potato peels and banana peels are awesome for them. We also have a rabbit, some of you know that, and when we dump his potty pan, we use it as a fertilizer for the plants. This actually works quite awesome., December 29, 2012

Polling indicates that 74 percent of Utahns want to host another Olympics. Herbert said it would strengthen Utah’s image as a winter sports capital, and would be a fiscally responsible choice for the state and the country, since the venues are already built. Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker said Utah may be viewed favorably by the International Committee because of its compactness and minimal carbon footprint.
“Not only do we have an urban area to be able to host the quality and the size of what’s needed today and going forward, but we have the capacity to do it in a way that minimizes the impact on the environment, and allows us to look at how we can enhance our own position going forward,” said Becker.
But before Utah can pursue a bid, the US Olympic Committee has to decide whether it will pursue the Summer Games in 2024 or the Winter Games in 2026. Fraser Bullock is on Utah’s Olympic Exploratory Committee for Utah, and played a large role in mounting 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake. He told KUER that the US would probably prefer the Summer Games, but it might be prohibitively expensive.
“Will a US city step up to 5 or 10 billion dollars to host a games, particularly in today’s economic environment ? That’s the challenge,” said Bullock, “And so if that doesn’t work, obviously we turn to a winter games that can be hosted reasonably, economically, and very successfully here in Utah.”
According to Bullock, the US Olympic Committee should make a decision early next year.Image Unavailable

We can all breathe a sigh of relief, as Facebook did not introduce yet another site redesign today. Instead, the Palo Alto, Calif., social network led off its announcements with something far more useful -- an option to take your data with you.
Company founder Mark Zuckerberg's blog post lays out what you'll be able to download as this option rolls out:
"..we've built an easy way to quickly download to your computer everything you've ever posted on Facebook and all your correspondences with friends: your messages, Wall posts, photos, status updates and profile information."
After you pass some security checks, you'll get a compressed .zip file on your desktop, which you can extract to peruse its contents in a Web browser.. It should be axiomatic that when you put data in, you should be able to get it out, but too many Web services, and disk-based programs, fail to include an "export" function.
(Now that I've paid all those compliments to Facebook, remember our conflicts of interest: Post Co. Chairman Donald E. Graham sits on Facebook's board of directors, while the newspaper and many on the Post staff, myself included, use the site for marketing purposes.)
The second-most important shift at Facebook is a new Groups feature, rolling out over the next few days.). You can then share updates, pictures and video; work together on notes; and chat in real-time with all or part of the group.
Facebook's older groups option -- long the favorite vehicle for users to kvetch about new site features or policies -- will continue to be available, but it won't benefit from such new features as group chatting. The site now suggests that you set up a public page for larger virtual gatherings and congregations.
But Groups might not be all collaborative, clubby goodness. At their worst, they could combine the run-on chattiness of an e-mail thread among friends with the privacy issues you fear when friends tag you in photos, video and notes. And since your friends can not only add you to groups (subject to your veto) but add pals to the groups you create, they could get a little spammy over time.
Facebook's third feature is a new dashboard to monitor the applications you've added to your profile. Zuckerberg's blog post explains:
"You can also see in detail when they last accessed your data. You can change the settings for an application to make less information available to it, or you can even remove it completely."
That seems useful, too. But it's not nearly as important as Facebook making the concept of "you own your data" more than a well-meaning line in a user agreement.
What's your read on the news? Do you trust Facebook more or less as a result?

You didn't say whether the data you download is actually deleted, or if you just get a copy. It seems the point would be to delete it as well, but that was not specifically mentioned by Zuckerberg in the quote, or by you.
And you know what they say about assuming.

Sorry, I've had leaving facebook, and whether your data can be removed when you do, on my mind. If migrating your data is the purpose, then good, but still not good for those of us who might want to be able to know that what we've posted is also gone when we deactivate the account.

Most important for me is to own the list of my friends. That way, I can port to the app that coordinates all my social networks -- FB, MySpace, the Googe thing, and whatever else. I can use the interface I like best, and all my friends can use the interfaces they like best, and every advertiser in the world can still target my computer screen with discounts on exactly what I want to buy now.

I haven't logged on to Facebook in over a month, as I am dismayed by all the privacy setting nonsense.
I don't get the groups/list thing. I mean, I think you explain it well, I just don't want to expend the mental energy to grasp it.

I got excited because according your article it would appear that I could download and subsequently delete my information from Facebook. However, according to Zuckerberg's blogpost it seems that I only receive a copy of said information.
Since I deleted my profile anyway (not deactivated, deleted) I wouldn't be able to recover my information. So all of my messages, photos, wall posts and everything else will eventually be sold to the highest bidder someday or leaked when their servers are compromised.
Got to love it.

@ JoeBrones... your profile is not deleted despite what you think. All the data is still there. It would take a court order to see it tho.
per the article: Zuckerpunk thinks he OWNS our data. THAT is a problem and it needs to be settled by a court!
STOP giving facebook publicity until they start complying to the privacy laws!

While all the other new features on FB seem to be something that should be standard and overdue. I question whether Fb Groups is the solution to Facebooks problem. Facebook is no longer exclusive. Which will eventually lead to its loss of coolness.
Facebook Has Groups…Trying to be Exclusive Again
This article explains why fb needed to create the Groups feature. How they have lost touch over the years because of their growth & how people are using the service different. also because of who is using the service. I guess my question/concern is...is the groups enough? Or is it too late for FB and have they reached there peak in popularity?

Not only do you have to assume that your posts etc are still "there" and archived by F'book forever, you should in fact assume that EVERYTHING you have EVER posted ANYWHERE may very likely be archived someplace. Including email and anything else. And including that it may have been copied or otherwise picked up by who knows while it was posted.
Years ago we used to assume that "we" were far enough "under the radar" that nobody would bother saving all that stuff; memory was expensive, and in any case, who would go searching forever to look for it? Flash forward: memory is dirt cheap, search engines are powerful, and who knows who may have taken an interest in your email or the obscure place where you posted something.
I do have a Facebook account, mostly to keep track of my kids, but I rarely post anything and if I do it is innocuous polite chit-chat.
Best to assume your life is an open book to somebody somewhere, and get used to it.
And BTW you won't find me interested in "cloud computing" either.

So, should anyone else want to attempt making candy corn from the how-to provided by The Harvard Crimson Flyby, here's what I learned:
- If you are using ingredients from the natural foods aisle (eg, not C&H powdered sugar), sift everything really well. I used powdered sugar from Wholesome Sweeteners and powdered milk from Organic Valley. Both of these clump up as a general rule but it's never been a problem with other uses, although those usually involved a mixer. No amount of stirring was able to get this stuff to a completely smooth dough.
So what? If the dough isn't completely smooth, it's a pain to roll out into the long snakey things that is a necessary step to get the traditional three color combination of candy corn.
- There's a lot of hands-on in getting the candy into it's final shape. If you wait until it's well and truly "cool enough to handle", it's firmed up too much. The arm strength needed to roll out the snakes and then squish them together with a rolling pin is more than I have. If you have them, consider some sort of gloves to protect your hands from the heat and get the dough moving before it cools down.
- I'm not sure if the trouble I had getting the three colors to fuse together nicely was a result of the dough having cooled too much or if it had been toughened up due to excessive handling. But I had to wet the sides of my colored snakes of dough to get them to stick, sort of, most of the time.
- If you have one, use a kitchen scale to get your dough division even. I ended up with more orange than the other colors.
- Using "mainstream" sugar may result in a whiter white. My Wholesome Sweeteners Sugar produced a white that's really more tan. And better food coloring might result in brighter colors. I had generic food coloring (usually used around here for coloring eggs) and some higher quality cake decorating colors may produce more vibrant candy.
- Roll your colored snakes out to much less than 1/2 inch in diameter. You'll end up with final candy corn that's a bit more reasonably sized.
You are amazing! It looks like home-made, organic food looks - way more 'real' and 'natural' than picture-perfect factory food. Bravo . . .[Date Index]

Re: Simple Recursive Map
You program it essentially the way you said it, just converting to
Mathematica notation for everything and using n on the left-hand sides
of the recurrence relations instead of n + 1:
Clear[x, y]
x[n_] := x[n] = y[n - 1] - a x[n - 1]^2 - 1
y[n_] := y[n] = b x[n - 1]
x[0] = 1.; y[0] = -1.; a = 0.02; b = 1/3.;
{x[49], y[49]}
{-1.57436, -0.524786}
Notice the (highly recommended) use of "caching" the values -- the
subexpressions x[n_] := x[n] = and similarly for y -- in the recurrence
relations in order to speed up the calculations. Without that,
Mathematica doesn't "remember" the values of x and y when it calculates
them and has to re-calculate them for each subsequent evaluation.

5 hours, 51 apologize if this has already been mentioned. I just received the Beginner Box today and I love it, but I was disappointed that the pre-generated characters did not represent all the races available, even when it covered all the classes. Three humans and an Elf. Come on, you should have made one of those Humans a Dwarf character.
Dwarves have a different base movement rate and special encumbrance rules. The Beginner's Box minimizes complexity by using solely medium races with standard movement.
The iconics are also preexisting characters and the dwarf iconic is not as well suited to Beginning play as the character he would replace in a four person party. Fighters are harder to build than rangers, but easier to play and with pregens building isn't an issue.
The OP does have a valid point in that the BB does include Dwarves, but not as a pregen.
The racial choices are Dwarf, Human, and Elf.
While I understand the use of iconics, it would have made sense to include a dwarf option.
It would have been better than a dual-wielding Valeros who in BB doesn't dual wield. Even one of my players who had zero prior rpg experience asked why all the art shows two weapons but she can't use two weapons.
The iconics aren't really all that Iconic if you are new and don't know their.Translation of Cab Cabron Translation Online Translation > Spanish Translation > Cab Cabron Translation Available on the following languages: English Other languages Cabron More Languages:[top] Cabron Translation On Other Language: Spanish Esperanto Bulgarian Catalan German English Finnish Polish Cabron in Spanish Cornudo.

Proceed with caution. Don’t let that scare you off, this truly is a big piece of my heart that I’m so glad to finally get off of my chest. I said it in last week’s post, but I’ll say it again…nothing about pregnancy and/or postpartum comes easy for me. I don’t cope well with the changes that my body goes through and I’m learning that it’s OK to mourn your pre-pregnancy body and to work really hard to get it back. I gained 40 pounds with each of my pregnancies, but the way that the weight is coming off is looking a lot different this time around. I have to be honest, when women told me “it’s a lot harder the second go round” I would roll my eyes and think “yea ok.” By 3 months PP with my first daughter I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight (I even had the doctor thumb back through my chart to confirm that) and now here I am 3 months PP again and I still have about 15 lbs left to lose. It’s been discouraging and very challenging for me to work through because my business is based around feeling confident…and honestly some days lately I can’t even fake it because I’m just not confident in my own skin. Turn on your JavaScript to view content Track Jacket | Alo Leggings | Sports Bra | Nike Tank | Sneakers | Sunnies (see all RayBan sunnies HERE) I was cleared to workout pretty early on since my post-birth recovery was amazing and I worked out up until the day that I delivered. I started to run again but I truly felt like a wobbly giraffe trying to find her legs. It felt like I was doing more harm than good and, on top of that, the scale didn’t budge. I knew that I needed something different (I’ve been running 8-10 miles a week since college so my body was very used to it) and I knew that I needed to work on my core above all. I had pretty severe diastasis this go round (the separation of your ab muscles), so I wanted that to be the main focus. When I reached out to you guys via Instastories and asked how you got back into shape after baby SO many of your suggested that I try pilates. See all Golden Goose sneakers HERE. I was very curious as to how pilates worked for so many of you guys, as I never really saw it as a viable option for myself. I’m used to heavy heavy cardio based workouts and come from the mindset that if you aren’t dripping sweat by the end of a workout that you really didn’t get a good one in. Thankfully, I kept researching the core principles behind Pilates, because it turns out that it was a perfect fit for me all along! Let me introduce you to IM=X Pilates here in Charlotte (although they have locations across the country as well). IM=X is a boutique pilates studio with a focus on the Pilates reformer (Xerciser) machine. The studio is just right down the street from my house, so after I dropped Landry at camp one day, I decided to check it out. Not going to lie, the machines looked very intimidating at first, especially for a girl who is not used to pilates or group exercise at all. After talking with Laura (the studio owner) at length about my situation and goals, she encouraged me to come in for a free class. One class later and I fell in love with this new way to workout. The Xerciser machines are SO versatile and I got one heck of a full body workout in 55 minutes. The resistance springs and sliding carriage on the machine allow you to isolate different muscle groups, as well as keeping your core engaged for an entire 55 minutes. There’s also a jump board attachment (see a few photos down) that we use for cardio work and even some standing barre moves. I never for the machines to be that versatile…not one class that I’ve been to have we done the same sequence of work…which I love! Best selection of designer activewear HERE. Two things that I should mention that are amazing for everyone, but specifically postpartum moms…there’s a HUGE focus on strengthening your pelvic floor and you are encouraged to breathe using pursed lips. What the heck does this mean?? Well your pelvic floor is also known as your kegel muscles and we all know that those muscles support your uterus and bladder and it’s SO important that you keep them strong, especially after childbirth. The instructor reminds you during each move to focus on your pelvic floor, which is awesome because otherwise I would have never thought to. Pursed lips breathing is a method of breathing where you inhale through your nose and exhale through tightly pressed pursed lips. This type of breathing allows you to engage your deepest abdominal muscles and ensure that your spine is always supported. It’s also allowed me to strengthen my core through each and every exercise during class, which was one of my main goals. Alo Leggings | See all leggings on SALE HERE Laura and I decided to partner and I committed to blogging through my pilates journey! We are so confident that 3 months of hard work at IM=X will completely re-sculpt my postpartum body and I’m so excited to share it all with you guys. I’ve been at it for 3 weeks now and can already start to see the results, which is thrilling! Pilates has a long standing motto of: “10 sessions, you FEEL better, 20 sessions you LOOK better and 30 sessions you have a completely new body” What I love is that it’s pushing me out of my comfort zone and I’m working new muscles groups that I otherwise would not have done on my own. IM=X also offers TRX classes AND combination classes, so I’m able to get a wide variety of work in during the week to switch things up and confuse my muscles. Ideally during the past 3 weeks I like to get in at least (2) Xerciser classes, (1) TRX class and (1) interval class, which gives me an amazing variety! I will also add that the instructors have been amazing and call each client out by name during class. It’s always felt so personal and friendly in the studio, making it a lot ea Ok ladies, here goes…me being as vulnerable as possible to stay true to this journey. Here are my before photos. 11 weeks postpartum and 15 lbs over my ideal weight. Raw and real…and terrifying. *Please don’t take these the wrong way. I by NO means think that I am overweight and I fully appreciate that my body gave me two beautiful daughters. I’m thankful for every extra ounce if it means that Lawson is happy and healthy. This is a journey about being strong and healthy and, most importantly CONFIDENT and happy! My arms are never my problem area, but they’ve lost all tone. I’m ready to sculpt them back into shape!

Height: 5’9 Starting weight: July 1 | 157 Current weight: July 19 | 154 (already down 3 lbs!) I want to focus a lot less on the scale and a lot more on muscle tone and definition.

The Bread Manufacturing industry has been faced with challenges, beginning with the low-carbohydrate craze generated by the Atkins Diet in the early 1990s. However, the emergence of the health- and nutrition-conscious consumer, driven by timely and clever product innovation, has stimulated demand for bread and bakery products over the past decade. For these reasons, industry research firm IBISWorld has updated its report on the Bread Manufacturing industry in Australia.
Melbourne, Australia (PRWEB) October 26, 2012
The Bread Manufacturing industry in Australia has been faced with challenges,%. The existence of a large number of small and medium-size establishments (such as retail and specialty bakeries), combined with mostly homogenous products and a high level of competition, has caused industry profitability to decline. According to IBISWorld Industry analyst Naren Sivasailam, “fierce volatility in commodity prices over the past five years has dampened industry growth prospects and squeezed profit margins”. However, the industry's major players have been able to post revenue growth due to the strength and longevity of their brands. Despite the use of labour-intensive production methods, the ratio of wages to revenue has declined steadily as the result of rising automation and capital investment across the industry.
The prospects of the industry, modest as they may be, do present some niche growth opportunities. The functional and fortified bread segment is expected to drive demand as consumers become increasingly time-poor and health-conscious. Wholegrain and fruit- or nut-infused variations of traditional bread and bakery products will also be popular. “The increase in demand for specialty breads will drive growth in niche and artisan bakeries over the next five years”, says Sivasailam. IBISWorld forecasts that industry revenue will grow over the next five years.
The Bread Manufacturing industry in Australia is typified by a medium level of market share concentration. The industry is dominated by its two largest players: Goodman Fielder and George Weston Foods (Food Investments). Concentration increased as a result of increased growth for some major players and an increase in merger and acquisition activity. However, increasingly uncertain operating conditions have caused the major players to scale down their operations, and the industry has returned to being more fragmented.

Creekside Camping(NNPA)—Dear Gwendolyn:
Last year I met a wonderful man and we started dating. I love him and he has asked for my hand in marriage. I have never been married and at times lost all hope in doing so. I am 78 and he is 86. We both reside at a nursing home with assisted living. We each have our separate semi-apartment, but I often find myself late at night tipping to spend the night with him. That is, providing the nurses at the medical station are not being alert on duty.
I said all that to say this: He has terrible bad breath. How can I tell him that his breath stinks? I don’t want to lose him. After all, at 78 you don’t get proposals.— Susan
Dear Susan:
I knew you were elderly before you mentioned your age. Not many young ladies today refer to “he has asked for my hand in marriage.” My hand? However, I am delighted to know you are happy and that’s all that matters.
As to his halitosis, have the facility’s doctor treat him for the problem. If you choose, ask the doctor to not reveal you were the person concerned. In the meantime, you need to have a broader knowledge of the problem. (Read “Curing Halitosis the Natural Way” by Chin Chun Wu—Copyright 2011. Kindle eBooks)
Let me tell you this: As to tipping to his room late at night, why? It is nice to enjoy the closeness of someone at any age. But think about it. Maintenance, such as mopping floors, is done while residents are asleep. Girl, stay in your room so that you will not fall and become injured. Whatever he whispers in your ear at late night can be said—come morning.

Cherwell District Council is hosting events in Banbury (Monday), Kidlington (Tuesday), and Bicester on Wednesday, to promote the message that good meal planning can help the planet and the purse.
Debbie Pickford NNL-151130-151706001
Making the most of recycling services will be the team’s other key message, reinforced by a series of promotions. These include free bags for life to help people sort their recycling and tea towels printed with thrifty kitchen tips, free to the first 50 householders who pledge to reduce their waste.
Cllr Debbie Pickford, Cherwell’s lead member for clean and green, said: “These events are a great way to learn more about how reducing the amount of food thrown away.
“In Cherwell we discard over 5,000 tonnes of edible food per year, the equivalent of nine jumbo jets. That’s a waste of money for our residents, putting a strain both on our recycling services, and the planet.
“Our green team will be sharing some brilliant, often surprising tips on how people can make their grocery bills go further, including everything from lemon sauce to pizza toppings.”
Residents are invited to talk to council officers about food waste and the council’s waste and recycling services at the three events, which take place at branches of Sainsbury’s across the district. The events take place from 10am-1pm.JBU Tops U.S. News’ Best Value List
SILOAM SPRINGS, Ark. (September 12, 2012) - John..While there are a host of bands taking the whole compound word craze a little too far, not to mention a growing number of so-called brutal acts whose band and song titles border on blatant self-parody, this does not necessarily lead to an all out impoverished experience musically. In particular, Perth has seen the rise of a recent storm of notes and shouts that I will simply refer to as DFC (the band's full name reeks of reaching for shock when there is no more shock to be had), with a slightly better album title in "Ungodly Violation" and a decent musician set to back up the lofty claim. The lyrics generally consist of the usual attempts at shocking senses and sensibilities that goes with brutal territory, but that is where the typical nature of things here terminates.
DFC can't be described solely as a technical band, nor a typical brutal/slam act for that matter, but there are plenty of indications that both styles have had an impact on the resulting sound. There is a level of randomness to some of the riffs that filter in and out of the asymmetrical songwriting going on here that definitely points at the mathcore side of the grind equation, though it never quite crosses into the quirky territory that goes with earlier works out of The Dillinger Escape Plan. But for the most part, the influences are fairly multifaceted and include a good helping of Cryptopsy influenced technical wonderment and the flesh ripping, machine-gun character of The Berserker. All the while, vocalist Blake Simpson comes off as a nasty mixture of traditional Chris Barnes worship and some occasional Lord Worm shrieks, sounding a bit more human and methodical in contrast to the incomprehensible pig-squeals and guttural belches that tend to go with this style.
There are a number of individual points on this album that could be pointed to as highlights for their auspicious usage of virtuosic drum, bass and guitar work, much of it localized on longer songs. The brooding stops, starts, and frequent sweeps of the lead guitar on "Chemical Castration" are equally as impressive as the spoken words that kicks the song off are appalling. "Rectal Gorge" also takes some impressive strides in the technical department, reminding heavily of mid-90s Cryptopsy revisited with a slightly more mechanistic production. But the end all, be all of this album is the closing song "Beset By Rapists" which essentially functions as a demonstration of every member's abilities, though the bass particularly shines on this one with a number of frequent and fleeting solo sections that are, again, heavily reminiscent of early Cryptopsy.
As with any death/grind offering, this one comes loaded with a lot of over-the-top content baggage that generally functions as little more than a random museum of horrors, though some implicit statement might be lurking beneath the gore and depravity. Anyone who had their gag-reflex tested during the 2002 film "Irreversible" may want to skip the last couple minutes of this thing as it's one of the few moments on this album where things actually get disturbing enough to illicit the sort of revulsion that the rest of this album was going for. Otherwise, the true punch of this album is found in the musical performance, with DFC proving to be a cut above the rest at their instruments. Anyone who wants to hear what Brain Drill would sound like with a bit more tact and subtlety should definitely check this out.I love the first snow of the season. And the second. And third.
So get out your shovels, snow blowers and Aleve and keep an eye out for those first flakes of winter. Technically, it’s not winter until December 21st, but tell that to anyone who enjoyed the April Fools’ Day storm in 1997.
Of course, Cape Cod’s biggest snow storm in recent years blasted us on Sunday, January 23, 2005. We were to host a Patriots playoff party that afternoon, but ended up watching the game by ourselves in the cozy confines of our soon-to-be igloo.
The next morning, I struggled to peer out the windows to size up the previous night’s winter tidings, but every window was nearly opaque with snow and ice and steamed up instantly with my breath. I proceeded to the front door and very carefully opened it, just a crack, to survey the accumulation.
What I saw, instead, was a wall of snow that covered the entire doorway. That was a tad unsettling, knowing that the rest of our exit doors had attached screens that swung out. How, exactly, were we going to get out?
I pulled the snow shovel from the coat closet and slowly opened the door enough to start pushing the snow away at the top of the doorframe. In a few minutes I had cleared the doorway and our impatient black lab, Maggie, dashed out to relieve herself. Only she completely disappeared into the snowdrift and was unable to move.
I continued to shovel out to where she had vanished and uncovered a wagging tail attached to an embarrassed, 75-pound coal black dog statue. Turns out that I was the black Labrador retriever this morning, not her.
With three feet of snow and twelve-foot snowdrifts, it was a morning I’ll never forget. I dug a series of trenches for Maggie so she could do her business without fear of becoming a popsicle. I also dug a walkway out to the SUV, which we had cleverly parked in the driveway close to the street. After the plow driver came by, we only had about five feet of snow to shovel from behind the car to access the street.
By 10:00 a.m., we were able to make it out of the neighborhood and get to the office. Many other people, I acknowledge, were stuck for up to three days, due to the shortage of heavy plow trucks. The normal fleet of private snow plowers, operating their half-ton and three-quarter-ton pickup trucks, were useless in over 30 inches of snow.
The office temperature (inside) was 37 degrees Fahrenheit (see Taking The Temperature of Danny G. for an explanation of the competing temperature scales). Snow had covered the exhaust vent pipe and caused the heater to shut down. So, rather than balancing debits and credits with our frosty number two pencils, we went for a ride to see the storm’s aftermath and shot the pictures that follow.
Although, as an elected town official, I’m concerned about the stress such storms put on our budget, there’s a little voice in my head (among several, unfortunately) that says “I wonder what a 4-foot snow storm would be like…”
I used to have a black lab named Maggie :).
The budget being what it is(n't), I'd just as soon go snowless this year... still, the occasional big storm can definitely be fun. Must be something to live in a place where a 3-4 foot storm is routine.
How about that, sandy shoes? Maggie's AKC name was Margarita La Brea (after the La Brea tar pits). I've always named my dogs people names. Emily, Hazel, Maggie. That has led me to calling my two girls by the dog's name on many occasions. I doubt that I would've accidentally called Gayle "Rover" or "Fido."Java course in Ahmedabad makes candidates technically very sound.

According to Guinness editor Gaz Deaves, Eliot's surprised everyone, stealing the record out from under Super vs. Battle 2009 champion Phil "Dinosaur" Mackenzie.
"It was certainly a dramatic few hours. With Dinosaur's epic win at the Super vs. Battle this year we were expecting him to walk away with the record, so when Eliot KO'd him in the third round we almost couldn't believe what we were seeing. Overall the standard of play was very high, with Eliot clearly the strongest on the day."

Two of them are Nelson Mandela and Gandhi. One many have heard about, and the other some might not have heard about. However, they both are well-known for many of their good deeds. After reading this article, you should have a better understanding about both these men and what they are known for, and how these two go together. At this moment in time, some might have little information about them. Here are some of highlights you may or may not know, but still remember that each man was great in his own way.
They were both leaders, but in different areas. Gandhi was a leader of India. Nelson Mandela was a leader of South Africa. However, both of them have South Africa in common as Gandhi followed his sense of morality to become a political activist and champion of non-violent revolution in South Africa for the Indians living there, after he saw how they were treated when he went to practice law in South Africa. He was only visiting in South Africa at the age of 24 when he was treated with extreme prejudice. He then extended his stay as he saw terrible injustice and felt compelled to begin a political party in 1894 to represent the Indians living there. Eventually, the South African government struck a compromise with him. He promoted peace in South Africa as well at home in India and politically was very much a catalyst to galvanizing the entire country of India together to practice a non-violent revolution against the oppressive British Army ruling over them in India. For this, for the freedom India attained as a consequence and for mindfulness he promoted and encouraged, many Indians worship him. Mandela started out adopting Gandhi’s peaceful ways but along the way adopted violent measures, only to return to the peaceful practices we are familiar with today.
Both Nelson Mandela and Gandhi are well-known in their countries as very honorable men for the changes they made. Both of them worked to change their countries for the better. Gandhi is thought to be an icon of peace in his country. Some Indians, however, do not agree with his decision to go along with splitting India into two countries, namely India and Pakistan. While Nelson Mandela was given his own honorary title after he had become President of South Africa.
Both Nelson Mandela and Gandhi had seen the discrimination that went on in South Africa. Nelson Mandela had a hand as well as Gandhi to see a reconciliation of the people in South African and the Indians there. While Gandhi achieved success in leading the Indian people of India, Nelson Mandela fought for his native South African people. However, as both fought in their own times, each finally came to an agreement with the ruling party in their own lands. For Mandela, this reconciliation didn't happen until after his 27 year imprisonment. Both of these men also worked, once they had reconciled, to bring more things to light in their countries and try to come to some tangible conclusions to help their people.
Both men are noteworthy. One had some problems before he became the man he is known as today. However, both men also worked long after they were in their prime years. Gandhi's legend is said to be one that many people think back on reverently. However, many have never heard of Nelson Mandela. Those who have heard of Nelson Mandela often know only of the his anti-apartheid movement.

Yoplait is a brand that I love and trust. You can say that we have a relationship, because it's the main brand that my family buys when shopping for yogurt. When My Blog Spark asked me if I wanted to try out the new Yoplait Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothie mix, I just had to take the offer.
When we went shopping for it the first time, it was all sold out, so we decided we'd try the Triple Berry Smoothie. My husband and I tried it and we were really impressed with the taste. It was really good, but our kids were a little jealous because they wanted to try it out too....I mean who doesn't like smoothies right? When we picked up the Yoplait Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothie mix, I made sure the kids knew that they would be able to try it along with us. And they did. And they really liked it. My entire family liked it.
When I opened the package, the flavor just jumped out at me. I knew I was really going to like it and could hardly wait to try it. It's really simple to make. All you have to do is add the contents of the package and 1 cup of milk into a blender and in about a minute you've got something wonderful. It's a great way to get a full serving of fruit and only has 110-120 calories per serving. I would love to be able to try the Yoplait Mango Pineapple next!
I am so excited to be able to offer a prize pack which includes two free product coupons and a blender to one of you!

This is the coaches portion. Sorry it is so late. I'm probably not breaking any new ground here. Got caught up in the On Iowa Live show last night, which was a ton of fun out at Fieldhouse Southwest. Thanks to Mark Dukes for having us out there. The food smelled great, which had a guy who only at a Milky Way and a bag of chips to that point, drooling.
This is Kirk Ferentz inside and in a suit.
Going into his 14th season at Iowa, Ferentz says this will be one of his yougest teams. He brings up some names on the defensive line. Ferentz also talks about "piecing together" the running back position. And catching the ball is "part of the equation." Coordinator questions, too.
Quick run down of young defensive line, which, I think, is the major storyline for 2012. If it works, wow. Ferentz also talks in general about the freshman class. There's also more coordinator questions.
First-year offensive coordinator Greg Davis breaks down his gameday operation, as in calling plays from the press box. He already has a thought in his mind on scenarios for plays. He'd like to be at the LOS with 18 seconds left on the playclock. No timetable for running back, "You really can't separate backs until you start tackling."
Phil Parker says his first defense as coordinator is in the installation period. Also, as a secondary coach, he focused on the small picture, but now, as coordinator, his world view has grown. Also, Nico Law isn't a solid starter, at least not year. Finally, he's asked how much the defensive line will define what Iowa does on defense in '12.
Reese Morgan is in his 13th year at Iowa, but it will be his first as D-line coach. He talks about how it's different but the same here. Also, he talks about some of the names he's looking at to contribute. There are a lot of names. He might've left a few out. Morgan knows there's a spotlight on this group.
I asked if O-line coach Brian Ferentz, who coached TEs famously with the Patriots, had any input on TE and he directed me to grad assistant David Raih. I did that and we had an excellent conversation. I also talked Rob Gronkowski and C.J. Fiedorowicz comparisons. I knew this might get batted back into my face, and it did. And that's fine. I should've said maybe a Gronkowski outline for Fiedorowicz, who really only does have 14 career receptions. We eventually got to O-line and Austin Blythe, who I think might be a really good player at Iowa. Anyway, great conversation with Brian. I learn a lot about the game talking to him and that's something I absolutely love. Probably don't compare a college kid with 14 career receptions to an All-Pro who redefined the position in the NFL last season.
Running backs coach Lester Erb said "one thing about it does [Iowa's ongoing running backs situation] is keeps me young." "You can't assume anything with any of them right now." I asked a silly question about waiver wire. Silly. Thanks to coach Erb for humoring me. I don't know what I was going for there. Also, I asked about Damon Bullock. They like him. I think they really like him in space and with his hands. "His knowledge level in coach Davis' offense, it's a little bit ahead of the other guys." We also talked about the circumstances that brought Bullock to Iowa.OC Greg Davis said Iowa will use "six or seven" wide receivers in a game this year. That's a bit of a departure for WR coach Erik Campbell. I asked if the younger receivers benefited from the offensive change. Campbell said, not really, it's still a second system. Then, how do you stack up Nos. 3 through 7? "Work, you have to put the work in. It's an open competition and you might see some freshmen in there." Davis mentioned that freshmen Tevaun Smith and Reese Fleming have stood out.- Shoes » Women's Shoes » Boots

June 17, 2009
I am led to believe that this may not be that wise an activity for all sorts of reasons!
Yesterday I sat in the sunshine drinking coffee with Ken Banks of Kiwanja (spelt correctly this time!) overlooking the river Cam and watching groups of “punters” enjoying the afternoon. I was talking to Ken about the Betavine Social Exchange concept and how it could work in Africa amongst other places … Ken’s experience and insights helped me to understand that we still have a lot of work to do! We really need to do our research with our end users and not just presume that we can transplant our thinking across continents … hence the strange title of this post.
Will local NGOs and community groups understand what we are trying to do? i.e. bringing people with “challenges” together with people with “solutions” – but specifically in the mobile space. There are already a number of excellent websites doing this type of matching activity e.g. Nabuur but not specifically focussed on mobile. Maybe people just describe their “challenges” and not care if the solution has a mobile component? Maybe we could link to and support some of these existing problem solving communities?
Another issue we discussed was the way in which people would describe their problem or “challenge” … free text discussion forum was thought to be the easiest starting point before any more formal problem description.
What about privacy? If an individual has a good idea they may wish to keep it to themselves and seek to start a small business to exploit it. How does privacy sit within an “open” community?
I am hope to get answers to some of these questions by talking to more NGOs and people who understand how to work in the developing world.Severity: Notice

Pretty cool. Like a good backstory for a magic item that can be very useful to a group...or to a village.Go to Comment!!
There is still something to be said about aged meat, but this will definitely do...oh, yes, it will do.?
- Those that believe in the curse to the depth of their bones go out and assassinate or kill 2024 people anyway regardless of the king's intention. So even if they king protects his subject from that fate, those that believe and fear the curse will simply go on a killing spree to fulfill the need.
Now he has to decide to I continue the custom and spare the innocent citizens or fight those that would defy his decision.
Awesome. I like it because there is so much you can do with it. You have a benevolent ruler that does it as a matter of course or you can get a bastard (in the attitude sense, not the offspring) that brings the torture and defilement into the main city.
Then there are so many little plots and twists you can throw around that could have as wide reaching reprecussions as you want. If they don't sacrifice then anything that happens in the world against the kingdom can be tagged part of the curse.
(can't stop)
- Because the king stopped the killings, many small villages that are deeply superstitious start blaming any misfortune on the lack of sacrifice. This leads to an almost religous zeal backing the belief. Slowly, through self-induced hysteria they may start killing their own criminals or lynching those that are only accused of crimes in order to alleviate their own personal misfortune. All it takes is a drought "cured" by a killing to provide "proof" that it works and soon the entire countryside is deep in their own version of 2024.
-- King decides that following the decision is better than this outcome and follows through with the sacrifice. Now he needs to get word through the kingdaom. Will the believe it? Will it be enough to stop what has already begun?
--PCs could have witnessed the fixed sacrifice and be charged with bringing this word, or carry it as they adventure because they want to stop the killing. Each time they come to a village would bring possible conflict. They villages might believe their word or call them liars. A new tension and moral dilemna for the players to have decide whenever they see an injustice based on the sacrifices.
I like it, but I too want more. As soon as you throw dragons into the mix (and other uber strong monsters) we want, nay...need more background. Even if your intention is just a vague story to be adapted and absorbed into other campaigns, we want to hear your take on it. Gives the idea that much more creedance and understanding on your intentions.
For this, I am begging the question....why? With that alone I would be satisfied I think! Why is he being chased, why do they find him anywhere they go, why isn't there TONS of rumors about the path of dragon destruction that always happens after this dude shows up. Dude would be lynched upon arriving at any town way before the dragons get there...and there might be a reason he isn't.
This is on the edge of greatness...push it over the edge!.

I don't want to get on my soap box and rant on but I do want to encourage each one of you to try to see what others are going through.
My 14 year old son recently had to learn that sometimes doing the right thing comes with hard consequences. Max was asked by a teacher to go check on a boy that was on crutches in the bathroom. Apparently he had been gone a while. My son walked in on a group of boys smoking. He stuck his head in the bathroom and told the boy that the teacher wanted him back in class. When he was leaving he was told "you didn't see anything here." He returned to class and thought about what he just saw. It bothered him and he immediately found me after school to tell me what had just happened and that he wanted to speak to the dean. The dean quickly went to that bathroom and found the evidence. Max and I both assumed that the boys were smoking cigarettes. Never in a million years did my naive mind think that Marijuana was involved. Needless to say the boys were suspended from school and the wrath of angry fellow classmates came crashing down on Max. The girls were the worst. Most of the kids were smart about verbalizing their threats and insults instead of sending notes or text. Fortunately Max does not have a Facebook for them to retaliate with. We had high school kids tell him not to bother coming to school with them next year and even a few drove by the house to yell remarks at him.
The worst part of all was that one of the boys was Max's volleyball teammate. In 3 days they were to play for the county championship. This boy was very athletic and a key player for the team. The majority of the girls volleyball team told him that they would now loose the big game. Very little negative comments were made about this particular boy or any of the other boys that made a very poor decision. Now I must say that there were some really great kids and parents that were supportive of Max and told him how proud they were of him. Then there were the parents that avoided me like the plague or ignored me all together. The head coach (who is a "strong Christian")of the volleyball team never acknowledge any of the events. Winning was more important than doing the right thing. The team did lose the championship game. More comments were made, but it quickly died down.
It is important to say that my son in by no means perfect. He is a typical 14 year old boy. However this was a sign of maturity and courage by him. One that I am very proud of.
It died down at school and things got back to normal for Max. But I was mad! How could these parents let their children behave like that? How could they behave like that? Some of these parents I was friendly with. I have had a hard time letting this go. I felt like I was being picked on too! To make matters worse they have let their daughters date these boys??!!

My purpose for sharing this story with you is to remind everyone that support makes a big difference. Women should lift each other up, not shoot them down. There is so much competition between moms these days as to who has the smartest, prettiest, best dressed, most athletic, etc... that we forget that these are children. They are not prize show dogs. Each child is different. Encourage each other, help each other for we are all in this together....even...
The Lake Forest Elementary School tree, slated to come down this summer, may get a second life after all. Mark Newell, a North Augusta-based archaeologist, is trying to arrange donating the near-century-old tree's wood to Augusta State University's fine arts department for sculpture classes. If the college agrees, the tree will live on as artwork.
...our question is: Out of three Richmond County schools, or the total 94 schools in Cluster 8, how did (reporters) Kelly Daniel and James Salzer determine Tobacco Road was the worst? We agree with Jennifer Clark's Jan. 29 letter, when she...
Five knives in two days is enough to make Richmond County school officials nervous, but the age of the supposed offenders is rattling educators even more. A 9-year-old Houghton Elementary School third-grader apparently brought a 10-inch hunting knife to school Wednesday, showing it to another student, who told administrators Thursday morning, school police said. The knife has a 4 1/2 -inch blade with a smooth edge.
If you stand on Sussex Road and listen carefully, you just might hear the sound of blood boiling. The gentle notes of birds singing hello are what really greet your ears as you walk down the shaded streets of the Brynwood subdivision. There are other noises, a distant lawn mower battling weeds, an occasional car, though it is mostly quiet. But simmering beneath the normalcy is the sound of a neighborhood in uproar.
Maybe it was Mother Nature's way of sweeping away all that pollen, so visitors won't sneeze so much next week. Or maybe it was just her way of teasing Augusta with near-natural disaster right before The Big Show begins. Whatever the motivation, Friday's wacky weather wasn't enough to totally derail last-minute Masters Tournament preparations, though it did slow some down. While some rural counties reported tornadoes, Augusta and Columbia County suffered no more than an up-and-down period of heavy rain, pockets of sunshine and more heavy rain.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing the proposed Richmond County high school on Old Waynesboro Road and will issue an opinion about the site next week. The agency was asked by Virgil Fowler, chairman of Richmond County's emergency planning commission, to provide "technical analysis" about the site, said Bill Taylor, an EPA official in Atlanta. Construction started in October at the site, which is near two chemical plants but also residential areas, an elementary school and a hospital.
Augusta officials should immediately pursue a way to free up $15 million to ease traffic and train congestion on 15th Street, commissioners agreed after being briefed on their options Friday. Commissioners asked Administrator Randy Oliver to work with U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood's staff to try to broaden the law regulating how the federal funds, already appropriated, may be used to solve one of Augusta's main traffic headaches.
Zeke is reeling in his line. Richmond County Associate Superintendent Willie Mazyck, a fixture in Augusta schools for 26 years, announced Wednesday he will retire when this school term ends. His decision stunned school officials, who now must decide how to fill a job that handles some of the system's heaviest duties. "You know I tried to talk him out of it," said Superintendent Charles Larke, whom Dr. Mazyck told of his plans Monday.
Suddenly, Richmond County has one elementary school with two sets of administrators, managers and teachers who have to be moved to new jobs a year ahead of schedule. School trustees decided Thursday to move Lake Forest Elementary School students to Forest Hills Elementary School for 1998-99 while construction crews expand Lake Forest to combine the schools by the 1999-2000 term. There's too much risk in having children at Lake Forest while construction encircles the Lake Forest Drive campus, officials decided.Some of My Favorite Things

Hello lovely deskers around the world - hope you've had a good week! There hasn't been much crafting going on here again, although there has been fun in the JanCave Mk2 :-D
My friend Lynne came to stay for a few days - she has recently joined WOYWW as Lynnecrafts, so pop along and say hello if you can! Lynne and I have known each other for a very long time (34 years to be exact!), she and her husband have been great and loyal mates to me and Mr LLJ and, do you know what? We still chat away happily, there's never any silences :-D
From the other end of the table, so you can see experience the full deskiosity! Lynne was helping me out by drawing around the circle template for some ornaments I'm going to make. It was lovely having someone to chat to while I was mending some clothes! Lynne had brought some jewellery with her that she was going to make a necklace/chatelaine with for a party she's going to soon:
A little light extra internet bead shopping may have occurred at this point :-D
Lynne also bought me some really fab postcards by a photographer she's stumbled across in France - Nicolas Ughetto:
He's a wonderful landscape photographer (see here) As well as some amazing wildlife pics, he's played around with the printing which I love - the top left is my favourite, I could live with that on my wall! Lynne bought me a hare triptych which I'll show another time. We had a great few days and visited The Ginhaus in Llandeilo again - it's getting to be a habit :-D
I'll leave you with a couple more pics of my home town harbour. G and I decided we didn't want to sit down all evening so went for a walk and spent ages watching things go on down there....
The RNLI crew had been out practising....
The tide was going out and the sun was setting...
It was a still evening, we spent about three hours just watching the world turn.
ATC anniversary next week, I really must pull my finger out and get some made!!
Gorgeous sunset!! Looks like you had great fun with Lynne, what a surprise (!) that you chatted a lot.... love the postcards she brought you. Helen #?
How lovely to enjoy time with special friends....life should be filled with days like that. Gorgeous photos of the harbour.....happy memories 😀
Hugs,
Annie x #14
Arrrgggghhh - comment 2 - lost the first one :-) Looks like a lot of fun was had with your friend!!! I envy you the harbour and being able to wander there and watch the world go by. Super photos. Love the postcards. would love to swap with you for WOYWW anniversary next week. Anne x #10
It's time I had a chatty crafty house visit with some of my friends. On Saturday there are about 12 of us descending on one of our craft group members to do a stitched Inchies session.
Normally there are three of us who get together from time to time over lunch, craft and chat and it's so nice.
Glad you had a lovely time
Lynn 12 xx
I know who the friend is now you showed us a chatelaine she made you a few weeks back. Lucky you having a friend like Lynne who knows what you like (and will like). Those postcards are absolutely fantastic but I think I could live with any one of them on a wall.
Your own photos are worthy of hanging on a wall, especially the last one. What a gorgeous picture. T'other half was well impressed too.
Have a lovely week
Hugs, Neet 13 xx
Crafting with a friend is so much fun. Those turquoise beads of hers are gorgeous, as are the postcards. Sarah #17

Looks like you had a lot of fun with Lynne. It's always fun crafting with friends isn't it. Those cards are beautiful, really unusual.
I reckon you should be employed by the Welsh tourist board, it looks so beautiful in your neck of the woods. It must be so nice just to be able to watch the world go by on an evening, like being on permanent holiday.
Enjoy

Happy WOYWW. Wonderful photos - of friendship and the seaside. It is a shame that you are not more local. We could do with you in our local WI. We are having a stall at a local market in August and need to get stuff made to sell. I have offered to do something with paper/card, whilst others are sewing and baking. As usual, we are short on volunteers - why do so few do the majority of the work in any group?! Ali x #23
Hiya Jan, sounds like you had a fab time with Lynnes visit. Those postcards are amazing, I agree. Your weather looks to have been glorious- we had a nice day Saturday, the odd shower even though the forecast said none- but since then it's just rained. My new plants are loving it though! Lots of love and huge hugs to you both, Shaz XxXx
Beautiful, beautiful photos! I love lighthouses so it's great to see a different one especially with the lifeboat in the shot too. The sunset looks terrific. It looks like a wonderful place you're living in. Glad you had fun with your friend. It looks like you're having a great time crafting together. The postcards look beautiful too.
If you're swapping extra ATCs please put me down to share. I'd love to swap with you.
Happy WOYWW

I recognize that lyric from the Golden Girls!!! Love these photos...and I'm with you on not-much-crafting-going-on. What is it? Is there something in the air? Just weird that lately I've been doing everything but crafting, and I've been out of the house a lot. But I think once I get the crafty corner cleaned out a bit more and maybe downsized with stuff I'm storing that I'll probably never get to...I'll be back on an embroidery or paper project or two. Hugs!!! Sandy Leigh #34
Oh such fab pics today Jan - I think I need a new camera! xx Jo
It was brilliant seeing you both. Your sunsets are wonderful, too!

I, too, recognize the lyric! We usually have that show on when we go to bed. Great for putting us to sleep since we know every show. I'm finally back to crafting a bit. Gotta get caught up on some stuff. And I LOVE your pictures! Thanks for sharing those! Have a great week!

In summary: I want, nay NEED, your pals cardigan/over jacket: she looks very happy drawing circles but I cannot understand the lack of alcohol which is know to be crafting fuel: You will find yourself frequenting the ginhaus with every new visitor, we have been given a loyalty card for our local bestest Restaurant because once a month we turn up with a batch of visitors, we have to remind ourselves it's a new experience for Les Tourists...and never seems a chore for us...couldn't get the landscape photos to load ( tinterweb is playing up AGAIN)... but will look him up...and in conclusion - isn' t that why you moved thee selves to your new home? so evenings would be spent in pleasurable pursuits of the gentle kind? thank you for stopping by my desk earlier, dxxxx
I like your story. Everything seems pleasant and interesting and lively. Your friend's jewelry intrigues me! Is there, perhaps a tutorial we could view? Peaceful seaside sunset photos - especially that glowing sunset! A Postcard of your own, perhaps?

Ah, the tree trunk postcards is the one for me. What a skill, huh. Lovely to see Lynne and you making the most, absolutely gorgeous photo of you . The harbour in the dusk is pretty lovely too, how I love to watch the world go by.

Lovely post, Jan. So nice to see you and Lynne busy enjoying a crafting session. You both look very happy in each other's company. The postcards are gorgeous and I do like those beads - bet the chatelaine will be beautiful. Love the photos of your harbour, especially the one with the sunset. Sounds like three hours or so well spent. Have a great week. Hugs, Elizabeth x #46
It looks like it was a wonderful day!!
sounds like a wonderful time you had, that sunset is out-of-this-world-beautiful, my favorite picture is the middle left one, the one with the trees, have a nice weekend, vicky #5
Hi Jan. What a great week you have had. long term friendships are extremely precious, aren't they. It looks like you had a load of fun with Lynne - well done both! Trust the bead chatelaine goes well. The walk along the beach and harbour looks just great - stunning photos. I'm thrilled that you are both so enjoying your new area together. I confess that my friends took to the hot tub at their rented house each evening until it was dark - so no photos there!! Stunning house and view where they all stayed, though - grand views over the Conwy estuary! A fantastic, noisy, chattery week has been had - and now I have no voice left!
I'd love to swap ATCs with you if you have a spare one?? You have my email - just let me know your address:-)
Take care young lady. God bless.

What an awesome post! Isn't it nice to have life long friends that you can share hours and days together and still have enough to talk about for another long visit!

I think the meds and illness has really impacted my memory! Vickie #43/ AutoIndustriya.com Team | May 09, 2014 18:37
Vios is the best-selling model with 1,982 units
Toyota Motor Philippines (TMP) continues to break the 8,000 unit sales mark for the second consecutive month.
According to the most recent CAMPI report, TMP posted a share of 45-percent with total sales of 8,102 units in April.
The sales of Toyota last April was again possible through the continous demand of its best-selling vehicle, the Vios with sales of 1,982 units.
The company’s performance was further strengthened as the Fortuner and the locally-manufactured Innova registered 1,473 units and 1,200 units respectively while Wigo had 634.
TMP says other Toyota models such as the Corolla Altis, the Hilux and the HiAce were also number one in their own categories.
,” TMP President Mr. Michinobu Sugata said in a statement.
Furthermore, TMP says the company continues to stretch its lead in sales on a year to date basis.
In the passenger car segment, the company registered 11, 625 units and in the commercial vehicle segment recorded 19,305 units.
All in all, the manufacturer increased by 32-percent versus the same period of last year outperforming the industry’s growth. TMP’s total sales on a year-to-date basis is at 30, 930 units.Home / Educational Resources /

This starts in Oct, 04. will remain open > through out the following year, and states 'no limit'. I was stunned to hear that there will be open season on crows. I almost thought it was a bad joke. No joke, apparently. Crow Society ----------------- Crows are intelligent birds. They contribute to the social order of birds in many important ways. They maintain territory by chasing away many larger birds, including ravens and raptors. With crows gone, these other birds intrude on the available territory and harass and predate smaller birds. Many bird hierarchies are determined by size. As a medium-sized bird, crows have a special niche in this delicate balance. Crows, like robins, are watchdogs. They warn of dangers and many other birds and even some animals (deer, for example) are alerted by their calls. When you kill a crow, you aren't just killing one bird. There's a big chance, you are destroying a crow family, since the crow's mate is affected by the loss in many ways. You are killing the young crows who haven't made it through the winter yet because knowledge is passed on about winter food sources, caches, potential predators, etc. I've seen Steller's jays (which are also corvids), learn from their family group for months after they are technically on their own. I'm sure crow society is similar. Hunting Crows -------------------- Not all hunters are birders. I know hunters who can't tell a blackbird from a raven. I know MANY people who can't tell a crow from a raven. Give hunters the go-ahead to shoot crows and some of them will make mistakes. The Web is full of stories about hunters who have mistaken cows, people, dogs, and other mammals for deer and accidentally shot them. The difference between a blackbird and a crow is far less than the different between a deer and a dog (or a human). West Nile will be here soon. It has the potential to devastate the crow population, so why shoot the birds first? When West Nile kills birds, it kills the weak ones, leaving the rest to breed stronger offspring with some West Nile resistance. That is nature's way--there's a balance to it. Hunters do not shoot the weak animals. Some shoot the trophy birds, some shoot for pure sport. The crows are not being shot for food. Hunters are not going to cull the birds that might be more susceptible to West Nile because they can't. There's no way to gauge it. They are going to cull the ones that are easiest to see and easiest to shoot. This doesn't strengthen the collective health of the crow population. If hunters start shooting crows, they will make noise. They will frighten birds, small animals, and possibly people. They will sometimes miss and hit something else. They will sometimes misidentify a bird and perhaps kill a fragile or protected species. Birdshot ----------- What are hunters going to use to kill these birds? Bird shot? Lead shot? If a large bird like a swan swallows just one or two lead pellets that have lodged themselves in a mud bank or pond, the swan will be dead in 21 days. A bird gizzard grinds the pellet and thus it enters the bloodstream more easily. I know some of the states and Canada have been taking steps to ban lead shot, but I'm not sure what the situation is here in Washington State. If hunters legally (or illegally) use lead shot and the shot misses the mark and enters habitat, it becomes a hazard to other birds, animals, and people. The shooting of crows is incomprehensible to me. I don't understand the rationale behind this decision.

- Experian: 723 – The client had a good Experian rating
- Transunion: 691 – Bonny had a good credit score with Transunion.
- Equifax: Bonny’s Experian score was 710, which is a good credit score with the Experian scale.
Debt Consolidation Will Assist Any Deeply Indebted Borrower to Escape Bad Debts like Payday Loans
Most debt consolidation loans vary from $33,000.00 to $45,000.00. They are mainly used to pay off existing high interest loans like credit cards. Bonny needed a debt consolidation loan to pay for their existing mortgage and their credit card. Bonny was able to find a mortgage in the end. Debt consolidation, or just consolidation, is a tactic in the debt snowball method which changes your bad, high interest loans to a single lower interest loan. Debt consolidation loans generally have interest rates as low as 2.8%.
Bonny’s Overall FICO score at the time of acceptance for a mortgage, taking into account their forest and conservation technician job and their future job as a golf course superintendent
Bonny was declined by Barnett Bank of Tampa, National Association 5 times before being granted funding by Sun Bank of Seminole at 240 State Road 434
On January 13, 2009, Bonny inquired about borrowing $26,000 from The First Bankers of Polk County with Holli, their friend from just outside Seminole County, and even with the co-signer, Bonny was rejected for this mortgage. With good credit, it can be very hard to procure financing, even with collateral and a co-signer.
Before applying for this mortgage, Bonny had an Experian score of 723, which is good, so Sun Bank of Seminole probably cannot provide Bonny a mortgage
Fast Loans for Bonny in Seminole County, Florida to prevent bankruptcy or broken legs from debt collectors.
Fast loans in Seminole County, Florida aren’t actually that difficult to obtain, particularly if you have some gumption like Bonny. Bonny was able to find a fast loan for $135000 from First Bank of Crestview and Caribank, but turned down both offers in favor of their mortgage from Sun Bank of Seminole. The improvement with a fast loan over a debt consolidation loan is in speed. Fast loans usually are processed within 1 – 3 weeks, versus up to 6 weeks for installment loans. A big difference in the case that you are on the go.
Installment loan for Bonny, a graduate of Concordia University and a forest and conservation technician working for over $79,000 per year
Bonny, an alumnus at Concordia University and a forest and conservation technician in Seminole County, Florida wants a mortgage to purchase a car. Bonny has instead chosen to obtain an installment loan for $16,000 and is currently seeking lenders like The Broadway National Bank of Tampa to process their request.
Signature Loan acquired in Seminole County, Florida for $135000 with good credit by Bonny
Many clients have difficulty with finding signature loans in Seminole County, Florida, and Bonny is not an exception. Bonny went to 8 lenders or more prior to settling on Sun Bank of Seminole, who offered Bonny a signature loan for $135000. Typical signature loans simply need a client, like Bonny’s signature to get them, up to $25,000 in some cases. Bonny was able to get $135000 as a mortgage, which is very high for a mortgage. Because signature loans do not require a cosigner, they tend to require better credit, as high as 799
Many past requests for credit have been made by Bonny in the past, including one from First Tennessee Bank in Seminole County, Florida before Bonny was approved for the $135000 by Sun Bank of Seminole
Bonny made 5 prior attempts to obtain a mortgage, 2 of which were with First Tennessee Bank, a lending institution in Seminole County, Florida known to specialize in mortgages specifically. Prior to finding Sun Bank of Seminole, Bonny was very concerned due to their inexperience and good credit rating.
Previous requests on Bonny’s credit
Bonny’s Transunion score was altered by the mortgage loan, changing to 691 from 710, which is normal in our experience.
Bonny has a low current yearly income, but has a high number of prospects
Bonny has always wanted to be a golf course superintendent, but would have to attend Concordia University again to become one. Bonny has other prospects as well, including commercial diver, athletic coach, and alumni relations coordinator, which pay $56,000 through to $94,000 per year, at least. Because of this, we believe that Bonny can pay for this mortgage of $135000.
8 Months in the Past, Bonny Tried to Find a High Risk Loan for $30,000.00, and it was Easy
It is an well known struggle for clients to get high risk loans in a non-harmful manner. Many high risk loans end up originating loan sharks or the like, which can be physically harmful to borrowers like Bonny. Bonny decided not to obtain a high risk loan this time. High Risk loans are the instrument of choice, and are given to bad credit borrowers. Individuals with credit scores as low as 416 can apply for a high risk loan and may be be accepted.
When Bonny was 20, they attempted to obtain a student loan from 6 alternate lenders, which damaged their credit rating. Below is a list of Bonny’s previous attempts at finding a student loan:
- Attempt 1) Loan for $32,000.00 on December 26, 2010
- Attempt 2) Loan for $36,000.00 on August 24, 2010
- Attempt 3) Loan for $33,000.00 on June 22, 2011
- Attempt 4) Loan for $20,000.00 on May 15, 2010
- Attempt 5) Loan for $37,000.00 on October 31, 2012
- Attempt 6) Loan for $25,000.00 on May 3, 2010

Personal Loan for a forest and conservation technician named Bonny in Seminole County, Florida to Pay Off Commerce Bank

Tommys Lawnmower Repair TampaChris Dodd and Bob Corker have apparently agreed on a draft bill to reform the financial system, which they will introduce next week. Steven Pearlstein offered a preview today. First, they’ve apparently come up with an odd duck of a compromise on the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, which consumer advocates and even the White House have deemed crucial to reform, but which lobbyists for the banking industry have excoriated:.
Not exactly what the White House has sought, but my working assumption is that they’ll leap at it. The fear here is that safety and soundness will take precedence over consumer protection every time, so there would need to be assurances that the two missions had an equal footing.
The second major aspect of the Dodd/Corker proposal concerns unwinding too big to fail banks:.
The devil’s in the details here, and those “temporary loans” could easily grow into another bailout. FWIW, Simon Johnson likens this resolution authority to a unicorn – “a mythical beast with magical properties, but not actually useful in the real world.” Nevertheless, he does argue that the Dodd/Corker proposal offers “limited change.” (I smell a bumper sticker!)
If you’re missing the Volcker rule in these discussions, that’s because it’s stalled out..
The Obama Administration, while continuing to talk the talk about the Volcker rule, has been undercut by their own Treasury Secretary, whose proposal to give regulators discretion over defining and banning proprietary trading mirrors the Dodd/Corker proposal. Yves Smith remarks that the Volcker rule has been “whittled back to meaninglessness.”Underwriters

Scientists at the University of Michigan recently designed and printed a device that helped restore a baby’s ability breathe using a customized 3D printer.
Kaiba Giofriddo had a rare case of severe tracheobronchomalacia—a condition that causes tracheal collapse—and doctors were unsure of whether or not the baby could even leave the hospital alive. The situation seemed dire, but thanks to the innovativeness of Doctor Glenn Green, MD, and his colleague Scott Hollister, Ph.D., Kaiba made it out of the hospital alive and his trachea is expected to grow into a healthy state.
Using customized 3D printing equipment and CT scans of Kaiba’s trachea, Green and his colleague designed a bioresorbable device—a trachea splint—that was implanted around the baby’s airway to expand the bronchus and serve as a skeleton to help Kaiba’s breathing mechanisms develop correctly.
“The material (polycaprolactone) we used is a nice choice for this. It takes about two to three years for the trachea to remodel and grow into a healthy state, and that’s about long this material will take to dissolve in the body,” according to Hollister.
Twenty-one days after the splint was implanted into Kaiba, he was successfully weaned from the ventilator, and is now currently in a healthy state living with his family in Ohio.
“He has not had another episode of turning blue,” said Kaiba’s relieved mother, April Giofriddo. “We are so thankful that something could be done for him. It means the world to us.”
Kaiba’s life-saving 3D-printed implant is just another example of how 3D printers (commercial and personal) are quickly changing the way we utilize technology to manufacture what’s desired on demand. In the health field there are certainly more barriers to clear, such as an FDA approval, before a device like Kaiba’s splint can be implanted. However, 3D-printers made for the masses have already offered people the ability to print out customized parts for a gadget and even parts for buildings.

Today's feature reviews the regular season; tomorrow the Holiday Bowl matchup with Nebraska.
(From the 1999 Arizona Football Media Guide)
Game 1: Arizona 27, Hawaii 6
McAlister, Smith Outshine Rainbows
HONOLULU - Arizona senior Chris McAlister took the opening kickoff back 100 yards and the Wildcats never looked back in their season-opener at Hawaii. Sparked by McAlister's return, the Wildcats beat the Rainbow Warriors 27-6 in front of 33,804 at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu.
Wildcat head coach Dick Tomey named Ortege Jenkin as the starting quarterback, but as planned used Keith Smith at the start of the second quarter. Smith's entry sparked UA to its second touchdown as he hooked up with Jeremy McDaniel on the right sideline for a nifty 17-yard TD.
No. 24 Arizona put more points on the board late in the third quarter as Smith found junior wideout Dennis Northcutt for a seven-yard touchdown pass. The Wildcats scored their final touchdown midway through the fourth quarter when Kelvin Eafon blasted through the right side from behind Yusuf Scott and Manuia Savea to score from five yards.
Smith completed 17-of-22 on the night for 218 yards and two touchdowns. Northcutt caught eight passes for 91 yards and a touchdown, as well as returning seven punts for 70 yards with a long of 29.
McAlister broke up two passes and did not allow a completion in coverage, plus disturbed punter Chad Shrout, causing a kick of only 18 yards. McAlister also lined up at tailback on the first play from scrimmage on a lateral for 12 yards.
Game 2: Arizona 31, Stanford 14
Offense, Defense Roll Over the Cardinal
PALO ALTO, Calif. - No. 21 Arizona used a bruising effort on both sides and improved its record to 2-0 for the first time since 1995 with a 31-14 win at Stanford in front of 30,096 fans.
While the Wildcats' offense rolled up 511 yards of total offense, Arizona's defense held Stanford to only 60 yards on the ground and 347 yards of total offense.
Tailback Trung Canidate returned to action and underscored his value as a feature back with 21 carries for 100 yards.
The QB rotation of Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins worked for the Cats as each completed 8-of-14 passes, Smith for 130 yards and Jenkins for 158 yards. Dennis Northcutt hauled in five catches for 160 yards and a touchdown. Jeremy McDaniel grabbed seven balls for 70 yards and a touchdown.
Arizona started slowly but took the lead after forcing a Cardinal punt with 3:18 left in the half. UA took over at its own 26-yard line.
Jenkins hit Northcutt on a 44-yard gain and a first down at the Stanford 34-yard line. The Wildcats converted twice again before he connected with McDaniel on a fade to the corner of the endzone.
Marcus Bell led the Wildcats with 10 tackles. Chris McAlister, Kelvin Hunter, Eli Wnek and Rafell Jones all were in on five tackles. McAlister also broke up four passes including his first interception of the year.
Game 3: Arizona 35, Iowa 11
UA Halts Ground Attack, Outflies Hawkeyes
TUCSON - No. 16-ranked Arizona's wide receivers, Jeremy McDaniel and Dennis Northcutt, had a nice night against Iowa in helping to lead the Wildcats to a 35-11 victory.
The Wildcat quarterbacks completed more than 60 percent of their passes for almost 300 yards in front of 52,634 fans at Arizona Stadium. UA's defense held the Hawkeyes to 28 net rushing yards.
Northcutt hauled in five passes from Ortege Jenkins and Keith Smith for 157 yards, including a 44-yard touchdown. He also had a catch for 56 yards, but did not score on the play.
McDaniel also caught five passes for 108 yards. He did not score a touchdown, but did catch a pass for 76 yards from Jenkins. Smith completed 7 of 8 attempts for 167 yards and the touchdown to Northcutt. His only incompletion was dropped by an Arizona receiver. Jenkins was 4-of-10 passing for 118 yards.
Kyle McCann completed 18-of-36 for 274 yards and Scott Mullen was 7-of-11 for 116 and a touchdown for Iowa, but UA put a damper on the one-dimensional attack with interceptions by Scooter Sprotte and Kelvin Hunter.
Wildcat linebacker Marcus Bell earned the first Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week honor of his career against the Hawkeyes with an 11-tackle (five for losses), two-sack performance.
Game 4: Arizona 35, San Diego State 16
Cats Explode for 28 Points in First Half
SAN DIEGO, Calif. - No. 16 Arizona traveled to San Diego to play before a rush-hour crowd of 23,811 people at Qualcomm Stadium and a national television audience on ESPN.
Aztec receiver Damon Gourdine took the opening kickoff back 76 yards, but Chris McAlister made the tackle in time at the Arizona 21-yard line and the Wildcats held SDSU to only a field goal.
The teams traded punts, and a 51-yard return by Dennis Northcutt gave the Wildcats great field position at the SDSU 19-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Keith Smith hit Jeremy McDaniel for a touchdown.
After another Aztec punt and more good field position, Smith ran for a 16-yard gain, and again for a 20-yard touchdown to put Arizona up 14-3. On Arizona's next possession, Smith scored again, this time on a 30-yard scramble around the left side. Arizona scored its final touchdown of the first half on its next possession when Jim Wendler plunged in from five yards out. It was not only the first touchdown of Wendler's career, but also the first carry.
Defensively, Scooter Sprotte's two interceptions helped bail UA out of trouble. He also had four solo tackles and nearly had his third interception of the game in the third quarter when he broke up a pass. Marcus Bell led all players with 13 tackles, eight solo. He also recovered a fumble and broke up a pass.
Game 5: Arizona 31, Washington 28
Leap by Lake Collars Dawgs
SEATTLE - Ortege Jenkins scored on a highlight-film scramble with four seconds left to give No. 14 Arizona a 31-28 win over No. 20 Washington in front of 71, 469 fans at Husky Stadium.
The sophomore quarterback was flushed from the pocket and ran for the end zone. Three defenders converged on Jenkins at the 2 yard line. Jenkins leaped and flipped over the defenders before landing on his feet for the winning touchdown.
Jenkins' miracle flip was the culmination of a 13-play, 80-yard drive and came after a nice UA goal-line stand (two tackles by freshman Keoni Fraser) which thwarted a UW try for a touchdown. The Huskies missed the field goal.
Jenkins finished with 111 passing yards and a touchdown on 10-of-19 completions. Keith Smith was 9-of-14 for 146 yards and a touchdown. Trung Canidate led the Wildcats on the ground, gaining 87 yards on 15 carries.
Defensively, Marcus Bell earned Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week honors for his 21-tackle (11 solo) performance. He also blocked an extra point. Peter Hansen, a 6-foot-8 quarterback, played on special teams and blocked a Husky field goal attempt.
Game 6: UCLA 52, Arizona 28
Cats Play 50 Minutes, Bruins Ruin Last 10
TUCSON - Arizona's only blemish on an otherwise perfect season came during the fourth quarter against UCLA in front of 58,738, the fourth-largest crowd in Arizona Stadium history.
The No. 10 Wildcats went toe-to-toe for 50 minutes against the No. 3 Bruins, trailing only 31-28. However, the Bruins scored on three consecutive offensive plays in the fourth quarter to win 52-28.
With about 12 minutes left, the Bruins took to the air, and Cade McNown hit Danny Farmer for a 64-yard touchdown. The Wildcats were forced to punt on their next possession. Keith Brown took the handoff on UCLA's first play and ran 54 yards for the touchdown.
Arizona took the kickoff, but Keith Smith was intercepted by Tony White at the Wildcats' 25. On the next play, Brown ran it in, this time from 20 yards out. UCLA rolled up 229 yards in the fourth and fateful quarter.
Ortege Jenkins had his best numbers of the season statistically, completing 14-of-30 for 260 yards and a touchdown. Dennis Northcutt caught eight passes for 103 yards, and Jeremy McDaniel grabbed seven balls for 126 yards and two touchdowns.
Game 7: Arizona 28, Oregon State 7
Basic Football Style Lifts Cats Over Beavers
CORVALLIS, Ore. - No. 16 Arizona turned to some time-written football axioms to recover from the whipping of the previous week, beating Oregon State, 28-7, before 30,021 fans in Parker Stadium.
The Cats won the turnover battle, established the run, and shot down the run - a handful of ploys most coaches hang in a shellacked frame on the wall.
Led by linebacker Marcus Bell, who finished with 12 tackles (nine solo), Arizona held the Beavers to only 21 yards rushing. OSU checked in with only 167 yards in total offense - an opponent season low.
Arizona ran the ball a season-high (tie) 53 times for 228 yards and four touchdowns. Sophomore Leon Callen led the way with his best game of the year, 107 yards on 16 carries. He scored his first touchdown of the season on a 36-yard run in the fourth quarter.
Kelvin Eafon was another key for the Wildcats with some superb red-zone work. The senior bulldozed through the Beavers defense for three touchdown runs of one, four and two yards. Eafon finished the day with 84 yards on 13 carries.
Arizona quarterbacks Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins combined for 148 yards on 16-of-24 passing, as the Wildcats executed their game plan of short, conservative passes.
The Wildcats took advantage of two OSU fumbles to set up short-field scoring drives.
Game 8: Arizona 45, Northeast Louisiana 7
More Firepower Leads Cats Past Northeast Louisiana
TUCSON - No. 14 Arizona rushed for more than 250 yards and passed for nearly 200 more to earn its seventh win of the season, 45-7 over Northeast Louisiana, before 39,218 fans at Arizona Stadium.
Running backs Kelvin Eafon and Trung Canidate each rushed for two touchdowns, while Keith Smith threw for two and Ortege Jenkins tossed another. Cornerback Chris McAlister capped it all with a 68-yard touchdown on the first punt return of his career. UA averaged 7.1 yards per play on offense. The Arizona defense sacked Northeast Louisiana quarterbacks a school-record nine times for -52 yards.
Smith completed 10-of-13 passes for 136 yards. Jenkins was 7-of-12 for 62 yards. Canidate carried the ball 12 times for 91 yards, while Eafon rushed 10 times for 70 yards.
Defensively, Marcus Bell led the Wildcats with eight tackles, two for loss, a sack and two passes broken up. Daniel Greer sacked Vige three times and finished with six tackles. Barrett Baker, Arizona's special teams captain, blocked the first punt of his career in the third quarter.
Game 9: Arizona 38, Oregon 3
Near-Perfect Cats Put Ducks Down
TUCSON - The Cats put on some straight-face masks and in a battle for a major bowl berth, No. 13 Arizona whipped No. 12 Oregon 38-3 in front of a Halloween crowd of 44,931 at Arizona Stadium.
A goal-line interception by cornerback Chris McAlister thwarted UO's first drive and UA drove 80 yards to set the tone. Brad Brennan sparked the Wildcats' rout with a 48-yard catch-and-run from Keith Smith for the punctuation.
UA did what UCLA had done a few weeks earlier - blast a good team with a splurge of points. The Cats ran 24 plays for 286 yards on their first four possessions of the second half for four scores.
The Wildcats got going on the fourth play of the half with a 71-yard scoring run by Trung Canidate. Later, his 61-yard burst set up another score.
UA's kicking game was a big key. Dennis Northcutt's punt returns of 53 and 14 yards helped set up two scoring drives, while UA punter Ryan Springston and the coverage units contained Oregon's return specialists to a 6.3 mark on returns.
Canidate finished with 180 yards, his highest total of the year at the time, on 17 carries. Kelvin Eafon added 67 yards on 14 carries and three touchdowns.
Arizona's defense held then-Heisman Trophy candidate Akili Smith to only 168 yards on 13-of-25 passing. He was intercepted twice.
Game 10: Arizona 41, Washington State 7
Cats Run Through, Around Cougars
TUCSON - Back in the groove at No. 10, Arizona ran its fewest plays of the year but made them count (8.8 per) and built a 24-7 lead by the half, then kicked into overdrive to cruise to a 41-7 victory over Washington State before 47,761 fans at Arizona Stadium.
WSU put together its best drive of the night to take an early 7-3 lead. But Arizona showed its big-play capability two plays into its next possession, as Trung Canidate blew through a hole on the right side and scored on a 75-yard run.
Canidate struck again later in the first quarter. The junior hit another hole, streaking for a 45-yard touchdown run to give the Wildcats a 17-7 lead.
Arizona finished its scoring in the first half in dramatic fashion. Cornerback Chris McAlister stepped in front of a Steve Birnbaum pass on the right sideline, and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown. He became the seventh player in NCAA history to return a kickoff, punt and interception for touchdowns in the same season.
Canidate rushed for 174 yards and two touchdowns on only 12 carries . Keith Smith rushed six times for 90 yards and neither he nor Ortege Jenkins were sacked. Through the air, Jenkins was 5-of-7 for 68 yards, while Smith was 6-of-10 for 88 yards. UA rushed for 368 yards.
Game 11: Arizona 27, California 23
UA Hangs on for Win in Penalty-Ridden Game
BERKELEY, Calif. - Arizona and California combined for 29 penalties and 307 penalty yards that slowed the pace of the Wildcats' 10th victory of the season, a 27-23 triumph in front of 36,500 fans at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley. The game gave Arizona a perfect 6-0 mark on the road in 1998 and it became the first team in school history to win 10 games during the regular season.
Cal's first punt was blocked by Wildcat cornerback Chris McAlister to set up a Keith Smith to Jeremy McDaniel touchdown throw.
Cal scored on a 41-yard run by Marcus Fields to tie the game, but a Golden Bears' miscue on their next possession hurt. After punter Ryan Springston dropped the ball inside Cal's 20, the Bears were stuck with poor field position, and UA came up with a forced fumble by Idris Haroon and a tackle of QB Justin Vedder by Joe Tafoya for a safety.
Arizona came out in the second half and scored on its first possession of the half, capping an eight-play, 65-yard drive with a 17-yard pass from Smith to Brad Brennan.
Trung Canidate gave Arizona the lead at 27-10 with a 54-yard run early in the fourth quarter, but Cal fought back with 13 unanswered points. UA had a big first-down run by Kelvin Eafon to eat the clock before giving the ball over to the Bears for some final desperation throws.
Game 12: Arizona 50, Arizona State 42
Canidate Runs and Runs...Devils Can't; But Throw
TUCSON - In one of the biggest games in school history, Trung Canidate had the best day any running back has ever had at the University of Arizona.
Canidate carried the ball only 18 times in Arizona's 50-42 win over Arizona State in front of 57,953 fans at Arizona Stadium. However, he averaged 16 yards per tote and rambled for a school-record 288 yards and three scores. The TD runs came on jaunts of 80, 66 and 48 yards.
Meantime, UA held ASU to 51 net rushing yards. Ryan Kealy ripped the secondary for 511 yards on 33 completions in 56 attempts. Each team missed twice on two-point conversion attempts.
Arizona took a 7-3 lead in the first quarter after Brad Brennan caught a 72-yard pass from Keith Smith and flew past the Arizona State defense for the touchdown. However, the Sun Devils battled back to take a 15-7 lead. Arizona scored again when Jim Wendler scored his second career touchdown on a one-yard dive early in the second quarter to close at 15-13.
The teams traded punts and with ASU starting at its own 12 yard-line, UA tackle Kenoni Fraser knocked a ball loose and linebacker Scooter Sprotte scooped and scored. Still, Arizona State scored on its next possession to take a 22-19 lead with 1:50 left in the first half. But moments later Canidate ripped off the first of his long runs, an 80-yard untouched cut-back.
The Sun Devils opened the second half with the ball, but were forced to punt. Chris McAlister burst through the ASU line to block the punt, setting up a short drive and an Ortege Jenkins 13-yard scoring run to put UA up 33-22. The Wildcats did not trail from then on, as Mark McDonald added a 21-yard field goal, and Canidate scored on 66 and 48-yard runs. ASU didn't stop scoring either and had a desperation pass knocked down by Kelvin Hunter as time expired. The 92 points scored by the two teams were the most in the series.
UA linebacker Marcus Bell turned in his second 21-tackle game of the season to easily cement his standing as the top tackler in the league in 1998.
Arizona won 11 games for the first time in school history and became only the fourth Pac-10 team to do so.
Coming Wednesday: Fourth Quarter Drives Help Cats Beat Huskers in Holiday BowlI saw Incubus for the first time at Red Rocks.
To begin with, that venue was perfect. I doubt I'll ever be able to think of a concert the same after that magical creation. It was like a church of music... it's just you, and the music, and the band, and the souls of everything that has ever existed, put into this one area of pure bliss.
I don't even want to talk about the opener, not worth it.
But the instant the music started, my heart stopped. The feeling in my soul was amazing. I wanted to cry from the overwhelming amount of perfection flowing in and out of my mind. I only wish I could have shared the moment with my lover, as opposed to my sister who had no interest, which is disappointing to say the least.
The only thing more beautiful in my life than that moment, was the moment I fell in love. Absolutely beautiful.
While I really wanted to hear Switchblade, or Isadore, I was very happy with the set list. It was phenomenal. Absolutely beautiful.

Vacansoleil-DCM teammates Kenny van Hummel and Danny van Poppel completed the podium in Handzame for the Dutch WorldTour squad, still in search of its first win of the year.
Amidst steady rain and near freezing temperatures, the day's main breakaway formed after approximately 70km of racing with five riders going clear: William Clarke (Argos-Shimano), Jonas Van Genechten (Lotto Belisol), Youcef Reguigui (MTN-Qhubeka), Sean De Bie (Leopard-Trek Continental Team) and Kess Heytens (Team 3M).
The five-man lead group extended its lead to more than four minutes on the 16km finishing circuit comprising the bulk of the race's 190km distance, completed 10 times in Handzame.
Blanco Pro Cycling and NetApp-Endura set the tempo in the peloton and steadily reduced the break's lead, cutting their advantage to three minutes with 71km remaining and then two minutes with 45km to the finish.
Meanwhile, the unity of the break fractured with Van Genechten attacking his four companions. Heytens found himself in trouble and lost contact for good, while Clarke, Reguigui and De Bie made their way back to the Lotto Belisol Belgian.
Entering the final 16km circuit the four leaders held a tentative 22-second lead and soon after hearing the bell for one lap to go the break split under the impetus of Van Genechten - Clarke and De Bie were quickly absorbed by the peloton while Van Genechten and Reguigui pushed onwards. The duo's flight lasted until 12km to go when they, too, were brought back into the fray.
Shortly afterwards, however, a counter-attack formed comprised of Bert Grabsch (Omega Pharma-Quick Step), Wesley Kreder (Vacansoleil-DCM) and Alphonse Vermote (An Post-ChainReaction). This trio's lead reached 22 seconds with six kilometres remaining, but the sprinters' teams brought the escape group back into the fold inside the final kilometre, setting up a field sprint finale to decide the race's winner.David and Annie (Taillon) Butterfield

Janet Yellen offered some insight into her thoughts on Capitol Hill today. Her elevation to chair of the Federal Reserve is inevitable, and in terms of philosophical continuity, she was the logical choice to succeed Ben Bernanke and oversee the Fed's quantitative-easing program.
Today she spoke glowingly of Bernanke, describing him as "wise and skillful." She spoke of the benefits of quantitative easing, describing its impact as "meaningful." She gave every indication that she'll continue the Fed's current accommodative policies. As I watched Yellen today, I began to believe that any tapering of the Fed's bond-buying program may be further in the distance than many of us..

It’s another day closer to Christmas. Allison feels the spirit of the season in every word she hears.
Although she can’t see her decorations or express herself with words, there’s no mistaking her joy. And there’s no mistaking the melody of her favorite Christmas carols.
Last year, Make-A-Wish® volunteers redecorated her room with reindeer, snowmen and polar bears. A group of carolers visited to help grant her wish. They sang all the holiday classics – as they sang “Santa Claus is Coming to Town,” St. Nick arrived to read some of Allison’s favorite stories.
But this Christmas will be the best yet. Allison enjoys her holiday décor all season long. She knows Christmas is nearly here … and everyone she cares about – Mom, Dad, Benjamin and Sara – is by her side to celebrate.

History
Jasper Farm and Ranch is a full line Farm Equipment and ATV dealership located in Jasper, Texas. This rural area is a short drive from the gulf coast of Texas and from the Texas-Louisiana border. The area is characterized by beautiful pine forests, rolling farm lands and large lakes.
The stores original location was in downtown Jasper. Founders Bill and Matt Morian incorporated the business in 1974. Originally Jasper Farm and Ranch was an International harvester dealer.
Then in the late 70’s Kubota was added to the lineup. Jasper Farm and Ranch was one of the first five Kubota dealerships in Texas and celebrated its 35th year of operation in 2008.
In the early 80’s Bill and Matt relocated the business to a new facility and its present location just north of town on Hwy 96N. Over time the facility was modified and renovated, bringing it to its present layout.
Through the years, Jasper Farm and Ranch has won many different awards for distinguished sales and service, including Bush Hog’s Presidents Club Gold Award: Yamaha’s Pacesetter Award, Case IH’s 25 year service Award, Kubota’s Customer Satisfaction CSI10 Award and Chamber of Commerce Awards.
In 2007, ownership of the store was transferred to Kejzar Motors Inc., a dealership holding company. Today Jasper Farm and Ranch continues to serve the agricultural community with top-notch equipment such as Kubota, Yamaha, Cub Cadet, Kuhn, Bush Hog, Landpride, Case IH parts, Modern and many other short lines and parts suppliers.1.

A cloudless sky beating the sun’s rays down. You’ve been there for six weeks without a drop of water. But you are still there. This is reality for the Deinococcus species of extremophiles. These robust bacteria have evolved to cope with the harshest environments found on our planet. Since its discovery in 1956, coincidentally 56 years ago, scientists have been trying to understand the mechanisms behind these adaptations at a molecular level. Their hard work is now paying off in new and exciting ways.
Much of the recent research links back to why this species of tough microorganism was discovered. Back in the 50s, a new method of preserving food using gamma radiation resulted in a tin of spoiled meat and Deinococcales radiodurans was found to be the culprit. Exposure to unnaturally high doses of ionizing radiation was a doddle to this new species with 90% survival rate at a dose of 5,000Gy. To put this in perspective, workers at the Chernobyl plant were exposed to a cumulative dose of about 0.1Gy* during the 2-year clean-up process.
There is nowhere on earth with such high natural radiation so the first puzzle was why these bacteria had adapted to survive. Martian theories involving meteorites were thrown into the mix. Scientists tested the bacteria with natural extremes including lack of water and UV radiation. They flourished and were soon discovered in places like the Sahara (D. deserti), geothermal vents (D. geothermalis) and the Gobi Desert (D. gobiensis).
What confers these unearthly properties on the adeptly nicknamed Conan the Bacterium? One hypothesis is that the high dose of radiation is inadvertently turning the bacteria into super-mutants. This is correct in once sense as it is mutating the bacteria’s DNA. Since other bacteria e.g. E. coli do not succumb to a blessing of extra strength, we have to look beyond the supernatural for an answer.
The first point of call was DNA damage as high doses of radiation are notorious for causing double stranded breaks in DNA. D. radiodurans DNA is broken in a similar fashion to other bacteria but its supremacy is the ability to repair this damage. Recent research has addressed this by focusing on a very damaging process, oxidation. Radiation and other environmental stresses increase the release of damaging reactive oxygen species. These are a natural byproduct of metabolism but when they are increased dramatically they cause damage to cell structures. The power of the super-bacteria is their ability to prevent this devastating destruction.
Anti-oxidants are a vital component in this process and a number of studies have shown a particular detox ion is present in higher volumes in D. radiodurans under stress. The manganeseII ion is a cofactor in many enzymes and its action permits resistance to extreme conditions. Scientists have revealed these hardy bacteria have a very efficient manganese regulatory mechanism. Deinococcus species have taken the use of antioxidants to a new level!
Having revealed many of these extremophiles secrets, scientists have discovered some novel ways of exploiting its properties. IrrE is a protein switch and shown to be involved in protecting D. radiodurans. Transferring this regulator to E. coli also transfers the protection. Under conditions which would normally be fatal such as salt and thermal shock, the E. coli survived. Moving to a higher level, IrrE also endowed salt tolerance when tested in a transgenic plant, Brassica napus. These initial experiments give us a glimpse of the potential IrrE could have in transgenic plants as 20% of all land is now affected by salinity.
Telling the story of D. radiodurans reveals a thrilling tale of discovery and potential. This bacteria is more than an entry in the Guinness Book of Records. The mechanisms behind the world’s toughest bacteria reveal elements that could be adapted for use in radioprotection and higher tolerances in crops. More possibilities will be revealed as its means of protection are investigated further. One thing is certain; the Deinococcus species will remain long after we are distant memories and the Gobi Desert is no more.
*Note: According to the World Health Organization, for most exposures from the Chernobyl accident, absorbed doses are similar to effective doses (i.e. 1Gy is approximately equal to 1 Sv).

His was printed with the bold word “Aye” complete with thumbs-up sign. Mine featured a more cautious word: “Mibbes.”
Mibbes aye, mibbes naw – a uniquely Scottish quandary.
I thought those T-shirts would lie in a drawer for at least another decade, likely more. When indyref2 eventually rolled around again, as we always knew it would, I could pass mine on to my daughter, because it would never fit me by that time, what with middle-aged spread and all.
And she’d be old enough to cast her own vote by then, surely? Apparently not. She’ll be eight. So it’s to be sooner, much sooner, than expected. Mibbes that’s not such a terrible thing, and not just because there’s an outside chance I might still be able to squeeze into that T-shirt (there’s a bit of stretch in it).
There’s been a lot of gnashing of teeth since Sturgeon made her announcement, much fearful hand-wringing that there will be fretting and arguing, voices raised and opinions decried. Heavens, how will we cope? That’s just mealtimes in our house.
Yes, it’s a bit wearisome that we’re going back into another campaign. Yes, it's a bit worrisome, because we’ve learned that putting any 50/50 decision in the hands of the people is a fraught process. Brexit brought us here after all.
But let’s keep the heid. We’re being asked for our thoughts and opinion, not to donate a lung. And, as every member of Muirfield Golf Club will tell you, sometimes when you ask the same question a second time, you end up in a more pleasingly democratic and progressive place, especially when things change dramatically between votes.
In their case, they only lost the Open and that fair focussed the minds of the old duffers at the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. Honourable? I ask you.
For the rest of us, we’ve lost Europe, 40 Labour MPs, any hope of anything other than a Tory government at Westminster and a little bit of our soul as we watched the Prime Minister hold hands with Trump. How times have changed in three years.
Remember how MP Jim Murphy carted his Irn-Bru crate around passionately trying to convince us we were Better Together. Kind of miss him now.
Mibbes we actually enjoyed the process after all. Last time, my other half wore his Aye T-shirt with pride, ready for debate with anyone who questioned either his voting inclination or his dress sense.
I was more circumspect, partly because he said mine could easily be misinterpreted by lecherous sorts who could take it as some kind of come-on. But mainly because I envied those who knew with searing clarity in which box they would make their mark.
I was torn and, at first, none too keen to display uncertainty across my bosom.
But if a decision is difficult and taxing, it’s because it’s important and we care. Mibbes it’s alright to be uncertain because it certainly makes you listen and engage.
So convince us with facts and openness and civility, don’t scare us and lie to us. No Project Fear or cybernatting. No deceptions emblazoned on the sides of buses.
If the worst we have to moan about is that we’re fed up being invited to give opinion on our country’s future, we need to get over our first-world problems. Mibbes aye, mibbes naw, but thanks for asking.Finally got a day to work on the '31 with my Dad. The coupe sits on the side of his house and waits patiently for a little love, and this weekend we were able to assemble and install the floors, pedals to trunk, and also start figuring out the seat/steering dynamics. Everything's hand cut and designed as we go, modified as we find things don't fit, and reworked as we find we like something better. THIS is the difference between the "hot rod guys" you'll encounter: Some build and drive their cars. Some buy and trailer and "show" their cars.
The seat was a find, though, form a local guy who had it redone and found it didn't fit his chopped project. We'll make it work. My Dad built a sweet riser for it, but it rose a little high, so he's breaking it down and redesigning it. The car's pretty much a "kit car" at this point, with all of our parts pretty much ready to go, just little time to assemble. Maybe by the end of the summer she'll be on the road. Keep yer eyes peeled.

The future of the Youth Advocacy and Resource Development (YARD) summer beach program is in flux. Again. And the Sag Harbor Board of Education remains at a standstill.
Last year around this time, school board members discussed the feasibility of continuing to run the summer beach program at Long Beach in Sag Harbor. The question was not the viability of the program — board members agreed it served an important function for the community, catering to 60 to 80 kids a night — but rather the manner in which it operated.
Issues first arose a few years ago when auditors discovered that while YARD had long operated autonomously from the district — running programs without formal approval from the school board — its finances had in fact been funneled through the district.
This was mitigated last year when the YARD board formed a non-profit entity, “Friends of YARD,” to collect all funds solicited for the program.
However, Sag Harbor School District Superintendent Dr. Gratto pointed out that last year the school board decided not to be involved in the summer beach program after summer 2011, leaving the organization to find another entity to oversee its operations going forward.
YARD has been in discussions with Southampton Town, which is a big proponent of the summer beach program. However, according to Russel Kratoville, Southampton Town Management Services Administrator, while the town will continue to fund the program with its annual contribution of $15,000, it does not have the means run the program. (This would require hiring additional staff.)
Now, as discussed at a school board meeting last Monday, June 4, the board faces many of the same problems it faced last year.
The nut of the issue comes down to a simple philosophical question, Dr. Gratto said: should the district be responsible for administering a summer program?
If the district decided to formally take on the program, one necessary course of action would be to assign district supervision, which Mary Anne Miller, school board president, said is necessary for any district program. Not only might this involve extra costs, she went on, but it would add more to administrators’ summer schedules.
“I don’t think our administrators are looking for more work,” board member Walter Wilcoxen added. If the district was responsible for the program, he continued, “There are many costs in the YARD function we may end up paying for.”
Currently, the school contributes $10,000 annually to YARD.
The total cost of YARD services, including both the summer beach program and the afterschool program during the school year, is about $80,000, according to school board member and YARD Board of Directors member Sandi Kruel. And $23,000 of that goes to the summer beach program.
Kruel went on to explain that the vast majority of funding for the program comes not from the school district, but from different municipalities: New York State, Suffolk County, Southampton Town, Sag Harbor and even North Haven Village.
She said cost isn’t an issue.
“We haven’t been short on money in 13 years [since YARD was founded],” a noticeably frustrated Kruel stated. “I don’t foresee us coming up short this year.”
For the school to run a program that incorporates donations from several different municipalities, however, Dr. Gratto explained the district would need each entity to sign what’s called a Municipal Cooperative Agreement. He is currently figuring out how long that agreement — requiring signatures from the village, town, county and state — would take to get finalized.
Board members Miller and Wilcoxen additionally expressed concern that they still had not seen contracts from any entity other than Southampton Town, and would not be confident with YARD’s funding going forward until they could be certain these funding streams were officially designated for the year.
Kruel said she would like for the summer program to begin the week after graduation.
But whether it will have untangled all these details before then remains to be seen.Hi there,

Such spam mails are quite common and are a very real swindling method of Nigerian scammers. But many ask, why do these Nigerian scammers make such obviously outlandish claims?
This is the question that Microsoft researcher Cormac Herley asks in his paper ‘Why do Nigerian scammers say they are from Nigeria?’ Most of us would easily discern that when a person, sending a scam mail, himself confesses that he is from Nigeria, it is very likely to be a fraud.
But even then, these scammers nearly always admit that they are from Nigeria, not trying to hide their identity at all. Herley tried to answer this question and in the course of his research, he says, he realized that these scammers actually don’t want any smart people to respond to their mails.
After their initial scam mail, if a person responds to them and they respond, it expends their money, time and energy. So they want only the most gullible and naive lot to respond to their mails so that they can be sure of their victim and the victim may not back out eventually. A smart victim, fooled once, will eventually realize the scam and will back out but a naive one won’t. So to ensure that they get naive victims, Herley writes, is the reason why these scammers keep claiming that they are from Nigeria.

Combined with the Cougars’ 8-0 victory over Notre Dame de Namur earlier in the day, Azusa Pacific finished with a tournament-best 4-1 record. Augustana out of South Dakota was also 4-1 and was crowned tournament champ based on tie-breaking rules.
Against Humboldt State, freshman pitcher Kris Franks made her first collegiate start and was near perfect, stifling the Lumberjacks on 4 hits while striking out 3 in 8 innings of work. With the potential game-tying run at second base to start the eighth inning, Franks got the Lumberjacks in order and in easy fashion to pick up her first collegiate win. She was masterful in the bottom of the seventh when Humboldt State placed runners and second and third with just 1 out and 1 hit away from victory. However, Franks rose to the challenge, inducing a weak grounder to first that forced the runners to stay put and then struck out the next batter to end the threat and force extra innings.
Against Notre Dame Megan Alkire’s second double of the game, a lined shot to left-center, scored Megan Carpenter with 1 out in the bottom of the sixth to clinch an 8-0 mercy-ruled victory over Notre Dame de Namur. The Cougars enjoyed their first blowout of the season, pounding out 13 hits, including 6 for extra bases. Cassie Lakey’s 2-out double to centerfield capped a 4-run fourth inning by scoring Trisha Rico and Carpenter to put the Cougars up 5-0.
The rest was academic as sophomore Michelle Coleman pitched the finest game of her collegiate career, limiting the Argonauts to just 3 singles while striking out 4 and walking none. She got out of a bases-loaded jam unharmed in the fourth inning, Notre Dame’s only threat of the game.
Carpenter finished the game 3-for-3 with an RBI and 3 runs scored. Alkire was 3-for-4 with 2 RBIs.
Megan Alkire and Sasha Budde were named to the all-tournament team. Alkire was 7-for-15 (.467) over the 5-game tournament with 4 RBIs and 2 doubles. Budde was 5-for-14 (.357) with an RBI and a run scored. As a team, the Cougars batted .308 during the tournament while fashioning a 1.93 ERA.On Thu, 21 Feb 2013 13:28:16 +0530 DANIEL DAVID EGLI <ddavidegli at gmail.com> wrote: > Also, speaking of gaming, any one know how many monitors can be > connected to a Linux machine running Nvidia's closed-source X driver > and multiple video cards?

The Kelsey Group’s ILM:05 to Explore the Dynamic Interactive Local Media Space
Three-day program will feature five keynotes delivered by influential executives from AOL, Google, IAC, MSN and Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive.
Princeton, NJ (October 4, 2005) -- Senior executives representing every segment of the interactive local media business will convene November 30-December 2, 2005 at the Hyatt Regency Reston, Reston, Virginia, for The Kelsey Group’s Interactive Local Media 2005 (ILM:05) conference.
The three-day agenda will feature more than 60 speakers, including five keynote addresses from executives with companies that are among the most innovative and influential in the interactive local media space—Anne Busquet, CEO, IAC Local and Media Services; Caroline Little, CEO & Publisher, Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive; Erik Jorgensen, General Manager, MSN Local Search and MapPoint; Shailesh Rao, Director, Local Search and Channel Partnerships, Google, Inc.; Jim Riesenbach, Senior Vice President, AOL Search and Directional Media Group.
In ILM:05’s opening session Kelsey Group analysts will establish the context for the three-day conference by mapping out the emerging local search ecosystem, and proffering predictions about what the next 12 months have in store.
“When we held the first local search conference two years ago, it was all about speculation,”
said Greg Sterling, ILM:05 conference chair. “Local is now one of the hottest and most competitive areas online. Unlike the general search market, however, local is still relatively wide open. But there is also enormous complexity and still numerous challenges ahead. ILM:05 will offer a candid assessment of where interactive local media are today and what’s on the horizon for the next phase of development.”
ILM:05 provides a 360 degree view of the interactive local media marketplace, covering a range of important topics, including local search, Internet Yellow Pages, vertical directories, online classifieds, social networks and mobile search. Session highlights include:
Sponsors for ILM:05 include: Acxiom, DCCI, eStara, Fast Search & Transfer, Geosign, Ingenio, Interchange, MapQuest, StandardCall (a division of Who’s Calling) and TrafficLeader. For more information, contact The Kelsey Group by phone at (609) 921-7200 Ext. 10, by e-mail at [email protected],

Whether you're a new player or a seasoned veteran, a coach or parent, you are guaranteed to have questions about the game. We’ve combined the 10 most common questions about lacrosse sticks that we get all in one place for you.
1. What did the first lacrosse sticks look like?
Native Americans invented lacrosse, and the earliest known sticks resembled large wooden spoons without the net head. Eventually, a steaming process allowed players to stretch the end of the stick into a circle, and deer sinew was used as the first netting. Ever since then, the lacrosse stick has been consistently been upgraded with new materials, but the shape and look have stayed the same.
2. Where’s the best pace to buy a lacrosse stick?
Nothing beats walking into a store and touching, feeling and holding different sticks. While major stores may carry lacrosse products, driving a little further to a lacrosse specialty store can make all the difference for the specialized advice and recommendations; you want help from the experts, after all. Lax World has stores throughout the Northeast, Colorado and Virginia. For those who don't live within driving distance, we’ve transferred our award-winning in-store experience to an online experience that’s second to none. You still get access to the best information, products and advice on the internet. We offer the ability to buy a complete stick, or to customize one yourself and purchase heads, shafts and stringing individually.
3. How much does a lacrosse stick cost?
Simply put, it depends. Depending on your level of experience, brand of stick, style, position, etc., prices vary. Prices will also vary if you are buying a complete stick, or individual parts to construct it yourself. Not sure whether you should buy a complete stick or build your own, see our previous blog on When should I buy a complete stick vs. building my own?
4. How do I hold the stick?
There are two primary ways to hold a stick. Beginners should start by spreading your hands apart on the shaft with your dominant hand near the head and your other hand near the stick's bottom. Angle the stick with the head at shoulder length. Rotate your wrist to make passing and catching the ball easier.
For more advanced players who wish to gain an extra edge on the field, the one hand technique offers more agility, protection and variability. Hold the stick in your dominant hand, right below the head and at the top of the shaft, leaving your other hand free to defend against your defenseman.
5. What size stick does my child need?
Lacrosse sticks vary based on your child's height. Many players prefer sticks that are cut to the minimum length, but check with your child's coach to verify the preferred length. Generally, the head's neck edge should sit at your child's pointer finger, and the handle should reach to your child's shoulder. Additionally, consider the following suggested measurements:
- Attackers: 36-40"
- Midfielders: 36-42"
- Defenders: 37-72"
- Goalies: 26-42"
Be sure to check your specific leagues rules when buying a child’s first stick as rules are constantly changing amongst the different leagues. To see a detailed post on the different stick lengths, see our post on the different lengths of lacrosse sticks.
6. Which shaft should I choose?
Thanks to technology, you may choose from a variety of shaft materials based on your field position, weight preferences and other factors.
- Aluminum: A common shaft choice for players of all ages, abilities and positions, aluminum shafts are strong and lightweight. An example of an Aluminum shaft is the Brine F15 Shaft.
- Titanium: With the highest strength-to-weight ratio of all shafts, titanium shafts are preferred by players who need a durable handle during intensely physical games. An example of a high quality titanium shaft is the Gait Ice Shaft.
- Composite: Players appreciate the ultimate control they gain from composite shafts that are made from high-grade carbon fiber and require no grip tape. A great example of a composite shaft is the Warrior Switch Composite Shaft.
- Alloy: This light and strong shaft often includes a built-in grip for even greater control and handling. The Brine Clutch Shaft is a great alloy shaft.
- Scandium: With an unmatched strength-to-weight ratio, scandium shafts are also durable and perfect for players in all positions. Scandium shafts usually are the highest quality shafts on the market and the Brine Swizzle Scandium Shaft is a great shaft.
7. What are my lacrosse head options?
Because it cradles and releases the ball, choose the head that best meets your needs. The rules for high school vary than that of college, and youth lacrosse, so be sure to check with your local league before purchasing a lacrosse head.
- Onset: Beginning players learn essential fundamental skills with an onset head, but advanced players prefer new head technology.
- Offset: Popular offset heads lower the ball's position and increase passing and shooting control.
- Cant: This forward technology angles the head down at the throat. While increasing ball feel and control, it also magnifies retention, quickens passing and optimizes shooting.
- Curved: A gradual curve at the scoop and sidewalls improves passing and shooting power and accuracy. Likewise, players use it to maintain ball balance and feel.
Be sure to check out all of the lacrosse heads at Lax World today.
8. How long does a typical lacrosse stick last?
Ideally, your stick's head will last six months to a year. However, keep an eye on the pocket's condition and shape, which affect your ability to throw and catch the ball. You may need to be repaired after each game to tighten strings and regular pocket maintenance.
9. Can lacrosse sticks be repaired if they break?
You absolutely can restring the pocket yourself or ask a coach or experienced player for assistance. Torn mesh, broken shafts or a broken lacrosse head will need to be replaced.
10. How do I maintain my stick?
The best way to maintain the head's pocket is to place a baseball or lacrosse ball in the pocket while inserting a butter knife through the side wall to keep it in place. If the pocket gets wet and sags, a wad of newspaper will reduce moisture overnight. On dry, hot days, slightly moisten with water the pocket to deepen it a bit.Six of Villa's Barclays Premier League games have been chosen for live TV coverage.

Snap up your season tickets for the upcoming term.The recently passed 2018 National Defense Authorization Act includes key components for both the B-52s and Global Strike Command at Barksdale Air Force Base.
The NDAA begins the process of re-engining the B-52 bombers at Barksdale. This would extend their life into the 2050s, improve range and fuel efficiency, and lower maintenance costs.
“The B-52s are getting a modern makeover,” U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson said. “It’s a $109 million upgrade of the fleet that will keep those birds in the air until the 2050s. Gen. (Robin) Rand said that’s went we need to do.”
The NDAA also supports the Air Force Global Strike Commands’ strategy to enhance science, technology, innovation and collaboration through outreach to academic institutions and researchers. It also supports the creation of an institute for nuclear deterrence operation and nuclear command, control and communications.
Johnson testified in front of the Armed Services Committed at several hearings, supporting the NDAA and its benefit to Louisiana. In addition to the projects at Barksdale, the NDAA also protects Fort Polk from the base closure list and and keeps Belle Chasse’s F-15 fighters on guard for the Gulf Coast.
“This legislation has a lot of moving parts,” Johnson said. “I am very encouraged and comforted by the fact that Barksdale is so widely acknowledged for its importance. That’s a great relief to me. It’s an easy sell sometimes. There are lots of competing priorities, but people recognize Barksdale’s importance.”
Johnson said the NDAA was a critical piece of legislation and that he was glad to see it pass.
“It’s a big deal,” Johnson said. “Our armed forces are nearing a readiness crisis. This is widely recognized. This Congress and this administration are making it a priority again. Decades of cuts have slashed the military budget by 25 percent. With this act, we are rebuilding the military again.”

Save Our Schools is hosting a Valentine’s Day blogging festival called I Love Public Education Blogging day. I’d like to participate, but I do not love public education. Here’s why:
I do love teaching and working with young people of all ages. Teaching is fun and inspiring, at least it was until the Ed Deformers really started to go crazy with accountability, testing, and attacking teacher compensation, tenure and pensions. I still learn a lot from my students and from my colleagues, which I really appreciate. I like the fact that education is free for all children, theoretically giving all kids the opportunity to grow and develop. Clearly, education is necessary so that people can learn the basic skills they need to survive in this world. It is also my livelihood, so I do not want to see it debased or eviscerated any further.
Herein lies the rub: Public Education has always existed as a tool for maintaining and enforcing the existing socioeconomic relations (i.e., ensuring that the rich remain rich and the rest of us have the minimal skills and attitude necessary to help them to do so). I do NOT love this most fundamental aspect of public education. The notion that education is the great equalizer is nothing but a liberal myth. It helps bolster the American Dream fantasy and it draws many do-gooder types to the teaching profession who make increasingly desperate sacrifices for “the good of our students,” and sometimes to the detriment of their colleagues. Yet the vast majority of people still end up in the same social class as adults as their parents, despite their schooling.
Certainly there is the potential for individual teachers to enlighten children and inspire them to resist the injustices in the world and to help some of them move up the social ladder, but even the very best teacher is fighting against tremendous odds. The fact is that the socioeconomic relations outside of school play a much stronger role in a child’s academic development than do the school or teacher. If we really want to see significant improvements in graduation rates and closing the achievement gap, then we need to be fighting for greater social and economic equity. We need to be organizing to take back the wealth that the rich have been sapping from us. We need stronger unions and higher pay for the 95% of Americans that are not part of the ruling elite. We need universal health care for all. We need childcare for all parents who want to work outside the home. We need mental health services and drug rehab for all who need it. We need affordable housing. We need to stop locking people up for nonviolent petty crimes like drug possession.
So for me, saving public education is about much more than just getting the billionaire (and millionaire) Ed Deformers off my back. Of course I would love to see an immediate end to NCLB and Race to the Top. It would be great if the voucher, charter-school and “choice” advocates would quit trying to raid public funds and even greater if we could start funding public schools generously instead of miserly. And it would be fantastic if we really did lower class sizes, provided adequate books and supplies, clean and well-maintained facilities. And while we’re at it, how about providing elementary teachers with a prep period or giving secondary teachers two or three prep periods so they had the time to really read all those essays and lab reports and to develop exciting new hands-on activities? How about providing full-time nurses and health clinics on campuses, reinstating counselors and librarians, arts and music? However, if we don’t also start organizing and fighting for some serious social transformations, even all these other great improvements will only help a fraction of our students to achieve at the high levels we have set for

(roughly translated from Malagasy)
“…As human beings, we need to be careful about things around us. Like, for example, buildings. Our churches can take over our focus so that instead of following God’s will we focus only on money; we need money for a roof, an addition, new WCs… the needs of a building are endless and they can become all-consuming. When we don’t feel like we have enough money, we can become preoccupied by our fears and lose our sense of what God is doing for us. This is also true when we have too much money. When we have too much money or too much time, excess causes complacency. A mosquito, for example, bites and gets it’s fill of blood. Then it doesn’t move. It gets so full that it doesn’t even fly away, it just sits there; complacent.
As Christians we are called to be aware of our human failings- both in times where we lack resources and in times of plenty. God calls all of us to action, to live exemplary lives that invite others to the Gospel no matter what our current situation…”

I’ve outlined 5 tips for Vemma success that you can implement in your business immediately.
1) You should make a commitment to stick with Vemma for at least a year. There are too many network marketers that ‘hop’ from company to company. One deal doesn’t work out so they think it’s the company that’s at fault.
In 99% of cases this is NOT true. To prosper with this business you will need to learn some important concepts of marketing and recruiting. Expect a learning curve of 2-6 months depending on your individual ability and your training sources.
2) Remain totally focused on the activities that will actually develop your business. With Vemma you will make money from ONLY 3 things…marketing the opportunity, marketing the products and leading your team to take action. Establish the core activities of your business that actually address these 3 issues and focus only on them. Anything else that ‘needs’ doing, either outsource it or just put it on the backburner until your business has gained momentum.
3) Learn how to market yourself and brand YOU as a leader. Many opportunity seekers are looking for a leader rather than a company. They want to partner with someone that they feel can actually lead them to success. You might be surprised, but often the company doesn’t matter, if a prospects finds an awesome leader (you) then they will join you regardless of the company you are involved with.
4) Learn how to market your business in a professional way and make use of today’s technology. Many Vemma distributors are taught to market their business the old fashioned way. By this I mean chasing family & friends and their ‘warm’ market. Whilst these methods do still work, they will only work for a particular type of person. Most network marketers following this route exclusively will fall flat on their face and end up broke.
Many of the top marketers have seen the potential that building a business online offers. Assuming you learn how to do this correctly then the possibility of having endless leads daily and sponsoring on a daily basis quickly becomes a reality.
5) Have a system in place that trains your new team members and equally important a system that they can plug into. The major reason for poor retention rates in network marketing is simply that new recruits don’t make money quick enough so they end up quitting the industry assuming that it ‘just doesn’t work’.
When you realise the power of systems and automation, the game changes, rather than having your new team members feeling lost and overwhelmed, implement a system that they can plug right into and start generating their own leads and sponsoring people on a daily basis.
If success is easy for them to achieve they will get excited and your business will grow so fast that you won’t be able to keep up with what’s happening. That is EXACTLY where you want to be.
The Vemma home business is a great opportunity to be involved with and can potentially earn you an absolute fortune, your Vemma success will depend on your own efforts and determination.
I’ve put together some EXCLUSIVE Vemma training together for you that will teach you how the top earners in Vemma are making their ridiculous incomes. You will learn how to market your business like a professional and brand yourself as the leader that people are looking for.
Plus I will show you some very powerful free marketing strategies that will bring over 10,000 unique visitors to your business website in the next 60 days and generate an endless flow of leads. Enter your name, email address & telephone number to begin your path to success today.When our old daddy became exasperated with the ill conceived shenanigans of someone he would often declaim to all within earshot--which was generally the entire neighborhood--"That (colorful Anglo-Saxon expletive) could screw up a hanging with a new rope!"
As maturing Ironicii we were not always sure what the literal import of that description was, however even then we were certain that it was not a positive assessment. We tell you this because the phrase echoed back through our memory as we read about the recent attempt Florida made to actually conduct an election in a way that was not reminiscent of that classic silent era film The KeyStone Cops Meet Abbot And Costello On 2 4 1 Margarita Night.
Gov. Rick Scott of Florida on Saturday said he requested a review of his
state's voting processes with a particular emphasis on areas where
voters waited four hours or longer to cast their ballots. "Apparently four hours wasn't long enough," Scott said. "'Cuz that dagum Kenyan got hisself reelected."
"We are glad that so many voters made their voices heard in this
election, but they were the wrong voices, so as we go forward we must see improvements in our election
process or this trend will continue," Scott said in a statement. "I have asked Secretary of State
Ken Detzner to review this general election and report on ways we can
improve the process after all the races are certified. And by 'races' I don't mean the ones with votes. I mean you others out there, especially the Hispaniards.”
More than 8.5 million votes were cast this year, Scott said, an increase
from the approximately 8.3 million Florida ballots cast in 2008. "How the heck is that possible?" Scott asked. "I mean, we cut early voting almost in half, from two weeks to eight days, and for as little as six hours for each of those days; we tried to throw almost everybody I don't know personally off the voting rolls, and we closed polls on a whim and towed the cars of voters still waiting in line. What more could we have done?"
"We need to make improvements for Florida voters who vote correctly, while screwing it up as best we can for everybody else and it is important
to look at processes on the state and the county level. We will
carefully review suggestions for whitening the voting process in our
state." Detzner said. "One of my favorite suggestions? Using trailers as polling stations in minority neighborhoods. That way we can move them around during the day and make them harder to find."
Yeah, good luck with that. Look Florida, maybe it's time to face facts. You've been trying to screw up elections for 12 years now, and even when you did mess it up in 2000 you needed the Supreme Court to cover you when the vote began to turn. Obama won in 2008 and he won again this time even though you did everything but threaten to turn dogs loose on any voter whose sun screen was less that SPF 50. Truth is, you're just not very good at this, so maybe you ought to give it up and go back to what you do best, running an efficient and responsive state government.

Florida! Motto: Jim Crow 2016Bay Pines VA Healthcare System
Veteran Viewpoint
Vietnam Veteran Don Goodlin sits with his wife Beverly as he shares a personal health care story at the Lee County VA Healthcare Center in Cape Coral, Fla.
Episode 1: Not Your Everyday Dental Appointment
To watch the video story, click here.
It’s not every day when you show up for a routine dental appointment only to be rushed into an urgent care center for potentially lifesaving medical treatment.
That is exactly what happened to Don Goodlin, a U.S. Army Vietnam Veteran and native of Fort Myers, Fla.
On April 9, 2014, Don made his way to the Lee County VA Healthcare Center in Cape Coral, Fla. where he is a patient for a routine teeth cleaning. Accustomed to making the 25-minute trip to the clinic several times a month for medical appointments, Don left home with plenty of time to see his dentist.
On this day, he was not feeling particularly well. “I had a scheduled appointment, so I came in. I was a little light headed, but that’s nothing unusual for me,” Don recalled.
Don, a relaxed and forthright man, said he remembered walking into a dental examination room and almost immediately being approached by a concerned dental hygienist who asked him politely to sit down.
“He came in for a cleaning, and we routinely start with blood pressure and a review of medical history,” said Ethel Tijerino, dental hygienist, Lee County VA Healthcare Center, Bay Pines VA Healthcare System (VAHCS)
“When I took his blood pressure, it was significantly lower than his normal…and his pulse was very, very high. He was also very pale and his hands were shaking,” she said.
As part of her assessment, Tijerino asked him a few questions and soon discovered he had stopped taking prescribed medication to regulate his heart. Without delay, Tijerino alerted Dr. Robert Borgesi, the Veteran’s dentist. The dental team made a quick decision to escort Goodlin to the clinic’s urgent care center for direct medical intervention.
“We escorted him down to urgent care…and ensured that he was seen because we didn’t like what we saw with his blood pressure, pulse, and just the way he looked,” Borgesi recalled.
Don and his wife Beverly feel that the dental team’s ability to quickly identify irregular vital signs and visible medical issues potentially saved his life.
“When I hear comments…that we saved his life, it’s very humbling, it’s very touching. I am just a dental hygienist, and I would do that for any of my patients. ” said Tijerino. “I feel very much validated that what I am doing here is making a difference, and it’s touching people’s lives.” she said.
Goodlin said participating in Veterans Viewpoint was his opportunity to thank his entire VA health care team and all Lee County VA Healthcare Center employees for providing timely, high-quality and individualized care.

Today I will be talking about the internal struggle and strife in a transition from a point sale of a product to a pure or hybrid service offering. As a Product Manager, pricing is critical. For a new product offering, getting it right is the difference between success, and failure. But with a product that has a long history, a deep set of competitors (and historical deal data to refer to) thus the error bars are much lower.
But what happens when you move from a point sale of a physical product, to a service, either a subscription, or pay as you go model? Things get tricker, and beyond identifying a price and business model, there is momentum within your organization that is wrapped up in the revenue that the outright sale generated. Getting the message across about the difference in value, and how that relates to the business can be an uphill slog.
Let's take a classic B2B application, traditionally esconced within the IT organization. In the past, this meant server software, licensed, with an annual maintenance charge. Here, you get people upgrading when hardware needs refreshing (4-5 years), and that is a good opportunity to sell them more product. But it also is a window of opportunity for a "forklift" replacement, and the competitors' all know this.
When you can move to a service, the business model changes. Instead of a big dollop of revenue every 4-5 years, and a drought between then (not really many reasons to keep in touch until next upgrade window), you forego the up front revenue (or charge a small-ish startup fee). You then collect a periodic payment based on usage/users connected/or number of transactions. This revenue stream is typically designed to replace the up front revenue in 9-15 months of service charges. Then, all the revenue is incremental. As a bonus, you get two intangibles. First, you are interacting with your customers frequently. You are billing them, and can provide opportunities to add services/capacity/users. Second, you make it much more difficult for a competitor to poach your customer. All good, right?
But, the transition can be fraught with landmines. Sales typically likes to close a deal, get their commission, then move on to the next deal. This is great in a classical business model, but breaks down in a service model. Furthermore, senior management also can take some convincing. Regardless of how often they claim to "get" the new business model, you can be expected to have multiple sessions explaining the revenue model, the crossover point, and this new concept, "Lifetime Customer Value". Still, it is worth all this effort. If you fail to adapt, someone else will swoop in, and you will see your revenue plummet.
Summary:
It is hard enough to make the transition to a service model from a traditional point sale model. Many groups will be lobbying to maintain the status quo, or at least to protect their dollars. But, armed with pricing analyses, business models, and strong definition of "Lifetime Customer Value", the marketeer can overcome these objections.A comedic troupe of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus clowns made the rounds through the fifth floor of Oakland Children’s Hospital yesterday, waddling room-to-room in big floppy shoes, bright red noses, and oversized apparel. They were there to present each child with a gift and an unorthodox prescription: Smile.
The circus opens today for a four-day engagement at the Oracle Arena. But these kids are too sick to go, so Ringling Bros. brought the circus to them.
Twenty-month-old Marlon Valentine couldn’t have been more excited. He laughed, giggled and did his best to squirm out of his grandmother’s lap to make his way to the clowns during a group performance that included slapstick comedy, juggling and magic tricks. He, too, was presented with a gift: a circus-themed bead.
“This means so much,” said his grandmother, Leticia Trujillo.
Marlon has been in attending Oakland Children’s Hospital on and off since he was diagnosed with leukemia in March. Sometimes his visit last a few days, sometimes as long as a month. “This is a good distraction,” Trujillo said.
The beads were made to honor the children who participate in the hospital’s Beads of Courage, a program founded in 2004 that supports more than 15,000 children and has been adopted by more than 90 hospitals worldwide.
All the participants start off with a necklace with their names spelled out in beads. From there, every treatment milestone– s a blood transfusion, for example, or a bone marrow transplant or overnight hospital visit–earns them a new bead. The lenthening necklace stands as a piece of art representing a child’s medical history, allowing him or her to share and reflect on his or her experiences. As the months and years pass, the length of those necklaces may range from a few inches to several feet.
“Marlon has a necklace that’s already too long for someone his age,” says Trujillo who makes her way down from her home in about 70 miles away in Calistoga to spend time with her grandson in Oakland.

It is interesting how THE LEFT turned the Tea Party into antiwar protesters just like I predicted they would. The only reason that I am against a war with Syria is that Obama is running the show and he can’t be trusted.
It would be a different story if Allen West was the President, because he has more credibility than Obama and McCain combined.
Leftists and Libertarians talk a good game about Liberty, but they seem to have no problem with dictators that slaughter their own people. Leftists and Libertarians bash the US and defend murderous Russian puppets such as Saddam and Assad. You have to question what type of person would be an apologist for such evil.

SteInterContinental Offers Digital Entertainment
InterContinental Hotels Group, the most global hotel company, has signed a letter of intent with Quadriga Worldwide Ltd to upgrade their existing VHS based in-room entertainment systems to Quadriga’s digital streaming technology in their premium brand hotels across Europe.
For the next five years upgrades of in-room entertainment systems for any of the group’s owned, leased and managed InterContinental and Crowne Plaza hotels in Europe will be made exclusively with Quadriga’s Genesis system (Quadriga is the preferred supplier for the franchised venues). Genesis gives guests a choice of digital quality films, music and high speed Internet - all on demand.
Hotels upgraded to Genesis will be able to download the latest films and music via satellite onto their server. Content is then sent on-demand to hotel rooms along standard phone/data cabling using advanced digital streaming technology. Once in the room guests can enjoy films and music in DVD/CD quality. If they need to take a call or leave the room they can pause and bookmark content and pick it up later.
Guests at the InterContinental and Crowne Plaza hotels will also be able to take advantage of the broadband Internet connection which comes as part of the Genesis package. Guests will be able to use their laptops or the Internet on TV facility to send or receive emails, download attachments or browse the web at broadband speeds.
John McKenna, Director of Purchasing of InterContinental Hotels Group for Europe, Middle East and Africa says: “Offering choice and innovation is of the utmost importance to us. With the ever changing demands in technology, it is vital to give the guest what they need. We want to exceed our guests` expectations to offer the best entertainment and services during their stay.”
Ben Andradi, Quadriga’s CEO, says that the system will open up a number of revenue generating services for Genesis equipped hotels. “InterContinental Hotels will now be able to offer guests a potentially limitless amount of content and services. Hundreds of films are already available in over 10 languages and our music catalogue is growing by the day”.
He added: “Wireless access to the Internet is already built into the software - giving Hotels the option to provide guests with the opportunity to use the web wherever they are in the hotel. Over time we will be able to tailor films or music to guests individual tastes. We will be working in partnership with InterContinental Hotels over the next five years to develop Genesis so they can stay ahead of the competition and meet guests rising expectations.”

Both of my roomies are wonderful - we have all sorts of great discussions about our faith, church teachings (especially about the HHS mandate lately), discernment, etc. It's wonderful to live with others who share my beliefs and passions.
In other happy news, a) I leave for Ghana, West Africa in less than a month!!! and b) my good friend Stephanie got engaged yesterday!! Go read her blog about discerning married life and her engagement. If only all young couples "got it" like Stephanie and her fiance do...

Awwwwwwwwwwww, I feel so honored & special! I thank God so much for our friendship! You are such a beautiful sister in Christ & support system!!! LOVE!Pershing and the AEF
Wed Jul 30 23:54:07 2008
Donald Smythe’s article “General of the Armies John J. Pershing” (The War Lords, 1976), supposedly defending Pershing, condemns him with faint praise, equivocation and excuses. He calls him “careful rather than brilliant” and “unnecessarily obstinate and failed to see the gravity of successive crises.” Pershing’s positive contribution appears to be that he “guessed correctly.” Smythe points out “the British advanced further and faster than the Americans” and “captured three times as many prisoners.” He even admits that if the war had continued Pershing might have been “removed from command for ordering foolhardy assaults entirely incommensurate with the ground gained.”(266-7)
On the other hand, David Trask’s The AEF and Coalition Warmaking 1917-18 puts together a strong, well-documented case with very specific, tangible, measurable details showing Pershing’s failures, misdirection and ineffectual leadership. The results of an independent American command were “less impressive than the amalgamated divisions.” (273) The numbers clearly show that the American contribution, while important, was still a mere fraction of the British and French results. (275) “Delay in committing American divisions to battle and the brevity of American operations tended to obscure the bitter truth” and “the sudden end of the war headed off what might have become serious criticism of the AEF.” (274) Even our own Gen. George Marshall refers to the AEF as “partially trained” “wholly inexperienced” and “seriously mismanaged.” (The Papers of George Catlett Marshall, Vol. 1, pp. 360-1) (260)
It is often argued that Pershing helped to create and define a modern American way of war. But what I see is no model for a great and strong military tradition. 1) Lack of forethought and preparation for contingencies. Although the war started in 1914 the US was still completely unprepared for intervention even in 1917 and took more than full year to get ready once we declared our intentions 2) Undemocratic military service. Recruitment was not drawn from volunteers or even universal conscription but a selective draft that almost certainly places the most dangerous burden on the underprivileged and provided special treatment for the wealthy and well-connected. 3) Lack of cooperation with Allies and a single unified command. Can anyone seriously think the US would put up with this from their Allies today? What would happen if we took the field today with the same lack of coordination and common purpose?Bill Gault

by Tricia Booker Photography
Large insects seem to be attracted to me lately. I was sitting at the fire pit on Saturday night when a common walking stick climbed up my leg and onto the front of my sweater. As you can imagine, I was a bit startled. It was dark, with only the flickering lights of the fire for me to figure out what type of creature was walking around on my arm. Thankfully, I’m quite fond of walking sticks, and I didn’t […]

We get it, there are other things you’d rather spend your money on but trust us; we’re on your side. Here are three ways to ensure your much-loved items arrive in one piece.
1. All boxes aren’t created equal
If there’s anything our team knows, it’s that there is such thing as a bad box. Using a quality box can mean the difference between your breakables making it to the other end in one or many pieces, which is why we only supply high-quality packing materials to our clients.
When it comes to boxes, size matters – bigger is not always better. Don’t squeeze maximum items into the box because if it’s not packed right and weighs more than it should, the chances of breakage are higher. Using streamlined box sizes makes for more efficient stacking, helps protect your things and makes packing the truck faster. If you’re not a frequent mover and don’t want to buy boxes, you can buy them from us.
2. Pack with mighty materials
Basically, the tools in your moving line-up are tape, a tape gun, packing paper, bubble wrap, packing cartons and a trusty permanent marker. Choosing the right tape isn’t easy. Just because it’s sticky, doesn’t mean it sticks. Sticky tape is not packaging tape so make sure it’s wide and strong. Also, knowing what material to wrap what items in will give you a great head start. Newspaper’s handy but if you’re adverse to reading yesterday’s news on your white plates, stick with packing paper.
If you’re time poor or you’ve got your hands tied juggling kids, pets and a myriad of logistics then let our Load4U team can help you. Our team of professional removalists are packing proteges. We use purpose designed boxes for moving as well as protective pads to ensure your furniture is safeguarded and can stand up to any bumps and bangs while in transit.
3. The art of packing art
Because it sits out of the way on a wall, minding its own business, art is often the last thing to get packed. Not all art pieces will fit in a box, which makes for peculiar packing. Arm yourself with the right boxes, bubble wrap, tape and markers. If your art has glass fronting, you’ll need to get the balance right between packing it firmly enough to protect the glass, but not so firmly as to damage the frame.I read this paragraph and did not understand it. Can someone explain it to me please. It is from an article that was in USA Today.

Although his words were harsh, Miller completely agrees with his boss’ pointblank assessment.
“Dana White was right,” Miller admitted on his official.”
When asked if Miller would be granted another opportunity with the UFC after ending his six-year hiatus with a convincing TKO loss to Michael Bisping, White sounded unenthusiastic and unsure. While the reality exists for a one-and-done return to the organization, the 30-year-old plans to grow from his humbling defeat.
“I made a lot of mistakes in this story – during the camp, during the fight – but the key to living life is learning from your mistakes and making positive change,” Miller expressed. “I feel very positive right now … I will continue on this amazing journey, looking to make the most epic stories that I can.”
Miller owns a respectable 24-8 pro record and is currently honing his skills in Holland. There’s still no official word on his UFC fate.PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

First of all, we want to thank everyone who submitted. In all, there were almost 4,000 entries, and I speak for the rest of the staff when I say we had a great time reading through them. By the end, we all had certain ones we stood behind (I see you, dude talking to a unicorn ridden by Natalie Portman), but alas. There could only be 10. These 10, actually:
- Ben Liebman
- Matt Borcas
- Stephen Whiting
- Ramon Ramirez
- Ryan Moskal
- Jonathan Bales
- Frank Dupont
- Josh Klein
- Katherine Gotsick
- Shane Morris
Congratulations to those who made it through, but their work is far from over. The competition itself will be comprised of several different scoring opportunities that will be tallied each week:
- Every Tuesday, each participant will compile a 750-word recap that details some of the key performances from the previous week’s games and key waiver wire pickups. The winning entry, as selected by the Grantland staff, will run here on the Triangle.
- The other half of the writing portion will involve a weekly preview of each of that Sunday’s games with tips on whom to start, whom to sit, and who might be poised to surprise. The best game previews will be selected individually and combined into a collective post. The more an individual’s previews are chosen over the course of the season, the more points that individual receives.
- The 10 finalists will comprise the Grantland Fantasy League. Points will be awarded for head-to-head victories as well as the week’s high score (those points will be added to what’s awarded for each week’s two writing tasks).
Finally, Facebook fan voting will count for the remaining points available.
Next Tuesday, the results of the league’s fantasy draft will be accompanied by each potential writer’s team name, avatar, and a short bio. The scoring will begin with a preview of Week 1 that will run that Friday.
Again, thank you to everyone for submitting and making this competition a worthwhile endeavor for us. We truly appreciate the effort and the enthusiasm. And best of luck to the finalists.

Use the questions below after reading,
"Homeward bound"
During the Great Depression, Americans turned inward toward home and family. What does this suggest about the economy's effect on social expansion or withdrawal? Today's seniors were children at the time. Is their warm, nostalgic view of those years a true reading? Or were they too young and carefree to understand difficulties? How can we test our memories against hard evidence? In the long run, do children benefit more from family togetherness or financial security?
There's little doubt that the '30s was a simpler age. Do you think it was safer, less materialistic, more moral and trusting--or just different in values and lifestyle? How has life gotten better and how has it gotten worse? For parents? For children? For minorities? All things considered, which time period would you rather have grown up in and why? Is your answer influenced by your gender or race?
The Seattle Times Women's Page and a succession of "Dorothy Neighbors" columnists spoke exclusively to women and homemaking. How does The Times handle homemaking and lifestyle issues today? Are there "gender-specific" features? Columnist Virginia Boren wrote society news while encouraging volunteer and work opportunities for women, which was unusual for the time. Where else might career women look for support? Was society discriminating against working women or just being practical about job scarcity with an unwritten code of "one job per family?"
The Centennial Page shows racially diverse family portraits in which everyone looks well-off and well-bred. In truth, the newspaper rarely published information about the area's minority families. What message did these omissions and the focus on upper classes send to readers? What experiences did families of all races, classes and occupations share during the '30s? Today The Times works hard to represent the entire community. Why is that important to a good metropolitan newspaper? Look through the paper and decide whether The Times is accomplishing that goal.
Widespread electricity brought radio into American homes, where it was a great communicator of shared public values and culture. FDR used radio to establish an open and intimate conversation with the American people. Has the media been used as effectively by a leader since? Does modern print, radio, television and Internet media communicate a shared culture or send mixed messages? Besides advertising jingles, what cultural elements do we hold in common? Do you feel more comfortable in a society of commonly shared values or strong and diverse individualism?
First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was exceptionally involved in public life. Like Hillary Clinton today, Mrs. Roosevelt was both praised and criticized for that involvement. What's the proper role of a First Lady? Is she a role model for American women, a policy maker, a public servant, a political conduit to her husband? Or should the role be left up to her to define?Apr 10, 2012

I find myself agreeing with Paul Sheehan concerning the impact of parents on schooling (''Parents the X-factor in education rankings'', April 9).
Private schools have an advantage over public ones because parents accept that the rules will be enforced when their children are enrolled. Public schools also have school rules that are intended to be enforced but a small proportion of parents will not accept this.
I am gobsmacked at the abuse and bad manners the teachers at a colleague's primary school have to endure from parents who refuse to accept that their child might have misbehaved in class and the consequences imposed. Unfortunately, schools cannot suspend the parents, but public schools would be better places if they could.
Stephen Kirk Blackbutt
So Paul Sheehan's solution to the problem of dealing with hard-to-educate kids is to expel them as private schools do. Private schools have the ''choice'' to dump ''the kids whose parents can't or won't exercise any control on them'' onto the public sector, and Mr Sheehan wants to give public schools the ''choice'' to dump these children onto … where exactly Mr Sheehan? We must put funding back into public schools which do all the heavy lifting.
Brenton White Mosman
Menindee Central may be one of the 10 lowest ranked schools on the My School socio-economic index in 2011, but it has much to be proud of. Attendance rates are about 90 per cent and a majority of students complete year 12 and/or move into traineeships or apprenticeships.
This has been achieved through the commitment and effort of the school's staff and the community in working together to ensure the students get the most from their educational, vocational and social experiences at school and beyond.
More power (and resources) to them I say!
Pamela Williamson Ryde
Paul Sheehan mistakenly describes Portland Central as a ''melting pot'' when including it in a round-up of poor performing schools. Portland Central has a high Caucasian population very much unchanged over the past decades. An analysis of this school's performance may support the hypothesis proposed in the article.
What really should be addressed is the private school bashing that comes from the city chattering classes, all of whom have the selective school option.
Selective schools are neither offered nor possible in rural and remote areas unless they are part of a regional town. Students in these areas who should be pursuing science, music or maths at a top level are destined to attend the comprehensive school where these subjects are not offered at a level commensurate with their abilities.
Sarah Childs Lithgow
Paul Sheehan's article is on the right track but, with rampant political correctness, no public school can hope to improve standards while public sector principals do not have the same powers as principals in the private sector.
Kids know public school principals are powerless to enforce codes that may bring about change.
Denis Suttling Newport Beach
Tony Abbott is reported as saying: ''Fundamentally I want to be a politician that keeps my commitments'' (''Gay sister can't change Abbott's marriage view'', April ).
Leaving aside the issue of gay marriage, this statement sums up the stance of a man who, or in Abbott-speak ''that'', having stated a position on a subject will not change his mind. Henceforth, Mr Abbott is not open to further debate on the subject, will not alter his stance, irrespective of evidence he should, and any public discussion of that becomes irrelevant. This is an alarming attitude from a populist leader given to knee-jerk reactions in response to statements from current government ministers. It does not auger well for good government.
Having said it, whatever ''it'' is, Mr Abbott does not claim infallibility on that issue, just consistency, irrespective of the logic of an opposing view. Foolish perhaps: terrifying certainly.
Michael Creswell Waterloo
I would have much more respect for Mr Abbott if he showed more support for his sister and her life choices than worrying about sticking to outdated commitments. Perhaps he should respect his potential constituents and their right to make their own commitments.
Penny Paul Newtown
I am infuriated at the comments made by Philip Hughes in your story about Australian Christians with an Asian heritage (''Asian followers give life to Christian churches'', April 9).
They suggest Asians who go to church do so because they are compliant, lack individuality and don't question strong authority rather than in response to their own spiritual awakening and God's call. They perpetuate insulting cultural stereotypes. The implications are profoundly demeaning to intelligent Asian Christians who choose to worship God because of our individual feelings and beliefs, rather than because we are a compliant crowd of sheep who respond blindly to authority; and thus make good prey.
Grace Leung Rhodes
How refreshing to read a thoughtful comment on the parlous standards permitted by that most inept of organisations, the Australian Advertising Standards Board. (''Sex sells, but we're selling out our children'', April 9).
A recent example illustrates my point. During the national Olympic selection trials in Adelaide, a program many young children would watch in the hope of seeing their swimming idol, Channel Ten broadcast at 7.40pm an advertisement for the Sexpo, replete with two women dressed in salacious S&M leather. It was vulgar, crass and the epitome of the cultural void that advertisers live in. A porn theme park? Only at best. More like a porn coliseum, where the young and innocent are the victims.
And to those who dispute the psychological harm caused to children with that most perceptive of rejoinders ''just get over it", might I suggest you first read the scientific literature, then buy a new, more analytical phrase book.
John Wilks Baulkham Hills
Why all this fuss about Trenton Oldfield (''From Shore boy to river menace: why an Australian crashed the Oxbridge classic'', April 9).
A harmless prank has been committed by an eccentric protester. So what?
Oldfield has not shot the Queen, blown up Big Ben or committed a terrorist act. But by the outrage expressed by some people he might have. It's just a boat race. Seems to me there is a lot of British fussing and tut-tutting over very little.
John Leon Brunton Grafton
I'm not sure why Trenton Oldfield had to make his anti-elitist protest on the other side of the world. He could have travelled out to Penrith for the annual Head of the River regatta last month.
Brian Jeffrey Gunnedah
The protester against elitism who disrupted the Oxford-Cambridge boat race is surely in an elite class of his own - for committing the most disrespectful and pointless act of civil disobedience in living memory. He should be keel hauled.
Peter French Balmain
Our latest Aussie aqua-terror has launched a new war, without any class, against the British social elites. Schlock and oar!

If it is magic that the long-lost greater glider has returned to the Royal National Park 18 years after devastating fires destroyed much of its habitat then some straight forward good planning and stronger government commitment is needed to keep it there (''Possum Magic: national park sightings suggest glider is back after bushfires'', April 9).
For decades before this fire, and in the years since, local conservation groups have spent thousands of hours trying to convince local and state government decision-makers to address the many cumulative impacts besides wildfires that have already led to local extinctions of up to 12 vertebrate species in southern Sydney alone. When there is inadequate funding for strategic wildlife corridor purchases, a willingness to allow just a little more urban development and fragmentation of bushland, failure to protect nature-reserve-quality water catchment lands from coal seam gas mining, and inadequate understanding by government of the need to adopt regional approaches in keeping all these precious corridors intact, there is a formula for the ultimate loss of many other species.
Much more than a wand is needed to stop our native species from disappearing. Regional plans with real legislative teeth would be a good start.
Gary Schoer secretary, Southern Sydney Branch, National Parks Association of NSW
Jane Caro (Letters, April 9) confuses me. On the one hand, she demands respect for women and recognition of the role feminist thought plays in Australian society. On the other hand, she airbrushes from history women who are Christians (along with thinking men, including gay Christians), who frequently and openly disagree with the political institutions and public statements of various churches, treating them as dumbed-down drones.
She may reflect on the critical role Catholic and non-conformist women have played and continue to play in combating racism and inequality, and fighting for social justice and economic reforms to improve the lives of Australian women, children and families.
I look forward to hearing a more careful, more nuanced, view from Caro in future.
Fergus Hancock Macquarie Hills
I wonder if the Treasurer read Bernadette Scadden's letter (April 9).
Frankly, for the government to support such a superannuation scheme is obscene. It is not the actual pension part payment they (''those retirees on $700,000 who feel they are in need'') are seeking - it is the other benefits associated with the old age pension, e.g. concessional car registration.
If the government really wants to help those on low incomes, perhaps they should take a long hard look at how it is spending taxpayers' funds.
Patricia Hutchison Catalina
Fly into Kingsford Smith airport at a time of high spring tide, or even better during a summer king tide, and observe how close to the taxiway of the third runway is the water level of Botany Bay. It does not take much imagination to envisage the potential impact of higher sea levels.
In 2009 a consultant's report for the federal government's Department of Climate Change publication on risks to Australia's coast from rising sea levels, concluded "the airport's proximity to Botany Bay and tidal waterways makes it vulnerable to future sea-level rise and storm surge". What is fairly certain is that the sea level is rising, what is uncertain is at what rate and when it will achieve a threshold level to impact adversely on airport operations.
The elevation of the third runway and its taxiways looks especially vulnerable. If it is forced to suspend arrivals or departures during future high tide inundations then scheduling of this very busy airport will become chaotic.
Potential sea-level rise may not be the most critical factor in driving decision-makers to a second airport hub but it must be taken into consideration. Planning and construction of a new airport will take a decade or more and by that time the third runway and approaches will either have to be raised or a Thames-like barrier built across the entrance to Botany Bay. Such alternatives have their own costs.
Bruce Thom former chair, Coasts and Climate Change Council, Vaucluse
Major-General John Cantwell thinks the government's deadline for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan is driven by politics (''In politics' alternate reality, Afghan troops can be ready at a pen stroke'', April 9). What does he think drove the decision to get involved there, in Iraq, in Vietnam, and in just about every other war Australian troops have been involved in?
Jennie Morris Wollongong
There is something deeply wrong when the hollow-eyed, alabaster-skinned, stem-thin waif with straw-thatch hair I thought was an Easter appeal for a homelessness charity turns out to be Australia's latest international model (''Fashion peak conquered in just six months'', April 9).
Paul van Reyk Petersham
I wonder whether residents around a cluster of small bars would agree with councils' perceptions that they reduced alcohol-related problems (''It's cheers all round for the bar tsars who think small'', April 9).
Seems to me the $500 cost of an alcohol licence is far too cheap, encouraging excessive proliferation of licensed premises in small areas, which brings with it considerable collateral damage to a community, including but not limited to noise, urination and defecation.

Rather than boast of being the world's best importer of skilled migrants it could be said that given our high youth unemployment, which stands at 17 per cent, we are the worst at training our own (''Australia a world leader in skilled migration'', April 9). But then, as we have seen so many times, economics can always trump morality.

I accept that John Burman's publicly listed company was governed in an ethical and responsible manner but recent history suggests that some other such companies are just as guilty of lack of disclosure, conflicts of interest and poor governance as some unions and some industry super funds, whatever the rules say (Letters, April 9).

In response to John Burman, I wonder if there is any stench in those audited accounts which have not been lodged by some very high profile billionaires, recently reported in the Herald (''Billionaires grow fat off lazy government'', March 21). Many company directors just snub the corporations law in more ways than one.

And of course we expect the Labor Party will legislate so that all trade unions present their annual accounts to the same exacting standards as the business sector. I don't think the Gillard government has the fortitude.

Ron Sinclair (Letters, April 9) might ask his friend Craig Thomson who forged his signature on the union-supplied credit card, at the brothel, and put the whole matter to rest by telling the rest of us.

Having lived in Newcastle since 1966, it never fails to astonish me when members of the public come up with grand plans for the poor old ''neglected city'' of Newcastle. Gordon Stokes's (Letters, April 9) idea about a second airport is the latest, and I wonder if he's planning to move here?

What fantastic solutions are offered by Justin Pettit (Letters, April 9) on how to solve the problems of Sydney Airport. They are great - if you live in Manly as he does.

- at the end of the day
- fairly unique
- i personally
- at this moment in time
- with all due respect

i would like to add, “i have a headache.”

never learning difference between subjective and objective case
Sort of like a version of the truth.
staycation was mentioned, but I would add more stupid buzz words like it: “bromance,” “murse” (man purse), “moobs” (man boobs), and others I can’t think of at the moment….
It looks like you could stick all five of those words in the marist poll in a row and a semi-coherent sentence, or totally coherent on a college campus.
I’d like to see a sentence that combines all of the words together.
*and get. And get a semi-coherent sentence. Whoops.
I’m all for de-cluttering, particularly the folks who talk about “losing” something and spell it “loose”.
I would add: “I’m just saying…”
“I hate Mondays”
If you hate Monday’s at your 9-5 so much, then choose a different life path already. You shouldn’t hate any day of the week.
Thanks for letting me air my frustrations….

The Minimalist Path
Another day in paradise.
the one thing i absolutely cannot stand is the use of “LOL” in text. once you are past middle school, this should not appear in your writing. EVER.
“Pivot” seems to be big in corp-speak these days.
Wow – I must the most annoying person on the planet. I’ve used all of these at some point, including LOL.
I guess it shows you that what’s annoying is different to everyone. I generally find the lack of capitalization in writing to be annoying because it leaves me with the impression of immaturity, lack of confidence or laziness. When the content is good enough, I don’t worry about it. :)
I also have no idea what the difference is between subjective and objective case is and I wrote for a living for several years. Odd..
I never really thought of “fairly unique” as annoying, but then again I never really noticed it. It’s ridiculous. How in the crap can something be fairly annoying? It either is, or is not, unique.
I won’t speak on the rest of the list, as I’m guilty of quite a few. (Goes off to hide in the corner shamefully)
Sorry, “fairly unique” , not “fairly annoying”. I’m terrible with words, I have no business writing on the internet. :(
I would like to add:
“To be honest…” (implying that at all other times, this person is lying)
“Get over it…” (simply being dismissed), and
“I/we would like to -verb goes here-…” (either do it or don’t)
Fun post, thanks for sharing!
RE: i would like to add, “i have a headache.”
… is minimalizing causing a dryspell? lol ;)
/omg i used lol! and all lowercase. whatever, at the end of the day this comment is still amusing.
“in this economy.” Everyone says it and I hate it.
@Kahnrad “To be honest” is one of my pet peeves! On the rare occasion i catch myself saying it, I mentally slap myself. As soon as someone says it, he is calling himself a liar up until that point. Ugh!
“I was just wondering if”- I hate this phrase. In every instance it can be replaced with “do” or “will”.
And the following words are unnecessary in every circumstance: only, just, still, basically, anyways, though.
I’m tired of “epic” and “fail” already. Gamers have been using it for at least 5 years now. To hear it on TV just makes the novelty of it, well, “epic fail”.
“Wildly popular”, “if you will”, and “bottom line…” All of these are “wildly disturbing”, and I’ve made it my work to eliminate them wherever I can.
How about “irregardless” – it’s not even a word! I also hate when interior designers on those design shows repeatedly say “space” instead of “room” – what’s wrong with “room”!
at one point, every journalist or “expert” interviewing or being interviewed continually used the phrase “if you will.” If you will WHAT! Believe what I’m saying? Also…the use that is now totally accepted I guess… “and he goes” and then “I go” and “I went like Hey man!” Instead of he said, I said, she said. A certain age group has totally stopped saying says or said! Amazing. Sorry. I’m venting.
Ending ALL sentences in “or whatever” and inserting “like” into every possible place in a sentence, such as:
“I think she’s like going to like finish that job first or whatever”
And this is coming from a 50 year old’s mouth, not a teenager’s! :)
And like, you know…
yeah nah
on the car instead of in the car
aks instead of ask
these all drive me mad
HOW ABOUT DELETING “MINIMALIZE”. THE WORD IS MINIMIZE !Jeremiah Hampton Squires. One of the old and honored residents of Topeka, to which city he came thirty-seven years ago, is Jeremiah Hampton Squires, veteran of the Civil war, who is now living in comfortable retirement after a long and useful career as a business man and public official. Mr. Squires was born at Southampton, on Long Island, New York, September 11, 1842, and is the only survivor of the four children of Jeremiah and Phoebe (Jaegger) Squires, who were farming people.
Mr. Squires resided on the home farm on Long Island until reaching the age of seventeen years, and during this time acquired his education by attending the public schools and Southampton Academy. In the spring of 1860 he went to Columbus, Ohio, and, with the exception of the time he was a soldier in the Civil war, remained in the employ of one man at carpentering, as an apprentice, journeyman, foreman and partner, for nearly twenty years. Mr. Squires enlisted July 22, 1862, as a private in Company A, Ninety-fifth Regiment, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and within two weeks of the time he was enlisted was engaged in his first battle, at Richmond, Kentucky. In this engagement twenty-seven men of his company were killed or wounded, and here he received his first and only wound during the war which consisted of a bullet in the left hand. He, with 600 others of his regiment, was here captured and paroled for ninety days. He was then declared exchanged and rejoined his regiment, going into active service at Milliken’s Bend, in April, 1863, and being subsequently set to work digging a canal north of Vicksburg. Next he went to Grand Gulf, later to Jackson, and then to Vicksburg, where for six weeks he participated in the siege of that city, which finally fell into the hands of the North. His regiment then took part in the chase of Johnston’s army, which it met in the battle of Jackson, where it was ordered to uncover a masked battery. In so doing, Mr. Squires, then a sergeant, saw two officers of the enemy beating a retreat, followed them, and, on discovering them in a tent, covered them with his gun and took them as prisoners to the Union lines single-handed. While on the way from Vicksburg to Jackson, he was ordered to select four men and make a reconnoissance in the neighborhood of Black River, where the enemy were supposed to be occupying a fort on the river bank. Here they were surprised by about twenty-five of the enemy who were in the fort and were fired upon. The handful of Union men responded with a charge on the twenty-five Confederates, who retreated and crossed the river in boats, leaving the unguarded fort to be captured by a force of about one-fourth their own strength, one of the plucky Northerns having been dispatched to the Union commander with information regarding conditions. Later in the day, the commander of the Federal troops relieved the four men and they went on to Jackson as previously related. After Jackson the regiment went back to within about six miles of Vicksburg, where the men went into camp. Mr. Squires was then assigned to the duty of going to Columbus, Ohio, to secure drafted men to fill up the depleted ranks of the regiment, but, as there were none there, he was ordered to recruit. He was relieved in the early spring and rejoined his regiment at Memphis, Tennessee, June 1, 1864, and was then in the expedition sent out to check the advance of the Confederate leader, General Forrest. At Brice’s Cross Roads, Mississippi, the Union forces, numbering about 6,000 were defeated by the Southerners, who numbered some 10,000, and 136 men of Mr. Squires’ regiment were captured by the enemy, he being among the number. He was started to Andersonville Prison and for several days the only food obtained by the prisoners consisted of corn which they picked up from around the places where the animals had been fed. Finally, they reached the line of the railroad and were packed into box cars and sent to Andersonville stockade, where they arrived June 19, 1864. Mr. Squires experienced all the hardships, sufferings and tortures which incarceration in that awful prison meant, and from the weight of 175 pounds when he went in wasted away to eighty pounds, his weight when finally released. On November 24, 1864, with 10,000 other prisoners he was paroled and returned to Camp Chase, Ohio, to endeavor to regain his shattered energies. While at Andersonville, he had in some miraculous manner succeeded in secreting 60 cents from the search of his guards, and with this he bought writing paper and stamps and sent a letter to his sister, who was then living at Columbus, Ohio. Six months after the letter has been written it was handed to him at Columbus. In the spring of 1865 Mr. Squires rejoined his regiment at Mobile, Alabama, but the war being virtually over, he was stationed at Enterprise, Mississippi, doing guard duty for the rest of his service. He was finally ordered North and discharged at Louisville, Kentucky, August 18, 1865, at which time he held the rank of orderly sergeant.
At Columbus, Ohio, July 27, 1867, the brave young soldier was married to Virginia Elizabeth Schimp. He continued to be engaged at carpentering and contracting in Ohio until 1879, when he came to Kansas and purchased 240 acres of raw land in Pottawatomie County, six miles northwest of Waumega. In the fall of that year his family joined him and he continued to be engaged in farming for six years, since which time he has resided at Topeka. For several years he followed real estate ventures and during that time was elected and served three terms as a member of the Topeka Board of Education, and later was elected and served four terms as city clerk. Mr. Squires is a republican. He is a popular comrade of the Grand Army of the Republic and a valued member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights and Ladies of Security, the Ancient Order of United Workmen and the Modern Woodmen of America. He and his family are members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Mr. and Mrs. Squires are the parents of three children: Ralph W.; Frank C., an achitect of Topeka; and Anna L.Travis Perkins plc Company Profile (LON:TPK) Tweet Analyst RatingsEarningsDividendsInsider TradesCompany ProfileToday's Chart Consensus Ratings for Travis Perkins plc (LON:T), 8 Buy Rating(s)Consensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.47)Consensus Price Target: GBX 2,099.58 Analysts' Ratings History for Travis Perkins plc (LON:TPK) Show: All Ratings For This Stock Only the Most Recent Rating From Each Brokerage DateFirmActionRatingPrice TargetActions5/22/2015Liberum CapitalBoost Price TargetBuyGBX 2,300 -> GBX 2,500 5/22/2015Jefferies GroupUpgradeBuyGBX 1,510 -> GBX 2,650 5/21/2015AlphaValueReiterated RatingReduceGBX 1,998 5/18/2015Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 5/14/2015Credit SuisseReiterated RatingNeutralGBX 1,838 5/8/2015Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 5/7/2015AlphaValueReiterated RatingReduceGBX 1,958 4/23/2015Berenberg BankBoost Price TargetHoldGBX 1,800 -> GBX 2,000 4/23/2015Beaufort SecuritiesReiterated RatingBuy 4/23/2015JPMorgan Chase & Co.Reiterated RatingOverweightGBX 2,100 4/22/2015Panmure GordonReiterated RatingBuyGBX 2,300 4/22/2015Cantor Fitzgerald EuropeReiterated RatingBuyGBX 2,100 4/22/2015Westhouse SecuritiesReiterated RatingNeutralGBX 1,558 4/17/2015Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHoldGBX 1,991 4/16/2015Liberum CapitalReiterated RatingBuyGBX 2,300 4/13/2015BarclaysReiterated RatingEqual weightGBX 1,970 4/2/2015AlphaValueReiterated RatingReduceGBX 1,962 4/2/2015Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 3/25/2015Citigroup Inc.Reiterated RatingBuyGBX 2,190 3/23/2015Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 3/13/2015Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 3/4/2015Beaufort SecuritiesInitiated CoverageBuy 2/16/2015Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 1/26/2015Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 1/12/2015Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 11/17/2014Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 11/7/2014Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 10/22/2014Goodbody Stockbrokers LtdReiterated RatingBuy 10/20/2014Davy ResearchDowngradeNeutral 10/3/2014Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 8/22/2014Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 5/16/2014Liberum CapitalReiterated RatingBuy 5/8/2014Westhouse SecuritiesReiterated RatingNeutral 4/30/2014Davy ResearchReiterated RatingOutperform 4/25/2014Beaufort SecuritiesReiterated RatingBuy 4/24/2014Goodbody Stockbrokers LtdReiterated RatingHold 3/25/2014Davy ResearchReiterated RatingOutperform 3/17/2014Deutsche BankReiterated RatingHold 2/27/2014Beaufort SecuritiesUpgradeBuy 2/26/2014Davy ResearchReiterated RatingOutperform 2/25/2014Goodbody Stockbrokers LtdReiterated RatingHold 1/23/2014Peel HuntDowngradeHold 1/13/2014Davy ResearchReiterated RatingOutperform 7/25/2013Davy ResearchReiterated RatingOutperform -> Outperform (Data available from 5/22/2013 forward) Earnings History for Travis Perkins plc (LON:TPK)No earnings announcements for this company have been tracked by Analyst Ratings Network Dividend History for Travis Perkins plc (LON:TPK)AnnouncedPeriodAmountYieldEx-Dividend DateRecord DatePayable DateShare3/3/2015GBX 25.751.3%4/30/20154/30/20156/1/2015 7/30/2014GBX 12.250.72%10/9/201410/9/201411/11/2014 2/26/2014GBX 211.09%4/30/20144/30/20145/30/2014 (Data available from 1/1/2013 forward) Insider Trading History for Travis Perkins plc (LON:TPK)Transaction DateInsider NameTitleBuy/SellNumber of SharesAverage Share PriceTotal TransactionActions3/25/2015John P CarterInsiderSell28,017GBX 1,965.25£550,604.09 3/20/2015Ian PreedyInsiderBuy2,996GBX 1,998.64£59,879.25 3/17/2015Ian PreedyInsiderSell4,069GBX 1,948.08£79,267.38 3/6/2015John P CarterInsiderSell10,487GBX 2,013£211,103.31 (Data available from 1/1/2013 forward) About Travis Perkins plc Travis Perkins plc, based in the United Kingdom, is a building and home improvement company.

He was pretty bad last year with the Bruins. He never really got the hang of their defensive system, he double-clutched at the point more than he actually shot, and he only threw a hit once every 3 games or so. David Krejci outhit him. By a lot.
For the most part, though, he didn’t make noticeable costly errors. 2M is probably overpaying, but it’s a seller’s market right now and a 1-year deal isn’t too bad. If Carolina fans lower their expectations enough, they might not even be totally)Personal Trainer Bio

Not only it has became a source of latest updates/news going in world, but also an addiction to lot of those who tweets regularly.
Twitter has provided lots of API that can be used to Get the latest tweets / Add tweets / Search the tweets / Get the trends etc.. These APIs are REST APIs that can be called by using any scripting language and getting the result back. You can read full specifications of API at Twitter’s API site.
Let us first see the small demo that I have created. This demo page will read latest public tweets every 10 second and update it on screen with some animation effect.
We will use a PHP library to call the Twitter APIs and get the result. Following is the code of library. Just copy paste it in a file called
Twitter.class.php.
Now create a file called twitter-reader.php in the same folder as of Twitter.class.php and copy following content in it.
That’s it. Your simple twitter reader (client) that reads public tweets is ready. I have used some jQuery code to pull latest tweets every 10 seconds and display them on screen. For that we are using a php file latest-tweet.php which calls our PHP library and gets the latest tweet. Following is the content of latest-tweet.php
Thus, all we need is three php files Twitter.class.php, twitter-reader.php and latest-tweet.php and that’s it.
There are different API functions available in Tweeter.class.php that can be used to do lot of things around twitter. Functions are pretty much self explanatory. Give it a try and let me know.Introducing Service Virtualization

Review: Shambling Mirror of Fate Signals Time to Jam a Stake in Castlevania's Heart
(Nintendo 3DS)
Mercurysteam performs necromancy on a dying classic, and the results aren't pretty... or fun.
- Share it:
- Tweet
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow: Mirror of Fate brings the series back to Nintendo's portable systems, where it thrived for a decade, after a lengthy hiatus. Unfortunately, the game suffers from a single glaring problem: It's not very good.
Mirror tries to do a lot of things all at once -- to be many different things simultaneously. Ambition is commendable, but developer Mercurysteam has taken such an inelegant approach to combining the game's multiple influences that the end result amounts to muddled chaos. I suppose that's thematically fitting given the role of Chaos as an anthropomorphic force in many Castlevania plots, but something tells me the devs weren't working toward a clever metatextual statement.
As the title indicates, Mirror aspires to carry on the legacy of the Castlevania brand, which has sent players into the castle of Count Dracula to ram a stake into his heart for more than a quarter-century. It's admittedly something of a sideways continuation of that legacy, as even Lords of Shadow producer David Cox has admitted his trilogy represents an alternate reality side story to the "main" Castlevania timeline (though there's no indication Konami intends to continue that particular narrative thread, either). Still, with "Castlevania" right there in the title, certain expectations come hand in hand with the experience.
Unfortunately, Mirror fulfills those expectations poorly. It wears the trappings of Castlevania awkwardly, like a little kid in a suit he pilfered from his father's closet. You have Simon Belmont and Alucard and whips and axes and succubi: Familiar elements all. But they've been mashed into the template of a game that doesn't particularly play like Castlevania despite its name and superficial appearances.
Not that there'd be anything wrong with taking the series in a new direction; the original Lords of Shadow did precisely that, and -- love it or hate it -- you can't deny its creators did precisely what they set out to accomplish. Where Mirror of Fate stumbles is in lacking its predecessor's surety of purpose. It wants all at once to be the God of War-inspired child of Lords of Shadows, an old-school whip-frenzy Castlevania action game, and a reworking of the non-linear Symphony of Night branch of the series. If it settled for simply being one of these things, they probably could have knocked it out of the park. Sadly, they got greedy. In trying to cram so many pieces into a single game -- and a seemingly low-budget one at that -- Mercurysteam failed to do justice to any of them.
Mirror makes a poor successor to the classic, linear, action-driven Castlevania titles it initially appears to imitate. Those games distinguished themselves with exquisite level and enemy design that perfectly complemented the heroes' limitations (stiff controls, few weapons) to pose a sharp but almost never unfair challenge. The environments and foes worked together in harmony to force players to consider each move carefully, to learn the rhythms and flow of each stage, to juggle multiple threats and strategize their choice of weapons.
You won't find any of that in Mirror of Fate. What little platforming exists in Mirror feels perfunctory, and it's agonizingly slow since most of it involves the protagonists grabbing onto shiny ledges and pulling themselves along rather than pressing forward at a brisk clip. Enemies never combine with the environments in interesting ways, unless they're conspicuously placed as an arbitrary gate to progress to force you to seek out a new skill and return with your new "key" in hand. Most combat takes place in boxed-off areas that force you to grind through a seemingly endless procession of one or two enemies in order to move forward. There's no rhythm to it, no sense of flow.
Still, there's more to the Castlevania legacy than the focused combat of the NES days. Symphony of the Night took the series into a more RPG-inspired, exploration-based format where moment-to-moment battles were of less interest than than overall sense of progression. Mirror shifts to this style in its second act, but it does an equally poor job of delivering a satisfactory version of that experience, too. While you'll find yourself backtracking occasionally, it barely registers. The level designs rarely branch in any meaningful way, and the occasional points that encourage you to return with new skills in hand only contain meaningless collectables (scrolls written by the spirits of previous explorers recounting their deaths -- medieval snuff films, basically) or health and magic upgrades.
You'll never need to go terribly far out of your way to progress along the main path, and you'll never feel particularly compelled to revisit different areas because of the game's suffocating visual monotony. The handful of thoughtfully designed rooms are outnumbered fiftyfold by drab caverns or dingy castle halls. The sumptuous art styles that set different castle sections apart in the Symphony-inspired titles is completely absent here. Mirror looks pretty lousy on a technical level, with poorly detailed characters and stuttering frame rates, but its real visual failing comes in its utter lack of compelling artistry. It has the cheap, cramped look of so many 2D games built with 3D graphics. Granted, not every game can be as gorgeous as Bionic Commando: Rearmed, but the combination of low-res graphics and uninspired art design makes this easily the worst-looking Castlevania game since the N64 days.
The underlying appeal of Symphony and its successors came from those games' emphasis on leveling up. The powers, weapons, and items that former protagonists like Alucard and Soma accumulated over the course of their adventures provided the addictive hook of an RPG. You'll find little of that in Mirror. While the protagonists do level up, that simply amounts to unlocking new whip skills. Besides the whip, each character also wields an extremely limited set of supplemental skills that never evolve and end up being reset to zero every time the story switches its perspective to a different hero.
And even that wouldn't feel like such a letdown if not for the fact that Mirror of Fate is as poor a God of War clone as it is a Castlevania game. Levels consist largely of empty spaces dotted with occasional low-effort platforming sequences, forced combat in locked-off areas, and a handful of conspicuously contrived puzzles to solve. While you acquire dozens of whip abilities in the course of the game, you rarely need anything more than the two basic attacks, your quick-dodge, and the ever-present air juggle. Outside of bosses and the very few basic enemies that can't be knocked into the air, practically every enemy encounter boils down to "soften them up, launch them, juggle them, and perform a pointless quick-time event finisher for extra experience points."
Bosses provide the only real break in the monotony, but they trade tedium in return for frustration. These encounters take the form of multi-stage cinematic affairs divided up by arbitrary QTEs that you activate to initiate the next phase of the fight. The QTEs have a tendency to pop up unexpectedly, and the interface is so dull (grey buttons that fade into the muddy neutrals that dominate Mirror's palette) that you can easily miss the prompts. But hey, no worries: If you screw up and die in a boss battle, you'll be checkpointed right back to the beginning of the most recent QTE with most of your health and magic topped off to try again as many times as you need in order to win. This seems like a brazen admission that the battles are badly designed, and any sense of stress evaporates when you can keep banging your head against these sequences' arbitrary rules until you win. Don't expect anything like the knuckle-biting tension of classic Castlevania battles with Death or The Creature.
Mirror fails as a God-of-War-alike because, as it turns out, God of War-style combo-driven action doesn't work in two dimensions. Without that third axis to maneuver in, combat goes from being a wide-ranging, challenging affair revolving around crowd control and deft maneuvers through throngs of foes to simple hit-juggle-repeat affairs against a meager two or three monsters at once. Mirror of Fate fails where Lords of Shadow worked because it literally lacks that game's depth.
The tragic crown for this entire lackluster affair is that it doesn't even get the superficial trappings of Castlevania right. The plot is a nonsensical mess that resembles a sloppy fanfiction, and what little music exists in the game rarely rises beyond a muted, forgettable drone. Not long ago, former series composer Michiru Yamane told me that when she first came on board to work on Castlevania Bloodlines, a coworker warned her that she had a grand legacy to live up to. Clearly, things have changed.
Of course, as a long-time Castlevania fan, I approached Mirror of Fate with unavoidable preconceptions and baggage. Still, I tried to be open-minded and fair -- for the first few hours, I was even happy to defend it. Yet the experience degraded the longer I played, and by the end it all amounted to little more than a huge misstep: A monotonous, ugly attempt to reinvent Castlevania that seems have been created without anyone stepping back to really ask themselves what about the series endures, or how best to combine it with more contemporary game tropes. I'm not surprised I didn't enjoy Mirror as a Castlevania sequel, but I'm disappointed that it's not much fun as a game, period.

Love CastlevaniePosted: userComment.createdDate by k1ngTUT
Honestly, I agree with those who say that they shouldn't jam a stake through the heart of the franchise. I've been through it all with this franchise and I've seen the good, the bad, and the unfortunately awful, but in some way shape or form, I either find a way to find those bad games enjoyable, or they rekindle the Castlevania name with a better game the next release. Now, I haven't played this game yet, but I would be lying if I said I won't be picking it up in the near future. A lot of other franchises are either dead or just hanging on by a mere thread (I'm looking at you, Sonic =D), but Castlevania always seems to have some sort of new release somewhere along the line, and as bad as some critics and fans may think it is, there will always be those die hard fans that will take pleasure in it.
Bring back fun Konami!Posted: userComment.createdDate by Wait_Huh?
I just played through Symphony Of The Night (bought on special on the PSN) and it's been a blast. Prior to SOTN I played Last Of Us and was fairly convinced that not much could follow that experience. Now I'm not going to compare apples and oranges by comparing those two games, but I will say SOTN was full of wonderful elements: The soundtrack with all its Bachesque church organ dissonances, the strange artistic interpretation of the Eastern Orthodox Church as a kind of Byzantian Catholocism, the ATMOSPHERE (remember atmosphere!!), The monsters sourced from mythology, etc. etc. But most of all the gameplay and exploration. What a pleasure!
So yeah... don't stick a stake in the franchise... just stop trying so hard to be what it's not. Not every game needs to aim for some vague American market. If you aim for a smaller market and do what you do best, you'll impress everyone in your market, whereas when you try andt please everyone (particularly stakeholders) you'll make no one happy. Bring back fun Konami!

i don't think they should "jam a stake through the franchises' heart" i admit im excited about mirror but if its a bad game well thats ok. You can't expect every franchise to come out with a perfect gem everytime. every long lived franchise has a few that fell short and i'm not even much of a castlevania fan. but dear gods i haven't seen graphics like that since...well i dunno, even the originals were prettier then that

Put Castlevania on the Vita. Stop making games for inferior hardware for a minuite and support a handheld that can handle it. I understand that the 3ds has a higher install base and all but the Vita has the power, controls and screen resolution for a great Dracula game. Take Alcuard add in designs of S.O.T.N combine with combat of Lord Of Shadow, top it off with co-op and you have a Vita classic.

Wait a damn minute your telling me after Nintendo made 3 successful castlevania games for ds and gba that we should throw the whole series over one crappy game if we lived by that logic alot of games wouldn't get sequels like sonic,suikoden which 4 was horrible which went on to make v and its a great game and final fantasy this is is one of nintendos first blunders in the castlevania series besides castlevania 3d games I never played them but heard they were good I'm glad your not president we would all be in trouble lol!
An unfortunate review...Posted: userComment.createdDate by Malakhim3
Not because it's a low score, but because this is how 1up is going out. It was very hard for me to get past the first paragraph once the reviewer mentioned Symphony of The Night and other similar entries. This is NOT another "Metroidvania". It isn't a 2D sprite-based action/RPG, Michiru Yamane isn't the composer, etc., and this has all been known. I did get through the entire text and I doubt the actual content of the interview probably wouldn't change much otherwise naturally, but I really think that it does a disservice to those who like myself enjoyed the previous 2D entries, but also enjoy Mercury Steam's new take on the series(including this one). I don't know how aware the wirter was about the gameplay before release, but personally I think it reflects poorly on the site.
Read more carefully...Posted: 03/13/2013 by ja_schaffer
...the author makes the point that the game is flawed regardless of its status as a Castlevania sequel. Frankly, I have the same thoughts about Mercury Steam's previous game as well - both of their titles are horrible, misguided, cheap feeling hodgepodges of other people's work.
You're right...Posted: 03/14/2013 by Malakhim3
Although I did mention that the score probably wouldn't have changed much given the genuine complaints(for some reason I wrote review as interview. Whoops). I still feel that the comparisons that people have been making between Mirror of Fate and other SoTN-esque entries is still unfair, regardless of whether or not it was expected, given the fact that we've known for a long time that this was not going to resemble those games in any way.
Honestly, that's my only real compaint about the review, although I feel it undermines the legitimacy greatly. Other than that, I don't agree with it, but I can respect the author's opinion.

This looks like a fair review. I've read most of them from Metacritic.com and this seems like the most accurate. Saw about a half of hour of gameplay on Giantbomb.com and the graphics were choppy along with stuttering framerate. I think I will hold off on this one. Purchasing the game and a 3DSXL would have been a regrattable investment considering how the game turned out. Hope the next console game fares better.
Mixed feelings about the new alternate CV universePosted: userComment.createdDate by BrokenH
I'd give it a chance if I had a handheld. Still, I don't think I'd expect it to live up to Symphony Of The Night, Dracula's Curse, or Bloodlines. (I'm a snob, I know.)
However, I did absolutely "love" Lords Of Shadow for the 360. Certainly a keen critic could pick apart its' individual pieces while snarkily proclaiming how it rips off God Of War, Shadows Of The Collossus, and Dante's Inferno but to me it had the genuine atmosphere of a CV game. It was sort of like playing a rebuilt modern version of Super CV 4 and there's nothing wrong with that!
(Besides, I always thought God Of War aped ideas from the earlier Castlevania games and Rygar anyway. A chained weapon that helps Kratos traverse his surrondings? Hmm, where have I seen that before?)

Yes, let's all take a big steaming shit on the entire castelvania franchise and send it to it's grave because of one crappy DS game. I get that the point of a title is to grab someone's attention, but jesus christ man it's castlevania we're talking about.
Send that shit to Mercury SteamPosted: 03/13/2013 by ja_schaffer
I know most companies blame the IP rather than the studio these days (which is highly ridiculous), but I think if Mercury Steam is putting out mediocre (or worse) games and then talking them up (and talking 'trash' about the previous Castlevania games) then the reviews should reflect that. Frankly, I hope the next Castlevania LoS game does poorly so it gets the IP away from this mediocre developer.
Artwork and MusicPosted: userComment.createdDate by Alucart
I think if Castlevania is to ever exist as a 3D game it has to be stylized to look like 2D artwork like what Capcpm did with Street Figher IV. I look at the artwork from MercurySteam (specifically the one used in this article) and I can't help but wonder how much my personal disappointment of the game would be washed away if the game looked liked that? The concept artwork is awesome.
Imagine that artwork coupled with the musical composition from the Super Castlevania by composers Masanori Adachi (Credited as Masanori Oodachi) and Taro Kudo(Credited as Souji Taro). Michiru Yamane is a great composer but her flavor and style I felt matched more of Alucard's anguish as the son of Dracula more than the overall Castlevania vibe and feel deliver in the NES and SNES. Each room he entered was like getting a sense of his emotion as he traversed the Castle which it totally befitting.
The rest of the original style of castlevania music targets the journey across great distance to reach the castle with the openness, sense of loneliness and sheer distance of the environment the must be tread that challenges the hero would be music that interplays with the Belmont in that environment. The sound should be the environment with the disturbance of the Hero given his range of emotioanl states. If that makes any sense at all. Like an object thrown in a body of water each causes a different ripple. Thats Castlevania to me as far how music should fit into it.
But MercurySteam would rather drown all that expression out in favor for "epic score# 38."
Thank God For YoutubePosted: userComment.createdDate by Alucart
I was able to confirm how the story would play out without buying a 3DS just for this game; something I was genuinely looking forward to. But it sounds like it plays like an slighly below average game echo by several reviewers and owners of the game alike. Not worth dropping hundreds of dollar for an entry that is basically nothing special.
Generally it sounds like the gameplay certainly wasn't worth investing to justify a 3DS purchase. I liked the story from what I've seen but trying to imagine myself sitting through much of the game's overall execution story and gameplay would have likely been irritating to me and a regrettable the purchase. This is soley on the basis on being a game, not a Castelvania. That achievement certainly isn't there. Its Castlevania in name only.
Granted, I'm a huge Castlevania fan...Posted: userComment.createdDate by SinnerOrSaint
...but I couldn't disagree more with this review. It's not perfect, but this is the first game that I could not put down until I 100%-ed it in a long time.
I thought the game was gorgeous (obviously, it's on the lesser-powered 3DS). Yes, it's dark, and there is a lot of grey--it's an old, dingy castle ruled by darkness. However, character designs are very cool, the color splashes and accents are nice, and the settings are impressive. Further, this is one of the best experiences with 3D games I've ever had (I have a PS3 as well), and Mercurysteam did a great job making the scenes (both during gameplay and in the pre-rendered sequences) feel cinematic.
Combat was actually really fun for me, and I thought they did an admirable job of translating it into 2D. A bit more attack variety from enemies would have helped (perhaps bouncing attack patterns, etc.), and I do agree with the reviewer that the enemies and platforming could have been tied together in more interesting ways. However, once you develop a bit of skill in managing the fights, it becomes quite rewarding to maneuver around a handful of enemies, dodging and counterattacking with ground-, air-, and magic-based attacks. In addition, some great boss fights are more memorable than several other boss fights from the original batch of handheld CV games.
While strict platforming sections can move slowly on occasion due to the constant ledge-grabbing, there are plenty of cool setpiece moments that give virtually every area a special gameplay event by which to remember them.
Finally, I was also happy with the narrative. It occasionally lacked the "punch" I was hoping for (few actual surprises, but some interesting realizations and "oh, I see what really happened" moments on subsequent playthroughs), but it was overall a great followup to the first LoS and a story that makes me want to play the conclusive LoS 2 when it comes out later this year.
Oh...Posted: userComment.createdDate by SinewySimian
Your first draft wasn't THAT bad. I appreciate your preserving and sharing it because I'd say you were entitled to a bit of a rant; you did after all just break down the entire anatomy of the 8-bit originals in an attempt to do the very thing you mention in the final review's penultimate sentence: figure out what about these games endures. Why the hell can't the developers take the time to do that?
Anyway, great review. Glad to hear it won't be the last.
Not Really AccuratePosted: userComment.createdDate by Furysetzer
I understand that you were disappointed with the game, but in my opinion, the score for me is a solid B. It really wasn't bad at all, and was an enjoyable experience. Comparing it to God of War doesn't do the game justice. I think the developers did a good job with the game. It isn't meant to be a post-SotN game, rather, a reboot title that took the gameplay back to its roots with a modern feel. The action is solid, and the level design didn't bother me at all. Overall, the game was fun. Not the best in the series of 2D, but certainly not the worst. You compare it to every other game in the series, and that's not fair, because it is its own beast. No offense, but you are too negative in your judgement, and to say that the game is a Frankenstein of failed ideas is wrong. It does quite a few things well, and I liked the game. Try not to be so hyper critical of the next game you review please.
Agreed, PaulPosted: 03/08/2013 by VeryMadMage
And the review doesn't fault the game for not being Castlevania, it faults the game for doing a terrible job at trying to be Castlevania and also make many solid arguments as to why the game plays poorly regardless of what name it has.
You MisunderstandPosted: 03/09/2013 by Furysetzer
I wasn't saying that his opinion was wrong. I said that blasting the game for being a bunch of failed ideas is wrong. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and to say that mine is a waste of space is very poor of you. He says that the game is below average, and I disagree with that. I think it does a good job as a game and plays well. I wrote my own review on how I feel about it, and didn't have to fall back on being biased. He compares it to God of War and how it's how it's so terrible compared to every other Castlevania platformer and basically says that it's garbage. Not true, and to try and convince others that it's not a good game when it is aggravated me because it doesn't represent the game at all. But hey, have to let people know that the game is so horrible that they should just end the franchise because he didn't like it. I don't know, I just expected more out of a professional review instead of one long rant on how trashy the game is.
professional reviews can and should involve personal opinionPosted: 03/11/2013 by VeryMadMage
Several arguments are made as to why the game is poorly executed. You do not have to agree with them, but I persoanly do. Does that make my opinion "wrong" as well?
This review spoke to and for a certain type of person. One review can not be for every person, just as a horror film reviewer is not well suited to review romantic comedies.

It is bittersweet that the (presumably) last 1up review be emblematic of everything exceptional about 1up. Regardless of the games in quesiton, 1up always saw and dared to point out flaws other game reviewers would gloss over either out of ignorance, laziness, or advetizing pressures. 1up holds games to a different standard and isn't afriad to point out flaws which need to be pointed out. Where the hell am I gonna read thoughtful, fun, unbiased reviews now?

Kinda Sad...Posted: userComment.createdDate by Pacario
...that one of 1UP's last reviews had to be this disappointment; it's not exactly a happy note to end on.
Nevertheless, fans long suspected this title would be but a shadow of Mr. Igarashi's own opuses, and that has indeed proven true. What is the Master doing these days? Like Capcom with Mega Man, Konami seems at a loss concerning the fate of its venerable franchise.
Fortunately, there are great titles like Dust: An Elysian Tail and Shadow Complex to remind us that great games in the Castlevania tradition can still be constructed. Maybe Konami will one day remember.
I friended him on FacebookPosted: 03/07/2013 by VeryMadMage
He does (or at least used to) accept friend requests from anyone. He never posts about games though, which is a really bad sign and very sad.
I don't think he wanted to be the director of the 2nd Otomedius game. After it's justifiably poor performance, it seems Konami has shelved him for good.

What are the names of the brother/sister protagonists of Costume Quest?

More Costume QuestMS):
LAWRENCE O’DONNELL, HOST: Sarah Palin’s slide off the Republican a-list continues this week with her Fox News boss taking a swipe at her even going as far as to compare her to President Obama.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL O’REILLY: The same thing's happening to Sarah Palin. Her favorability among Republicans and Independents has dropped four points in a month. And the reason I think it's dropping is because she's not engaging directly. You know, when I had her on this program, I asked her some specific answer -- questions she didn't want to answer. She wanted to the give a speech, this, that, and the other thing.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O’DONNELL: Bill O’Reilly, the communicator-in-chief at Fox News also found fault with Tea Party Republican Christine O’Donnell when she ran for the senate in Delaware. So O'Reilly has found, has O’Reilly found his calling in Republican politics, bullying the nuts off the stage to make room for viable candidates? Joining me now is Alex Wagner, Huffington Post correspondent and MSNBC analyst. Alex, thanks for joining us tonight.
ALEX WAGNER, HUFFINGTON POST: Thanks for having me.
O’DONNELL: I think this O’Reilly thing is serious business the way he talked about Sarah Palin. I don't think he would have done that a while ago. She’s a very valuable asset, or has been considered such for Fox News, but O'Reilly is a much more valuable asset for Fox News, and he seems to be saying, “Don't pay attention to the freaks.” I think he wants people to concentrate on real viable Republicans.
What was interesting is that nowhere in this four minute segment did O'Donnell mention what the context of O'Reilly's comment about Palin was.
As NewsBusters previously reported, despite Clinton and Gates going on ABC's "This Week," CBS's "Face the Nation," and NBC's "Meet the Press" Sunday to discuss the events in Libya, they were not offered to appear on Fox's political talk show. This led "Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace to scold the administration for this oversight.
On Monday, O'Reilly brought former CBS reporter Bernie Goldberg on to discuss the matter during which came the five sentences about Palin.
O'Donnell chose not to inform his viewers Tuesday what O'Reilly and Goldberg were actually talking about, and neither did his guest. This was particularly curious as the outlet Wagner works for, the Huffington Post, did a piece Tuesday concerning this matter wherein the author at least had the decency to report the full context of the Palin snippet:
O'Reilly brought Palin up while discussing the recent flap over the White House's decision not to send Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates onto "Fox News Sunday," even though the Secretaries of State and Defense went on "Meet the Press," "This Week" and "Face the Nation." Host Chris Wallace brought the issue up on air, criticizing the White House for its decision.
Speaking to weekly guest Bernie Goldberg, O'Reilly said that the decision by the White House not to go on Fox made no sense to him.
"I can't really figure this out," he said. "The Fox audience is divided on the Libyan action. There isn't any anti-Obama juggernaut on this network...I don't get why they want to stoke this up."
Goldberg said that he thought the move would hurt Obama politically with independents, because they would see him as ducking critical questions.
That's when O'Reilly brought Palin up.
As such, the organization Wagner now works for was far more honest with its readers than she or O'Donnell were with his viewers.
After some give and take, "The Last Word" host offered another tenuous premise:
O’DONNELL: Isn't it proof that O’Reilly is the absolute king of her Fox News world, that she has not immediately tweeted some sort of attack of Bill O’Reilly for slighting her in any way? If anyone else had said that, there would be the Palin attack machine would immediately react.
Or, the fact that Palin hasn’t responded means that she didn’t take these five sentences by O’Reilly in a lengthy segment ridiculing the President as being much of a slight on her or anything warranting her attention.
Sadly, the conspiracy-minded O'Donnell and Wagner didn’t consider that possibility.
For those interested, here's the full video and transcript of O'Reilly's discussion with Goldberg Monday evening:
BILL O'REILLY, HOST: Thanks for staying with us. I'm Bill O'Reilly. In the "Weekdays with Bernie" segment tonight, yesterday Secretary of State Clinton and Defense Secretary Gates went on ABC, CBS, and NBC talking about Libya. They avoided "FOX News Sunday." Chris Wallace was not pleased.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: The Obama team felt no need to explain to the millions of you who watch this program and FOX News why they have sent U.S. servicemen and -women into combat. We thought you'd like to know.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
O'REILLY: Joining us now from Miami, the purveyor of BernardGoldberg.com, Mr. Goldberg.
So, was it was a big dis, disrespectful to FOX News?
BERNIE GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I wouldn't choose the word "disrespectful." I would say it was -- "dumb" is a better word. I think it was a dumb decision not to -- not to go on FOX.
First of all, if -- and I'm underlining the word "if" -- if this was an honest decision to simply go with the more traditional media, the White House has to understand that this is the 21st century, and there's a lot more out there than just ABC, NBC, and CBS. FOX matters, and it matters a lot. That's why I don't think it was that.
I think the war between the White House and FOX is continuing. I -- I don't think -- I think it cooled down for a while, but it never went away.
The idea that these smart people -- and I'm not saying that sarcastically -- smart people at the White House either don't understand or refuse to understand the distinction between partisan anchors, in some cases rabidly partisan anchors, on FOX and a straight shooter, hard news solid journalist like Chris Wallace is absolutely ridiculous. I mean, to not understand that distinction is really dumb.
O'REILLY: Well, Ted Koppel -- Ted Koppel was on CNN yesterday and didn't seem to understand it either.
But to be fair to the Obama White House, they didn't do CNN. CNN has a bunch of morning shows, Sunday morning shows. I think they hid behind the fact that, well, we didn't do cable. We just did broadcast. But as you pointed out, "FOX News Sunday" is on broadcast.
GOLDBERG: FOX is on -- FOX is on the broadcast network, right.
O'REILLY: I can't really figure this out, because -- here's why I can't figure it out. The FOX audience is divided on the Libyan action. They're divided on it. BillOReilly.com polling, FOX News polling, very close. There isn't any anti-Obama juggernaut on this network.
GOLDBERG: Right.
O'REILLY: Some of us, like me, support the action. Some others don't. But it's evenly divided. So I don't -- I don't get why they want to stoke this up.
GOLDBERG: Neither do I. But from a -- I'll say this, from a political point of view, it doesn't make any sense.
Barack Obama is going to need the independents that he lost in 2010. A lot of independents watch the FOX News Channel. Barack Obama won't win any Republicans who watch FOX, but he has a shot at some of those independents.
But when he disrespects, to use the word that you used in the lead-in, of FOX News, and more importantly, when he disrespects the viewers, who hear Chris say what he said about the White House or -- and the administration, and what he correctly said, I don't think that endears the independents to Barack Obama in 2012.
O'REILLY: No.
GOLDBERG: So, politically, I don't think it's a smart move.
O'REILLY: You know, it's interesting, because I just did this in the no-spin news we have for BillOReilly.com premium members after the program, the no-spin news that I don't cover.
The same thing's happening to Sarah Palin. Her favorability among Republicans and independents has dropped 4 points in a month. And the reason I think it's dropping is because she's not engaging directly. You know, when I had her on this program, I asked her some specific answer -- questions she didn't want to answer, and she wanted to the give a speech, this, that, and the other thing.
GOLDBERG: Right.
O'REILLY: So I think you're absolutely right that Barack Obama, if he looks like he doesn't want to go into the tougher venues -- and I don't think Wallace would be any tougher than the other guys -- that people are going to say, "Look, you're not confident in your position." That's not leadership.
GOLDBERG: I rest my case, your honor.
O'REILLY: All right. So what you're saying to the audience is I summed it up so beautifully that you're at a loss for words?

Penn State has received its annual infusion of tobacco settlement funding, which will help support Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center’s research mission. This year, Penn State received nearly $6.6 million. Over the past 12 years, Penn State has received more than $104 million in formula funds – helping to not only explore possible treatments for diseases but also to fuel Pennsylvania's economy.
At the July meeting of the Medical Center’s Board of Directors, Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Michael Wolf delivered a check for the Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement (CURE) Program’s formula funds.
“Since 2001, tobacco funds have provided seed funding that has helped faculty members at Pennsylvania’s research institutions, including Penn State, win an estimated $2.4 billion in additional funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies,” said Penn State President Rodney Erickson. “We’re proud to partner with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on this initiative to advance science, knowledge and the quality of life of Pennsylvania citizens.”
Established in 2001 as a result of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, Pennsylvania’s CURE Program distributes settlement funds annually to the state’s medical research institutions. Through its distribution of funds, the CURE Program has stimulated economic growth through expansion of the state economy, creation of jobs and more.
Since the start of the program, these funds have created or sustained more than 7,700 high-paying jobs in the academic medical sector, according to a recent economic impact analysis by Tripp Umbach. Some 593 of these jobs resulted from the money received by Penn State Hershey alone, and the state economy has seen a $208.4 million net expansion, as well as $360.2 million in additional federal research funding.
In addition to the check presentation, Wednesday’s event featured a video highlighting research by Penn State Hershey faculty members Drs. Walter Koltun and Zachary Simmons. Koltun’s and Simmons’ work is supported by CURE funds previously awarded to Penn State.
Koltun’s CURE program grant will support his work examining the genetic components of diverticulitis. He seeks to explore the correlation between the severity of the disease and its recurrence in families.
Simmons’ CURE fund grant will support his study of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), otherwise known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, which has few treatment options. Simmons will explore the role of genetics in ALS and the potential for targeting treatment regimens to an individual.
Koltun and Simmons are collaborating with scientists at Penn State Hershey Institute for Personalized Medicine. One of the institute’s primary goals is to tailor treatments to the individual by considering the genetic influence on the individual’s response to medication. The institute gives scientists, such as Koltun and Simmons, the necessary tools to develop research studies exploring these varying genetic factors. Seed money for the institute’s specialized space and equipment came from previous years’ CURE Program allocations.
“We are grateful to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for its continued support of medical research through the CURE program,” said Dr. Harold L. Paz, CEO of the Medical Center and Penn State Hershey Health System, Penn State’s senior vice president for health affairs, and dean of Penn State College of Medicine. "These funds make a huge difference not just to our researchers, but above all to the patients and families who look to academic health centers like ours for new discoveries and new hope.”- <<

Biscuit has guided reading at school. It's basically reading comprehension, but you know they have the change the names of everything every few years.
They get either "books," which are photocopies stapled together, or what they call passages, which are just one sheet front and back with a story or non-fiction information. The levels are lettered so they can keep up with where the kids are in their reading. Biscuit is supposed to be at the letter N by the end of the school year. Right now, he's already at R, so he's doing really well. But he puts a lot of pressure on himself.
It's hard because I want to push him and encourage him to do the best he can, but I don't want him getting all stressed out about it. He has this weird mix of being a perfectionist but also wanting to be done with his work more than wanting to be right. So he hurries through things and is then upset when he doesn't do as well as he wanted to do.
So, on to the part where I wanted to laugh ...
When they get their books or passages, they also get sheets with four reading comprehension questions. In addition to the reading and questions, they also have math homework every night. So the idea is for the kids to answer one question each night, making it all more manageable.
Biscuit has piano lessons on Tuesday evenings, so he usually does two questions on Monday or Wednesday. This week was kind of crazy, then Biscuit picked up a nasty cold and had to miss school Wednesday. And somehow, he ended up with three questions to answer Thursday evening.
He does his homework at the kitchen table, and if I sit there with him, he'll ask me a thousand questions and will depend on me too much to help. So I stay in the living room, then when he's done, he brings his answers to me and we go over them.
I was in my rocking chair when Biscuit rounded the corner crying.
"What's wrong?" I asked him.
"I ... I ... I'm doomed," Biscuit said with full drama!
"You're doomed?" I asked him. "Why do you say that?"
"Um, because I can't find my guided reading booooook," he said with more tears falling. "It's no use. I'm going to flunk second grade. I just can't flunk second grade, Mom."
It had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. I shouldn't admit it because he was so upset, but he was just SO dramatic. But he was completely serious. He was that worried about losing his book. And remember, this so-called book is some photocopies stapled together.
He had the question sheet, so I said, "You've read the passage several times. See if you can remember enough to answer the questions."
I sat with him at the kitchen table, and sure enough, he remembered enough to give decent decent answers to two of the questions.
Once he got those answers down, I could tell he was calming down. So then I lit in with the responsibility / keeping-up-with-your-stuff lecture.
"Your best course of action is to go straight to the teacher and tell her what's going on," I told Biscuit.
"Okay," he said, and I could tell he was dreading it.
I wrote his teacher an email to tell her what was going on and how upset he was about it.
She wrote back later and said that as soon as Biscuit walked in the classroom, he went straight to her desk and stuttered and stumbled all over himself and told her he lost his book.
"Okay, let's problem solve," she told him. "Pick up another book and go do your last question right now."
And that's all he needed to hear. She said he got his last question done in no time.
And it's safe to say that he won't flunk second grade!Update on BP oil disaster and the Gulf’s Murky Future

We have had some rains and I’ve left some to collect
thru several rains. When I went to clean the area
that collected rain, I noticed a difference in the
slime that collected. It seemed more slimey than
what I have been used to from just leaving rain
water to set for a week. The slime covered the bottom
of space and stayed when the water was dumped off.
Those with bird baths might notice a difference too.

Oddly enough, the slime seems to be found next to
things that are made of petroleum and different
types of petroleum products having different levels of
slime growth when in constant contact with water.

But, the slime growth is different than what I remember
from many years of having left petroleum products

Those would be slick. Be careful.

He taught for three years in Camden, South Carolina, then did a year of graduate study at the University of South Carolina (M.A., 1907). One of the early Rhodes Scholars at Christ Church College, the University of Oxford, Mills graduated with honors in theology (B.A. 1910). He was YMCA secretary at the University of South Carolina from 1910 to 1912. During this time he also studied at Columbia (South Carolina) Theological Seminary (B.D., 1912). In 1932 he received an S.T.M. degree from Union Theological Seminary, New York, and in 1951 an honorary D.D. from Davidson College. He served under the YMCA in China from 1912 to 1932, largely in ministry to students.
In 1932 Mills resigned from the YMCA, was ordained, and began work under the Presbyterian Foreign Mission Board in Nanking (Nanjing), where he coordinated the work of the Presbyterian mission and worked with Chinese pastors. Just before the Japanese occupation of Nanking, Mills played an important role in efforts to bring about a truce that would allow the Chinese army to withdraw from Nanking and the Japanese army to enter the city without fighting. With approval from General Tang Sheng-chih, Mills and fellow missionary M. Searle Bates went to see the U. S. consul, J. Hall Paxton, on board the USS Panay, to transmit the truce-negotiating messages.
After the Japanese army occupied Nanking, Mills was appointed vice-chairman of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone when it was founded in November 1937, and chairman in February 1938. The Nanking Safety Zone had a population of about 250,000, of which about 70,000 people were dependent upon the zone committee for food and fuel. Mills received the Order of the Green Jade, the highest honor given to Westerners by the Chinese government in recognition of his work in Nanking during 1937-1938. During World War II he was interned for nine months in Shanghai by the Japanese, was repatriated in 1943, and returned to China in 1944.
The next five years were spent in Chungking (Chonqing) and Shanghai. He left China in 1949 and retired formally in 1951 but continued to work in New York City on the staff of the Missionary Research Library at Union Theological Seminary until 1955. He died in New York City.On November 14, 2011, APHIS announced plans to streamline and improve the agency's process for making determinations on petitions for nonregulated status for genetically engineered (GE) organisms. APHIS reviews such petitions in order to determine whether a GE organism poses a plant pest risk and, if not, should no longer be subject to APHIS regulation under 7 CFR part 340.
Since the petition process was first added to APHIS biotechnology regulations in 1992, the time it takes the Agency to reach a final decision has grown from six months on average to three to five years or more. As a result of these improvements, APHIS expects to reduce the length of the petition review by half, while also reducing the variability of the timeframe from one petition to another.
APHIS used Lean Six Sigma (LSS) business process improvement techniques to identify and address the root causes of the length and variability of the process, and to develop improvements to address those underlying root causes.
The new enhancements include:
By taking these steps, APHIS believes it can deliver to its customers and the public a more predictable process for considering and acting on petitions, without compromising the quality of the analysis supporting our decisionmaking.
The improvements to APHIS' petition process are part of USDA Secretary Thomas.

SGI monitors where the absolute best. I did the same as you for many many years. still have the VGA to 5 component cable as a memento.
It's consumption tax. I can have all the income i want and not pay taxes on it. I pay taxes only when i want to use the wealth I've accumulated.
If i want to pay less taxes then i spend less. If i want to live in luxuries then i pay more.
Those with smaller incomes must use a larger proportion of it on consumption.
10% is 10% no matter what the purchase price is, the Proportions are the same.
The only way where they get out of balance is where corporations can purchase larger quantity and get a lower sale price per unit then the smaller consumer for a given item.. So you will not be removing the buying power element, but even then you are capturing the taxes and doing it based on money changing hands.
easiest way is to break the company into shells each making a max of 9,999,999 and not look back. at an added tax rate of 25% as the summary says it would be simple math to show that the added paper work for inter-company billing and accountants would be cheaper than paying the tax (especially if they automate it).
They need to move to a flat consumption tax for products and services, get rid of all theses random income crap and just keep it simple. When money changes hands, tax it.
Drop the income tax, make it a flat tax on consumption (both products and services). You pay tax on raw materials and collect tax when you sell. you can make 100m$ and pay no tax until you spend it. it would make it easier for everyone to understand, it would be easy to track as tax would happen when money changes hands.
but hey, simple logic does not seem to work in this world because everyone wants the rules to apply to everyone but them.
i haven't had that issue. only once in 5 years when the drown seal was worn out and cost 400$ my dad had it done twice in the past 20. so you can tack on ~100 or less a year in maintenance costs...

The world is no nursery. - Sigmund FreudSo, I've gotten a couple of emails since the last post (and by the way, thank you to everyone for your kind words and support... I feel amazingly blessed that people out there on the intarwebz not only give a hoot about my little blog but come out in droves just to give me a figurative hug when I'm down) wondering what's up.
So, lets take this week... Friday, I took my last final, found out what I'd gotten on my other final (passed the class, with a B, this makes me happy) picked up a suitcase, the Dawgs (oh, yeah, I got a new pup... a six month old male miniature schnauser... he's thick as a post but cute as a button) and hit Safeway because they had Pepsi products buy two get three free. Picked up ten twelve-packs of Mountain Dew for Mamaw, stuffed them in the trunk, and headed for the Old Homestead.
Got here in time to watch round nine of the NFR on the big screen, with Mamaw, Bill, and SB (who wasn't about to pass up an opportunity to watch bull riding on a fifty inch hi def) with much hooting and hollering by myself and SB.
Saturday I replaced/repaired the plastic on Mamaw's windows, which turned into an all day ordeal, since nothing wanted to go right. Saturday night we watched round ten of the NFR, which SB missed because his ex gf showed up begging him to take her back and he couldn't get loose.
Sunday, it was cold and nasty out so I decided to stay over one more day and go back to my house Monday. So, I puttered around the house for Mamaw and got some stuff done here. Monday, I puttered some more, and we decided to go Christmas Shopping Tuesday, so I figured there was no point in hauling the dogs home just to leave them shut up in the house all day, when I could stay one more night and they could play in a big yard all day instead. That night, SB and I went out to drive around and look at the Christmas Lights and talk.
(I swear, I need to carry a 2X4 around with "I'm not ugly" on one side and "I'm a good person who deserves to be happy" on the other. That boy has no self esteem, and maybe if I beat him over the head with it enough he'd get the picture.)
Tuesday. Yikes. We got all the shopping done (I swear every year that I'm going to start my shopping in June, and I never do....) but it was still a long day. I can't even brag about the perfect gifts I got people, cause they all read my blog!
So, Wednesday. I was going to go home Wednesday, but about twenty minutes before I was going to get my stuff together and get on the road, I got a phone call from one of the neighbors out in the country... the cows were out. So were the horses.
I spent all afternoon yesterday pushing cows around and making my horse, and SB's horse, mad. Farmmom got there to check the cows in good time to push some that I'd cut off on my way in... they were headed for Kansas, so I got them pushed onto the neighbor's wheat, figured they'd stay for a while, and went to get the horses since I didn't know where they were. I was planning on calling Mamaw and having her bring my tack out so I could get them with a horse rather than driving over the wheat.
Farmmom saw em on her way by so she started easing them towards our place as I was getting the ponies in the corrall... I'd discovered that the entire south side of the fence was down, so at least I had somewhere to take them in. Luckily, our ponies like people and figure that they usually get treats when they follow the pickup, so I just had to drive into the corrall and shut the gate.
Of course, when Monkey and Sis (SB's mare) saw that we were pushing calves around without them, they got cranky. That's their job... The other horses were milling around, wanting the out gate cause they like their pasture... Monkey and Sis were cutting a calf off together and taking it hither and yon in the big pen. They work well together...
So we got the calves all in, got the fence fixed, water re-arranged so that we could leave the cattle in the big pen and water the horses in one of the smaller ones, the tank heater replaced and the float cleaned on the tank in the big pen, and the other cows checked.
By then, it was dark.
To top the whole day off, on the way back into town, a german sheperd ran out about five feet in front of the pickup, stopped and looked at me. On the highway. No more doggie. No more right turn signal on Mamaw's pickup. Lovely recurring flash of the thump doggie made when the pickup hit him.
When I went to the house he belonged to, they basically said "It's ok, he's dumb, he's from Texas."
Ate dinner, and got a txt from SB so I went over to his house to lend an ear for a few hours. Came back to Mamaw's and went to bed.
And that's just since Friday!
Still have present wrapping to do, and packing. I'm moving back to the Old Homestead, since I'm planning on doing my internship down here, and there's no point in driving that much, or paying rent when I'm not there. So, much to do yet, including planning New Years, cause old friends will hopefully be in town.
I do know that I got a kickass pair of shoes for Christmas (since I picked them out) so I'll have great attitude shoes to wear for New Years. Yes, I do wear something other than boots, it just doesn't happen very often....

Moving around as a group
- Stay close to the group
- Never leave the group without telling a designated person (e.g., youth minister, chaperone).
- If you have to leave the group, go in groups of two or three after telling your group leader.
- The group leader is not the guide, but is the person in charge of the group (youth minister or head chaperone or priest or whoever is designated) and keeping everyone together.
- Establish a good way to quickly count heads. Perhaps set up sub groups that each report to the group leader who reports to the guide.
Getting on and off trains
- If possible, move your group toward the end of the platform as the end cars are typically less crowded. Even if the train looks full, it is not.
- It’s okay to get on two or three subway cars as long as there is a chaperone, group leader, or guide on each car, and each leader knows at which stop you are exiting.
- Getting on and off the Metro is not a time for polite deference. Do not push, but move on and off quickly as a whole group. Move toward the doors before the stop, if possible, to make exiting is easier.
- If someone does not get on the Metro with the group, tell them to stay exactly where they are. The group will count heads when they arrive. If someone is missing, they will send two people back to check the Metro station. Always backtrack if someone gets lost.
- If someone doesn’t get off the Metro with the group, tell them to get off on the next stop. Send two people on the next train to find them.
- Tell everyone the name of the station where you will be exiting the Metro before you get on. Teach them how to check the Metro maps when they are on the train. Most of these kids have never been on a subway, but they learn quickly.
- Be aware of your personal items in crowds. It is best to carry your backpack in the front.
- The guide should not be the last person on the Metro. Ask one chaperone to be the last person on the train and tell them the stop that you will be exiting. If that person misses the train, s/he can take the next one while the group waits at the designated stop.
- Groups tend to conglomerate as one monolithic roadblock for everyone else. Tell the groups to move to the side / to the wall if others are trying to get through. (You will need to tell them repeatedly.)
Getting Lost
- We mentioned what to do on the Metro, and the same is true for other circumstances.
- If you are walking to a new place and find that someone is missing, backtrack until you find them. That means that if you lose the group, stay put until they are found.
- Each person should have the cell phone number of the guide and the phone number and address of their lodging, as well.
- It is usually the two or three teens who don’t think the rules apply to them that get lost. They think they can hang much farther back from the group (and not look like they are part of it) and still make every connection. Plan on someone getting lost in every group.

Founder Carolyn Snowden was inspired by a similar dog cafe in Los Angeles — the country’s first such establishment, which opened last spring.
“I was just hooked. I thought ‘God, what a great concept. Why just LA? Why not every city possible?’” Snowden said to the Jacksonville Business Journal.
After a series of pop-ups — pup-ups? — starting last summer, the nonprofit Jacksonville Dog Cafe proper opened its doors on Feb. 11.
The cafe is, as yet, only open on Saturdays, from 10 in the morning until mid-afternoon. It’s located in the back of a barber shop, and the coffee is free — as is the dog petting.
The dogs — affiliated with a handful of local rescue groups — come in just before the cafe opens. “They lay around, take walk a with visitors and are social with everyone until we close,” Snowden tells Shelter Me. After closing time, they go home to their foster families.
Adoptions can be initiated at the dog cafe, too, though adopters must still go through background checks and home visits, before the applications are approved.
Snowden proudly says a dozen adoptions have gone through since the pop-ups got off the ground — and one more, since the cafe itself opened.
“My favorite moments have been mostly children interacting with the dogs. Their expressive faces light up when they get to spend time with these dogs,” she says. “The Jacksonville Dog Cafe is a place where lots of great things are happening.”
You definitely want to go visit the Jacksonville Dog Cafe, which is located at 5535 Roosevelt Boulevard in Jacksonville, Florida. Keep an eye on the Facebook page for schedule changes and special events.
And get in touch at aringreenwood@gmail.com with your story tips!

Among the principal findings of the report:
46% of all workers in Los Angeles, 811,000 workers, make less than $15 per hour.
More than half of those workers, 454,000, are full-time workers.
The average pay for low-wage, full-time workers is $9.55 and it is yet lower for part-time, low wage workers.
The low wage workers are concentrated in the hotel, restaurant, janitorial, security and construction sectors of the economy, in other words, globalization and out-sourcing is not the problem: The job of a hotel maid or an office janitor can’t be shipped off to Bangladesh.
The report looked at the consequences of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which is not exactly going to get you enough to buy a place in Beverly Hills, but it would come close to a living wage, something the Catholic Church has long taught is an obvious moral norm of economic life. Workers should be able to live decently and support their families if they work full-time.
The report stated that certain outcomes of raising the minimum wage are likely to occur. First, the standard of living of law wage workers would improve. Second, more money would stay in Los Angeles, rather than being invested elsewhere. Third, “[t.” So, raising the minimum wage would generate more economic activity within the city, producing a more localized economy. Sounds like the traditional Catholic doctrine of subsidiarity to me.
When LA’s labor leaders received the report, they were not really surprised. But, they wanted to call attention to the findings and wondered who might share their concern about the lives of people living in poverty and get the message out that something needs to be done. Maria Elena Durazo had the idea to invite the pope to Los Angeles.
“My family was very poor,” Durazo told me. “But they always had time to give to the Church. As poor as we were, my parents believed you always care for those who have less. When I heard Pope Francis speak about poor people and workers, it was like a dream come true. He was talking about my parents. Who ever talks about us?”
I asked Durazo what made her want to invite the pope to LA? “It wasn’t any one thing,” she told me. I go to this very poor parish just east of downtown. I’ve been hearing so much love for the pope, and not just there, but from non-Catholics and non-practicing Catholics too. He reaches beyond the Catholic community.”
So, Durazo wrote this letter to Pope Francis.
Dear Holy Father,
I was born into a very rich, very poor immigrant family. We were farm workers who migrated with the crops but we always carried with us our faith, our hope, and our sense of obligation to those who had even less than we did.
Since joining Cesar Chavez, I have dedicated myself to the simple idea that no one who works hard should stay poor.
Your profound embrace of the moral imperative that work is worthy of a wage that allows every human to form and support a family inspires me to continue.
I am writing to invite to come to our home, the City of the Angels. Nowhere in America are more working people making shamefully low wages as there are in Los Angeles.
We hope you will take joy in our campaign to allow others in our community to join in our invitation to you. We call it "Los Angeles' On-Line Invitation To Pope Francis" - it befits a Pope who allows us to follow him first on Twitter and then follow him to make the world a better place.
With love and in faith,
Maria Elena Durazo
The website is up and running: LosAngelesInvitesPopeFrancis.org. Ms. Durazo reached out to LA’s Archbishop Jose Gomez who has given his blessing to the effort. Like the kids in West Virginia who make solar panels for poor families in Africa, when someone wants to highlight a social justice concern, Pope Francis is becoming the go-to guy.
The Church in the U.S. has had a long history with organized labor. When the Vatican was worried about “secret societies,” in the nineteenth century, many of which were designed to fight the Church, it was Cardinal James Gibbons who successfully kept the Vatican from condemning the Knights of Labor, an early labor union that needed to meet in secret for fear of retribution from management. Indeed, it was the discussion about the Knights that laid the groundwork for Pope Leo’s seminal encyclical Rerum Novarum in 1891 which endorsed the rights of workers to organize.
In the wake of World War I, the U.S. bishops worked hand-in-glove with organized labor to put an end to child labor and to organize workers. How many union locals had their first meeting in the basement of a Church? Labor and most Catholic intellectuals enthusiastically embraced the New Deal. In the post-World War II era, the labor movement in the U.S. was unstained by Communism in large part because of the many Catholics who were union leaders. And, no one can talk about labor and the Church without remembering the work of Msgr. George Higgins or that of his successor today, Fr. Clete Kiley. The Church of Chicago has given many gifts to the Church in the U.S., but these two great labor priests are at the top of my list of significant contributions.
Now, the labor unions of Los Angeles are reaching out beyond their members via this new website to invite a new champion of the poor and working poor to visit their city. The pope has indicated he does not intend to travel as much as his predecessors, but who knows? And, whether he comes or not, the fact that his presence is so desired tells us a lot about him and a lot about the yearnings of working people: They were not as indifferent to the life of the spirit as some who moan about secularization led us to believe. They just needed to find a spiritual leader who spoke to their concerns. And, in Pope Francis, they have found him. Let’s hope he makes the trip to LA. Unlike most visitors, he will probably pass on the bus tour of fancy homes belonging to Hollywood movie stars are located in Beverly Hills. Look for him at Durazo's parish in east LA, where the truly beautiful people are to.About This Activity

Well, I did crash into a wall but it didn't give me the bung eye...I did do a stupid thing and something that the husband will laugh at when (if) I tell him about it.
What did I do? I took the lid of a hive. This is something that I have done before. It is something that I know how to do. It is something that I will do again in a couple of days time.
One day, a long time ago, in a dark dark forest...Oops, wrong story.
Yesterday was hot here, quite hot, too hot to do much. So I didn't. But come late afternoon, early evening it started to cool down and my list of things that needed doing was getting longer so I thought it would be a good idea to make a start. The Apiary need mowing. There is 1 hive in here with 3 others in the process of being moved in. The bees don't like the mower so I was careful to not get too close and the mowing was finished with enough time to get the mowers put away and the electric fence back up before it was too dark to get other jobs done. And I needed to put the sprinklers on in this paddock too. So I finish the mowing and even though the grass in front of the hive needed doing I didn't get too close because, you know, the bees don't like the mower...I take down the electric *gate* and start to take the mowers out, I had been using both the ride-on and the push mower, I take the ride-on out and ride it back to the house yard where I decide to mow along a fence line. The cows come over to where I am so I don't have to worry about the fact that I didn't put the electric gate back up...I finish the fence line and go back to the apiary to get the push mower but decide to mow a bit more and get closer to the bushes that are in there. By this time the last of the bees are flying home, they seem quiet and calm so I go and have a look at what they have, what colour the pollen on their legs is. I smell honey and think that maybe I will need to extract again soon, I'll have a quick look. I try and take the lid of the hive, it is stuck on and of course I don't have the hive tool with me as I wasn't planning on looking. But a quick pull and the lid comes off, I didn't really expect it too though and the bees all swarm up into my face and cover me. I start to panic, have to get the lid back on, there are bees everywhere...One is on my face, they are over my arms, everywhere, so I start swatting, NOT GOOD!! I start to run, they follow, I swat, they sting I run back across the paddock thinking that I really shouldn't pull my top off until I get into the house yard...Pull it off as I get to the back door, there are still bees all around me, I swoosh them away and get inside, kill the bees that come in with me. My face stings so I go look in the mirror to make sure that there are no more on me and think that I will have a shower and finish for the day. OH dear, maybe not finished for the day, where are my glasses? Now, it was darkish inside and I can't see much without my glasses so I couldn't see if I had put them on the bench or table like I usually do. I get the phone, squint with 1 eye shut (otherwise I see double) and make out a name that might be the daughters so ring it. It is, she answers and I quickly tell her what happened and she needs to get here before dark. Five minutes and she is here, I am waiting outside with a torch,it is not quite dark yet and tell here what happened, where it happened, what I think was my route of escape...The cows are back over near the unelectrified apiary with the gate down and where I don't want them to go...Daughter and grandaugheter tke the torch and slowing make their way across to the apiary where she finds my hat then finds my glasses. I am so thankful that the cows hadn't trod on them and that they survived me knocking them off in my mad panic. I put them on, that's clearer, put the mowers away, she turns the sprinklers on and she goes home and I come in for my much needed shower before having a much more needed coffee. The day is over.
This morning I wake up and I have a bung eye. Swollen underneath but not sore, just uncomfortable...

What a mesmerizing and frightening experience. That sting would put me in ER. Just don't do that again. I want bees someday, but this scares me. At least you found your glasses unscathed.
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
Yeah, I would have been lost without them. Thousand dollars and 2 weeks to replace. No reading, no computer, no driving, no TV...Hope the new year is a good one for you too.
Even with the cataract in one eye, I can see to do all of that, albeit, some of it poorly. Thankfully, I still have excellent far vision and can drive and watch TV. Depending on the size of the type, I can read. However, the time spent without glasses and the cost would be a real problem! You must not be allergic to bees.
Visiting via Simple Savings blog list.....what a frightening story. A friend of ours years ago had hives in his front suburban yard....I kept well away, although now I love watching bees visiting my lavender hedge and Basil bush when in bloom....at a respectful distance.
Love your writing.
Alexa blogging randomly from Sydney
Hi Alex. Husband told me everything that I did wrong...but I already knew it all. haha. I do need to get out there and have a proper look at the hives but will get dressed in all my gear first! Thanks for visiting.Marketing Executive & office female staff ( 0 - 5 yrs)

Harry’s Helpers is the brainchild of 16-year-old pupil Harry Mills and gives those in Years Seven, Eight and Nine the chance to email any questions to the group of nine, who all have a specialist homework subject.
The idea was brought to the table after Christmas, and is already proving popular. Harry said: “We felt the previous lunchtime club for students was not really working and thought the best way was to do something online. It really helps me as well with my revision too, and it is a great feeling people appreciate what we’re doing.” Pictured with Harry’s Helpers is Jim Knowles, associate assistant headteacher.There are some good points here about what can and can't be achieved with schema-awareness. But there seem to be one or two observations that result from your pressing the wrong buttons - always a hazard when you try out a new piece of technology. 1. You have the rather curious statement: "In Saxon the input document must also be XHTML or the schema of the input document must also be imported or the -vlax parameter must be used at the command line or the -val parameter must not be used in order to turn input validation off." And later in section 5 you say "we must ... turn the validation of input documents off". But validation of input documents is off by default, so I think this gives a wrong impression. What you are really saying is: if you ask for validation you must supply a schema. (Note also there are several other ways you can provide it, for example using schemaLocation in the source document or via the Java API). 2. You say: "In Saxon we must use a parameter at the command line to treat errors more like warnings. Now the error message is useless, "one or more errors found", and nothing is highlighted in the stylesheet." Basically I think this must be a case of you pressing the wrong buttons. (a) for "must use" read "can also use". (b) Saxon doesn't have a GUI, so it isn't going to highlight anything in the stylesheet: that's the job of the IDE's that integrate Saxon, such as Stylus Studio and Oxygen. Saxon does however produce detailed error messages about where the errors appear. By default these are written to the standard error stream, and if you didn't see these messages then it's because you either directed them somewhere else, or you somehow didn't see the contents of the standard error stream. I've given some examples of how the errors should appear on the console in a footnote this message. 3. You say: ." Yes: this is a limitation of the approach. Clearly Saxon can't issue an error message if your code is correct according to the language spec. I think it's an inherent aspect of the very dynamic nature of the template mechanism that you can't be sure at compile time that a template is generating invalid output unless it declares the type of output it is designed to generate. There are some cases where Saxon gets round this by generating compile time warnings if the code looks implausible, even though it might be correct according to the spec. I think this might be a way forward to reduce this problem. 4. You say: "If namespace declarations other than for XHTML are copied to the result-document it becomes not valid XHTML 1.0. This is not nice when both processors have just reported "no validation errors"." Agreed - another usability problem. You're presumably aware of the reason: to be "valid XHTML 1.0" you need to do more than conform to the XHTML schema, you also need to get your namespace prefixes right, and schema validity offers no guarantee of that. Although there's no support for this in the XSLT language spec, I think it would be possible for products like Saxon to offer users a bit more help here, by treating XHTML output as a special case. 5. In your example in section 5, you say "Note the, so validation is going to insert the default value (just as DTD validation would). One advantage of schemas over DTDs here is that's it's much easier to produce a version of the schema that removes the fixed and default values, to avoid this effect happening if you don't want it. You complain about this again in section 6 "Saxon insists in copying all that dirt out of the schema and into the result-document". Sorry, but it's required for conformance with the specs. A product that validates against a schema without expanding the fixed and default values defined in the schema is not conformant. If the validation were happening on the input side, your stylesheet would be entitled to rely on seeing the default values and would break if they weren't there. If you don't want this to happen, define a schema that doesn't include the fixed and default values. Footnote ======== Here are some examples of error messages: (i) a validity problem with an input document: java net.sf.saxon.Transform -im single-doc -val -o c:\temp\out.html conformance.xml render-page2.xsl Validation error on line 22 column 89 of file:/c:/MyJava/doc/saxon8/changes.xml: XTTE1510: The content model for element <li> does not allow character content (See clause 2.3) Error on line 346 of file:/c:/MyJava/doc/saxon8/render-page2.xsl: FODC0005: ValidationException: The content model for element <li> does not allow character content (2 messages, one giving the location in a source document, the other the location in the stylesheet that caused this source document to be read) (ii) a validity problem with the output that can be detected at compile time: Error on line 20 of file:/c:/demo2/queries/err-sa-xslt004.xsl: XTTE1510: Element h:tittle is not permitted in the content model of the complex type of element head Failed to compile stylesheet. 1 error detected. Note how the error message points to the place in the stylesheet where the error occurs. The offending line is this: <h:html xsl: <h:head><h:tittle>A list of functions</h:tittle></h:head> <h:body> (iii) a run-time validity problem with the output: Validation error on line 38 of file:/c:/demo2/queries/err-sa-xslt004.xsl: XTTE1510: In content of element <body>: The content model does not allow element <div> to appear here. Expected one of: {}blockquote, {}dfn, {}br, {}h6, {}p, {}sup, {}hr, [other possibilities snipped] (See clause 2.4) Transformation failed: Run-time errors were reported The error message here points to a line in the stylesheet that does: <xsl:copy-of - the error arises because the <div> element being copied is in the wrong namespace. (iv) Same as (ii), but with the -vw (validation warnings) option on the command line: Same messages on the console, but this time the invalid output HTML is written to the requested destination, with embedded comments. The relevant section of the output file looks like this: <h:h1>fn:collection() => node()*</h:h1> <!-- VALIDATION ERROR: In content of element <body>: The content model does not allow element <div> to appear here. Expected one of: {}blockquote, {}dfn, {}br, [list snipped] {}samp --> <div xmlns:xsi="" Anyway, thanks for the feedback. It's good to see schema-aware processing getting some discussion. There are real benefits, but as you point out there are also limitations and things to learn about what works well and what doesn't. There are also opportunities for products to go beyond the spec - checking for XHTML validity being an obvious example. Michael Kay Saxonica LimitedMilitary Resources: Vietnam War

Dewsbury peer Lady Warsi told a Sunday newspaper that the Conservatives had failed to appeal to voters from Britain’s ethnic minorities.
Her comments followed her resignation from the Government earlier this week in protest at its failure to condemn Israel’s actions in Gaza more fully.
Baroness Warsi was an early supporter of David Cameron’s bid to be leader and was later made co-chairman of the party.
In her interview she said.
Talking about the Tories’ 2015 election prospects, she said: “I will be out there, vocally fighting for an outright Conservative majority.
“But the electoral reality is that we will not win outright Conservative majorities until we start attracting more of the ethnic vote.”
Her comments earned a withering response from Mr Shelbrooke.
“I think within a week, ‘Who was Lady Warsi?’ will be the question. She has ended her career in many ways.”
He suggested she had undermined her position on Gaza by “spreading out into areas of different criticism”.
“Don’t you embarrass yourself if you start launching into a tirade about many other things, when you come from a position of having never held elected office?” he added.MOSCOW (AP) — Russian authorities say 19 people have died after a helicopter carrying 28 people, including 11 children, crashed in a remote Siberian region of Yakutia.
The Interstate Aviation Committee, Russia's top aviation body, said that a Mi-8 helicopter crash-landed in a remote mountainous area on Tuesday, dozens of miles away from the nearest village, and caught fire.
The committee said there were 28 people on board. Emergency officials said that 11 of them were children.
Officials did not immediately comment on the cause of the crash.
Russia has a dismal record of aviation safety, mostly blamed on poor safety standards and an aging fleet.

One such town, Millbrae, California sits northwest of Burlingame. In fact, Millbrae is of key interest for its distinctly suburban focus. Also, its homes are among the most attractive in San Mateo County real estate. What’s more, Millbrae real estate has a prime back drop of well-planned, family-friendly neighborhoods, parks and green spaces.

Murder charge laid for death of inmate at Stony Mountain prison
A source tells CTV News that Taylor had been stabbed, and was in the mental health section of Stony Mountain Institution. (file image)

Potatoes are a nutritious starchy vegetable.
The way you prepare your potatoes will determine how nutritious they are, but all types of potatoes can be a healthy source of fiber and essential nutrients when prepared and served with little or no added fat. Different types of potatoes have slightly different nutritional compositions, but sweet potatoes have a slight advantage since they provide higher amounts of a number of essential vitamins and minerals.
Macronutrients
A 100-gram serving of baked white potatoes, red skin potatoes or sweet potatoes with skin contains between 89 and 94 calories and provides 2 grams of protein and 20 to 21 grams of carbohydrate. Both protein and carbohydrates provide your body with energy, and protein also provides essential amino acids for forming new cells in the body. White potato and red skin potato provide 2 grams of fiber per serving, and sweet potato provides 3 grams of fiber per serving toward the recommended daily fiber intake of between 21 and 38 grams, depending on your age and gender. Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that is important for healthy digestive function and can lower your risk for obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol and heart disease.
Vitamins
Sweet potatoes provide 19,218 international units of vitamin A per 100-gram serving, which is 440 percent of the daily value for vitamin A. This is significantly more than white or red skin potatoes, which contain only 10 international units. Vitamin A is essential for healthy vision, cell division and immune function. Sweet potatoes also provide more vitamin C, with a serving providing 20 milligrams, or 40 percent of the DV, compared to the 13 milligrams found in a serving of white or red skin potatoes. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that is needed for building and repairing cells in your body. All three types of potato contain 4 percent of the DV for folate. Sweet potatoes contain more riboflavin, providing 8 percent of the DV compared to the 2 percent of the DV in white and red skin potatoes.
Minerals
Sweet potatoes contain more calcium than red skin and white potatoes, but red skin and white potatoes provide more magnesium. A 100-gram serving of sweet potatoes contains 4 percent of the daily value for calcium and 6 percent of the daily value for magnesium, compared to the trace amounts of calcium and 8 percent of the daily value for magnesium provided by red skin and white potatoes. Calcium and magnesium are both important for strong bones and nerve and muscle function. All three types of potatoes contain about the same amount of phosphorus, zinc and iron, providing 6 percent of the daily value for phosphorus and 2 percent of the daily value for zinc and iron per 100-gram serving.
Considerations
Baking is one of the healthier methods for cooking potatoes. Instead of butter or sour cream, consider topping your potato with vegetarian chili, yogurt or broccoli with low-fat cheese. Eat the skin as well as the flesh, as this is the most nutrient-dense part of the potato. Avoid eating any part of the potato that has green skin or new growth, as these parts contain a bitter toxin.

The composite is assembled in Photoshop where I can use layers for each image. The three images above were used in this composite with the left photo on the bottom, middle photo above that, and the right photo of a tilted building facade on top. I use various means to meld the images together. Sometimes it is as simple as dialing down a layer's opacity; other times I change the layer's mode. The bottom layer is always "Normal". The middle layer was changed to "Screen", and the top layer to "Overlay".
I add layer masks to the top layers so I can selectively paint out places where I want the bottom layers to dominate. I also add several adjustment layers attached to each image so I can control their individual color, contrast, and brightness. That is pretty much it in a nutshell, although a final composite can take be several days of fiddling before I get it the way I want it to look.
Initially, I began this series by double and triple exposing images in camera with the Fuji X-T1, but switched to working the images in Photoshop where I have much more control. I also switched to a higher resolution camera because my plan is to make very large prints of the final composites.What is Generic rigevidon?

the banding is a reality. Whether it is fatal or not is up to everyone but I think I have every right to judge this as fatal for me (exactly as I wrote) and I have made up my mind.
Fair enough.
I need smooth skies, the DP2M does not deliver that - so no DP2M for me.
This is where I think you are jumping to conclusions. There are some pictures floating around where one can see banding - but no reliable information is available about the processing at all. All we have are some JPEGs. I've actually seen enough DP2M pictures with smooth skies so far.
Other DP2M quirks that are probably true but not yet fully confirmed:
low battery life (only 100 pictures per battery)
Fully confirmed - the DP2M comes with 2 batteries and one batterie allows for roughly 100 shots. See the DP2M manual on Sigma Japan's site.
still slow writing times - although camera might be functional
Around 14 secs per RAW - there is a video on YouTube which shows an SD1 / DP2M comparison.
The DP (and to a certain part also the SD) series has always been quirky and even though it is a new series the probability that there will be others quirks is very high. So assuming that the DP2M is quirkless is quite optimistic.
I wouldn't call the DP2M quirky (but that's just me). The DP2M is pushing the limits. It requires two Dual II processors and it has to process roughly 45 MB of data per shot (in RAW mode). Hence the slow writing (processing) times and the load on the batteries. All this in a very small package.
The DP2M is that rare beast - a dedicated picture taking machine without bells and whistles.
I will get my DP2M this Friday - I might write about my experiences, but I'm afraid that that will only attract the usual banding (no offence) / aliasing / blown highlights / muddy shadows / high ISO / chromatic abberrations etc fetishists:rebuilt by moonworker1

To me coffee is more than just an energy boost – it’s integrated into the social aspect of our everyday lives. Think about it, coffee is a conversational piece. What’s the first thing most people say when they want to get together, “how about we meet for a cup of coffee?” A lot of us know about coffee and are around coffee all the time, but what is coffee?
Definition
Coffee is a drink made from roasted coffee beans. The coffee bean is actually the seed contained in the fruit of the coffee tree, referred to as the coffee cherry. Coffee trees are able to grow up to 30 feet but they are generally pruned short. Coffee trees are covered with dark-green waxy leaves that grow opposite each other in pairs. The coffee cherries grow along the tree branches.
Coffee grows in warm, humid climates up to 6,000 feet above sea level. It takes on average about a year for a cherry to develop. Realistically, the plant needs to grow for about 5 years before it’s fruit has commercial value. Coffee plants can live up to 100 years but are most productive between the ages of 7 and 20 years.
Two Species: Arabica and Robusta
There are two species of coffee that are important in the commercial coffee industry. Arabica and Robusta.
Coffee arabica originates from the original coffee trees found in Ethiopia and is approximately 75-80 percent of the world’s coffee production. The trees produce a small white flower that emits a sweet smell. These trees make a fine, mild aromatic coffee. Arabica coffees are usually higher in price due to the fact that they cost more to cultivate.
Coffee robusta consists of 30 percent of the world’s coffee production. The trees produce more coffee cherries than arabica trees and grow at lower altitudes and are more resistant to diseases. Most of the world’s robusta is grown in Central and Western Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. Robusta beans make a more bitter coffee as compared to coffee arabica and are used in coffee blends, espresso and instant coffee.For over three decades Altodigital has been involved in providing office copy and print technology, supported by exceptional service, to a growing portfolio of organisations throughout both the public and private sectors.

Conclusions
This is the first article to review the definition of crisis in the context of dementia care. A review of the literature indicated that the definition of a crisis is idiosyncratic. Therefore, it is difficult to prevent or plan for all crises.

English Oak (binomial name Quercus robur) is the type species of the genus (the species by which the oak genus Quercus is defined), and a member of the white oak section Quercus. English oak is indigenous to most of Europe, and to Anatolia to the Caucasus, and also to parts of North Africa.[1]
Wandlore.[2]).[2]
Folklore
The divide between holly and oak aforementioned is believed to be the origin of the old superstition, “when his wand’s oak and hers is holly, then to marry would be folly,” a superstition that Garrick Ollivander found to be baseless.[2]

Bernard Weil, Chief Photographer/Multimedia
In 1990, former Toronto Star staff photographer Andrew Stawicki and Photo Editor Peter Robertson invited myself along with a small group of other Toronto based professional photographers to form a non-profit collective determined to explore how photography can contribute to social justice and to focus on realities with which we are all too familiar such as poverty, illness and injustice.
To mark the occasion, a retrospective exhibition of photographs from 20 years of PhotoSensitive projects is on display from September 14-27 at the Allen Lambert Galleria, Brookfield Place, Toronto, along with a panel discussion September 16 at the Verizon Grand Hall at the Hockey Hall of Fame, of which I have the honour of being a part of.
Below are are some images from a few of the projects I've had the privilege to be part of. To say the least, it has opened my eyes to the frailties of life, as well as the incredible determination of the human spirit.
Braille = Equality
PhotoSensitive spent several months working with the blind and visually impaired to help the public better understand the importance of braille. Louis Braille's invention of six raised dots enables the blind to read and write and function in our sighted society.
A worker at CNIB in Toronto inspects an acetate sheet imprinted with braille which will be used to produce a printed page.
Them = Us
I dove into digital at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and never looked back. It was fast and helped us beat the wires, so on this project I wanted to further explore digital photography in a new and creative way.
I spent a week in 1997 at the Etobicoke School of the Arts taking photographs of nearly 700 students and ended up with 28,800 images which were used in the final photograph below. Each student is in the image many times. The main image of three dance students was used as a template. The final print allows viewers to move in closer to see thousands of smaller images.
The technology was a lot slower then, and the final 100MB file was unheard of at the time. It also took me a year to produce, one image at a time on what was then considered a state of the art Macintosh computer. I then had to print it. The printer was a Lightjet 5000 and there were only two in Canada at the time. It was the only printer that had the resolution I needed.
We have to find unique ways to tell people's stories and we have to be prepared to take chances and do it differently. The digital revolution led me in that direction with this photo.
The final image above was printed 4 feet wide, making each image within a 1/4 inch in size. Below is a blow up from the image above.
Beyond the Wave
In 2005, five PhotoSensitive photographers, including myself, travelled to Indonesia and Sri Lanka to document the reality of lives affected by the December 26, 2004 tsunami. PhotoSensitive partnered with World Vision and CARE Canada to raise awareness of the tsunami's continuing impact and the positive results of Canadian aid and development work, one year after the disaster. The sights and smells are forever burned in my memory.
Irul Jubir throws stones into a waiting dump truck provided by Care, at the shoreline on the outskirts of Banda Aceh, October 17, 2005. Aceh Province withstood a direct hit from the tsunami that devasted coastal areas of the Indian Ocean a year earlier.
A home lies in ruin near the shore in Ulhee Lhea, beside Banda Aceh, October 22, 2005, located at the north eastern tip of Sumatra Island, Indonesia. The devastation exists as far as the eye can see in some areas.
A lone fisherman tends to his nets on the outskirts of Banda Aceh, October 17, 2005. The shoreline and all buildings were wiped out as the result of a 100 foot high surge of water that crashed into land and pulled everything back out to sea.
Arifin lays bricks on a home for World Vision in the village of Lamgriheu, near Banda Aceh October 20, 2005, located at the northern tip of Sumatra Island, Indonesia. The area was one of the first and hardest hit by the tsunami a year earlier and is only now starting to be rebuilt.
Young children are taught Islamic religion at a school outside Banda Aceh October 20, 2005 along the north west tip of Sumatra Island. Despite the devastation, life continues.
HIV Positive
In April 2002, CARE welcomed myself and six other members of Photosensitive to Zambia to document the HIV/AIDS crisis. In the heart of southern Africa, Zambia is one of the poorest but most peaceful nations on the continent. Sadly, the HIV/AIDS scourge is deepening poverty.
Ovies Mwila, 31, carries a coffin to a work area where he will finish the trim and lining inside, April 8, 2002. The small hut where he sells his coffins can be seen from the main road leading to Lukasa, the capital of Zambia. Together with his father Ovi, 52, they also repair vehicles and make door and window frames. Ovi sais the coffin business is busy because of the huge number of HIV related deaths.
Sick and very weak from an HIV related illness, George Sakala is rushed several kilometres through a field to the St. John Hospice on the outskirts of Lusaka, Zambia, April 11, 2002, where he most likely will spend his last days of life. Helping him are his mother Monica (black top), caregivers Scostica Mumba and Agnes Zulu. Sakala was found sick and dying, huddled on the floor of his home in the Misisi compound on the outskirts of Lusaka. The illegal compound is home to 50-60,000 people. Caregivers at the Misisi Home based Care Centre make daily visits to the sick.
Later, inside the St. John Hospice, George Sakala is comforted by his mother Monica.

Inside Islam, Part 2
When asked about the cultural outfit or dress of the women in Islamic communities and countries, Baseema is equally straightforward. “The burka was instigated by the Bedouin because of the average male’s propensity in that part of the world to breed with anything that moved. It began as a way to stop other men from attempting to breed with each other’s property. That was centuries ago. It isn’t much different today.

While we are busy hearing one thing from the government and Muslim groups like CAIR and ACORN, and still another thing from the media, it would appear that this particular individual spent a few years living the life of a dedicated Muslim woman within the Islamic community in which the story was altogether different for her from the one that is normally presented to the world about Islam. Is this merely a coincidence, or is what we are being fed the lie?

Playing Right into the Hands of the Unions
I sat last evening listening to a few hours of news shows on TV where the biggest debate concerned the teacher/public employee situation in Wisconsin. Of course, if you ask a pro-union person/member what Gov. Walker is trying to do, they will tell you point blank that he is out to destroy the unions. In fact, this thought also came from Mr. Obama’s mouth. Because of that, anyone who is pro-union, a Democrat, or a Leftwing Liberal in general will believe that this is what Walker is attempting to do.

Lefties Wish Death On Republican, Governor Walker
While the attitude and demeanor of people seem to be bending to the Left, the Right will be seen more and more as bias, bigoted, hate-mongering and the like. This is what the Left is doing. They make false claims against conservatives and if that does not work, they will simply resort to name-calling. What they hope to accomplish is to make people believe that conservatives are such a minority, that it is not worth even being part of that movement.

Recent CommentsEach week seems to see a new food recall; now there is a walnut products recall in place due to an outbreak of E. coli illness. You can see a list of brands and products that contain the E. coli bacteria, if you believe that you have any of the infected items, then please stop eating them immediately.
This outbreak has seen 13 people coming forward with their illness due to an E. coli fears. Nine of these were sent to hospital for treatment, while two developed a more serious case of the illness called haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). It comes as no surprise that this issue is being taken seriously, so you really need to study the chart that we have for you below, which was thanks to CBC News.
If HUS is left untreated, then it could result in kidney failure, something that you do not expect to get just by eating walnuts. Thankfully all cases were treated in time, and now all are expected to make a full recovery – but it is hard to understand what would have happened if they were not seen by medical staff.
We can see three brands in all, these are as follows: Amira, Merit Selection and Tia. The recall is not only for raw Shelled Walnuts, but also Mistral Mix and Salad booster. If you have eaten any of these products and are now suffering from abdominal pain as well as bloody diarrhea, then we advise you to visit your doctor or head to hospital.
Other recent food recalls include Del Monte Cantaloupe, Lean Cuisine and Skippy Peanut Butter.

Winart's Keeper of the Goal (RIP) One of his show pictures. We lost him at 15 1/2
How did you accomplish the horseback pics? My Abbey grew up around horses but she's never expressed an interest in riding one!!
Actually when I got her I took her out to see my horse she wanted to run right up to him. She was so tiny when I got her weighed less then 3lbs at 3 months old. I put her on Blue Buffalo dog food and she started growing her weight now at 2 1/2 is usually between 18 and 19 lbs now. Anyway back to the subject of her with horses. If I pick her up and am standing beside my horse she tries to climb onto his back. She loves to ride in the cart when I'm driving my horse.
I believe on another thread, you mentioned that Lady Kay-Dee was from IA. Do you have the breeder's name? I could not find her in the Basenji Pedigree Database. How old is Kay-Dee?

Kay-Dee is 2 1/2. The breeder only had the basenjis for a short time. She traded one of her Arabians for the bred dogs. She got hurt and had to sell the Basenjis.
Arwen It's a minature horse yearling.
Took these pictures in the winners photo spot at The Special Olympics Equestrian show today.
Lovely photos and isn't she a pretty girl! Does she stay in the saddle or does she jump off when the horse moves?
Thank you. Everywhere I go she attracts attention and I call them members of her fan club. LOL
We've been putting her on my friends pony and I walk beside her. She walks around on him then she will lay down on him. She is still trying to get her balance on him She doesn't try to jump off. In fact when I pick her up near the horses she will try to get out of my arms and onto him. When she sees me harnesses my horse to the cart she gets all excited. She loves to ride in the cart too.
Great pictures. Thank you so much for sharing them with us.

"DEACN." Abbreviations.com. STANDS4 LLC, 2015. Web. 22 May 2015. <>.The rumor mill has been spinning at a furious pace for the Bolts and their draft forecast of late now that the team’s total pick allotment has been established. San Diego is now in possession of eight draft choices in total with five of those picks in rounds one through three with the final three occurring in rounds six and seven.
Compensatory picks were awarded as scheduled to the deserving clubs this past Friday with 32 choices in total being handed out by the league. The Chargers’ grand total of eight picks (18, 50, 61, 82, 89, 178, 201 and 233) heading into April’s draft is second only to the New England Patriots at this point and sets the team up to have a successful offseason in replenishing their roster’s talent pool.
Everyone knows that General Manager A.J. Smith has a tendency to wheel and deal when it comes to the draft and maneuvering to land players that he really covets. This year could be no exception with some significant ammunition on the team’s plate with five picks out of the top 89 overall.
Plenty of rumors have been swirling as to the players the team may consider at their current first round selection point of 18th overall in round number one, but the positions of interest seem to be unanimous. Priorities for the Bolts are mainly on defense this offseason with the team needing to add some quality on both the defensive line and in the pass rushing department at outside linebacker. Fortunately for San Diego, it seems that the defensive end position is particularly deep in terms of quality players who could be potential day one starters and make a real impact at that position.
It is just recently however that the idea of getting two picks in the first round has become a part of the conversation. There has been a history between the Chargers when it comes to making deals with the New England Patriots who are always looking to trade and stock up on picks for a rainy day. New England is again a topic of conversation as the owners of two first round picks this April and may wish to trade down from one of those selections.
The pick in question is the 28th overall selection (New England’s second in round one) and there are several scenarios that could play out and offer and enticing situation for the Chargers to pounce on. There is some evidence to support such a trade being in the works according to sources as this link details a potential trade with the Pats and that the Bolts’ two second round picks would be an attractive value for the Patriots in trading off of the 28th selection.
Let’s take a trip back in time to the 2005 NFL Draft when the Chargers were already the owners of two picks in the draft’s opening round. The team was zeroed in on defensive prospects and landed pass rushing specialist Shawne Merriman with the 12th overall pick and then turned to the defensive line for end Luis Castillo at 28.
Now back to the present where the Chargers could potentially be in position to get a quality pass rusher the likes of Ryan Kerrigan from Purdue with the 18th overall pick and then turn to the defensive line in a trade up scenario with the Pats at pick 28 and snag Miami’s Allen Bailey. Such a scenario would be nearly identical to the way the draft played itself out in 2005 which is widely regarded as one of GM Smith’s most successful classes during his tenure with the Bolts. It has been reported that the former Miami Hurricane Bailey is scheduled to visit with the Chargers which could be yet another piece of this draft puzzle falling into place.
According to proverbs, having your cake and eating it too is widely regarded as an impossibility, but for the Bolts in this year’s NFL Draft, it could become a reality. Even in a trade up scenario such as the one outlined above, the team would still have their two third round picks as well as two in the sixth and one in the seventh to use on more depth.
A position such as offensive tackle is also considered to be a need for the Chargers, but the depth at that position is such that it could allow the team to find a so-called ‘diamond in the rough’ later on in the selection process. GM Smith offered his thoughts on the strengths of this year’s class on the team’s website saying: “This particular draft to me is very, very strong at defensive line. Defensive ends and defensive tackles. And I think there’s quality through the draft at offensive tackle. That seems to jump out at me right now. There are some other intriguing positions that are pretty good too, but I’ll give you those two. I think if you’re looking for help at offensive tackle and you’re looking for help on the defensive line, be it defensive tackle or defensive end, I think there’s some outstanding players there that are going to be really good pros.”
It sounds like Smith is determined to give this team the help it needs in the trenches this offseason and hopefully toughen them up for a more physical brand of football. The old cliché of the game being won and lost along the line of scrimmage is still applicable as evidenced by the Bolts missing the playoffs for the first time in five seasons last year. Adding some quality to both sides of the ball in the trenches should rectify that area of concern and turn some of those L’s into W’s in 2011.
Now let’s hear from you. Do you think the two compensatory picks that the team received frees them up to make more deals during the draft? How do you feel about the prospect of having two first round picks this offseason? Does the outlined trade up scenario remind you of the 2005 draft when the Bolts had defensive players as their main targets? How would the addition of two players like Ryan Kerrigan and Allen Bailey impact that quality of the team’s defense in 2011? Channel your inner A.J. Smith, will he be content to stay at his current draft choices as they are or will he be swayed by the temptation to trade up when draft day arrives? Please leave you thoughts in the comments section below!

Sigh. Can we ever have a draft where the Chargers do not trade up? I have a hard time accepting the notion that adding 6th and 7th round comp picks frees the Chargers to give away their two 2nd rounders to trade into spot 28. Those simply don't come close to comparing with the type of players two 2nd round picks would bring.
As for specific names, please don't draft Kerrigan. He is a project who would move from DE to OLB, but would take time to develop and may not have the required athleticism to play that position. Why take on another 1st round project like that when the team seems to still have high hopes for Larry English? This year's draft has lots of players who played DE in college but project to 3-4 OLB in the NFL. We do need to invest in depth at that spot, but if a guy is going to take a couple years to develop anyway, why not pick that guy in the 2nd round instead of the 1st.
Beyond that, late 1st is too high for Bailey, who looks like a mid-2nd rounder to me. A much better approach would be to get JJ Watt in the 1st and target an OLB prospect like Brooks Reed, Sam Acho or Jabaal Sheard in the 2nd. Then use the other 2nd to grab a new RT, and you still have two 3rd rounders to address depth at positions like WR, CB, S, ILB, etc. The 6th and 7th rounders can be used to target "specialists", like a kick returner, a 3rd down back and special teamers that will hopefully prevent the team from giving up 47 kickoff return touchdowns again.
cczer08 has it right . Bailey is no 1st rounder. If Watt's not there at 18th then take Wilkerson and in the 2nd round Sheard or Acho should be available. Reed will be gone with the 50th pick for sure. Middle linebacker is a vital need with the next 2nd round pick. We need at least three new starters on the defense. Sign Clary or another free agent for right tackle and we should be fine on the OLine for one more year. In the 3rd round a reciever like Titus Young or Jerrel Jernigan would be the spark plug we need to bring the offense to the next level. Jernigan is a great reciever.
I agree with both - hard to tell who's really going to be there but we're more in need of front line pressure from the outside with the age & skill we've currently got and hope that pressure ties up lineman to free an English to be more effective. We've seen the various names but we need some bulk and tenacity. Sure, I'd take Watt if he clears the earlier teen picks. But we don't want linebacker size, we want someone who can man up. Between English and Butler we have no idea what we already have on the roster. I wouldn't be surprised if it took Butler another year but he still could be a good pick. Hopefully he get's some playing time and starts to get acquainted. I like the DE first, then see if you can package a 3 and a couple later picks to get someone's high 2. If we could get a #18 pick in the first, 3 second round picks spread throughout, and one 3 we could get some serious talent a variety of positions.
Let's not trade! We are in a good position to fill our needs with the picks we have. Keep all our current picks!
we have to search for good player who there name not found yet to many good player there will be there we have to find them and get them with out tread or less cost we have to be sharp and good to find the hidden fire in there eyes we need good scouting team not just good G.M. only

RACISM AND BIGOTRY IS NOT ALLOWEDAfter a day, I found that, in Unity dashboard, there is a recent-files box showing ALL THE FILES I opened.
I don't like anyone to see what I have opened. A possible scenario would be I have to show other people how to do something, either locally or remotely, and they could see what I have opened (meaning the "files" I have in my machine.) I will not have any privacy at all.
I searched and found that the "recent-files" list is stored in a file named "recently-used.xbel" under "/home/YOURUSERNAME/.local/share/"
Example content of the file:
<xbel version="1.0" xmlns: <bookmark added="2012-05-07T03:55:02Z" href="" modified="2012-05-07T03:55:02Z" visited="2012-05-07T03:55:02.049049Z"> <info> <metadata owner=""> <mime:mime-type <bookmark:groups> <bookmark:group>Graphics</bookmark:group> </bookmark:groups> <bookmark:applications> <bookmark:application </bookmark:application></bookmark:applications> </mime:mime-type></metadata> </info> </bookmark> </xbel>
A way to empty the list is to empty the file(or delete it with "rm"), to empty the file use this command:
echo -n > ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel
This can be made into a shell script and to make it clickable whenever one needs to clean the history.
Or put the script in startup application list to clean it every time the machine starts.
** There is also an old trick for Ubuntu <12.04 to make a directory named "recently-used.xbel" in its place, instead of a file. Unfortunately, someone said it doesn't work with the new Ubuntu (I also haven't tested that yet).
Above method will just deal with the history storage, we did not touch the application that do the "logging" yet.
The logging application is called "zeitgeist-daemon" running in the background.
It might be possible to remove Zeitgeist-daemon from your system, on this page suggest that you could do these command both in order to get rid of it.
sudo apt-get --purge remove zeitgeist sudo apt-get autoremoveAlthough, there is another way to disable or configure(if you just want partial of it to enabled.)_It is to use "Activity Log Manager".
** in this blog, it seems that Activity Log Manager owned its place in "System->Privacy". Although, I couldn't find it there. So, I installed it manually.
To install and use Activity Log Manager:
sudo apt-get install activity-log-manager activity-log-manager
The application will launched and it looks like this:
on the first page, you can choose when to delete the logged activities, or manually delete it.
There is also a switch at the bottom to enable/disable the activity logging program(zeitgeist).
On the second tab, you'll see more option to configure for file-opened logging. You can discard logging on specific file types, or discard logging files from a specific folder.
On the third tab, there is application-level configuration. Meaning, it will ignore logging for the application you have put in this list.
After finish configuring, close the Activity Log Manager, logout, and login again. Now it'll log only what you want it to log and show only that to Unity dashboard.
** Actually, Zeitgeist is still logging EVERYTHING and put it into ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel but it just does not show on Unity dashboard. Therefore, it's good to clean the file once in a while.
ref:

sudo apt-get --purge remove zeitgeist
sudo apt-get autoremove
those commands are works, "recently used files" are gone
thank u AniDear
I've deleted ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel and created a folder with exactly the same name. I't works... no more logging
Here is another permanent solution. Edit recently-used.xbel to make sure it is empty, or just keep the files you want in there. Then save and open terminal.
Type this
sudo chattr +i ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel
this will lock the file, so that even root cannot edit it.
Works for me, I hope it works for you.See Of The Most Famous Bathroom Scenes In Cinema!

Enchiladas, a dish of stuffed and rolled tortillas bathed in a chile sauce, has many permutations. At its most trashy, it contains an overdose of cheap gooey cheeses and is laden with salts and fats. But at its very best, it’s hearty and rustic fare, dead easy to make and is a great dish to feed a posse.
This version uses chile anchos, canned tomatoes, garlic, onion and chicken stock. The filling is chicken, which I had leftover from a roast, but the dish could easily be turned into a vegetarian dish by using braised collard greens or Swiss chard sauteed with a bit of white onion and tossed with queso fresco.
In Oaxaca, sauce from leftover mole is a shoo-in for mole enchiladas, and if you have leftover roasted salsa verde or roja around, you can also use it for enchiladas – for enchiladas verdes or enchiladas rojas respectively.
The steps in making them are the same no matter what kind of salsa you use, so feel free to use this technique as a stepping stone.
My stepping stone here is from the book Mexican by Marilyn Tausend. I’ve tweaked it just a tad by foregoing the frying of the tortillas, preferring instead to heat them to make them pliable, then dipping in the chile sauce.
Enough talk. Let’s start cooking.
Ten beautiful chile anchos are stemmed and seeded, ripped into pieces and soaked in hot water for 15 to 20 minutes.
Once hydrated and softened, transfer the chiles to a blender jar along with 15 ounces of whole canned tomatoes, six cloves garlic, half a white onion, coarsely chopped, and a sprinkling of Mexican oregano. Blend until smooth.
Like other Mexican sauces and moles, this mixture needs to be fried and seasoned. Heat a deep saucepan with light olive oil, and pour in the sauce, stirring quickly. You may have to wipe down the walls, ceiling and yourself at this point! No matter.
Add four cups of chicken stock, bring to the boil and simmer until you have a velvety sauce. Season.
Preheat oven to 325 F. Add a layer of ancho-tomato sauce to a casserole dish. Make the enchiladas.
Heat the corn tortillas on a cast iron comal or pan until pliable. Dip the tortillas into the chile sauce and transfer to a plate. (Yes, it’s going to get messy. Get used to it).
Crumble the chicken along the side closest to you and roll up. Place seam side down into the casserole dish.
Repeat until the casserole is filled and firmly nestled together. Cover the dish with more chile sauce, place in the oven and heat through.
Serve, garnished with crema – creme fraiche if you parlez-vous francais – thinly sliced white onion and radishes.
If you really need cheese, knock yourself out. Damn good eating either way.
Makes about six cups of sauce, enough for days of enchiladas.
*Update: After feasting on enchiladas, I still had sauce left and added it to a batch of stewed black beans. Heaven!
oooooh i was just directed to a pumpkin enchilada recipe – but this may change my mind now
Right after I read your comment, I saw a recipe for pumpkin enchilada in Bon Appetit. It looks great. There are soo many kinds of squash available right now, it would seem a waste not to experiment.Pediatric ophthalmology is a fascinating field, but can be frustrating for many residents because children are hard to examine. Despite this challenge, pediatrics is rewarding and is one of my favorite sub-specialties.
The Pediatric Exam:
Examining kids is a difficult prospect, as children are moving targets and universally hate strangers messing with their eyes. You have limited time before your child further decompensates, so it’s important to hone in on any eye problems quickly.
Vision testing also depends upon the age of your patient. Young babies may only blink-to-light, but as the child gets older they start to track faces, and eventually identify pictures. It’s hard to measure quantitative vision in the young, so focus on asymmetry between the eyes. For example, cover each eye and watching how the child reacts and tracts. If a baby is fussier with a particular eye covered, then you may be covering his only good eye! Also, toddlers will cheat when covering the eyes, so watch them closely!
Refractive Error
Determining a child’s refractive error is even more challenging … how can you tell if a child is myopic or hyperopic when they can’t read the eye chart? Here’s how we do it:
Bruchner Test:
One quick method to estimate refractive error is by examining the red-reflex (the red-eye you get in photographs). Hold a direct scope from a distance and shine it so that the circle of light lights up both pupils at the same time.
Examine the red-reflex from each eye. Assuming that the child is looking right at you, the placement of the red-reflex gives some clues. Inferior crescents, such as in this drawing, indicate myopia (near-sightedness) while superior crescents indicate hyperopia.
Most children have some degree of hyperopia, as their eyes are small and still growing. This makes the Bruchner test more useful for picking up myopic (near-sighted) errors, but overall the test isn’t very accurate in undilated children as they have the ability to accommodate. Also, if the eyes are not well aligned, such as strabismus, the results are inaccurate.
Retinoscopy
Retinoscopy is a much more accurate way to check prescription, and is how we refract all pre-verbal children for glasses. By flashing a beam of light back-and-forth into the eye we can examine how the light bounces off the retina. By holding different power lenses in front of the eye we can figure out what power lens focuses the light properly and neutralizes the red-reflex. This is a difficult skill to learn, but surprisingly useful, even outside of the pediatric realm.
Amblyopia (a.k.a. “lazy eye”):
Amblyopia is decreased vision in an eye because of disuse of that eye during childhood development. The prevalence in the USA is 2-5%, the major risk factors being prematurity, developmental delay, and a family history.
The visual pathway is a plastic system that continues to develop during childhood until around 6-9 years of age. During this time, the wiring between the retina and visual cortex is still developing. Any visual problem during this critical period, such as a refractive error or strabismus (misaligned eyes) can mess up this developmental wiring, resulting in permanent visual loss that can’t be fixed by any corrective means when they are older.
Competitive Wiring!
If you don’t use an eye, the nerve fibers from that eye don’t develop … in fact, the eyes are in competition with each other. The afferent nerve connections of the strong eye become numerous while the weak (unused eye) nerves atrophy and decrease in number. In animal studies, occlusion of one eye leads to loss and atrophy of cells in the LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus) associated with that eye.
Fortunately, the situation can be reversed. Penalizing the strong eye, with the use of patches or eyedrops that blur vision, gives the weak eye a competitive advantage and time to re-grow its afferent nerve connections. This regrowth potential decreases with age, and once a child reaches 7-10, very little can be done to improve the amblyopic eye.
How to Detect:
As you can imagine, you want to pick up amblyopia at an early age. Unfortunately, it is exactly these younger children who’s vision is most difficult to check. Pediatricians always check vision as part of a well-baby exam, and schools perform vision screenings – but vision assessment in children is tricky, even for trained ophthalmologists. We get many false-positive “poor vision” referrals from these sources, but that’s ok, because early detection is important!
The word “lens” is named after the lentil plant (greek name Lens culinaris) whose 2 – 9 mm disk-shaped seeds bear a remarkable resemblance in size and shape to the human lens.
The lentil legume was one of the first agricultural crops and was grown over 8,000 years ago. Introduced in the U.S. during the early 1900’s, the “lentil bean” is grown in drier Washington, Idaho, and Western Canada and the seeds can be used in soups, stews, casseroles and salad dishes.
Strabismus:
Strabismus describes when the eyes are not aligned with each other, such as when an eye is turned in (cross-eyed or esotropic) or turned out (wall-eyed or exotropic). Here are some terms we use in ophthalmology to describe misalignments:
Esotropia (ET): The eyes are turned inwards (cross-eyed) all the time.
Exotropia (XT): The eyes are turned outwards (wall-eyed) all the time.
Eso/Exo-phoria: Phorias are eye deviations that are only present some of the time, usually under conditions of stress, illness, fatigue, or when binocular vision is interrupted.
Detecting Strabismus in babies
A quick way to check alignment inbabies is to shine a penlight into their eyes. You can determine alignment by looking at the corneal-pupil light reflex (the light reflection off the cornea) to make sure it is centered over the pupil of each eye. A large percentage of newborn infants will have some tropia at birth that goes away within a few months.
Don’t be fooled by pseudostrabismus – this is the illusion of crossed eyes caused by nasal epicanthal skin folds found in many Asian and young children. On casual inspection of these children, less white sclera is seen nasally and the child “looks cross-eyed.” However, closer inspection will reveal normal corneal light reflexes and no refixation on cover testing. Children outgrow these epicanthal folds as the bridge of the nose becomes more prominent.
With younger children who don’t track well, you can use the Hirschberg’s test – a quick method to estimate the amount of prism deviation in a misaligned eye. For every mm the corneal light reflex is off center, equals approximately 15 diopters of prism.
You can pick up phorias and tropias with the cross-cover test. Since the cross-cover test breaks binocular vision, the phoric eye will wander off axis when it has nothing to focus on. The amount of deviation can be quantified using prisms. This is a difficult technique to describe in words … basically you alternately cover the eyes with a paddle and hold up prisms until the deviation is neutralized. Detecting and measuring tropias and phorias is much more complicated then this, but I think this is enough for now!
Strabismus as a major cause of amblyopia
If a child has misaligned eyes, they can unconsciously suppress one of their eyes to avoid seeing double. However, this suppression leads to amblyopia and permanent visual loss. Adults don’t have this ability to suppress vision and if they develop strabismus (such as from a nerve palsy or trauma) they will permanently see double.
Treatment of Strabismus:
Before taking anyone to surgery, correct all the non-surgical causes of strabismus: check for refractive error and treat any amblyopia – many cases of strabismus will improve or resolve by just doing these things. Eye surgery consists of shortening or relaxing the extraocular muscles that attach to the globe to straighten the eye.
Strabismus Surgery
To correct simple esotropias (cross-eyed) or exotropias (wall-eyed) we can weaken or strengthen the horizontal rectus muscles. A recession-procedure involves disinserting the rectus muscle and reattaching the muscle to the globe in a more posterior position. This effectively weakens the action of this muscle and turns the eye accordingly.
The picture below demonstrates the basic strabismus surgical technique – after exposing the rectus muscle from the overlying conjunctiva and Tenon’s fascia, you imbricate the muscle with double-armed vicryl suture, disinsert the muscle from the eye, then reattach the muscle to the globe via scleral passes at a measured distance from the original insertion. A resection procedure strengthens the muscle – you disinsert the muscle, cut off a section, and then reattach the muscle to the original insertion site.
The dangerous step with this surgery is reattaching the muscle – as you don’t want your scleral pass to run too deep and pierce the eye! Strabismus surgery isn’t technically difficult to perform, compared to cataract surgery, but it does take experience and good pre-op measurements to titrate the amount of recession/resection needed.
The goal of strabismus surgery is correct alignment so that the eyes are properly aligned when looking straight ahead and when reading. No surgery can “fix” the underlying muscle problems, such that the child may not have perfect alignment in all gaze directions.
Shaken Baby Syndrome:
This is a depressing topic (I won’t be adding any funny cartoons to this section). This terrible condition is important to recognize as it is preventable.
New babies cry a lot – on average three hours a day, and often for no apparent reason. Some babies cry significantly more than this! Frustrated caregivers may pick up the child and shake it if suitably irate. This shaking can become a reinforcing response as the infant becomes somnolent afterwards and stops crying, exactly the response the caregiver was hoping for. Infants are predisposed to physical damage from shaking as they have big heads and weak neck muscles. As the head whiplashes back and forth, the acceleration and deceleration forces traumatize the brain in a big way. Biological fathers and boyfriends are the most common perpetrators of this behavior, but anyone can be the attacker – this phenomenon spares no ethnicity, religion, culture, or social class.
These children are typically 5 to 10 months of age and present with somnolence, seizures or coma. The classic triad of exam findings include:
- Intracranial hemorrhage: usually a subdural hemorrhage secondary to tearing of the small bridging veins between the dura mater and arachnoid.
- Brain swelling: from shearing forces, diffuse axonal damage, secondary edema, and infarction.
- Retinal hemorrhages: specific findings (see below).
The child can also have other physical findings such as bruising of the body trunk (where the shaker grips the child) and fractures of the skull, long bones, or ribs. Remember: be suspicious for abuse when you see many bone fractures at different stages of healing.
Retinal Findings:
An ophthalmologist needs to be called in for any case of potential shaken baby to evaluate the retina. These kids have specific retinal hemorrhages that aren’t really seen in any other condition:
1. Large retinal hemorrhages located in all quadrants of the eye, located in all layers of the retina (subretinal, intraretinal, and preretinal).
2. Retinoschisis cavities. A schisis is a split between layers of the retina, and is very suspicious for abuse in this age group.
It’s imperative to write a descriptive note in the chart (have the attending write this note for litigation reasons) and document any bleeding with fundus photography. You want to take these photos soon, as hemorrhages can resolve in only a few days!
What about other causes of retinal bleeding?
Studies have found that household injuries, such as a fall from caregiver’s arms or furniture doesn’t usually cause significant retinal hemorrhage. Birth trauma can cause mild retinal bleeding but this is usually limited and resolves in the first few months. CPR with chest compressions rarely causes significant hemorrhaging. The hemorrhages in SBS are impressive and similar retinal bleeding isn’t seen except with big trauma such as a high-speed car wreck or a multi-story fall.
Be sure to look for any coagulopathy with basic lab testing, including CBC, coags, platelet count and bleeding time.
Prognosis:
While a third of these babies have no long term sequela, the long-term prognosis is generally bad. Twenty percent of these abused children die outright and the remaining kids end up with life-changing developmental problems, mental retardation, blindness, paralysis, and behavioral changes.
The Leukocoric pupil:
Every newborn receives a baseline exam by their pediatrician, and part of this exam involves checking for a good red-reflex off the retina. Leukocoria describes a white-colored pupil. This finding should concern you and requires an ophthalmology consult as the causes may be serious. Potential causes of leukocoria that you should look for include:
1. Congenital Cataract
2. Retinoblastoma
3. ROP (retinopathy of prematurity)
There are many other causes for a white pupil, such as persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, but let’s focus on these three:
Congenital Cataract
A cataract in a newborn can occur by several mechanisms. They can be idiopathic, genetic, from metabolic disorders, child abuse trauma, or caused by one of the maternal TORCH infections during fetal development. Whatever the cause, it is important to remove these cataracts as soon as possible as they are amblyogenic and will lead to permanent vision loss from visual neglect. Replacing a lens is tricky, however, as babies are tiny, generate an impressive inflammatory response, and their “prescription” is still changing as the eye continues to grow. The cataract is removed as soon as possible, but often the lens implant can be placed at a later date – parents have to deal with aphakic contact lens or thick glasses in the meantime.
Retinoblastoma
Retinoblastoma is a tumor of the primitive retinal photoreceptors. The tumor grows on the retina and forms a white or cream-colored mass that can completely fill the eye, creating a white iris, and often a retinal detachment.
Retinoblastoma is the most common primary malignant ocular tumor in children. That being said, the cancer is still very rare, with only 250-500 new cases reported in the United States each year. You don’t want to miss this one, though, as failure to diagnose RB results in the death of a child.
These children are under 4 years of age, with the average age of diagnosis 18 months. There are different types of RB, and the tumor can arise from a random somatic mutation or develop along several germline inheritance patterns.
Treatment modalities are many, but decisive treatment often involves enucleation (removal) of the entire eye to avoid seeding tumor cells into the orbit. The tumor spreads by extension down the optic nerve toward the brain so it is important to get a good optic nerve section upon removal with careful microscopic evaluation for margin involvement. The overall survival rate in the US is very good, approaching 90%, but only if the tumor is recognized early.
Retinopathy of Prematurity
ROP is an important disease process that is commonly found in neonatal ICUs. Here’s how ROP works:
The retinal blood supply begins formation around week 16 of gestation, with retinal vessels springing forth from the optic disk and spreading outwards in an expanding fan toward the edges of the retina. By the 8th (36 weeks) month this vasculature has reached the nasal retinal-edge, and within a few more months the whole retinal blood supply has formed 360 degrees.
Everything sounds good, right? Well, problems can occur if a child is born premature. With premature eye metabolism, areas of peripheral retina that haven’t yet developed blood supply can become ischemic. Ischemic retina produces VEGF with resulting neovascularization. These neovascular vessels can bleed, create traction, and eventually retinal detachment. A leukocoric “white pupil” can result if the retinal detachment is big enough. The more premature a child is born, the more likely this unfortunate sequence of events is to occur. For this reason, children born under 32 weeks or less than 1,500 grams are screened to insure their retina is forming properly.
We treat these kids in a similar fashion as proliferative diabetic retinopathy in adults – PRP laser or cryotherapy is used to ablate the peripheral ischemic retina in an attempt to shut down excess VEGF production.
PIMP QUESTIONS
1. How is the Bruchner test performed? What will a near-sighted child look like with this exam?
The Bruchner test is a simple method to estimate the refractive error in a child. You look at a child through your direct ophthalmoscope from a distance. Light up the face such that both pupils are lit. Hyperopic children will have superior crescents in their red-reflex, while myopic (near-sighted) children will have inferior crescents.
2. How do you determine the refractive error (glasses prescription) in a pre-verbal child?
By streak-retinoscopy. This is where you flash a light beam across the retina and hold up different lenses in front of the eye until the red-reflex movement is neutralized. Correct for your working distance and you have your prescription.
3. What is amblyopia? What causes it?
Amblyopia is poor vision in an eye from disuse at an early age, usually secondary to strabismus or an unrecognized refractive error.
4. How do you treat amblyopia?
You treat by “penalizing” the good eye. Using a patch over the good eye forces the amblyopic eye to work. Also, you need to treat any underlying cause of the amblyopia such as anisometropia.
5. You suspect a baby of having strabismus, but because of the baby’s age you aren’t able to measure eye deviation with your prism set. How can you estimate the amount of eye deviation?
You can do this by measuring the corneal light reflex in relation to the underlying pupil (Hirschburg test). For every millimeter of light deviation, you have approximately 14 diopters of strabismic deviation.
6. What’s the difference between a tropia and a phoria? How can you differentiate this on exam?
This is exactly the kind of question you’ll get asked during a pediatric or neuro clinic. A tropia is a deviation that is there ALL the time. A phoria is intermittent, and tends to occur more with fatigue or when one eye is covered.
As for how to pick these up: it’s hard to describe, so you should have one of the residents demonstrate how these are done:
Tropias: cover-uncover test
Phorias: cross-cover test
7. The actress Lucy Liu (from Charlie’s Angels) brings in her new baby. The Asian American actress is concerned because Drew Barrymore said her baby’s eyes look “crooked.” Casual inspection shows a healthy 12-month old baby who appears mildly esotrophic (cross-eyed). How would you measure ocular alignment in this child.
You can check the corneal light reflex with a penlight.
8. The corneal light reflex appears to be correctly centered (normal Hirschburg), yet the child still looks esotrophic. In fact, the child looks a lot like her attractive Asian mother. What’s going on?
This sounds like pseudostrabismus from epicanthal folds. The nasal skin creates the illusion of crossed-eyes as less white sclera can be seen nasally. As babies get older, the nasal bridge becomes prominent and this appearance usually goes away.
9. What systemic and eye findings will you see with shaken baby syndrome?
In the eye, you will see retinal hemorrhages at “all levels of the retinal in all four quadrants of the eye.” Schisis cavities (large splits within retina layers) are relatively specific. Other system findings include intracranial hemorrhage, brain edema, and skull-rib-long bone fractures. On exam you might also find bruising on the body trunk and under the armpits. Supposedly, these kids can have a torn frenulum (the piece of tissue under the upper lip that connects the lip to the gumline), but I’ve never seen this myself.
10. Parents say that a child fell from her crib and hit the floor. Do you think this would cause a fracture and the retinal findings of shaken baby?
Kids are relatively bouncy, but this story COULD account for the skull fracture. However, it takes a LOT of traumatic force to create large retinal hemorrhages — this story sounds a little fishy. An experienced pediatrician and ophthalmologists needs to examine this child.
11. Name three causes for a leukocoric pupil.
Cataract, retinoblastoma, and retinopathy of prematurity.
12. List risk factors for developing retinopathy or prematurity.
Gestational age less than 32weeks, birth weight under 1,500 grams, and systemic hypoxia.
13. How soon should a congenital (found at birth) cataract be removed?
Soon, in order to avoid amblyopia. Some recommend removing these early cataracts in the first two months.
My Neices baby at 2 months of age has been diagnosed with opthalmic folds. The babies eyes both constantly twitch or move from side to side.
He does have sight but can you please eplain to me. He has been referred to a laser specialist in Sydney, Australia.
Editors Notes: Hard to say, as I’ve never heard the term “ophthalmic folds” … a couple of possibilities. One is that he has retinal folds, possibly from retinopathy of prematurity, thus prompting the referral to a laser (retina) specialist. The roving eye movements sound like either a congenital or sensory nystagmus. Be sure to followup with the doctor in a timely manor and make sure they explain to you exactly what’s going on. Sometimes it helps to have your doctor write the diagnosis down on a piece of paper so you can research it.

you are a very talented ophthalmologist
My Daughter is 9 years old and her eyes deviate equally to the sides gradually and stay deviated when she is watching the television. Her vision is otherwise good and no deviation of the eyes and neck when in the class room or when doing other activities. Upon questioning she says that she cannot see properly the image on the television when she looks straight and she has to deviate her eyes and eventually the neck. We have seen a pediatric ophthalmologist regarding this at the age of 9 years and upon his exam he says that it is torticollis.
He wants to do another exam after the dilatation in 6 months.
Do we call this esophoria or is there another term for this.My concern is that is it going to cause amblyopia/ vision problems in the future.
Thanks,
Chandra
hello, my daughter who just turned 4 has a hemorage in the right eye that rebleed yesterday as of right now shes on 3 different drops is there anything else i can do. and is treatment differ from a child to an adult. thanks very concered tammy
My four year old child turns her head to the left and looks from the exteme corner of her her eyes when looking at distance especially when watching television. One doc said it was fourth nerve palsy but three others disagree. She sometimes complains of a black spot in the middle of the television that goes away when she turns her head. If it’s not fourth nerve palsy, what could be the problem?
Hi,
Correct spelling is Bruckner reflex. Great site. Can i recommned it to my med students?
hi, my baby just turned 6 months..
and i don’t know if her eyes are crossed or it’s just because she’s still a baby… she is half western half asian baby.. could it be because her eyes looks like asian? i hope to hear some answers… thanks.
Hi, correct spelling in pimp questions 5 and 8 is “Hirschberg test”.
Thanks
I live on prince Edward Island canada where can we find a

thanks for you time
my son was born at 24 weeks gestation. because of his prematurity his lungs were very underveloped and required him to be on high levels of oxygen which caused his retinopathy. he wears very thick lensed and I would like to know if it is possible for him to have surgery when he is older to restore some of his vision?
Hi, My son who is now 5 was born at 23 weeks gestation. He developed ROP, had the corrective laser eye surgery and has been seeing an opthamologist ever since. He is very short sighted in his right eye which is also “lazy” or turning in. As such we are having to put dilating eyedrops in his left eye to encourage him to use his right eye. Anyhow I took a photo of him today and noticed that in the photo his dilated pupil had a yellowy-red crescent shape in the photo. I have heard and read about people detecting eye cancers in kids eyes after using flash photography and am now worried that that may be what I am seeing in this photo. Please contact me with your opinion on this as we don’t have another eye appointment for three months and I know a quick diagnoses can be important if it is cancer. I can send you the photo to look at. Thanks you.
thanks sir, ur lectures and videos was so great,easily presented,
in video of this chapter, u wrote abt risk factor for ROP > babies less than 1500 kilograms(kg).
but ur pdf text if correct
thanks 🙂
my 2 years10 months daughter is suffering from mild squint. our docter suggest us a spects and said that her both eye sight no is spherical +1.75 and told us that every child have low eye sight. Is every child have low eyesight and mild squint will be recover by own or when child become older then the quint recovered by own. please tell me the treatment. and why squint happend to our child
my son aged 4has started to twitch( raise forehead and eyebrows) when watching tv and when i’m reading stories to him, any ideas what this might be?
my son aged 4 has started to twitch repeatedly when watching tv and when i read to him, any idea what this might be?thanks
My 18 month old son started about a month ago when he is playing will stop what he is doing and his eye will go up and to the left and he will blink a lot, when he stops blinking his eyes will stay there for a little bit, then he will stop and go back to playing, any idea what this is? He don’t do it everyday, and when he does it he acts like he didn’t even do anything. Thanks.
Hi, My 3 month old seems fine but when i cover her right eye she freaks out but is okay when i couver her left eye. she follers things like my finger on ther right side but does not do the same with her left eye. she doesnt evemn turn her head when we talk to her from the left side. Her left eye may also look a tad smaller and when she was about a month old she had a blocked tear duct. What could be wrong o is something wrong please help
My son aged 4years have diagonosed for patch one eye.And +5D spy. Glass to wear what is the cause of poor vision and is there any chance to improve vision.
HOLA MI HIJA TIENE UN MES DE VIDA Y TIENE UNA DESVIACION DEL OJO IZQUIERDO. ES PERMANENTE SU DESVIO. ME GUSTARIA SABER QUE TRATAMIENTO TENGO QUE REALIZARLE, Y PORQUE ES SU DESVIO MUCHAS GRACIAS ESPERO UNA RESPUESTA. YA QUE ES MUY IMPORTANTE LA VISTA DE MI HIJA.

Thanks a bunch for sharing this with all people you actually understand what you are speaking about! Bookmarked. Kindly additionally discuss with my web site =). We will have a link trade arrangement between us
Hi. My dd is now 2 and was a 28 weeker. She has a weak eye which is not responding to patching. She manages well with patch on, but in the dark with patch, struggles. At recent review retinal folds or crease was mentioned and further investigation under sedation is requested. If it is a fold or crease, can her vision in this eye be improved? She has a small white patch in her pupil of her weak eye. To make matters worse, she also was born with congenital toxoplasmosis and has chlororetinal scars, but not in her field of vision. These exist in both eyes. She has no developmental delay and does not appear to be limited by vision problems, but accept she is not at reading age as yet etc. any advice please? Thanks
Aly,
Your questions are pretty specific and need to be answered by a pediatric or retina ophthalmologist. At the very least, it sounds like an exam under anesthesia is required. As far as prognosis … I have no idea.
my friend is belong to an indian and she is settled in UK her baby was born with lack of eye reflex.Is it normal for asian babies?……
My daughter is 7.5 weeks old. I had noticed a slight drift in her eyes a couple weeks ago, then during early morning feedings I saw one eye or the other drift quite a bit outward. Now that she has become more visually aware, I have noticed over this weekend that this is happening more frequently, for longer duration. There are times when she will seem to focus just fine, and she also follows with her eyes, objects and faces (parents and siblings!) The outward drift is intermittent. So far. I will take her to her doctor tomorrow, but I wonder if he will see what we see. Is it TOO early to detect a problem? Is it too early to treat? How can I make sure she gets treatment if it is needed?
Hi, my 11 year old.
Hi, my 11 month.
My grandsons eyes are constantly moving in quick jerky back and forthmovements. They are telling us to wait till feb apt. There is no way he can possiblyfocus like this. They say his optic nerve is weak.what does this mean? And will he be able to see?
Thanks for some needed answers
vickie
Vickie:
1. Make sure your grandson sees a “pediatric ophthalmologist”
2. Ask the pediatric ophthalmologist if the child needs an MRI to rule out optic nerve tumor
Beyond this, I don’t have any answers for you. Pediatric nystagmus management is out of my practice area.
When my baby turned 6 mo her pediatrician asked me if i took pics of her with flas on because when she examin her noticed some ‘condition’ on her right eye, i told her i dont use flash on her and asked if she was ok, she said it was a ‘rare’ condition but should be fine. My baby is one yrl old now and i notice she shows white pupil and not red on a fee pics i have used flash. Im not sure if its the angle or if i should take care for a checkup i Dont have a su gle photo with red eyes.
Diana, you need to take your child to an actual eye doctor for a dilated eye exam. There is no way to diagnose this problem online.
I’m 29, and I was born with a congenital cataract to my right eye. I had a keratophakia when I was about 1 year old. During my early childhood my mom would attempt to do the patch as was ordered by the doctor. Unfortunately I now have very very poor vision with amblyopia mostly with far sight, and cross eye at very near sight. My right eye provided me with great peripheral view at least. Since the age of 10, my ophthalmologist has diagnosed glaucoma, or not sure if the corneal transplant is having an effect on the pressure reading. Just yesterday my pressure was 32, that’s without me taking my eye drops for quite some time. Just wondering what your thoughts/insights may be on the pressure reading validity post a keratophakia at the age of 1. My opthamologist isn’t sure. This has been a life long challenge, that I continue to struggle with. Thanks in advance for your time.

Aberdeen midfielder Isaac Osbourne faces at least six weeks on the sidelines with his second hamstring tear of the season.
The 26-year-old suffered the injury during the Dons' 1-0 victory at Dundee on Friday.
The former Coventry player returned in January following a near two-month lay-off with a similar problem.
Manager Craig Brown said: "To lose Isaac again to another injury is a huge disappointment for the squad."
Talking to the club website, Brown added: "Having just returned to the team in recent weeks, he had made a positive impact on our performances and he will be sadly missed.
"Isaac is a consummate professional and he will work extremely hard to ensure his rehabilitation from this injury is swift."A healthy start to the new year

They can be restored to QSYS or to any user library. Viewing them, however, may be tricky if they’re not restored to QSYS. The DSPLOG command isn’t going to know anything about them unless they’re in QSYS.
As for QAUDJRN, it’s almost certain that you don’t want to restore the <i>journal.</i> Most likely you actually want to restore a particular range of <i>journal receivers</i>. These can be restored to any library, but it’s also best to restore them to the library you normally create them in. In order to access them, use the DSPJRN RCVRNG() parameter to list explicitly the first and last receiver that you will be searching.
You should restore receivers so that there are no gaps between the first receiver you list and the last one you list. You can have gaps between different groups that you restore and between any group that you restore and receivers that are live in the current receiver chain. You just don’t want to mess with trying to search across a group that has a receiver missing in the middle of your range.

Some Cute Hacks
Small scrolling region
If you want to play around with graphics, it is nice to make the text scroller smaller so it doesn't get in the way of the graphics.
ok screen-ih iselect ok 5 to #lines ok screen-height char-height 5 * - to window-top ok iunselect
That makes the scroller 5 lines high and moves it to the bottom of the screen.
You could put that in a file on a USB key to run it automatically - /boot/olpc.fth .
The shortest way to say it would be:
ok screen-ih iselect 5 to #lines 316 to window-top iunselect
316 is the hex number that results from the computation "screen-height char-height 5 * -". Obviously it is dependent on specifics of the OLPC machine and the number of lines in the scroller, but you get the idea.

Although several studies have shown that US physicians make greater use of medical technologiesthan UK physicians, no study has examined variation in specialty referral rates, the step before specialised procedures. We compared rates of referral to specialists in the United Kingdom and the United States. To hold the effects of gatekeeping systems constant, we studied US managed care settings that used a structured referral process similar to that in the United Kingdom.
Participants, methods, and results
We included non-pregnant patients aged 0 to 64 years, with at least six months of enrolment on a health plan or general practice registration and at least one consultation with their primary care physician during 1996 (US) or 1997 (UK). The US sample comprised 384 693 patients from five health maintenance organisations. All US patients had been assigned physician gatekeepers, who authorised specialty referrals. We used the general practice research database for the UK sample (n=757,680).1
We measured referral rates as the annual percentage of patients with a new referral to a specialist physician. In the United Kingdom, general practitioners recorded whether each visit led to a referral. In the United States, patients with at least one visit to a specialist were considered to have had a specialty referral. To limit misclassification of follow up visits to a specialist asnew referrals we did not count visits during 1996 (the study period) if the patient had also had a visit to the same type of specialist in 1995.
We used the Johns Hopkins adjusted clinical group system2to develop a “treated morbidity index.” Patients in the same clinical group have a similar need for healthcare resources. For each adjusted clinical group category, we determined a referral rate for the largest US health maintenance organisation and then divided by the overall average referralrate for the plan to yield an index score. Higher scores indicate sicker patients, greater morbidity burden, and greater need for referral.
Across the five US health plans, 30.0% to 36.8% of patients per year were referred compared with 13.9% per year for the UK patients. The figure shows that the US health plans clustered closely around the same trend line and that US patients were referred more commonly than UK patients, regardless of the morbidity burden.
Referral rate as a function of morbidity burden of patients. A treated morbidity index score was assigned to patients according to their adjusted clinical group category (groups are based on information on diagnosis, age, and sex). Higher scores indicate greater morbidity burden and greaterneed for specialty referrals
Comment
Among patients who visit their primary care physician, about one in three patients in the United States are referred to a specialist annually compared with one in seven in the United Kingdom. Our data do not provide information on whether the US rates are too high or the UK rates are too low. Nevertheless, the twofold difference in referral rates held true for the healthiest as well as the sickest patients.
The low availability of specialists, and resultant long waiting lists, in the United Kingdom isan important explanation for these differences. The supply of specialists in the United States exceeds that in the United Kingdom by twofold.3 Just 1% of US patients wait four months or longer for elective surgery compared with 33% of UK patients.4 General practitioners believe that waits for appointments with specialists threaten their capacity to deliver high quality care.5 Absence of waits is likely to have lowered the US physicians' referral thresholds.
Other possible explanations include a less intensive practice style among UK physicians, the common practice of self referral among US patients (even those in health maintenance organisations), and a broader scope of practice among UK physicians. Given the low rates of referral in the United Kingdom relative to the United States, it seems unlikely that referral guidelines, which have been proposed as a method to reduce pressure on UK outpatient services, will dramatically enhance specialty capacity by decreasing demand.

The Mavericks have three 7-footers on their team and another player who is a solid 6-11.
And they are going to be the small team on the court tonight against the Lakers at Staples Center.
The Lakers almost always have the size advantage against anybody, thanks to Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum, both of whom are at least 7-feet and in Bynum’s case, probably bigger.
But it’s not the biggest of the Lakers that give them the decided advantage in the physicality department.
Their guards, along with small forward Ron Artest, are more physical than just about anybody else’s smaller players.
Basically, the Lakers are bigger and stronger at every position than the Mavericks are, with the possible exception of point guard. But in that case, Jason Kidd doesn’t guard Derek Fisher. He’s usually matched up against Ron Artest.
“You look at Kobe (Bryant) and Artest, big guys, athletic and they know how to play,” Kidd said. “They’re a big, long team, so we’re going to have our hands full.”
In the interior, it’s even worse. While everybody equates the Lakers with Kobe, he’s not the thing that makes them unique.
“Playing against their big guys is a tough challenge,” said Brendan Haywood, who had a solid night Wednesday against the Clippers. “They have two of the best in the league in Gasol and Bynum. And (Lamar) Odom, the way he’s played this year, has been phenomenal. They have one of the most talented front lines in the league. We have to try to rebound with them and be physical with them and hopefully give our team the edge inside instead of letting them have it.”
It’s the only way the Mavericks can hope to send any kind of message tonight in the final regular-season meeting against the Lakers.
“(The Lakers) are a different kind of challenge,” said Rick Carlisle. “They’re a very difficult physical matchup for every team that plays them. Our job is to make it be our kind of game. That’s never easy to do, but it starts with efficiency with the ball. And we have to play hard and smart.”

About this Costume
- Construction Details:
- It was fairly easy to make and not very time consuming. I had to be a bit creative when making the top half of the dress since I would be 5 months pregnant when wearing it. I filled out most of it, but still have an extra inch waist wise, so it wasn't as fitted as I wanted it to be. This was also my first time making a petticoat out of crinoline and I'm super happy with how it turned out. I was worried it wouldn't poof up the dress enough, but it did plenty!
- Personal Thoughts:
- Excuse my derpy face in the only pic I have of it currently. I was very tired and hungry when it was taken.

mailto:trhazen@hotmail.comBERLIN — Beiersdorf AG has raised its sales targets again, saying it anticipates full-year growth of “well over” 4 percent for 2012.
In a short statement released by the Hamburg-based consumer goods and adhesives maker on Tuesday, its chief executive officer Stefan F. Heidenreich said, “We are satisfied with the way our fiscal year has gone so far.”
In early November, Beiersdorf, which manufactures brands such as Nivea, Eucerin, La Prairie and Tesa, raised its 2012 projections to 3 percent to 4 percent growth. The new guidance applies to both total group and consumer division sales, the company said.HE is surely Scotland’s most famous sheep, and what a yarn he has to tell the rest of the flock.
One minute skipping happily around his home in Lanarkshire, the next hurtling, ears pinned back, hanging on for dear life at 60mph on the front of a Renault Clio.
And fresh from starring on the front of the Evening News, Larry returned a celebrity to Calla Farm for a reunion with his mother and twin sister which no-one can quite believe.
How he survived the traumatic 40-minute, 25-mile journey remains a mystery but, for now, he seems to be recovering well and lapping up the attention. Indeed, he is now gamboling – albeit with a pronounced limp – as if nothing had happened.
Owner David Bailie said: “You just wouldn’t think it possible he could survive. There’s no doubt he’s the most adventurous lamb I’ve ever had.”
The mischievous four-week-old Cheviot hit the headlines after being hit by the car near his home on Friday and carried all the way along the A70 and A71. Larry’s journey from hell ended when the motorist arrived at Edinburgh Airport and was informed there was a seemingly startled sheep attached to her car.
Larry’s return journey was distinctly more sedate, as he was transported like ovine royalty, safely tucked up in the back of a Scottish SPCA van complete with travelling blanket.
Mr Bailie, who has more than 1000 ewes and around 1400 lambs, had no idea Larry was even missing until Scottish SPCA officers contacted him.
“He must have escaped on to the road on Friday night without me realising. It’s quite unbelievable,” he said.
Other than his broken back leg, Larry is seemingly unharmed, despite police having to free him from the grille of the Clio.
And he can look forward to a happy future at the Carnwath farm – providing he learns some road safety, of course – as he is set to used for breeding.
Mr Bailie said: “He’s back in the field with his mother and twin who seem pleased to have him back. The vets did a great job of getting him back on his feet.
“He seems to be doing well and happy to be home.”Worth a shot I guess?

P-Noy called a "bully" for lambasting Supreme Court
ABS-CBNNews.com and Inquirer.net report that President Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III is being hit by critics for lambasting the Supreme Court (SC) in two separate instances.
ABS-CBNNews.com and Inquirer.net report that President Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III is being hit by critics for lambasting the Supreme Court (SC) in two separate instances.
Inquirer.net pointed out: "On Thursday, December 1, Aquino gave Chief Justice Renato Corona a dressing down at the 30th anniversary celebration of the Makati Business Club." The report futher revealed, "As Corona sat in stony silence, Aquino did not mince words when he spoke about several instances when the court stopped him from going after [former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]."
Meanwhile, ABS-CBNNews.com discussed how the president had brought up his gripes against the SC in the 1st National Criminal Justice Summit held at the Manila Hotel on Monday, December 5.
The ABS-CBNNews.com report cited Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) chairman Dante Jimenez, who said, "This is disgusting. P-Noy should apologize to the people for his ill-mannered unpresidential behavior. Mr. President, you seem to have gone overboard. Bastosan na ba ito? It’s indeed disturbing." He added, "It is sending the wrong message that is all right to defy the courts of law. And why not? Binabastos nga mismo ito ng Presidente! Is this the kind of message the President wants to project? Then, let’s disregard the courts, go out into the streets and kill each other. P-Noy must show a good example as leader of a democratic country."
ABS-CBNNews.com also quoted Zambales Rep. Mitos Magsaysay, who said, "He should be more mature and be more diplomatic. Being President does not give him to belittle anyone because it so happened that court decisions did not go in his favor. It’s time we put civility and order in this country. We should ensure that the Constitution prevails, even if others are trying to destroy it." According to the report, Magsaysay thought Aquino clearly "bullied the SC and singled out Corona."
Both Jimenez and Magsaysay "praised Corona for not engaging in a word war against the president." Jimenez even made himself an example, claiming that he "gave due respect to the Supreme Court despite being penalized for insulting the Court’s decision on the Vizconde massacre case."

Back to Fall TV: Kids
Baylie & Rylie Cregut, 'Raising Hope'
Fox
As the title implies, this show centers around the Chance family's misadventures in their attempts to raise baby Hope. Talk about job security for the twins that play her! We haven't seen child actors this expressive since the Olsens charmed on 'Full House,' so if you think Hope is the reason we tune in each week, well ... you got it dude.
'Raising Hope' Season 2 premieres Tues., Sept. 20,What rather surprised me, and perhaps shouldn't have, is that the arrest wasn't back-channeled as most are, handled quietly between the State Department and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After all, the FBI has made several low-key arrests that you wouldn't know about if you weren't looking for them--there was no public hoopla. But the Russians really went there. I mean, they didn't just arrest the guy, they splattered the officer's photos through the press along with pictures of a table full of spy gadgets, money, and disguises.
Ugh.
My heart sank when I saw it. A pretty big blow, one of which the CIA will deny deny deny. That's what they're supposed to do. U.S. intelligence does not operate in Moscow...and Russians intelligence doesn't operate in the United States. And if you believe that I have a used spaceship from the Planet Moron for sale in my backyard.
In my estimation, there are two reasons for the humiliating public demonstration--either this spells a shift in the mostly settled relationship the U.S. has shared with Moscow over the past few years and they want to let us know under no uncertain terms that we are not friends and never will be. OR--this is a right cross in response to the uppercut we served to them in 2010 when the FBI exposed the illegals network in an operation that received A LOT of press. I mean a lot. Hell, the FX network even created a show, The Americans, that I'm certain was at least inspired by the those arrests.
Either way, American intelligence doesn't usually take this kind of thing on the chin or turn the other cheek. No, we tend to get our "cowboy" on and come firing back, all barrels blazing. I'd be very surprised if we don't see a body blow delivered hard and fast to the gut of the Russian Embassy in Washington or one of the other U.S. residencies in San Francisco or New York. However long it takes, I don't think we've seen the last of the tit-for-tat machinations.
I've said it before and I'll say it again, this spooky game of espionage between Russian and U.S. intelligence will endure for years to come. That's why I love writing this new series! In my fictional world you'll get to read about a lot of stuff that you thought you'd only read in papers...and some stuff you'll never read about unless you read my series. :)

Abstract
To envision the field of journalism as having, or lacking, its own theoretical status, somewhat dependent on conceptual and theoretical paradigms borrowed from the human and social sciences has become an important issue in academic discussions of journalism in Brazil. Tentative demarcations of an autonomous scientific field of research for journalism seem to ignore the ongoing epistemological debate of the bigger field in which journalism is inserted, that of Communication. This article aims at analysing different concepts of field used in this debate criticizing (a) the indiscriminate use of terms such as scientific field, academic field, professional and epistemological fields and (b) the equivocal effort to to reduce the object of study of the Journalism to practices of profession or in promoting fragmentation of its object.

The 34-year-old actress - who raises six children with partner Brad Pitt - has tried everything to persuade three-year-old Shiloh to wear other clothes, but she refuses to don anything that hasn't belonged toMaddox, seven.
At the moment, the toddler can regularly be seen sporting a pair of Maddox's old soccer boots.
She loves the shoes so much she even wears them to her ballet and tap dancing lessons.
A source told the National Enquirer magazine: "Shiloh always wants to wear those shoes. She cries when Angelina tries to put anything else on her."
It is not the first time Shiloh has fallen in love with an item of clothing.
Last year, she wanted to wear a ballet tutu at all times, and was seen in it "for months".
Shiloh's love of clothes doesn't seem to be inherited from her mother.
Angelina recently revealed she doesn't spend much time thinking about what she will wear to red carpet events, and is more interested in whether a dress is comfortable than the impact it will have.Hi there, Thank you for actually taking the time to read this and even better if you help. I have a gaming/blog channel. I have around 109 subscribers. I am trying to stay as natural as possible as money is not the top priority for me. Although making in the future may be. I hVe bought views and a few subs before but nothing really happened. Question time. 1. All this talk of keywords, can someone else this? Are they the same as tags and is there a trick to doing it? 2. Best ways or growing and being noticed? I do social network and whatnot and have gotten a bit of traffic via that but anything I am missing? 3. Is there anything I can do (back stage wise) that isn't on screen to boost myself a little more without look suspicious? I cant think of anymore questions but if you are still reading and have anything else you can tell me I'd greatly appreciate it. Really thank you guys!I finally got to eat at the Cove Bar in Paradise Cove! It was both mine and Mark’s first time, and it was perfect. Because the hosts heard me excitedly talking about what I wanted to eat and try, they seated us on the balcony in plain view of the water where World of Color happens.
We learned that if you are seated at the right time (right before Cove Bar closes), you can stay in your seats for front row viewing of World of Color — and we did just that.
What did we eat and drink?
As per usual, Mark and I shared drinks and food. It was soooooooo good.
CB Lobster Nachos — These nachos are perfect for savory-lovers. The menu describes it as: Tender Lobster Pieces atop fresh House-made Tortilla Chips with Black Beans, Pico de Gallo, Chipotle Crema, and our Signature Aged Cheddar and Oaxaca Cheese Sauce. However, I describe it as heaven in your belly. (lol)
Fajita Quesadilla Rolls — Grilled Flour Tortilla rolled with Chicken, Onions, Peppers, and Jack and Cheddar Cheese with Guajillo Sauce, Chipotle Crema, and Avocado Relish. Mmmmm… It’s so good just thinking about it. This was Mark’s favorite. Our server told us that the fajita quesadilla rolls are underrated, so we tried it. We’re so glad we ordered it because it was to die for.
DeLoach Pinot Noir, California — I’ve been into red wines lately, so I tried this pinot noir and it was good. I was surprised by how much they gave me in a glass.
Coney Island Brewing Company Hard Root Beer, Brooklyn, New York — Mark got this drink and said he liked it. I tried it and I’ll definitely be getting it next time.
I will be back Cove Bar! You did not disappoint.
Let me know if you get to try any of the things above,

Organic
Santa Julia Organica is one of the brands produced by Familia Zuccardi, a family-owned vineyard and winery in Mendoza, Argentina. The winery was founded in 1963 by Alberto V. Zuccardi, and is now run by his son, José Alberto Zuccardi.
The Organica range represents excellent value for money. The wines are remarkably pure with lovely fruit and fine acidity.
The Malbec is rich yet fruity with a nose of sweet violets as well as ripe fruits such as figs and raisins. Also notes of tobacco, vanilla and chocolate. The palate is relatively fruity, but not jammy, and not a fruit bomb either. It’s mostly cherry and blackberry on the palate, with a hint of cocoa.

I usually offer this fact hesitantly, almost embarrassed. It conjures visions of Miss America, of bimbos and swimsuit competitions, but it wasn’t like that.
I see my mother standing on my grandparents’ front steps when I imagine her during this era. She’s on her way to a parade, purple gown ruffled by a slight breeze, brown and orange and yellow leaves floating across the lawn. She holds her shoulder-length blond hair away from her face with white-gloved fingers, loose strands escaping from beneath her crown, Miss Blair sash slipping over her shoulder. Her skin is smooth, her smile perfect.
I may have seen this moment archived in one of my grandmother’s disorganized photo albums, wedged between snapshots of my uncle hiding from the camera and my aunt delivering her commencement speech, but I don’t know for certain. Those albums are almost as inaccessible as my mother. They hide in my grandmother’s chilly front hall, in a trunk that lies beneath rain scarves and heavy jackets. The albums are buried beneath the weight of afghans and bedspreads and old winter coats that smell of wool and dank air trapped for years. Anyone searching the trunk has to kneel next to the front door in the dark, blocking entry, ready for her knees to bruise should the door swing open.
Inside Blair, Wisconsin’s one-room library, I perused bound volumes of The Blair Press. I was struck by the front page headlines: middle school students competed in the state quiz bowl tournament, the Lutheran churches hosted a lutefisk supper, the Sons of Norway held a picnic in the park. It was amazing how many girls wore crowns and evening gowns on the front page, too. On June 6th, the Taylor Days royalty was announced; July 25th showcased the Trempealeau County Fair Princess; September 5th offered biographies of the Miss Blair contenders; September 19th featured the Cheese Queen and her attendants, draped in sashes, wearing crowns, holding flowers.
My mother smiled from a yellowed, thirty-year-old edition of her hometown’s newspaper, the caption offering her name in small print as though there were people in Blair who wouldn’t recognize Susan Thorpe. She beamed as 1969’s queen crowned her Miss Blair 1970. Her smile was wide, revealing the slight gap between her front teeth, and her eyes shone. I can’t remember ever seeing this expression on her face.
My mother is proud to have been the first Miss Blair. She reminds my sister and me of this fact every year when we travel across the state to our parents’ tiny hometown for the Cheese Festival—a celebration featuring a parade, a carnival, a tractor pull, and numerous contests and events.
A commemorative plaque hangs above a drinking fountain in the community center, a monument to the Cheese Queens. My mother’s maiden name is listed under 1970, gold capital letters on a shiny black background. For years I attended birthday parties, anniversary celebrations, and family reunions at the community center, playing cards, making awkward conversation with distant relatives, eating ham sandwiches and drinking watery pink lemonade beneath the inscription.
My mother noticed it every time she was in the building, I’m sure, and might have admired the plaque in secret. I was probably sixteen before I discovered it, dark wood blending into a dark paneled wall, hanging above my bent head as I sipped from the fountain or filled Styrofoam cups with cool water.
Blair’s little girls aspire to be Cheese Queens early on. The Cheese Festival’s Kiddie Parade, a small Saturday morning event limited to entrants ages twelve and under, often features girls who walk through the streets wearing plastic crowns, paper “Miss Blair” sashes over their shoulders.
Not me. In 1988, at age seven, I wore the real thing. My mother’s rhinestone crown was too big and slipped on my head, periodically tangling itself in the blonde hair that fell half way down my back, freed from its usual, stifling braid. My mother safety-pinned her yellowing satin sash to my dress to keep it from sliding.
1988 marked the Cheese Festival’s Golden Anniversary. My father commemorated the event with a Kiddie Parade float so elaborate it won a blue ribbon and a spot in the Sunday afternoon Cheese Festival parade, the same parade in which Miss Blair’s float appeared. He decorated a trailer with crepe paper streamers and painted a lawn chair to resemble a throne. The throne sat next to an enormous cardboard birthday cake topped by a plastic Christmas candle; my father painted over the “Noel” to mask its identity as a lawn ornament. He also built an old-fashioned camera and tripod from scraps of wood. Ingrid, my five-year-old sister (dressed as Mr. Dismoor, a Blair local who owned a photography studio at the time of the first festival), stood behind this camera to photograph me, Miss Blair.
I was ecstatic to emulate my mother that day, to sit in the glorified lawn chair waving to an entire town as she had done eighteen years earlier. I waved to my grandparents, my godparents, my aunt. My mother. I wanted to be just like her as I channeled her Cheese Queen spirit, just like my imagined version of the way she used to be.
My parents’ former selves were mythological to me, larger-than-life characters who were young and beautiful, divorced from the mundane parents I knew, the tired parents who bought my school clothes and made me eat my vegetables and decided my bed time. I sculpted my image of their former selves from the stories they told, filling in details to create glamorous people who somehow became an earth science teacher and a housewife.
I pictured my father at the center of his stories about driving alone from Wisconsin to New Orleans in a day, attending a Christmas ball at a rich man’s mansion, running from a trailer park to escape a tornado. He was brazen and courageous, unintimidated. Of course he’d be married to a Cheese Queen, the crème-de-la-crème of his hometown’s beauties. This glorified father was exaggerated, but based on real events and real personality traits, like a made-for-TV movie.
My mythological mother had a much hazier basis in fact, because my real mother didn’t tell many stories. I knew only that she was a bank teller before I was born, that she left college after a semester because she was homesick, and that she had been the Cheese Queen. In life she was timid and quiet, which was fine for my mother but not fine for my imagined version of the person she was in another era, so I unconsciously erased those characteristics. I didn’t envision scenarios for her to move through, but I created a personality. She smiled a lot. Her hair was always perfect. She was nice to everyone, and articulate. Popular.
It was my creation that I wanted to imitate as I rode in the parade, not my actual mother. I didn’t realize I inhabited myth as I sat on the disguised lawn chair, the Cheese Queen’s heavy crown slipping through my silky hair.
Blair’s elementary school sponsors a float decorating contest every Cheese Fest. Students transform shoe boxes into their favorite parade floats. Most of the girls create the Miss Blair float in miniature and adorn their shoeboxes with glitter, streamers, and Barbie dolls wearing glamorous pink chiffon. Blair’s little girls are indoctrinated early, and I would have been, too, if I’d grown up there.
They don’t realize that, in all likelihood, they’ll never ride the pristine Miss Blair float, trimmed with blue garland and crisp, silver sparkles. Most of them will not sit on Miss Blair’s throne, vases of fresh flowers at their feet, looking beautiful in front of a glimmering wire gazebo reminiscent of the local park’s most prominent landmark.
The losing candidates follow Miss Blair on what my once-geeky aunt (short brown hair, thick glasses, honor roll) dubbed “the reject float” after having the opportunity to ride it—twice. The reject float is just an unadorned convertible or, if there are a lot of rejects, a pickup truck borrowed from Ladsten’s Chevrolet. This “float” is labeled with a hand-written sign that says “Miss Blair Competitors.” The rejects do not use the crisp and exaggerated “elbow, elbow, wrist, wrist” wave reserved for Miss Blair. Instead, they try to conceal their failure as they wave sheepishly, timidly wiggling fingers at friends and relatives along the parade route.
This would have been my legacy, had I been raised in Blair and thus been steeped in the Queen tradition. After slaving over my shoe box Miss Blair float every year, after portraying Miss Blair on a prize-winning Kiddie Parade float, after seeing queen upon queen on the newspaper’s front page—I would have been a reject. Girls who join the debate team don’t wear crowns; rhinestones are reserved for the girls who stand on the sidelines to cheer for their boyfriends during the home games. Even as an heiress to the title, I would have graced the stage as an imposter.
When I was in fourth or fifth grade, before I realized there was such a thing as popular and I didn’t fit that mold, I discovered my mother’s high school yearbooks. I lay on my stomach at the foot of her bed, my elbows buried in the chocolate-colored carpeting, and turned the black-and-white pages. Year after year my mother smiled from the theater stage, from the marching band lineup, from the choir. From the Prom court, the Homecoming court, the Miss Blair court.
Her friends’ loopy signatures left little white space on the inside covers and spilled onto the interior pages. The bubbly messages alluded to parties and bonfires, mentioned dances and concerts and basketball games, spoke of memorable bus rides and road trips. Though many of the vague references were lost on me, I sensed that they added up to a person vastly different from the mother I knew. The yearbooks painted my mother as a person who was invited to the cool parties, who went on dates and was asked to dances, who wore lipstick and fashionable clothes. This girl—a girl I never knew—would not have befriended my high school self.
I can scarcely reconcile the person in the yearbooks with the woman I know, as though someone else once inhabited my mother’s body. The woman I know has few close friends and rarely leaves the house. She spends her evenings watching sitcoms and reading romance novels. Some of her Christmas sweaters have been in rotation for more than a decade. The gap between who she is and who she was is startling, like walking into sunshine after spending an afternoon in a darkened theater. I don’t know when or how she changed, and I don’t know how to find out.
My mother and I talk, but not often and never deeply. When we are in the same room we say, “It was hot today” or “Gas sure is expensive” or “What should we have for supper?” When we are apart, which is most of the time, we barely speak. A typical phone conversation—
Me: “Hi, Mom. I got the package you sent. Thanks! So…is Dad there?”
Mom: “He’s in the garage. I’ll go get him.”
Me: “OK.”
Doors open and shut, first the heavy inside door, then the porch screen door. Sometimes she has to shoo a cat first. Her loafers slowly click across the asphalt driveway as she carries the phone to my father. “Larry,” she says. “Phone.” I imagine her arm outstretched, reaching across paint cans and stacks of scrap lumber, handing me off.
Other girls call their mothers to chat about school or work or boyfriends. When I call my mother, I seek concrete information: “Mom, how long do I have to boil corn on the cob?” Our conversations rarely last more than a minute or two, unless she has gossip to share—one of my high school classmates had a baby, my cousin has a new boyfriend, family friends are adopting their foster daughter. And then she becomes briefly dynamic, speaking too quickly and stumbling over words, laughing mid-sentence. Perhaps this is a shadow of the Cheese Queen.
I had been dating my boyfriend for three months before she knew for certain I was seeing someone. I sensed her curiosity, but I didn’t intentionally keep a secret. The subject was hedged for weeks in the brief intervals between answering the phone and fetching my father. She didn’t know how to ask, and I didn’t know how to tell. My sister finally relayed the information.
When I say “I love you too” before hanging up, it’s usually to my father. Not because I don’t love my mother—I do, fiercely—but because I don’t know how to tell her. And she doesn’t know how to tell me, either. It’s awkward even to hug her at the most appropriate times, like before boarding an airplane; she feels too small and foreign in my arms.
I can sometimes feel her listening on the kitchen phone, the one that’s attached to the wall by a long beige cord, intently absorbing the conversation that flows freely between my father and I. I’m always startled when she interjects, because though I know she’s there and she’s listening and she cares, it’s surprising to hear her voice.
And so this is what I know of her: it’s laundry day, the house next door is for sale again, the diabetic cat is gaining a little weight. Small talk. Nothing. Silence.
When my mother ran for Queen there were nineteen contestants—it was one of the largest competitions in the Cheese Festival’s history. On coronation night, after an off-stage interview consisting of questions such as “Why do you feel you would be a good representative of our community?” the candidates anxiously waited in the brightly-lit high school gymnasium during a community-wide awards night. The entire town sat on uncomfortable bleachers or cold metal folding chairs for several hours; nearly every family had a member competing for an award: Star Farmer, Best Lawn, Grand View Nursing Home royalty. The emcee announced titles, shook hands, and distributed commemorative trophies, plaques, and certificates until only the Cheese Queen was left unnamed.
The lights dimmed and the theater department’s spotlights illuminated the stage at the gym’s far end, framed by heavy red curtains. Each contestant’s name was called and the girls filed onto the stage one by one, taking their seats in a row of folding chairs. They squinted in the blinding white glow as they waited.
The emcee announced Miss Blair’s attendants, the runners-up, first. They squealed and hugged one another, and walked to the far side of the stage to receive their sashes, tiaras, and bouquets. Then, for an added bit of drama, the 1969 Queen of the Cheese Festival came on stage carrying Miss Blair’s rhinestone crown. The reigning Queen paced back and forth, pretending to place the crown on several heads before resting it atop my mother’s puffy blonde hair.
I wonder how Susan Thorpe felt in those last moments before her victory. Surely there was a sense of anticipation and, more importantly, a sense of possibility. Two contestants had already been eliminated, but my mother—the girl who, eleven years later, would become my mother—still had a chance. She could wear that crown, smile for the cameras, and be somebody.
I’d like to know if life measures up to what she imagined in that moment. I doubt she planned to leave college without a degree, quit her job to become a mother and a housewife, and spend her life in the bachelor-sized house her husband bought years before they were married. More than three decades after the Cheese Queen, no longer wearing her rhinestones, there’s nothing to separate her from the contestants who stood with her on the stage that night. She cooks dinner and sweeps floors just like they do. My mother is an ordinary woman living an ordinary life populated by ordinary people and ordinary things. Whether or not she’s okay with that—happy—I do not know. I will never know. It’s a question that stretches far beyond the limits of our halting conversations.
My mother is a different kind of beautiful now. Her once-slender figure has softened and filled out. A rounded belly protrudes, the result of bearing two children, and small lines accentuate her eyes and forehead. Her makeup is thicker now, and no longer a daily occurrence.
She moves slowly, wobbling and leaning on a cane when navigating from room to room. My mother has less control of her voice than she did when I was a child; it shakes when she’s tired, and slurs even when she’s not. Her sentences squeak and catch in her throat when she’s excited, and she sometimes speaks too loudly. She cannot get her words out fast enough to keep an impatient listener’s attention. People ask, “What’s wrong with your mom?” after they meet her.
The first time a friend asked, when I was in junior high, I was puzzled. “Nothing,” I said. This was before the cane, before our family was granted a handicapped parking permit, before my mother began seeing double and so stopped driving.
That was before the diagnosis—before there was an official reason for why my mother sometimes tripped over nothing or lurched sideways while walking, for why stronger eyeglass prescriptions and special lenses did little to correct her faulty depth perception. That was before the semi-annual trips to the Mayo Clinic, one of the best in the country, to see a neurologist who could name the condition but not the cause or the cure: cerebral degeneration.
Part of the beauty queen’s brain is shrinking. Her motor skills have been deteriorating for years and will continue to do so. Hence the stumbling and staggering, hence the impaired speech, hence the blurred vision. My mother is in a perpetual state of drunkenness, but without the drinks, the hangovers, the giddiness, or the fuzziness of mind. This condition may or may not be genetic.
We’ve never talked about it. When I was maybe ten years old she began to go, without explanation, to days-long doctor visits while my sister and I spent time in Blair. To distract us, our grandparents spoiled my sister and me with trips to the root beer stand and they bought us trinkets at Liquidator’s, the local discount store. I still use my rudimentary childhood language to explain her condition. “My mom’s brain is shrinking,” I say, not because I wouldn’t like to offer a more scientific explanation, not because I wouldn’t like to be more precise in naming a disease, but because I can’t. Because I haven’t been told.
My high school boyfriend’s parents were doctors. He asked me more questions about my mother’s health than I’d ever asked her, or my father. Eventually, tired of saying “I don’t know,” I tried to talk to my mother. I lingered at the kitchen table after supper one night, silent, rehearsing the questions in my mind and working up the courage to inquire.
She leaned against the sink rinsing forks and cups, bending to place them in the dishwasher, no doubt curious as to why I wasn’t doing my math homework, watching TV with my sister, or reading in my room.
“Um…Mom?”
She looked over her shoulder at me, expectantly.
“What…uh…what exactly do you have? I mean, what’s your disease called?”
She was quiet for a moment, frozen with a plate in her hand. “Cerebral degeneration,” she said, “or cerebellar degeneration.” She rinsed the plate and closed the dishwasher. “Something like that.”
There are few important things we can talk about without strain, few life-changing events open to conversation. Being Cheese Queen is one of them—but only if I ask questions. My mother doesn’t tell stories about herself without being prompted, especially stories from her past. Perhaps the stories no longer feel real, or they remind her of a person she no longer recognizes. Maybe they are as mythical to her as they are to me.
Home from college one weekend, I asked my mother to tell stories from her Miss Blair reign. She wore a flowered nightgown and sat in an old armchair as we talked, not bearing an iota of resemblance to the girl in the newspaper photo. She didn’t have much fun at the Cheese Festival that year, she explained, because she spent her time running between events. Miss Blair had to ride in the parade, not watch it. She sat in the front row at the community ecumenical church service on Sunday morning, handed out ice-cream samples in front of the bank Saturday afternoon, attended the talent show on Friday night.
Moments before it began, my mother was asked to participate in the talent show. One of the performers sang a rendition of “Elvira,” a love song I’ve never heard, and—possibly because the original Elvira was a no-show, my mother can’t remember—Miss Blair was forced into the role. “I had to drift across the stage,” she said, moving her arms in a gesture reminiscent of a Hawaiian hula girl.
She smiled, no doubt envisioning what would happen if she drifted in her current condition. A few years earlier, while playing Guesstures, a charades-like game in which players act out words to earn points, she accidentally jumped into a wall while trying to make her team guess the word “leap.” Because of this incident, and an accumulation of others, I can’t picture my mother drifting across anything, much less while wearing a billowy floor-length dress and heels.
I don’t know that woman; I know a woman who must be driven to the beauty shop when she gets her hair frosted, dropped off at the mall to get a manicure. I know a woman who avoids grocery shopping alone because it’s difficult to control the cart, who is no longer coordinated enough to do the intricate needlework she loved when I was a kid, who can read only in short spurts because the words give her headaches. And I am clueless to what goes on inside.
“I can’t imagine you drifting across a stage,” I say.
My mother keeps the crown on a shelf in her closet, in a white box whose corners are dog-eared, whose lid isn’t a perfect fit anymore. The box rarely comes down, especially now that my mother is too unsteady to stand on a chair and retrieve it herself. It sits among other mementos—autographed high school yearbooks, laminated newspaper articles, boxes of photographs, my parents’ wedding album, baby books.
I understand this need to collect the artifacts of one’s existence. I have an antique hatbox filled with my own memories—letters from an old boyfriend, ticket stubs, a carefully dried corsage, nametags from former jobs, a mini golf score card, snapshots that tell stories. It is a collection of things meaningless without their associations, valuable only to me. My hatbox is now stacked among other boxes, occupying space in what used to be my bedroom before I moved from my parents’ house. The aged cardboard is too fragile to be transported, and so it stays where it is. The bottom, repaired with duct tape, has separated from the box. The heft of its contents is too great.
CCIrvine, California, had a 7-acre vacant lot that cost the city more than $4,000 a year to maintain. So the city met with Southern California Edison and the Second Harvest Food Bank and came up with a plan: the Incredible Edible Park. Instead of killing weeds, the city of Irvine grows vegetables.
According to the Irvine Wiki, up to 1,200 volunteers a year cultivate the gardens. The Second Harvest site says the number of volunteers is more like 4,000. Together, they grow, tend, and harvest broccoli, potatoes, watermelons, squash and more. It all helps feed the community’s thousands of hungry families who turn to food banks, soup kitchens, churches, and shelters.
More sponsors and supporters have come on board, including the Irvine Ranch Water District, Windwood Homeowners Associations, Orange County Farm Community, and El Camino Real Elementary. In the video posted by Growing Your Greens, you can see how extensive the fields are. It’s a small farm, with a bike path that winds through it. A lot of people have access to fresh, healthy food because of the vision that started with one man, A.G. Kawamura, California Secretary of Food and Agriculture.
Any city with vacant land could start something like this. What a hope-filled idea.What.

Since April, member of the knowledge management groups at the university of karlsruhe (FZI-WIM, AIFB-WBS). Master thesis on "Aquisistion of ontologies using text-minig" carried out at a industrial research labs ( Rentenanstalt / Swisslife, Switzerland ). Currently engaged in the architecture of the portal for the EU-funded community of excellence for Ontologies and Knowledge Management (ONTOWEB). Also engaged in the EU-funded research project WonderWeb, which focuses on infrastructure for and interoperability in the Semantic Web. Interests: Ontologies and their relation to other established research and technologies (databases, distributed object systems, text and data minig); also the semantics of formalized languages and inter logic interoperability (i.e. Description vs. Frame Logics). Background: Chiefly what was taught during master studies: Databases, Machine learning with a focus on text mining. Participated in software development in text mining ,web applications and ontology-based systems (OntoEdit, TextToOnto, KAON Tool suite: kaon.semanticweb.org, OntoWeb portal) Contribution: My chief contribution to WebOnt is likely to be in semantics, and particularly how representation primitives affect applicability, interoperability and computational complexity. I am particularly interested whether one could achieve a open, layered ontology framework that combines ideas from several logic languages, in particular how the resulting formal semantic will interpretable by inference engines with different reasoning mechanisms. I want to help in ensuring that the resulting language will be usable and that complexity issues are at least known to respective users.

3Gerard Depardieu Makes Light of His Plane-Urination Incident in New Promo [VIDEO]
Last month, French film star Gerard Depardieu caused quite a stir when he urinated in the cabin of an Air France plane in full view of passengers and crew. The odd story caused even CNN’s Anderson Cooper to have a serious gigglefit while covering it for his ‘AC360′ program.
Now Depardieu, 62, has proven he too has a sense of humor about it.
In this French-language video, ‘Les Gaulois Dans L’Espace,’ he and actor Edouard Baer — who was Depardieu’s travel companion on that fateful Air France flight — sit aboard a plane dressed as characters from their upcoming film ‘Asterix et Obelix: On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.’
As the flight attendant announces that no one will be served wild boar until they are in flight, Depardieu becomes agitated and demands to eat immediately. He leaves his seat and seconds later, the flight attendant can be heard on the PA system explaining an emergency landing will have to be made because a man made a “mess.”

I say “omg” in the smallest sense as in “what have I committed to?” I do enjoy the after-glow of a block well done, but the process of seam ripping, measuring, color matching….it’s a load.
I found I needed a tool of sorts to help me keep things in order. Last year, Lori Holt from Bee in my Bonnet, created these mini design boards that are useful for people like me. I forget to keep the pieces in the correct order. I did NOT, however, get as fancy as she in creating the lovely boarder on the design board. Lori designs fun fabric. She too went through making a Farmer’s Wife with her material.
I also realized I needed a big design board to pin my completed blocks on to get them up and out of the way of the cutting board. Think of the consequences – devastating right? I first saw a design board at Quilt in Joy last year when I took a beginner quilting class. Because of my frustration of the blocks laying on the cutting board I searched for a do-it-yourself for creating a design board. I found it here on Elizabeth Hartman’s OhFransson.com site.
The hours it takes to pick colors, cut, layout, piece, measure, seam rip is definitely NOT the sexy part. The best part is the finished block. You have your points pointing, your measurements are correct (after ripping and re-sewing), the block is esthetically pleasing allowing you to step back to appreciate what it took to create the block.
The blocks come from the book the Farmer’s Wife. The blocks for February are in order from left to right: 9 Box, 16 Calico puzzle (doesn’t it look like a union jack?), 21 Contrary Wife, 23 Country farm (FAV), 41 Friendship Star (another FAV), 69 Practical Orchard, 70 Prairie Queen – tough one, 72 Railroad, 81 Snow Ball (easy!) and 84 Spool (FAV again) are completed (along with a few others) and laid out on my big board.
We have our marching orders for March already. I actually have a few of those completed.

Brooklyn Bridge.MICHAEL COGGAN: In the fight against crime, NT Police have forged a new agreement allowing detectives to exchange DNA profiles taken from crime scenes with police in Queensland.
NT Police currently share their DNA database with WA and Police Minister Paul Henderson sees this latest move as another major step forward.
I spoke to him earlier.
PAUL HENDERSON, POLICE MINISTER: Well it really means that the long arm of the law just got longer and the capacity certainly for major crime if a major crime is committed in the NT, for the criminal to hop across the border and believe that they can't be traced means that that can no longer occur.
MICHAEL COGGAN: NT Police have been using DNA as a crime-fighting tool for many years now.
How successful has it been?
PAUL HENDERSON: It has been very successful -- part of a suite of evidence that goes to the courts, but since August 2002 over 360 offences have been cleared up in the NT, in part utilising DNA evidence, and that's led to the conviction of over 100 criminals and I really believe that the DNA legislation, the evidence that goes to courts that is being targeted on recidivist property offenders and, in part, leading to the 20 per cent reduction in property crime that we saw last year, so a very significant crime-fighting tool for the police.
MICHAEL COGGAN: Police have made the point that DNA has to be used in connection with other evidence.
Is that true?
PAUL HENDERSON: Oh, very much so.
It is part of a suite of evidence, along with fingerprints, other testimony, circumstantial evidence -- but what we're seeing is a significant clear-up, particularly of property crime, volume crime, and certainly the statistics show along with additional police forces -- ah, police numbers going into our police force -- the use of this DNA evidence, that we are seeing a reduction of property crime across the NT which last year was 20 per cent.
We've still got a long way to go, but it is part of a suite of tools in the fight against crime and it is working.
MICHAEL COGGAN: Is more work being done on how to use DNA?
PAUL HENDERSON: Well, the police obviously use DNA where they can.
We have this new agreements with Queensland.
We've also got agreeements with WA and Tasmania.
We're also in negotiation for agreements with SA and the ACT.
MICHAEL COGGAN: DNA has been used in Operation Genesweep with limited success.
Is that a concern?
PAUL HENDERSON: Not at all, because it's all part of crime-prevention initiatives.
I think criminals understand, people who are committing volume crime, crime over and again, they're more likely to be caught now.
And as I said, the stats are there for all to see -- over 360 offences cleared up since August 2002, 100 convictions that probably wouldn't have been obtained without DNA, and all other States are actually looking to the NT, looking to the successes that we're having in the NT, and amending their legislation.
MICHAEL COGGAN: So you see DNA as locked in and a crime-fighting device that will be held onto?
PAUL HENDERSON: Absolutely, and talking to the police yesterday, it's going to achieve the same level of significance in the fight against crime as fingerprinting did many, many years ago.
MICHAEL COGGAN: It's nine months since the O'Sullivan report recommended significant changes to the police force.
How is that reform going?
PAUL HENDERSON: Well, we're now recruiting at maximum capacity through the recruit college.
Government committed to an additional 200 police on the streets by the end of 2006.
Since August last year, over 80 police officers have already graduated, so the time's right now, if you're out there interested in a career in the police force then we want to hear from you and we're absolutely out there recruiting now -- the college is at full capacity and we're looking at recruiting 125 people this year.
MICHAEL COGGAN: One of the most significant findings of the O'Sullivan report was the problems with senior management and the need to settle that down and make it solid.
Has that been achieved?
PAUL HENDERSON: Look, I think the morale within our police force is raised significantly since where we were 12 months ago.
I think the police commissioner, his executive team, are working extraordinarily well, morale, as I get around the police force, seems to be pretty good at the moment, and the results are out there.
MICHAEL COGGAN: So you'd say unequivocally that senior police management have your 100 per cent support?
PAUL HENDERSON: Absolutely.
MICHAEL COGGAN: Thank you for joining me on Stateline.
PAUL HENDERSON: Thank you.

This sounds absolutely fabulous - and perfect for my family, as we like a little heat in our meals :)
Stopping by from Talent Show Tuesday - pinned to share.
I threw it into the stovetop at the very end to hurry it up and it turned out perfectly. It got a thumb's up from the whole family! Thanks!
This is 5 stars! Boyfriend just said,"this is your best soup to date". I used habaneros and spicy turkey sausage because we are obsessed with spicy foods. Other than that I followed the recipe! Amazing.
Thanks Anonymous!!!!! So happy you enjoyed it :)
Any tips on how I can keep the cheese from curdling?
sorry that it curdled! I am not sure. Usually adding it at the end works for me. Warm the evap milk too.What to Do with Leftover Pizza
I’ve always had a bit of an issue with leftovers unless I can make them into a soup, casserole or stew. Leftovers simply re-heated lose a lot of their flavor and texture. They are still edible but they just aren’t as satisfying or pleasing to the tongue. On the other hand, I don’t like wasting food. But pizza, what do you do with leftover pizza to still make it too good to resist? Read more…
WHAT TO DO WITH LEFTOVER PIZZA
Pizza is comfort food. It taste delicious and when made with the right ingredients is actually healthy; but one, occasionally two slices will satisfy me. I could never sit down and eat a whole pizza, not even a small one. Pizza is very filling and I like to enjoy mine with a nice green salad, not just eat pizza and only pizza unless it is just for a quick, tide me over snack and there one slice will do too.
Oh I sometimes make the small, individual pizza using flatbread or pizza bites made with crackers and they are very good but it just isn’t quite the same as sitting down to pizza, lightly crunchy crust that is loaded with lots of good veggies, that spicy herb and tomato sauce and oozing with melted cheese but it comes in eight good sized slices and that means I am going to have a lot left over. What do I do with the leftovers when I’m eating alone and have ordered or made a too large a pizza to be consumed in one setting?
I refrigerate it of course or package it up in individual servings and freeze it. The problem is that now I have to either eat it cold or dry it out too much in the oven before it is re-heated through or end up with soggy pizza when I zap it in the microwave. These methods also take away from the delicious flavor of fresh pizza.
It is never quite the same or nearly as good. Re-heated pizza can be so disappointing.
My friend Hoop solved the problem for me.
He said, “Get out your pancake griddle.”
I said, “Huh?”
He said, “The griddle, that thing you cook your pancakes on, on top of the stove. Re-heat your leftover pizza on your non-stick griddle or if you don’t have a non-stick spray it very lightly with cooking oil. Set the heat to medium-low and place your slice or two of pizza on the griddle and let it heat slowly until it is warm. The crust will remain crispy and the cheese will re-melt and the veggies won’t get mushy and over cooked. Try it. It works.”
I said, “Sure, okay, if you say so.”
I tried it. It works and I didn’t have to toss it out or eat pizza that was no longer really appealing. How simple is that? Just re-heat it on top of the stove, on my griddle. Why didn’t I think of that?
I’m sure Hoop would have an answer to that question too but it wouldn’t bear repeating.

Great advice. I love eating leftover pizza even if it’s cold.

Great post. I’ll be trying that next time we order pizza. We always have a couple of slices left over! xYu Xiang’s “I Can Almost See the Clouds of Dust”
Reviewed by Naomi Long Eagleson
Yu Xiang’s poems are the poetic equivalent of shoegazer rock. She takes the mundane—a whiff of cigarette smoke, a falling leaf, a housefly—and stares at it so intently that it splits open to reveal something unexpected. In the introduction to I Can Almost See the Clouds of Dust, the translator Fiona Sze-Lorrain writes that Yu “is adamant that a mundane life does not lack poetry. Rather, it lacks being discovered.” And indeed, throughout this bilingual collection the everydayness of life is keenly observed, giving rise to poems that reveal as much about the self as they do the world. In “Holy Front,” the speaker sits on a sofa and admires a flood of sunlight pouring through a glass pane she has just cleaned. But as she does, flies, mistaking the glass for air, hurl themselves into it and fall, cataleptic, on the windowsill:
Several houseflies want to buzz in and out, they smack into it
On the windowsill a few flies
twitch their bodies, struggling blindly in the sun
I guess my life is no different from these flies’
And in “Distracted,” the speaker confides about a peculiar habit of hers: “I like to stare at one thing for a long time.” In stillness, objects (soap bubbles, beer) and phenomena (cigarette smoke) come into focus until they burst or disappear:
I always stare at one thing for a long time
For instance, I am smoking this cigarette
I see green gray smoke waft upwards
and eventually disappear
. . .
I like staring at fleeting things
unaware that someone else is staring at me in this way
Even the simple act of stirring a pot of porridge can elicit a poem, as it does in “Other Things”:
if you stop, cornflour will stick to the bottom
other sounds will reach your ears
other things will emerge
No corner of life, however obscure or unremarkable, is unworthy of observation and consideration. Living rooms, bars, and city streets are alive with presence and activity. Everything is vibrating with reality (if not always significance)—and the buzz invites, even commands, our attention. All that’s required is patience, and perhaps humility, to see the poem hidden in the everyday, in “the Clouds of Dust,” to quote the title of the book.
Born in 1970 in the city of Ji’nan, in Shandong Province, China, Yu Xiang published her first book of poems, Exhale, in 2006. She is also the author of a chapbook, Sorceress, published in 2009. She holds a regular job at an office and writes during her spare time. As Sze-Lorrain writes, “the art [of poetry] is a privilege, the word a spiritual nourishment that helps her survive the tedium of life, and find meaning or beauty in an otherwise pessimistic and difficult society.” At once accessible and intimate, Yu’s poems are earthbound and familiar, like the voice of a friend—“I have a lonely yet / stable life” (“My House”), and syntactically arresting—“No light, no light / colors like a dialogue in sleep” (“A Painting Life”). Yu refracts everyday language to tell slanted truths about her world.
As the reader progresses through I Can Almost See the Clouds of Dust, poems move from the individual sphere (of self and home) to encompass larger, more populated realms that foist themselves onto our awareness by tragic events. Those who died in the 2005 Shalan Town flood in Heilongjiang and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, many of them children, are evoked in incantatory meditations on disaster and ruin, where events cannot be contained by language or by “stubborn life”:
please believe in an
incorrigibly stubborn life
believe in a severed finger that performs for dead spirits
please leave behind the earth that keeps shattering
ruins that keep shattering
leave behind the mudslide that blocks forklifts and cranes
please leave behind, leave behind
the right not to die

Hold on!
We only purchase climbing holds made in Europe – these have more stringent environmental standards and a smaller carbon footprint.More sustainability...
With over 450 routes in the centre and at least 80 changing each month, you won’t get bored at The Castle! Routes are set by our team of in-house setters led by Chief Setter Mike Langley and guest setters including Steve McClure and Gaz Parry.
If you would like to know a bit more about route setting at the Castle this article, published in the May 2015 issue of Climber will give you an insight into the huge amount of work that goes into managing and setting at one of the biggest walls in Europe and what it takes to set quality routes.
We offer both top-roping (where the rope is already in place through anchors at the top of the wall) and lead climbing (where you must clip the rope in through running belays as you climb). In order to lead climb you will need to bring your own rope. If you know how to top-rope and would like to learn how to lead climb, you can book a Lead Course with us.
All our routes are graded using the French grading system and are easily identifiable on each wall. We have a range of routes at all times from grade 4 up to 8a.
We regularly host a number of national and regional competitions including the BMC’s Youth Climbing Series and the BMC’s Leading Ladder. See our events blog or sign up for updates to get the latest news.
The Castle also has 10 TruBlue Autobelay lines. The TruBlue autobelay system may only be used by registered climbers.What’s Your Bermuda Triangle?
You’ve heard of the Bermuda Triangle, right? It’s the area approximately connecting Miami, FL and San Juan, Puerto Rica and the Bahamas where a host of unexplained disappearances of boats and planes have occurred since 1493 when Christopher Columbus made his first voyage to the New World. It’s reported that readings from compasses and other navigation equipment are not reliable because this is one of those areas where magnetic anomalies exist and therefore planes and vessels can end up off course… or worse as the stories are told.
Could your office or your office day sometimes act very much like the Bermuda Triangle? Maybe just a part of your office or your day can be considered your Bermuda Triangle. What would it be?
Do your papers and emails vanish in mysterious ways? How about your to-do lists? These can vanish quite easily in a disorganized environment. I know many folks who have a dozen to-do lists on legal pads, but they cannot find most of them.
Even if you’re office is fairly organized, it’s just as easy to get lost when time disappears, or you’re not sure where you are with projects or you’re not sure what you should be doing next. You may think that you’re working your biggest priority at the moment, but if you can’t find to-do lists, files or emails then how can you be sure you’re on course?
Could the disappearance of any of these be the cause of missed deadlines, forgotten tasks or missed goals? Perhaps.
If you feel off course on most days and you’re not reaching your desired destination, then you could be experiencing the effects of your own Bermuda Triangle. Your environment may be inhibiting you from getting the right readings on your direction and can leave you feeling disoriented or lost.
Next time you’re sailing or flying through your day, think about whether or not your office environment and your systems and processes for managing tasks, time, email and paper are keeping you on course. Remember these three critical points to help you stay on course:
1.) Simplify your surroundings. The less you have, the less you have to manage. Having fewer things around you will help you fight distractions that can take you off course. Be selective about what you keep, accept or commit to.
2.) Make sure you’re getting the right readings from you’re systems, which should direct you to your hottest priorities. These include the systems or processes you use for handling paper, incoming mail, email, voice mail, tasks, calendar appointments, contacts, etc… If you’re lacking systems in any of these areas, then you’ll be more likely to lose track of time, commitments and priorities. Get systems in place so that you can stop thinking about HOW to work so you can start DOING the work.
3.) Make little changes one at a time. Positive improvements will build on one another. Focus on one area at a time and there will be a gradual increase in your control as you work towards a more efficient office and a more productive work day.
If you’re not careful, things and time can easily vanish, leaving you unprepared, unproductive and stressed out. Or worse, your motivation and enthusiasm for what you do could vanish too and then where would you be?
If you can get out of your own Bermuda Triangle, no matter how you define it, then you’ll be on a safer and more productive course leading you to success!WMU

Festival,Recap: Angel S 03 E 02 That Vision Thing
Cordelia experiences visions that disfigure her physically. Lilah Morgan offers to fix the problem if Angel rescues a man imprisoned by the Powers That Be.
Tropes:
- All Women Love Shoes: Cordelia admires Gavin's Guccis. And his nice suit.
- Always Save the Girl: Angel thinks saving Cordelia is more important than whatever damage the prisoner will do.
- Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking: Lorne works out who the obvious suspect for Cordy's problems is.Lorne: "Who wants to get to you, who has the sizable resources, and who'd be willing to mess up a pretty face like Cordelia's?"
- Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!: Fred is looking up the addresses of Chinatown herbal shops.Wesley: "Anything of interest yet, Fred?"
Fred: "Oh, sure. Lots. 'H' is a fascinating letter. Helicopters, helium, helmets, hernias...'
Wesley: "Did you happen to notice 'herbs' in your wanderings?"
- Batter Up: Gunn carries a sharpened baseball bat so he can both stake and smash. Ironically the same weapon was used in a MADtv spoof Buffy the Umpire Slayer.
- Beauty to Beast
- Blood Magic/Bloody Handprint: The shaman trying to abort Darla's child.
- Buffy Speak/Shaped Like Itself: The fortress demon dimension.Angel: "I don't suppose we know what this dimension is like? I mean, besides fortress-y and demon-y?
- Chekhov's Gunman: The prisoner Angel freed will turn up again in "Billy", and the demon Skip in "Birthday". The exterminators sent by Gavin Park are revealed to have been planting bugs instead of getting rid of them.
- Discriminate and Switch/Fantastic Racism: Subverted when you find the Chinese couple are working for the Powers — vampires are (after all) evil.Old Chinese Woman: Your kind not welcome here.
Charles Gunn: Since when can't a brother buy some ginseng tea?
Old Chinese Man: Not you. Him. (Points at Angel) Vampire not welcome.
- Dramatic Thunder/A Storm Is Coming: Darla consulting the shaman. Just call it foreshadowing.
- Evil Is Petty/Undead Tax Exemption: Gavin Park steps up his harassment of Angel Investigations, listing 57 city code violations with the city planners office and sending pest exterminators in the middle of the night to clean out the Hyperion.
- Facial Horror
- Fascinating Eyebrow: Angel and Skip share some amusing eyebrow movements when they first meet.
- Friendly Local Chinatown: The locals are distinctly unfriendly this time round.
- Ghost Butler: Cordelia gets Phantom Dennis to open the door for her so she can usher Fred out.
- Gibbering Genius: Fred comes up with the idea of tracing back the signal from the Powers That Be.
- Hilarious Outtakes/Delicious Distraction:David Boreanaz: No, Cordy; this isn't about winning, this is about what's at stake, and these waffles are fucking great. Can we eat 'em?
- Hostage for MacGuffin
- A House Divided: When Lilah blows off Gavin's offer to come on his team, he lets Angel past Wolfram & Hart's vampire detectors to visit her.
- I Did What I Had to Do
- Innocent InnuendoFred: I've been forking with Gunn.
- It's a Long Story/Talk to the Fist:Skip: "And you're here to try to...rescue this guy? (Angel nods) But we're on the same side. Shouldn't you be helping to keep him in here?"
Angel: "I know. I know. Long story. Involves a girl. I don't like it any better than you do."
Skip: "So I really can't talk you out of this?"
Angel: "Sorry. I wish you could. I guess we just have to agree to..." (Skip punches him in the face) "...disagree."
- Improvised Weapon/Wire Fu: Angel yanks the Chinaman's belt sash, causing him to spin through the air.
- Kubrick Stare: Just in case you had any doubt the man Angel freed was evil.
- Levitating Lotus Position/Please Keep Your Hat On/My Brain Is Big: The Man in the Fez sits on Lilah's table, floats in the air, then removes his fez to reveal the top of his skull has been cut off to reveal a squirming brain.
- Man on Fire/And I Must Scream: The prisoner Angel is sent to free is engulfed in flames inside a burning cube floating in midair.Angel: "Uh, what keeps him in the fire?"
Skip: "My will."
Angel: "How come he's not screaming in pain?"
Skip: "Oh, he is. My will prevents him from being heard. I mean there is only so many 'oh my god! The pain! Please make it stop!' that you can listen to before it starts to bug the crap out of you."
- Needle in a Stack of Needles: The key is hidden in a key shop; averted though because it's too distinctive to miss.
- Never Heard That One Before: Darla isn't surprised the shaman doesn't have any answers for her.
- No Name Given: The Man in a Fez.
- The Nose Knows: Skip sniffs Angel and realises he's both a vampire and working for the Powers.
- Nothing Personal: Angel and Skip have a friendly conversation before trying to beat each other's heads in. Averted with Lilah — after making the swap, she tells Angel it was "just business". Angel responds by hurling a rebar through the skull of the Man with the Fez. Lilah stares at the corpse, then jumps when she realises Angel is right in front of her.Angel: "Don't you come at me through Cordelia ever again. You play that card a second time and I'll kill you."
- Oh, Crap: Angel crosses into the fortressed demon dimension. His weapons don't come with him.Angel: "Sure. Because it would be too easy if I could actually defend myself."
- Office Golf / Stealth Hi/Bye: Lilah is playing golf on her computer, then jumps when she realises Angel is behind her.
- Plot Coupons: The ring and the key enable Angel to enter the fortress dimension.
- Ship Tease: Blood Knight Gunn tells Fred he'd rather be out with her than fighting.
- Sword Fight / Battle Discretion Shot
- Talking in Your Dreams: The Man in the Fez puts his own visions in Cordelia's head.
- Tempting Fate: "This has never failed me." Well shaman, there's a first time for everything.
- That Came Out Wrong: Cordelia being compared to cars and dogs. And of course the inevitable Getting Crap Past the Radar versions.Wesley: "I supposed it is one of the unwritten laws of being a 'dick.' (Gunn give Wes a look) Ah, a sleuth, a gumshoe, Sherlock."
Gunn: "All I know is you use the word 'dick' again and we're gonna have a problem. So what is the name of this place anyway?"
Wesley: "Van Hoa Dong."
- They Look Just Like Everyone Else: The man Angel rescues looks like an ordinary human, rather than some hideous demon.
- Villains Never Lie: Averted; Lilah claims the man Angel is going to rescue has been unfairly imprisoned. Angel doesn't even bother asking for details. Both he and Wesley know that Lilah is either lying or not telling the full story. Regardless, if Wolfram & Hart want the man released it'll be bad news for someone.
- Wolverine Claws/Badass Grandpa/Never Mess with Granny/Battle Couple/Audible Sharpness: The Chinese couple guarding the Key.
- You Look Familiar: Kal Penn (the Man in the Fez) previously played a student turned into a caveman in the Buffy episode "Beer Bad."
- Your Approval Fills Me with Shame:Lilah: "To be honest, nobody at the firm thought that you could do it...except me. You're a remarkable man, Angel."
Angel: "Yeah, and you're an evil bitch."Description

Article first published published online: 6 SEP 2010
- Article first published online: 12 APR 2010
- Accepted for publication 15th February 2010. Published online 12th April 2010. spastic diplegia, eight with hemiplegia, six with spastic quadriplegia, and one with spastic triplegia) and 21 healthy comparison children (mean 2y 1.68mo, SD 2y 8.64mo) were evaluated. The distribution of Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels in the CP group was as follows: level I, 7; level II, 14; level III, 5; level IV, 3; and level V, 5. The following three diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters including tractography were evaluated for each tract (corticospinal tract [CST] and posterior thalamic radiation [PTR]): number of fibres, tract-based fractional anisotropy, and region of interest (ROI)-based fractional anisotropy. We compared each value between the two groups, and correlated each value with the GMFCS level.
Results The number of fibres and ROI-based fractional anisotropy values of both tracts were significantly lower in children with CP than in the comparison group (p<0.05–0.001). Additionally, there was significant negative correlation between GMFCS level and motor–sensory parameters (p<0.001–0.05).
Interpretation DTI parameters of the CST and PTR in children with CP were significantly lower than in comparison children. In addition, these parameters were significantly correlated with GMFCS level.Anti-Cortisol Supplements Informations
What is an Anti-Cortisol Supplement ?
Anti-Cortisol Supplements are designed to reduce the level of cortisol in your body. An excessive level of cortisol is bad for a bodybuilder and Anti-Cortisol Supplements mainly focus on reducing its level.
The usage of Anti-Cortisol Supplements
The cortisol, also called the stress hormone is responsible for many human functions. Many people have an excess of cortisol in their body (due to the stress) and bodybuilders should stay away from cortisol : cortisol can be the cause of being in a catabolic phase, high level of cortisol encourages the body to store more fat… Therefore, Anti-Cortisol Supplements can be used by every bodybuilder looking to get clean dry gains while also dropping fat levels.
The benefits of taking Anti-Cortisol Supplement during a cycle of prohormone are numerous : lean dry gains, dropping fat levels, (basically building more muscle, less fat and muscles are more hard!).
What are the ingredients in Anti-Cortisol Supplements ?
Anti-Cortisol Supplements contains various ingredients that works differently but they are all good. Some Anti-Cortisol Supplements ingredients are natural while some others are chemical. Chemical ingredients like 5-AT (5-Etioallocholen-3b,7b,17b-Triol) and 7-OH (3b,7-Dihydroxy-5-Etioallocholen-17-One) are very powerful and they will surely lower your cortisol level rapidly – most faster than the natural ingredients -.
What dosage should I take for an Anti-Cortisol Supplement ?
There is no specific dosage for the Anti-Cortisol Supplements. Just follow the guidelines from the manufacturer.
Example of good Anti-Cortisol Supplements
Reduce XT by Serious Nutrition Solutions is a very good Anti-Cortisol Supplement. Reduce XT contains two chemical ingredients (7-alpha-hydroxy-dehydoepiandrosterone and 7-beta-hydroxy-dehydoepiandrosterone) proven to work efficiently and rapidly. With Reduce XT, results of lowering your cortisol level will appear under a few days only :

Anti-Cortisol ReviewsHumorist Danny Tyree writes about possible Father's Day headlines.
Almost every day, as I plod through a world dominated by Murphy's Law, I am haunted by one of my late father's favorite observations:
"There's no such thing as a simple job."
For instance, I assumed it would be child's play to Google "Father's Day," sift through current events and get a great springboard for a column; but I kept being assailed by dry historical tidbits, banal parade schedules or Chamber of Commerce-approved "Top 10 Gifts For Dad" puff pieces.
If only I could find some juicier headlines! Need some hypothetical examples? Allow me to elucidate (another of my father's favorite terms):
1. International Brotherhood Of Fathers Union Sues Sen. John McCain For Trademark Infringement Over His "Don't Make Me Come Back There!" Foreign Policy.
2. Hasbro Creates Buzz At Annual Toy Fair By Discontinuing Don't Wake Daddy Game And Replacing It With Living-Will Edition: Don't Resuscitate Daddy.
3. Comics Historian Reveals That Superman's Father, Jor-El, Only Accidentally Rocketed Him To Earth. ("Those 2 a.m. feedings were always like kryptonite to me," bleary-eyed scientist chuckled, right before whole dang planet exploded.)
4. Federal Government Now Considers Verifiable Accusations Of "My Dad Can Whip Your Dad" As Criterion For Disability Payments.
5. Celebrity.)
7. Survey Says 23 Percent Of Fathers Think The Message From Harry Chapin's Touching 1974 Folk Song "Cat's In The Cradle" Is "Get A Ferret Instead Of A Cat." ("Yeah, I'll have to tell my son, What's-his-name, the next time I see him," promised one proud papa as he grabbed his briefcase.). Inventor of Horsey-Back Ride Inducted Into Chiropractic Hall of Fame.
Yes, those are the sort of headlines I craved as inspiration. And, yes, I guess I've been perusing the satirical website the Onion a little too much.
Speaking of onions (and childhood obesity), psyche yourself up for Father's Day with this parting headline: "America's Got Talent" Results Show To Feature Debut Of Updated Song, "Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast – You're Making Me Drop My Triple Cheeseburger and Funeral Fries Down My Elastic Waistband. More Than Usual."

In the morning I have nine miles to fuel for and run before midday. I eat cereal, toast, a banana and sit down for a couple of hours. Rain begins to fall. I never like stepping out into it, but love running in it once I am warm and calm – too long though, and the soles of your feet begin to wear away inside your shoes. I hope my feet don’t get too wet too quickly. London is still recovering after its nights of rioting so I head towards Peckham (where there have been riots) and adjacent Dulwich, Lady Thatcher’s old constituency, where there haven’t. But there is something wrong. By the time I reach the bottom of my road (about a hundred metres) my legs feel like they are running on some stability-testing fairground ride. I am breathing heavily. I turn the corner and outside the Riley’s snooker hall on the wide pavement there are sizeable dollops of horse shit. It is hard to think of a landscape less suitable for horse riding than the raging noise, metal and concrete of this junction. But here they must have been, crowd controlling Lewisham’s bottom feeders. Within half a mile I am beginning to think that I might be sick. In fact, for all the full stops in the rest of this post read thus: ‘and I still feel that I am about to puke’. I struggle through the first mile, convinced that the heaviness of my lungs and heart will pass at any moment .(. – and I still feel like I am about to puke).
Rain.
The weight of whatever it is sticks to me, hangs on me. I fight. I could cut this run to four miles, and sneak in this nine tomorrow, at some point – though I don’t know when. No, you came out for nine, that’s what you’ll do. Bing, mile three. Some boarded up shops and estate agents off Peckham Rye, but I’m not interested. Mile four. I feel like I am carrying a cannonball on my stomach. I am carrying water, which I HATE having to do, but I cannot drink any of it, feeling more stuffed than during post-prandial games on Christmas Day. So I have to carry the full bottle and I can hardly breathe my heart is beating so hard.
Into Dulwich and there are no signs of riot damage. I pass a bright blue and old-fashioned drop-crossbar ladies’ pushbike chained to a lamppost. It has had its front wheel stolen – I hubristically wonder if this is as bad as it got, here. But Dulwich has two things to say in return. One, no – and I know this because twenty yards on I can see a big queue outside a shop. The high street is deserted except for this. As I get closer, I see that it is not housewives queueing for rations in the 1940s, they are waiting their turn at the local locksmiths. Two, revenge. Leaving Dulwich and heading south, there is a huge hill. All of the miles so far have been run slower than 10 minutes. I climb this hill so slowly that I might have walked up it, backwards, at a faster pace. How have I got so far and held my breakfast down? The scene is suddenly offset by the sight of Enid Blyton’s house. It all seems so far away from the endless summer of her vision of England. Climb. Climb. Climb. I pass the Horniman Museum, a name that always makes me snigger for puerile reasons. Left, my head tells me this must be north. The sun in the sky is only a dim memory behind this thick concrete of cloud (and still I …). The hill cannot possibly continue further up, any higher and I will be through the cloud cover. Then, ahh, Mrs Jordan’s house. I always knew she was hidden away around here somewhere. Mrs Jordan was an actress in the early nineteenth century, and was the mistress of William IV, one of the two incompetent kings fathered by George III. The thought strikes me, could it be this horni-man that the museum is named for. My spirits obviously easing. The road slants away from me, slowly. It is a blissful sight. I am over an hour into the run, and although the nausea eases, it does not subside entirely. Now it is only helped by the slow and easeful pace aided by the curve down to Forest Hill.
This is the worst run I have done that did not end in, or was cut short by, injury. I made numerous mistakes. I ate too much. I went out too quickly. I ignored the fact that I was struggling. I was putting unnecessary strain on my heart. I could have brought on an asthma attack. Less fuel, more fun. But the most basic rule that I ignored was that the run was supposed to be an LSD. There is nothing about the concept of Long, Slow, Distance that fits with it being done in a hurry, being done in even a slightly curtailed timeframe. Instead, what I had done was fusion running. I had taken a Michelin starred dish of delightful LSD and remixed it as fast food. Of course the result was utterly nauseous.
How not to do LSDINDIANAPOLIS -- Now that the Jaguars have lost control of their destiny to reach the postseason, they have to root for help to come from somewhere.
The disappointment of falling 34-24 to the Indianapolis Colts Sunday, and losing the advantage they had in the AFC South race, doesn't change where the Jaguars should be looking for an avenue to the playoffs. Their best shot is to still win the division because a wild-card berth is, at best, remote.
"We certainly need help, but it's not impossible that we'll get some," said head coach Jack Del Rio.
The most likely assistance might be from the team Del Rio grew up rooting for, the Oakland Raiders, who play less than an hour away from his California hometown of Hayward.
With the Jaguars and Colts tied for first place at 8-6 (the Colts own the tiebreaker based on record against common opponents), a wild card is pretty much out of the question for Jacksonville because the Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets both stand 10-4. One of them would have to lose their last two games, an unlikely scenario since the Ravens close at home against Cincinnati and the Jets finish at home against lowly Buffalo. The Ravens play at Cleveland next week, while the Jets have a tough game at Chicago.
Jacksonville's best playoff road lies with the Colts losing one of their last two games, and their toughest test figures to be next week at Oakland (7-7). The Colts may have to play the Raiders without standout receiver Austin Collie, who suffered another head injury against the Jaguars after missing six games with concussion issues. Indianapolis finishes the season at home against the Tennessee Titans (6-8), who will likely be out of playoff contention by then.
The Raiders (7-7) are close to being eliminated from the AFC West race, but they still have a chance to achieve their first winning season since 2002. If the Jaguars take care of business by defeating Washington at home in an early Sunday game, they'll instantly become avid Raiders fans.
The Jaguars still have legitimate playoff hopes. It rests largely with getting help from Del Rio's first NFL love -- the Raiders.

History.
However, a spare unit of the armor is seen in a weapons cache hidden in Manhattan, along with other Goblin gear. It is presumed to be destroyed after the cache was destroyed in an explosion, however it is possible it survived as the armor is quite durable.
Notes
- No special notes.
Trivia
- The Iron Patriot Armor appears to be basically an outdated Iron Man armor that was painted with the colors of Captain America.
- Is suggested that it had similarities with the outdated Iron Man Armor Model 29
- Osborn altered the unibeam from the simple forms Stark use (like a circle or a trapezoid) to a star, reducing the amount of energy released by it making it a much weaker beam.
- On-set images of filming for the 2013 film Iron Man 3 reportedly showed actor James Badge Dale, as Eric Savin, wearing a battlesuit similar to the Iron Patriot armour, but in fact it was a stunt double for actor Don Cheadle. War Machine has been given a new paint job, as evidenced by officially released photos of the armor featuring the name Lt Col James Rhodes printed on the chest.
- In Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes (Animated Series) during a mission in space Captain America wears an armor very similar to the Iron Patriot armor.

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced no new stimulus action last week but said the Fed “will provide additional accommodation as needed” to spur economic growth.
Twice since 2008 the Fed has engaged in quantitative easing, a practice in which the nation’s central bank creates new money to buy financial assets, such as US Treasury bonds, with the goal of driving down interest rates. Lower rates can make borrowing money easier for homeowners and businesses.
But quantitative easing can also promote inflation.
“I think the Fed’s first action in quantitative easing was effective, to a certain degree,” Romney said, referring to the Federal Reserve’s purchase of $1.75 trillion of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities between December 2008 and March 2010. .”
Romney said his economic recovery plan would create 12 million jobs during his first term, a declaration he made for the first time last week.
To achieve Romney’s goal, the economy would have to add an average of 250,000 jobs per month over four years. The economy added 163,000 jobs last month, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report published Friday.
Romney said his growth projection is realistic.

Windows Phone 7
In the past decade the development of mobile devices has dramatically advanced and has become a major trend for competing technology companies. Companies like Microsoft, Apple, IBM, and Dell have spent years laying the groundwork for the latest mobile technologies and continue to impress us all with the progression of their products. Not only have these mobile devices gotten smaller and more portable, but they have also become more powerful and have come pretty close to matching the user experience of a desktop system. Today we rely on these devices for virtually everything from phone calls, texting, shopping, directions, weather, internet, email and more. It is clear that technology plays a powerful role in our life and continues to make our lives more efficient and easier.
Microsoft Mobile Office 2010from 2011
Companies are not only creating new mobile devices but they have also begun to create mobile versions of their primary software applications. The Windows Phone 7 operating system created by Microsoft is doing just that with their integration of Microsoft Office Mobile. Microsoft Office Mobile is a perfect example of how companies are focusing in on the mobile experience and providing a user a similar experience to a desktop environment. While the majority of Windows devices come equipped with Office Mobile, anyone whose Windows phone did not come with Office Mobile pre-installed can purchase and download the software through the Microsoft mobile marketplace. In addition anyone who is using an older version of Office and has a Windows phone that is operating on Windows Mobile 6.5 and above can also upgrade to version 2010 for free.
Small businesses are always on the lookout for a new technology and tools to help them with their day to day operations. Most professional environments utilize Microsoft Office in one form or another whether it is Microsoft Outlook for their Email and scheduling or Microsoft Word for their text editing needs. Given its popularity and the uses of its many programs, Microsoft Office Mobile clearly illustrates the potential value that a mobile software companion can provide to a business and its employees.
The Windows Phone 7 mobile device not only has all of the basic functions of a phone but it also manages to incorporate some of the power of a desktop computer with a few minor exceptions. Microsoft Mobile Office 2010 was released to coincide with the release of Windows Phone 7 and is only available on devices running Windows Mobile 6.5 or later. With these mobile device users can now enjoy a valuable portable alternative to their most employed software applications. By having the Microsoft Office Mobile software installed on the Windows Phone 7, a user can access these programs as needed without being confined to an actual office or having to lug around a laptop. Programs included in the Microsoft Office Mobile 2010 bundle include Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, PowerPoint Mobile, OneNote Mobile, and SharePoint Workspace Mobile.
It is understandable that working with a mobile device doesn’t always translate the same comfort and ease that it would from desktop or laptop computer. The mobile aspect does however provide the necessary convenience but it still does not quite live up to the user experience of the traditional MS Office software. Besides the slight trade off between convenience and usability it is evident that the Microsoft Office Mobile programs manage to capture the basic functions and operations of Microsoft Office. Provided below are some of the basic pros and cons associated with the mobile version of Microsoft Office 2010.
Microsoft Office Mobile PROS:
Microsoft Office Mobile CONS:
In conclusion the basic functions of Microsoft Office remain intact on the Mobile version but as expected the software does not encompass the full power that the traditional version offers. Nonetheless even lacking the usual user experience the mobile version can certainly prove to be an asset to any organization that uses Microsoft Office on a regular basis.
Check out more details and find out how Microsoft Office Mobile can help your business and employees at Microsoft Office Mobile 2010 and How to Buy Microsoft Office Mobile 2010!

Researchers say intervening early during teen years may help to prevent adult problems later
Training teenagers to look at social situations positively could help those with anxiety and may help prevent problems persisting into adult life, new research from Oxford University is beginning to suggest.
The researchers found that tasks designed to prompt either positive or negative interpretations of unclear situations can shift how healthy teenagers think about such events. The approach is called ‘cognitive bias modification of interpretations’ or CBM-I.
Having, have with anxiety are more likely to assume the latter interpretation. These negative thoughts are believed to drive and maintain their feelings of low mood and anxiety. If you can change that negative style of thinking, perhaps you can change mood in anxious teenagers.’
Adolescence appears to be a general period of vulnerability when problems with anxiety and depression can first emerge, and new treatments are needed. Cognitive behaviour therapy, for example, doesn’t work for everyone and it may not be available everywhere.
Estimates vary about prevalence of anxiety among teenagers, but it could be around 10–15%. The teenage years are a period when biological changes coincide with the development of areas of the brain involved in emotional control and with big social changes, such as changing schools and friendship groups, and first romantic interests. Yet despite this, anxiety and depression in adolescents has remained a rather neglected area of study compared with adults.
‘Of course it’s normal for teenagers to be worried about exams, friends, social acceptance, and about the future generally,’ says Dr Lau. ‘But anxiety can become a problem when it becomes persistent or is out of proportion to the situation. For example when someone is doing well at school but still worries all the time and can’t control the worry. In some extreme cases kids avoid going to school because they are anxious. This is not being just a little bit worried.’
Dr Lau and colleagues set out to assess whether simple training tasks carried out at a computer screen can change the reactions teenagers have to imagined social situations, leading them to take either more positive interpretations of the situations or more negative.
Thirty-six healthy teenagers from schools in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire took part in the study, and were randomly allocated to receive training designed to boost positive readings of scenarios or negative readings.
The training consisted of working through a set of short scenarios involving social situations that are familiar – such as reading a comment about your photo on facebook – but ambiguous in how you might respond to them emotionally.
The volunteers then had to complete these ambiguous stories, being prompted to give answers which tended to resolve the situation in either a positive way or a negative way – depending on what type of training they were allocated to in the study.
Following this period of training, the researchers assessed if there was any difference in how likely participants were to rate further scenarios as positive or negative. Volunteers’ mood was also assessed throughout the study.
The researchers found that the training task was able to induce different interpretation biases in the teenagers. Those who received positive training tended to endorse positive readings of the ambiguous scenarios, while those who received the negative training were more likely to view the scenarios more negatively. It suggests that the approach is able to shift teenager’s interpretations of situations, at least in this laboratory setting.
Dr Lau says: ‘Although these results are early, and among a limited number of healthy teenagers, we hope this approach to encourage positive interpretations of events will prove to be a powerful tool. If we are able to intervene early and effectively in teenagers with anxiety, we may be able to prevent later adult problems.
‘The next steps are to give people with high levels of anxiety these training tasks to see if it helps change their mood over significant periods of time.’

Over, ‘super.
Brian John:
May 26, 2013 at 08:37 AM
We have tried to bring this issue to the attention of the supermarket bosses, but they have apparently adopted a "don't look, don't see" strategy. Well, we have to keep on challenging them with their appalling hypocrisy until they hear what we are saying and start to look for themselves into the consequences of their policies. This is also an animal welfare issue -- animals that are forced to consume GMOs suffer harm as a consequence -- the evidence is stacking up on this quite inexorably. Will they persist with this ridiculous cost-cutting policy even though they know full well that the environment is harmed, communities are obliterated by the soya barons, and animal and human health are also harmed? We shall see...........

I always thought m&s were supposed to be the very highest of standards with regards to checking supplier adherence to standards. Very disappointed if they are involved in this as we specifically buy from them on evidence from a friend who profiles organisations based on their ethical approach to food supply.

If glyphosate causes malformations in human, then why have no problems been reported in the US, where glyphosate has been used much longer than in South America? Or, for that matter, in the UK, where is widely used as a weedkiller. This sounds like a scare story to stop South America competing with the US in the annual battle for soya bean exports to S.E. Asia - currently running at $30 billions exported from each region each year.
Bert Schouwenburg:
Jun 17, 2013 at 11:02 AM
I don't know why Mr Wood thinks that no problems have been reported in the USA. The agro-chemical industry spends millions of dollars promoting their noxious chemicals including Glysophate as being safe but a recent report casts doubts upon their claims as reported here:
Magnus Falko:
Aug 30, 2013 at 06:17 AM
Mr. Wood, I agree with Mr Schouwenburg. Please also be aware that other chemicals are being used in the soy fields as well. As this report tells: :
." Endosulphan and cipermetrine is used as well.
Dear Mr Wood, some of these chemicals are so dangerous that they are banned in the European Union – nevertheless, the EU gladly imports the soya.

Food and healing are two areas very much connected. They try to feed us with poisonous food in order to make us ill and after that to take some more money from us by the chemotherapy supported by the Big Pharma mafia. It will be more and more difficult to avoid their actions if we don't have our own plot of land to cultivate healthy crops.Walkthrough Part 1 Intro & Desert Oasis for Monster High 13 Wishes: The Official GameHome / Nintendo Wii /

-)I'm still working on a blog about the recent Grand Opening of Rock & Brews PCH featuring Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, but in the meantime, wanted to share some fun stuff I've been collecting which I thought you might enjoy as well.
First off, if you have a bikini ready body like Volleyball players, Michelle Lafigliola and the entire MCHS champion volleyball team, then check out the new styles from Breathe Bikinis showcased here.
Recognize Olympic Volleyball player, Eric Fonoimoana? He's the only guy in case you don't know.:)
Now if you're looking for some good summer reads while you hit the beach, here's a few famous female memoirs I recently finished which I recommend:
If you've always wondered what it would be like to be married to a famous rocker from the Rolling Stones, then wonder no longer. Her book will tell you all about it.
Lots of drugs, food, and music. Oh, and sex. Don't forget the sex. Oh, and even more drugs. Have to admit, that got a little tedious, but there is a happy ending to that section so keep reading.
All that said, I enjoyed hearing how Jo Wood pulled herself together after her husband's affair with a teenager (is 19 still a teenager? It's been so long I forget.) and created a whole new life for herself.
I also enjoyed learning about her organic business and how that came to be. She's definitely had an interesting life and this sneak peek behind-the-scenes is factual, funny, poignant and entertaining. Now I know why I am drawn to musicians so often.:)
On the flip side, Reba Merrill's book about creating an amazing career launched as an Arizona housewife and building a whole new genre of publicity - video interviews, was extremely interesting, especially as I launch my own video show. She spoke at a recent women's event I attended and was so inspiring I bought her book.
And I never buy books at book signings. Ever.
Seriously.
Her down-to-earth style of sharing about her amazing life interviewing celebrities over the past 20 years was such an easy read I finished it in two days. She dealt with sexism back in the 70's which I wished more young girls would read about to know how far we've come baby. She also dealt with sexual harrassment - promised her show would air if she performed sexual favors three days a week on some studio pig. She also has faced ageism and shared how that influenced her style and offerings. Very interesting book and if you're in the industry especially, you will enjoy her life story.
One of my favorite Real Housewives of New Jersey has also penned a memoir, the fiery redhead, Caroline Manzo, and if you're a fan of the show you will really enjoy this book. Just know the font size is extremely small for some reason making it hard to read at night if you're tired. However, it's very enjoyable and she doles out wisdom, advice, behind-the-scenes anecdotes, Italian recipes, and other information on the show which isn't gossipy, just sharing it like it is.:)
If you're a fan of Carol Burnett, or in the mood for a heartwarming story about the love of a child and their mother, then you must pick up Carol Burnettt's book (seen above) about her relationship with her wild child daughter, Carrie.
Reminded me of a friend of mine's child there was so much creativity and life in her story. It's broken into two parts and tells of Carrie's career aspirations and accomplishments, Carol's life as her mother and famous person, and is poignant, lovely and very easy to read.
However, it does break your heart, but then in Part Two, it lifts you back up by turning into the fictional story Carrie had been writing with Carol before she died.
I really, really, really enjoyed this story on many levels.
First, as a huge fan of the humor and career of Carol Burnett, then as a fan of her relationship with her daughter and lastly, as a fan of good writing. Very thoughtful, lovely story.
Now it can't be all about women, now can it?
In light of the fast approaching Father's Day, here's some fun suggestions on where to take Dad and what to possibly buy him, if he's a sporting kinda Dad, old sport. (Sorry, couldn't resist. The Great Gatsby has GROUND that word into my brain permanently. It's a fantastic film however.:)
Now if you haven’t made your plans for Father’s Day, then consider joining Firefly Bistro for some down-home southern music, fantastic beer and delicious BBQ at the 10th Annual Father’s Day Blues Barbeque at Firefly Bistro!
Here's Chef Paul Rosenbluh, executive chef and founder of Firefly Bistro, who was named Best Chef of America (in the ultimate guide of Chefs.) Now, if that's not an endorsement of driving out to Pasadena for some good 'ole Southern cooking with dear old Dad, I don't know what is!
Let Chef Paul take care of all your Father’s Day needs with Firefly’s homey ambience, southern charm and hearty cuisine perfect for the special BBQ menu.
Can you spell delicious? I knew you could.:)
Now to make sure Dad is looking fine, here's Cash Warren (Jessica Alba's house husband) sporting the Lacoste Corbon suede boat shoe – perfect for all family outings and a great gift for under $100 for dad in time for this Sunday!
Pick up a pair today at
And lastly, don't forget to watch Dexter's summer premiere on June 30th. We won't forget after enjoying this special ice cream treat delivered to the office!:)
Kinda creepy, eh?:) And that's all for now. Enjoy!Source: Anti-Activist Poison Pills by Marcel Kahan, Edward B. Rock :: SSRN

Abstract.. As we show, the various design features of a pill interact and features that may be harmless in pills designed to fend off a hostile takeover are unjustifiable in pills employed against an activist hedge fund. At the same time, we argue that a board, acting in good faith, may choose to use a pill to preserve and perfect the shareholder decision-making process, although, in doing so, it must act as a “neutral election board.”- Shopping Bag ( 0 items )

Lucy Emery has a passion for taking pictures, just like her photographer father. Unlike him, the 12-year-old doesn’t crave living in new places “the way other people crave staying put.” Now he’s moved Lucy and her mother from Massachusetts to a lakeside cottage in New Hampshire, and even before the family has settled, he’s off again on another assignment. Lonesome and eager to prove her skill with a camera, Lucy enters a photography contest that will be judged by her father. The shots she takes of her new environment eloquently track her most significant events over the summer, which include keeping endangered loons safe from harm, finding a friend in next-door neighbor Nate, and sharing his sadness over his grandmother’s slipping memory.. Ages 8–12. Agent: Tracey Adams, Adams Literary. (Mar.)
Overview ...On February 12th, at 5AM, I woke up after only 4 hours of sleep, to take the bus to MDW. After checking I had all the documents I needed, I left towards the bus stop on 55th Street. I caught the 6.30 bus #55, destination Midway Airport. After about 40 minutes, I got to the airport, not before seeing a huge line for security while on the bus, going underneath the walkway where the security line was. Anyway, having arrived at the airport, I needed to print my boarding pass, which I did at one of the self-service check-in desks DL has at MDW. I'm sure not many people (if any) connect in ATL to go to Kansas City, but how, oh how, could I refuse an MD-90, even if I had to wake up at five in the morning? I'm an enthusiast, and if I flew on the MD-90 before, I did so only once... I can't quite remember.
Anyway, the line before security was moving pretty fast, as there were about eight checkpoints you could choose from... But not before encountering an agent to check your ID... Who didn't know a Green Card was a legal form of ID for flying... At least his colleague did... And if not, I had a state-issued ID anyway, so who cares? Still, it's stupid not to know your own rules.
The guys/girls at the checkpoint seemed to care as much about security as a gazelle did about its feature as prey for lions in a prominent National Geographic documentary. At least it meant the checkpoint went quickly, even though it did not at all make me feel any safer.

The main reason for this particular itinerary wa the MD-90. Also, I feared connecting through Minneapolis in February (although I did so coming back) thinking that weather wouldn't be an issue in Atlanta. It wouldn't snow exactly when I'd connect there, would it? Well, actually it could. In fact 70% of flights from/to ATL were cancelled that day... But I wouldn't find that out until later.
Anyway, because gate C1 at MDW does not offer suitable (or any) airport views, I chose gate B1 for my main spotting activity that morning. From this gate I could see RWY 22L, which was in use for Take-offs, with 31C used for landings. Of course I started taking pictures... Some better, some worse... If you find any text in Romanian, I beg your pardon, I had a less textual version of this trip report on a Romanian aviation enthusiast forum.

An MD-90 takeoff from Midway is an unforgettable event for any enthusiast. It was the most powerful takeoff I had the luck of experiencing first hand (that I remember, anyway). It was delightful; the performance of the MD-90 is superb.
I must commend the crew on this flight (ATL-based F/As and Cincinnati based pilots IIRC), one of the best domestic coach cabin crew I have seen. Witty, but not over the top, and helpful throughout the flight.
Anyway... I had no idea what the weather in ATL was like, so I was a bit surprised when the pilots announced that their trip to Midway was very bumpy in its first half, and they expected the same on this flight, due to a very strong storm system. Later on, they came back on and said: "we don't have any information on connections. We know many flights have been cancelled and we hope that none of you were scheduled to fly on these particular flights". I got a bit worried and thought... What is going on in Atlanta? Thunderstorms in February? Well, as I'd find out while walking through ATL, that wasn't it. They were expecting 5 inches of snow... Woooow! That was a shock... 5 inches in Atlanta?

Well, basically on-time, we pushed back from the gate, to depart to MCI. However, snow had already accumulated on the wing (although it started snowing just 45' earlier), so this meant de-icing was necessary. I was surprised at how well ATL handled this, having few days in which winter takes its toll. Of course, having 1/3 of scheduled flights taking off, it means that we saved about 30 minutes while de-icing alone. Overall, it didn't help, as the tower (or ground, more likely) made what our pilot called a "faux pas": they placed an AirTran aircraft for de-icing on a taxiway--in our way! Oh well, I guess they're not used to these conditions. Soon we took off (although it took about 75 minutes from gate to take-off...), and after 1h 41' we touched down in MCI.

Conclusions:
DL has much better service, and the FAs seem much nicer now than say, five years back.
Concourse B at ATL is much improved, looks much nicer now than a while back, I guess ATL leased the gates to DL completely, rather than hold them as common use (that's why I was told they looked shabby before).
Anyway, way to go DL.
I might post the return later (this was via MSP, w/ a D95 and a CR9), with fewer pics and less interesting commentary. I think I have a takeoff and landing video as well, but that might have to wait a little bit, not up on Youtube yet.

To calm the tears and fears of his daughters, Mark Coleman repeats over and over that "Daddy's OK. Daddy's OK," after being defeated by Fedor Emelianenko in the second round of their heavyweight bout at Pride Fighting Championships first U.S. event, "The Real Deal," at the Thomas & Mack Center. When his repeated reassurance that "Daddy's OK, it's all over. It's all over. Daddy's OK. Let's go have some fun now," failed to completely calm the girls, Coleman took them to center ring and introduced them to the man who turned his face into a bloody pulp. Then, after a minute or two of talk, Coleman playfully tagged the Russian champion with light tap to the chin and then raised his arms in victory.(Updated) Changes In New CBA: HGH Testing, Qualifying Offers, Elias Rankings Ditched
According to Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports, baseball’s new collective bargaining agreement is chock full of big changes.
- Major League Baseball will begin testing for human growth hormone (HGH) beginning in February as part of the new collective bargaining agreement. MLB is the first of the four major sports to now employ blood testing of its players. MLB already conducts random testing for HGH in the minor leagues, a program it began last year.
- Commissioner Bud Selig already has. The past rule that teams in the same division can’t play in the Division Series round likely will not be part of the new agreement.
- Under the new CBA, all the current free-agent closers on the market that were previously designated as Type A free agents will no longer cost their new team a first-round draft pick. That means teams can sign Ryan Madson or Francisco Rodriguez without having to forfeit their first-round.
- The new CBA will do away with the Elias Sports Rankings starting next season. Under the new system, the top free agents will be subject to compensation only if their former teams make them qualifying offers off at least $12 million annually or more.
-.
- For international free agents, such as players from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, there will be a separate threshold and tax with penalties, and there will be a study committee that could put a new system in place later during the agreement. A tax of 75 percent to 100 percent will be imposed on the amount a team exceeds a threshold, and teams exceeding the threshold by higher amounts could lose first and second-round draft picks.

More to come…OH MY FREAKIN' WORD........ ok, I don't normally do that, but holy mackerel batman. This recipe is so good, as my husband said "good gosh woman you almost made me cuss" oh yeah, that good!
Yesterday morning I was reading through my blogger and checking in with my foodie pals when the title caught my eye. Bacon Cheeseburger Sloppy Joes, I thought you have got to be kidding me right? OH my, so I hopped over to Bridget's blog to finish reading. I was in the process of making my menu for the week and shopping list. This went straight to the top.
Now mind you, I knew I'd be home alone for dinner but thought ehh if it's not good not one will know and if it is, I have lunch for the next few days.
Good? NO, great? No. FABulous YES.
Our oldest son came home and said "oh man, wow, yum...I may have to have another" Two thumbs up and five gold stars!
I of course did not fix it exactly, because we know I don't follow instructions well, but I was close. Click HERE to read Bridget's blog and see her recipe. I have done several of her's before. She writes What's cooking in the burbs blog. Great ideas, good food and drooling food pictures.
Thank you Bridget for this one!
Bacon Cheeseburger Sloppy Joes
1 lb lean ground beef, browned and drained
1/4 cup water (she used broth)
1 onion soup packet
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
1/3 cup ketchup (I used 5 TBSP)
2 tbsp mustard ( she used Dijon)I used 4 TBSP whole grain mustard
1 garlic clove, minced (forgot to add so I omitted it)
1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (I used a Mexican shred blend)
1 cup cooked crumbled bacon ( bacon bits will work too)I used precooked bacon crumbled up
Brown and drain ground beef. Add remaining ingredients. Stir to combine and simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes. Serve on bakery rolls or hamburger buns. Sprinkle with additional cheddar cheese if desired. Enjoy! I toasted the buns first, sprinkled a little extra cheese and enjoyed this with a small salad and side of green grapes.
Enjoy!
I'm so glad you and your family enjoyed them, Dawn! Thanks for featuring them on your blog! It's funny because I was never a huge fan of Sloppy Joe's until I made them this way. Now I'll never have them any other way! :)
Oh yes we loved them! Thanks for the recipe!!
These caught my attention on her blog, too! They'll be on next week's menu for sure :)
Oh Jamie you won't be sorry! They are ab-so-lutely FABulousThrough online ordering, we connect hungry people with the best local restaurants. Explore restaurants near you to find what you love.

The suit alleges unfair business practices and false advertising. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Southern Division, and has been assigned to Judge Cormac J. Carney.
The suit alleges that Power Balance advertised that “Mylar holograms” at the center of their bracelets were “embedded with frequencies that react positively with a body’s natural energy field.” Power Balance touted that their bracelets would produce “faster synaptic response (brain function), enhanced muscle response (in both fast and slow twitch tissues), increased stamina (better oxygen uptake and recovery), more flexibility (faster recovery) and very improved gravitational balance.”
But upon investigation by Australian authorities, Power Balance ultimately admitted in writing that they had no credible scientific evidence that their bracelets worked, and that it had in fact engaged in misleading conduct in breach of Australian law.
An investigation by the two southern California law firms that filed the suit revealed that Power Balance was engaged in the same misleading trade practices in the United States. The law firms filed the suit hours before the Associated Press published a nationwide story about Power Balance’s admission of having no evidence that their product worked.
It is estimated that in excess of 3 million people were deceived, including numerous high-profile athletes. Information for consumers who purchased Power Balance products will be available on.

Replies to: Waive my right?
My English teacher told me to say yes because that means you trust the recommender. If your teacher sees that you do not waive the right they might not write it because you don't trust them enough to write a recommendation for you.
The issue is that people are more likely to be honest in their evaluations of you if you waive the opportunity to walk into the college's admissions office and demand to see the letters. By law, you have that right. You give it up so that colleges will trust your recommenders' statements.
Please note the waiver does not mean that you cannot see the letters. A recommender can still voluntarily give them to you for your review, comments, or records.
You simply cannot demand to see them as a matter of right.
If you do not waive your rights, then you will be able to see your recommendations AFTER you marticulate from that school, meaning after you graduate from the college to where the letters were sent.
However, if you want to see what your teachers said, you can ask them to send you a copy of the letter before they submit it to common app.
Not quite; you have the right to view your educational records after you enroll in a college or university.
But the main point is, you should waive your right to see your recommendations. There's rarely as much consensus about any topic on CC as there is about this one.
From the Common App Support Team:
"Thank you for contacting the Support Team.
As stated in the FERPA agreement, access to your recommendations will only be granted after you matriculate from the institution to which you end up enrolling in. What that means is that you will be not able to see your recommendations until after you graduate from college.
Again, thank you for contacting us; please do so again if you need additional assistance.

The Support Team" carrier assembly and a method controlling an infant carrier position use a base and a movable trolley mounted to a vehicle in a rearwardly facing direction. An infant carrier is detachably mounted to the trolley. The trolley is movable so that the carrier is movable between two reclined positions, 58.degree. and 49.degree. from the vertical to the infant carrier seatback. A sacrificial link and springs connect the trolley to the base to limit the movement between the two positions. During a front collision, e.g., when 1 or more G-force is created, the sacrificial link breaks away to release the trolley/carrier from the reclined positions to an upright position, where the carrier seatback can be upright up to about 15% (14.degree.) from the vertical.Vincent B.

Fontaine Ravine Viaduct
Viaduc Fontaine Ravine
La Chaloupe St-Leu, Réunion Island, France
361 feet high / 110 meters high
558 foot span / 170 meter span
2009
The Ravine Fontaine is one of 4 high bridges on the recently constructed Route de Tamarins highway. Réunion Island is a French territory located east of Madagascar Island in the Indian Ocean. Just 35 miles (56 kms) across, the region has become a popular tourist getaway as well as a permanent home to more than 800,000 residents. Crossing dozens of huge ravines, the new route also required the construction of 3 tunnels and 9 interchanges. Second in height to the Grande Ravine bridge, the Ravine Fontaine is a rare steel arch bridge with inclined spandrels that give it a sunburst profile.
The Fontaine bridge has a dynamic, multidimensional shape that comes from a box beam arch rib that is deeper than it is wide at the foundation, only to flatten out as it rises to the crown. This is the inverse of the famous truss-arch rib on Eiffel’s Garabit Viaduct. To construct the Ravine Fontaine bridge over the deep gorge, the roadway and support spandrels were built outward at the same time as the arch, eliminating the need for a highline. To prevent the two halves of the arch from falling into the gorge, several cables were attached from the road deck down to the arch within each spandrel panel. When the next vertical spandrel support was built up to deck level and connected to another short span of roadway, the arch rib was built out a little further and the process repeated itself. Once the two sides of the arch were closed in the middle, the temporary cable stays were all removed from inside the spandrel panels.Guys flirt in many different ways, some guys are touchy feely, some just constantly make jokes, so like to talk about how tough they are. I'm a little too shy for those approaches, so I've figured out the perfect strategy for instantly winning a girl over. It's a process, so it takes time, but it's so far been effective. I'm even in this process with two girls at work.
As we've learned, I'm not the type who can walk up and get a number on the spot, some guys have the charm, or body, to overcome the creepiness of that strategy, I don't. Just like all strategies it's important to pick one that fits your strengths and weakness. My strengths almost all reside on or in my head. I don't have the hottest body, genes have decided I should remain a bit skinny, so I don't have those huge muscles the ladies love. I do have cool blue eyes, boyish good-looks, and,what many women over the years have said is my most irresistible trait, dimples.
I'm a shy person, I'm not a smooth-talker from the get-go, I like to learn things before initiating a conversation, or allow the conversation to come to me. At work, finding opportunities to talk or learn anything about an attractive girl is a bit tough.
Like I said, this is a process. I like to start out by smiling as soon as we make eye contact. For some reason girls are totally drawn in by this move. I let this continue for a few days, then I go to the "Hey, I recognize you!" wave along with the smile. Then finally finding an opportunity to pass in close enough proximity to get a "Hi!" in.
Wow, I sound like a 6th grader dealing with his first crush now that I see this in writing, surprisingly, it's totally working. The final phase is sealing the deal and opening a dialogue.
How do I plan to do this? Easy, girls love compliments, and now that she recognizes me whenever we cross paths I won't seem like I've been scouting her out. Even though I may or may not have been...
6 comments:
i can totally see how that would work. not all girls responding to the flexing braggarts.
Yeah, I'd be kind of freaked out if some random guy just came up to me and asked for my number- "Who IS this guy?!" Your way gets around that :)
I think this is a flippin good idea! Too bad i'm a girl and I don't know too many guys to work it on... haha oh well! I think it's a fabulous idea!
Thanks! There are some guys who just have the gift of gab, who have the guts to go up and start a conversation and walk away with a phone number, I am not one of those guys so I have to use the tools I've got!
It's really a crying shame that you're anonymous...you're exactly my type. Oh and you have freaking good taste in music.

It just built a 62,000 square-foot showroom alongside a 65,000 square-foot service facility with loads of added conveniences.
"What continues to make the biggest impression on all of our guests, however, is the digital technology," said Kim McKay, Customer Relations Manager at Camelback. A state-of-the-art digital signage network from Unified Brand and Scala is one of the major components of the 22-year-old facility's complete makeover.
The goal of building this showroom was to create an environment that does not resemble a car dealership. The new facility is equipped with high-end amenities, including free Wi-Fi, a cafe, high-tech media room, kids' play area, outdoor patio and massage area with in-chair TVs. Accordingly, Camelback did an in-depth search to find a sophisticated digital signage network that would be able to match all of its other 5-star improvements.
The quest for the right vendor led Camelback Toyota to Unified Brand, which developed a digital network that offers custom content and a high-end brand experience. As a full-service media agency, Unified Brand has the compatibility to create, distribute and manage all content. Using Scala 5 Content Manager and Player software, Camelback Toyota runs rotating images of famous people, motivational quotes and custom-written "thoughts of the day" to motivate and entertain customers and employees.
The new digital signage system includes:
Seven unique channels playing a mix of custom HD content and real-time news such as stock prices, sports scores and business news; 45 Samsung HD screens scattered throughout the showroom, lounge, four-bay service area, cafe, new car delivery area, and parts and accessories department; Two jumbo HD TVs mounted on a column 25 feet in the air; Custom-built PCs Control 4 Systems to change channels and switch to live TV; and Library of dealership-specific content.
In addition to the expansive fleet of flat-screen TVs that display Camelback's custom content, a movie-theater sized high-definition projector screen dominates one wall of the dealership, giving the lobby the look and feel of a grand hotel. New financing deals, car accessory upgrades, service discounts, manufacturer's specials and other promotions constantly rotate on Camelback's network of screens to up-sell customers while still providing entertainment.
Camelback Toyota also uses the Scala system to run an ad in Unified Brand's local community network of signs, helping to draw new customers to the dealership.
"We wholeheartedly recommend this system and the providers behind it to anyone. We have extremely high standards, but Scala and Unified Brand met them," McKay said. They were great, and have continued to provide amazing service - even months later, as we continue to explore all of the possibilities of our new digital network."

Cleveland Indians OF David Murphy will serve as the designated hitter Saturday, May 16, against the Texas Rangers, and hit fourth in the batting order.
Fantasy Tip: Murphy ($1,900, 3.8% of cap) is hitting .297 against right-handed pitching this season, and he will be up against Rangers RHP Colby Lewis Saturday. Murphy is 7-for-his-last-14 plate appearances, and FantasyScore owners can easily fit him under the cap.

Cleveland Indians OF David Murphy will start in right field and bat fifth in the order Sunday, May 10, against the Minnesota Twins. OF Brandon Moss comes out of the starting lineup.
Fantasy Tip: Murphy ($1,900, 3.8% of cap) draws the start against the Twins right-handed started Trevor May. With a career .277 average against righties, Murphy is worth consideration on FantasyScore.
Thu, 07 May 2015 10:06:45 -0700
Cleveland Indians 1B Nick Swisher is out of the starting lineup Thursday, May 7. OF David Murphy is serving as the designated hitter and batting sixth in the order against Kansas City Royals SP Edinson Volquez.
Fantasy Tip: Swisher just returned from the DL this week, so the Tribe is likely to ease him back into regular playing time. Murphy ($1,900, 3.8% of cap) often starts against righties, but his at-bats may be tough to come by now that Swisher is back. Murphy is a disappointing .240 (12-for-50) against righties this year, and Volquez has been strong in his new digs in KC. Look to avoid Murphy today.

Fantasy Tip: Murphy ($1,900, 3.8% of cap) is a matchup play worth considering tonight at FantasyScore. Murphy hit .268 with seven of his eight long balls against right-handed pitching in 2014 in 336 at-bats. Ignore the fact that he's hitless in just six at-bats in his career against Pelfrey.

Cleveland Indians OF David Murphy is starting in left field and hitting seventh in the lineup against Houston Astros SP Asher Wojciechowski Thursday, April 9.
Fantasy Tip: Murphy ($3,000, 6.0% of cap) is a cheap FantasyScore option that should be considered as he goes up against a pitcher making his major league debut. Murphy hit .268 with seven of his eight home runs in 2014 against right-handers.

Cleveland Indians OF David Murphy (ankle) missed his third consecutive Cactus League spring game Monday, March 23, due to the twisted ankle he suffered in a game Friday, March 20. Murphy said if it were the regular season he could have played.
Fantasy Tip: The Indians are taking it easy with Murphy, and this injury isn't something expected to hinder him into the regular season. He is worth a late-round flier in AL-only leagues as a reserve outfielder/utility option..

Airtel has just 25% of the combined unit. MTN is the largest operation in Ghana, with Vodafone at number two. A combination of Airtel and Millicom – which trades under the Tigo brand – would have a larger market share than Vodafone. Airtel lost $91 million on its African operations in the most recent quarter, with income of $900 million, compared with a loss of $170 million in the equivalent quarter a year ago. Millicom is due to give its results for the last quarter of 2016 and for the full year on 8 February. In 2015, Millicom generated revenue of $6.73 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $2.27 billion.$179.99
19 inch CGA-EGA-VGA-SVGA LCD arcade monitor
Quantity Left: 0
Hello all,
I have a 10 year old Wells Gardner 27" D9200 monitor that is connected to an AVGA card of the same age. This setup has been rock solid since completing my arcade machine in 2007.
Recently I noticed a very subtle horizontal waving motion (not a line, just movement/oscillation) that is visible in all of the AVGA resolutions I tested except one; interesting, 288 X 264 did not appear to demonstrate this issue....not sure if that's relevant. Also, the wave appears to change speed (not sure if that's the best word for it; perhaps frequency is better) at different resolutions.
I've tried simple things like degausing, checking to ensure the AVGA card is properly seating in the computer, checking the monitor cable, etc. The most common advice I get is to CAP the monitor; which, given it's age, is probably good advice. However, I thought I'd post here to see if anyone might have any other trouble-shooting tips I could perform, before going the CAP kit route.
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
G.
Did you try connecting a laptop to it? Its weird it works on one resolution fine and not the others. If it still doesn't work with a laptop maybe just try changing all the caps in the power supply section on the monitor.The University of Mary Washington’s Writing Center seeks to enhance and support high quality education through engaged tutorials, workshops, and community outreach.

Re: "Military to spend $1 billion on armed drones for Arctic patrols," Aug. 7.
During a financial downturn, Prime Minister Stephen Harper is committing Canadians to paying $1 billion for armed drones.
It doesn't matter that Canadians were not consulted on this and likely would not approve such a move, but Harper goes ahead anyway.
Armed drones are being used to kill people daily in the Middle East and now we will be paying for drones in our own skies. That sure sounds like democracy in action.

All Destinations > Terceira holidays
Azores is a much in demand destination which has been over looked for a long time. Its secluded location and unspoilt beauty is attracting the tourist from all over the world and tourism is fast replacing the other forms of mainstay industries. Terceira holidays thus promise to be exploring and serene. In fact the admixtured Portuguese and French culture give a new dimension to the holidays to Terceira (Azores) with all its architecture, festivities and religious practices.
Being a part of Azores archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, Terceira holidays are usually an important destination of Azores itinerary. With an area of 396.75 square km and a population density of 140.73/square km, Terceira is fairly isolated and much of the land is a natural reserve. With undulating terrain, the island is a nice place for hiking and walking during Terceira holidays. For the brave hearts and culture freaks, Terceira conducts more than 230 traditional bullfights around the year out of which most notable is the ‘running of the bull’ or the ‘touradas a corda’I. The bull is set free and runs through the town and people try to get as close to this maddening bull as possible. Afterwards the bull is taken back and outdoor festivals begin. Terceira and other islands of Azores, alond with the Lisbon coast, Madeira and Algarve are top spots for your Portugal holidays
During Terceira holidays one can witness the well preserved traditions and practises in the many festivals, cuisines and architecture of the land. Terceira is to Azores of Portugal what Crete is to Greece. Holidays to Terceira offer umpteen opportunities in water-sports and hiking as well.
For long the Azores were the isolated islands with frequent earthquakes and volcano eruptions. However with Portuguese immigrants, agriculture due to the highly fertile volcanic sand flourished and export of wheat, sugar cane, oranges and dyes became the main stay of the islands. French immigrants brought the fine dining and wining legacy with them. Terceira holidays will surely bring you close to the place’s history with its old architecture and practices.
The strongest culture comes from the Portuguese as they were the first inhabitants of the land. Later with French influences, fighting off the pirates and whale hunting became popular. Today Terceira culture is a mix of agriculture, whaling, military and winery. Most of the people are Roman Catholics and most of the festivals are religious. Understanding the need of surviving through climatic adversities; Azoreans have a strange sense of independence and responsibility and band up very easily. Viola is a traditional instrument Azoreans love to play.After countless opinion polls trying to predict what voters will do on Nov. 7 (here and here), we’re just hours away from the opening of the only polls that count.
To ensure that your vote is counted, please heed Sunnyland Slim’s advice and “be careful how you vote.” And know your rights.
Tomorrow I’ll be in DC, where I’ll be blogging live from the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation’s War Room. National black leaders, political analysts and voting rights experts, including Clayola Brown, Unity '06 Convener Melanie Campbell, Dr. Joe Leonard, Marc Morial, Prof. Charles Ogletree, Dr. Ron Walters and Reg Weaver will track in real-time what's happening on the ground.
They will provide reports on black voter turnout and their voting experiences (read: voting while black) in key states, including Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virgina.
So, we will tell our story. At the same time if folks get stupid (here and here), we’ll run and tell everyone we know.

You may receive up to $5,250.00 in tax free education benefits from your employer each year. This is for USA only
Not Just For Dishes – Use about a teaspoon of liquid dish soap in your top-loading washing machine to clean your clothes. Its cheaper with fewer chemicals.
Make your own – I am A Google fan big time – go to Google to get the recipes for all detergent. The most common ingredients are usually Borax and Fels-naptha soap. A batch will cost you pennies in the dollar and worth the effort.
Pot scrubbers – Now I am sure most of you reading this will probably think “I don’t think so”. But if you are in a situation that you are struggling financially and every dollar counts, (watching Varney on Fox tells me that there are hundreds of thousands in this position) this is a great idea. Dont go buying the steel wool pads or any pot scrubbers just save the plastic mesh bags you get with your fruit and veg’s. Remove the labels and staples and tie in a knot, does a great job.
Save Your Shoes – Moisture from perspiration or mud puddles is tougher on the leather than pounding the pavement. If shoes get wet, stuff crumpled newspaper into them to wick up moisture. Another suggestion is to put a charcoal briquette into a sock and put that in the shoe overnight to both absorb wetness and eliminate odor.
I am a great fan of natural lemon grass oil. Put a few drops of lemon grass oil on the crumpled paper or the charcoal briquette that you put into the shoe. This oil will give the shoe that nice fresh smell and help take away that sweaty moldy smell.

Encountering and learning spaces, hospitals and retirement homes are spaces where a human being is in the centre of everything.
Vallila has many decades of experience and
know-how in the interior design of public premises, such as hospitals and
schools, as well as experience in being a business partner to municipalities.We have an extensive understanding about
the interior design and the relevant special requirements of municipal estates,
such as hospitals, nursing homes, care institutions, schools, and even
kindergartens.With regard to hospital interiors and
textiles in particular, special consideration is given to safety, such as fire
safety and antibacterial characteristics. Sometimes, there is also a need for
acoustic characteristics. Hospital fabrics must be of high quality to be able
to withstand use, and to remain in working order, and not to cause allergic
reactions. Bioactive fabrics also use technology that destroys bacteria. As far
as the colour palette is concerned, we aim to use soft and calming colours in
hospitals. Blue and green have a calming effect, while yellow is cheerful.
Monochrome fabrics are common, but some patterns are also used to a suitable
extent. Through the brands Vallila represents, some Finnish hospitals have been
furnished with fabrics from Création Baumann and Drapilux, and
wallpapers and carpets from Vescom. You can also get M1 category
wallpapers and carpets through us.In turn, the interior design of nursing
homes and care facilities pay attention to the easy care, fire safety,
acoustics and colours of the materials. With acoustic fabrics, it is possible
to adjust the echoes and sound volume of a room, and make conversations and
hearing easier. Dim out curtains help to dim excessively bright light which can
be annoying and cause uncertainty. Many elderly people have weak eyesight, so
contrasts between the darkness and brightness of surfaces help to perceive the
environment better. Colours can also influence the well-being and comfort of
the elderly. Different colours are used in different rooms: blue for
relaxation, or green for calming.School décor is determined by the
durability, fire safety, acoustics and price of the materials. At Vallila, we
can find the best solutions for combining these aspects. Colours are also taken
into consideration in the design process, as they affect people's alertness and
mood, and consequently also learning. The colour choices are often intertwined
with the architecture of a building, and its fixtures, for example. The
materials must be fire-resistant, washable, and durable. Such materials are
provided by Delius, Drapilux, Création Baumann and Vescom,
for example.The interior decoration of kindergartens is
based on functionality, durability, colours, fire safety, acoustics, and the
right price. Clients generally want to make the kindergarten environment cosy
and stimulating. It must be functional and nice for children and employees
alike. Bright, cheerful colours and patterns familiar to children are often
used in kindergartens. The materials must be durable and easy to care for, but
they must also feel nice. The fabrics must be fire-resistant. Furthermore, the
colours and other substances used in the materials must be safe and non-toxic,
because children tend to touch materials differently than adults do, sometimes
even tasting them.·Textiles, upholstery and

Spencer was fined $25,000 and suspended from participating in the truck race Wednesday night, the Busch Series race Friday night and the Winston Cup race Saturday at Bristol Motor Speedway.
The National Stock Car Commission, which generally rubber-stamps NASCAR rulings, upheld the suspension Wednesday morning, making Spencer the first driver in at least 30 years to be sent home for fighting.
Michael Waltrip drew a fine for slugging Lake Speed at Michigan after a race in 1995, but he wasn't suspended. Elton Sawyer punched Ryan Newman in 2001 after a Busch Series race, and he wasn't suspended. Tony Stewart was fined last year for striking a photographer in the garage area at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, but he wasn't suspended. And who will ever forget the melee in the third turn after the 1979 Daytona 500 when Bobby and Donnie Allison fought with Cale Yarborough? None of them were suspended, even after their fracas was captured live by CBS Sports cameras.
''I know other people have punched (someone) before and they haven't missed races,'' said driver Ward Burton.
The commission listened to Spencer's side of the story Wednesday and, as expected, sided with NASCAR. This despite hearing some compelling information that Spencer probably didn't initiate the latest skirmish with the talented, yet temperamental, Busch.
A transcript of a two-way radio conversation Busch had with his pit crew during the race indicates Busch was purposely trying to give Spencer a flat tire by hitting him on the track.
Spencer's crew heard the chatter on their radios, so he was on the lookout for trouble. Whether Busch was seriousdoesn't matter, because there was contact between the two when Busch passed Spencer for the lead with 50 laps to go in the race.
''I was trying to flatten the 7 car (Spencer) fender and I got mine,'' Busch told his team during the race. ''I needed to be further forward on his car.''
His crew responded by saying, ''They just showed that on TV. You just missed by an inch or two. Ah, not far enough forward.''
Said Busch, ''Inches only count unless you're playing horseshoes and hand grenades. Ah, I don't want to play either with that clown.''
Jim Smith, Spencer's car owner, defended his driver, saying, ''(Busch) said it, and it proves he was trying to get into Jimmy. Kurt Busch has been saying all week that Jimmy started this, but we all know what was going on.''
Essentially, Spencer's version that Busch took the first swing by using his 3,400-pound race car during the race didn't matter to NASCAR.Deploying Application Express on the Command LinePosted: May 24, 2013 Filed under: Uncategorized Leave a comment

Canonical Neglects Tomboy (Mono)
Summary: Ubuntu One stops support of Tomboy, a notorious application best known for its pulling of Mono into numerous distributions of GNU/Linux
Based on the news from FOSDEM, Xamarin‘s Mono is rapidly collapsing. In Techrights, a prominent and longtime opponent of Mono, someone recently showed us reports about people losing data due to Ubuntu One-Tomboy connectivity.
This thread is located here and it says “tomboy deleted all my notes after last synchronisation. Something to do with ubuntu one dropping support. I’m mad as hell, somebody should have told us, my last backup was a month ago, I’ve just lost a pile of information.”
The person who brought this to our attention noted, “C# / Mono is garbage. There is also the bad design on top of the bad language which follows from importing the Microsoft mindset.”
The pulling of Tomboy support is also corroborated here:
Ubuntu One discontinues support to Tomboy.
Over time we see fewer and fewer cases of support for Mono. █

Mono was marketed, disingenuously I believe, as a means to bring people and products off of M$ Windows. That was the official story. The reality, which many warned of in advance, was that it was instead used to infect and subvert many open source projects and bring dependence on M$ technology to these otherwise Free projects. Good riddance to mono, its removal can’t happen fast enough.
Too bad that end user got stung. There were two mistakes. One was not making backups often enough. The other was not looking out for hamfisted M$-style maneuvers. When a project is afflicted with the M$ way of thinking, the users will get stung. It’s just a matter of time.

I just am soooo psyched to get this dream dress for my BMs- they all love it and are psyched to wear it again as a wedding guest. It’s so perfect for our garden party! Weeeeeeeee!!!
Know Your Kale Variety
Curly Kale
Curly is the most common variety of kale and may even be found in mainstream supermarkets or on salad bars (though possibly as the garnish). Curly kale forms in large broad leaves with kinked and curly edges. Varieties of curly kale can range in color from a light green to a dark purple, though most common is a dark green leaf. Colored kale leaves are often used as ornament or garnish, though they are perfectly edible.
Nero Kale | Lacinato Kale | Tuscan Kale | Black Palm | Dinosaur
Identifiable by its oblong shape and deep green bubbly leaves. This variety hails from Italy, and grows in tall long stalks. Ideal Nero leaves are under 18 inches, too much longer and leaves will be bitter.
Red Winter Kale | Red Russian Kale
Red winter kale leaves resemble oak leaves with their soft sage color with red vining. Red Winter Kale is mild and may have hints of sweet. When cooked, the green and red color in the leaves intensify, for a bold rich red and green palette.Species: Human

Return of the Jedi
A childdealer Watto. While in Watto's employ, Anakin learned valuable mechanical and technical skills. He earned the reputation of being able to fix anything. So technicaly inclined was he that at the young age of nine, he cobbled together a working protocol droid -- C-3PO -- to help his mother. Skywalker.
History is spotty as to the events that followed this fateful development. As turmoil engulfed the galaxy during the transition from Republic to Empire, Anakin fell to the dark side of the Force. Consumed by evil, Anakin abandoned his past and his humanity. He became Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, apprentice to the evil Emperor Palpatine.
Sustaining greivous injuries at the hands of his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Vader required cybernetic enhancements and replacements to sustain him. His pure innocent self seemingly lost forever, Darth Vader cast a dark pall over the galaxy, as he was one of the foremost agents responsible for the elimination of the Jedi order.
But Obi-Wan survived long enough to begin the training of Luke Skywalker -- Anakin's son -- in the path of the Jedi. The young Skywalker sought to turn his father away from the grip of the dark side. In the end, Luke stirred the spirit of Anakin that dwelled deep within the black armor, and Anakin turned against his master. Anakin killed Emperor Palpatine, but was mortally wounded in the attempt.. His spectral form looked upon his two children -- the twins Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa -- during the celebration at Endor.

The game company’s PC console will be skipping AMD in favor of Intel CPUs and Titan GPUs in its first batch of devices sent out to beta testers.
Valve’s Steam Machines — not to be confused with the third-party Xi3 Piston Steam Box — will be shipping out to 300 lucky beta testers without AMD hardware inside.
According to a blog post by Valve, the Steam Machines will come in a variety of configurations depending on the desired price point: i7-4770, i5-4570, and i3 CPUs are available along with GTX780, GTX760, and GTX660 GPUs.
Considering that gaming is such a big push for AMD at the moment, and company representatives are highlighting AMD’s strong alliances with developers, it’s interesting that a major player in PC gaming chose to shun the #redteam for the first batch of what’s sure to be a major success in the PC gaming ecosystem.
Nvidia has been quoted by PC Magazine saying “It is no secret that we have been working with Valve on their upcoming SteamOS and that we are huge fans of the living room PC concept.”
It could very well be that Nvidia is paying handsomely for this privilege of being the sole provider of GPUs, so far, for the Steam’s PC console.
But consider what AMD’s Ritche Corpus, the company’s director of software alliances and developer relations, said during #gpu14 in Hawaii: “We are working just as closely with Valve. I think the difference is one side of that conversation is being more vocal than the other. If you go to Valve right now and ask them which hardware partners are going to be the partner of choice, they won’t pick one or the other. They are going to be agnostic. They mention that it’s an open ecosystem.”
As the official release date for the Steam Machines get closer, more details on the hardware loadouts will be available.
Valve has yet to release pricing details for the Steam Machines.Text Size: Small Text Medium Text Large Text

The Casio Exilim EX-ZR100 is a mid-cost digital camera, a flagship offering. Casio promotes the EX-ZR100 as offering more features than you might expect from such a small design. The Exilim Engine HS (with dual core processors) allows for high-speed shooting (.37 second shot-to-shot time, thanks to its continuous shutter feature), as well as high-speed image processing. This engine is also capable of facilitating slow-motion video recording. The Exilim EX-ZR100's 24-300mm lens is wide-angle (and can be extended up to 600mm with Casio's High-speed SR zoom technology). This camera features a 12.1 megapixel back-illuminated CMOS sensor with shift stabilization, which helps to ensure high-resolution images with low noise, even in dimly lit environments. This sensor also helps to reduce the blur associated with hand movement. The Exilim EX-ZR100 can capture 1920x1080 full HD video at 30 frames-per-second (fps) with continuous auto focus. This camera gives you the option of leveraging its full optical zoom and capture digital still images with high-speed burst shooting at 10MP while recording video. With burst shooting, you can capture thirty 10MP images at a maximum speed of forty shots per second. This model differs from the lower cost Exilim ZR-10 model in that the Exilim ZR-10 has a 7x optical zoom that can be extended up to 14x (whereas the Exilim EX-ZR100 has a 12.5x optical zoom that can be extended up to 25x), has a 28mm wide-angle lens, and lacks the EX-ZR100's Prerecord CS feature (which starts shooting video before you have fully pressed the shutter button, saving them to a continuously refreshed buffer). The Casio Exilim EX-ZR100 has a three inch LCD display on which all photos and video can be reviewed.

"Medal Of Honor Recipient’s Father: Bush Must Sign The GI Bill If He Wants To Show Appreciation For Troops".?
Transcript:
I want to appreciate, I want you to know that we appreciate all memorials, the gifts, the special attention that we’ve been given since Ross died. It has helped enormously with our grief process. But I feel there is somebody else out there that’s much more important than Romayne and I, and that’s the troops that are still active. Most of these men and women are very young, they’re a long ways from home, they’re afraid sometimes of the things they’re going to be called on to do, and so they need our support. They need to know that what they’re doing is appreciated by the people back home. They all experience home sickness. They miss the comforts that they’ve had, that they’ve given up, to do what they have to do. So I think it’s important that we show them our appreciation by sending them gifts, letters, and things like that that would remind them that they are appreciated and that they will be welcomed when they come home.
We’ve had the support of hundreds and hundreds of people — family, friends, and strangers that have helped us deal with what we had to go through. And this is a good thing. But our troops when they get home also need our support. They put their lives on the line for us, sometimes for four years, sometimes for two years, sometimes for 20 years. But when they get home, they also need our support. And many of these people were very young when they left home, they put aside their education and went into the service because it’s young people that make up the active army and really do the fighting for us. So we owe them an ability to be able to return home and become a productive part of their society..Tarpeena Weather

Topic: divine diptychs
Left: Kerrie
Right: Me
This week was a bit crazy for me, coming in late on the themes as I was on my road trip for the past three weeks.
I was a bit stumped initially on what to do for the theme of artificial, but I decided the blue wig I bought at a theatre's garage sale a few months ago would do nicely as a blatantly artificial subject.
All I knew about Kerrie's image before shooting mine was that she had already taken it, it was portrait format, and that it was on the desaturated end of things, which I totally forgot about when shooting my image, as you might be able to tell by the vibrant blue of the wig...
I love Kerrie's image and her concept for the theme, and despite my initial concern that my image was over-simplified by comparison, I think the two images end up working quite well together, especially as we're both totally 'armless ;o)
I'm loving catching up with everyone's creativity in my absence; and with the wonderful themes provided by rowandevoe for Week 7 I'm sure there'll be some brilliant pairings to come!
Meanwhile, I've finally finished importing and sorting the 11GB+ of images I took on my travels, and will hopefully get to some editing and posting this week.
Have missed everyone terribly, and hope you've all been looking after yourselves!

code overhall that I created out of necessity. I
renamed the module and files to avoid conflict with
previous work. I took care of most bugs (that I could
decifer) and integrated the active patches. Notably, I
have a number of tasks that read spreadsheets as
associated arrays (hashes) in Perl, so I added an
object to do that here. Also, if a filename is given to
the class constructor it will connect to that file
without having to make a second read. The included demo
and testcase.xls work for me and provide fairly clear
examples of formats and objects. Changes include:
* Modelled moreso after Perl Excel Parse/Write modules
* Added Parse_Excel_Spreadsheet object
+ Reads whole worksheet as row,column array or as
+ hash of indexed rows and named column fields
* Added variables for worksheet indexes and names
* Added an object call for loading individual woorksheets
* Changed default indexing defaults to 0 based arrays
* Fixed date/time and percent formats
* Includes patches found at SourceForge...
+ unicode patch by nobody
+ unpack("d") machine depedency patch by matchy
+ boundsheet utf16 patch by bjaenichen
* Renamed functions for shorter names
* General code cleanup, including <80 column width
* Included a testcase Excel file and PHP example calls
* Code works for PHP 5.x
Hope others find this useful,

Excel Spreadshheet Parser ZipiPhone 5? That’s so last season!
Apple will release three upgraded iPhones by the end of the year — despite launching its latest model just four months ago — tech analysts and Chinese newspapers report.
Two of the new models — the iPhone 5S and a first-of-its-kind low-budget iPhone — are due out by June, according to the China Times.
The third device, a larger-screened iPhone 6 with a 12-pixel camera, could be available by Christmas, analysts say.
The business move may be coming because Apple is feeling demand from folks who can’t afford smartphones, Wall Street tech market analyst Peter Misek told The Post. He also said the Samsung-style look of a big screen is gaining popularity. “A large percent of the population wants bigger screens — so there’s a demand for that and it’s hurting them,” Misek said.
Misek — who correctly predicted past iPhone features— said he is “confident” that the iPhone 5s will have an 8-megapixel camera and will hit shops by June. He also said the company’s “affordable” $250 iPhone will be heavier and made of polycarbonate material. The iPhone 6 will likely feature a 4.8 inch screen, he said.
The move is unusual for Apple, which has in the past released only one iPhone per year.
Natalie Harrison, a spokeswoman for Apple, refused to offer details about any in-the-works products.No idea where it is? Neither have I. But last night’s Autumnwatch, added to the recent Tanzanian revelation, convinces me that Africa is the place to go to support our beleaguered wildlife. The Senegalese actually seemed to be able to tolerate the ospreys taking their share of a swamp’s bounty.
Could it be that they’re showing more generosity than us North Europeans? Certainly more than our compatriots who would happily shoot cormorants merely for being better anglers. And centuries ahead of the dismal Mediterraneans, who would shoot anything that flies.The professionals at the ASPCA® often find inspiring ideas for animals in unexpected places. So when the ASPCA's Humane Law Enforcement (HLE) Department cleared its building's basement level to make space for HLE Agents to work out and stay in shape, a new idea for the ASPCA's headquarters was born and made into a reality—thanks to the contributions of a generous group of donors.
Monster Park, a 2,000-square-foot exercise, play and training area for the ASPCA's shelter dogs, was recently unveiled in a ribbon-cutting in the ASPCA headquarters' sub-cellar. This large indoor running and exercise space provides these dogs with extra opportunities to stretch, exercise, socialize and receive enrichment training, and it is available around the clock. Many of the ASPCA's dogs are large breeds, some of whom have experienced abuse or neglect. For these dogs in particular, extra attention from trainers and room to romp is essential to helping them reach their potential as well-socialized pets.
Like the ASPCA's adoption facility two levels above it, Monster Park is a state-of-the-art space, featuring light boxes along the walls to simulate natural light; cushioned epoxy terrazzo floors to keep the running surface warm, dry and comfortable; acoustic tile ceilings for soundproofing; and a new heating and ventilation system for climate and odor control.
This project, of course, didn't happen without the support of several major contributors. The project's underwriting donor is the David Merin Foundation and the Park is named for Mr. Merin's beloved late dog, Monster. A contribution from Ms. Lois Collier (in memory of her late husband, Reginald Collier) provided the additional funds needed to make Monster Park a reality. For more information on how you can become a major donor to similar projects and initiatives at the ASPCA, please contact Jaime-Faye Bean at (212) 876-7700, ext. 4506, or by email at [email protected].How is good or best practice assessment in inclusive classrooms organised?
It focuses on the certain needs of the pupil, such as for instance individual orientation in studies. By that I mean that a pupil who can’t write much gets a multiple choice examination and extended time, or an oral exam. It must be constant, analytical, diverse, it must be connected to the teaching, and be of benefit to the pupil. By that I mean that the pupil learns through the assessment. He or she sees what he/she is doing well, and also the factors that must be improved, and perhaps the way that he/she can go about doing so. Study assessment must help the pupil to take responsibility for their own studies, and to motivate them. In addition bonds with the parents must be established, so that they can monitor, and promote the child’s better performance and well-being, by creating the right conditions for study at home. M.
In relation to what the role of the mainstream class teacher is in initial SEN assessments and diagnosis, the mainstream class teacher is usually the person who calls for a internal or external (as related to the school) specialist such as a special educational teacher, speech therapist or psychologist to formally assess or diagnose, regarding special needs. The role of the mainstream teacher is to participate with all relevant information concerning the student, to keep a record of all work/assessment done and implement changes, if any, that the teacher, parents or the specialist recommend following the formal diagnosis.
Procedures and flexibility.
N was given individual oriented studies, and the results were assessed as he went along, using diverse methods. Conventional final assessment and ordinary examinations on paper were only partially used. “When I look back, I feel that the school normally chose the methods, but the school was very receptive to suggestions from parents. I don’t remember suggesting anything without it leading to the test being adapted to N’s needs. Adapted so that he could answer with his eyes, so the tests had to be yes and no questions, or a choice between statements. One thing comes to mind, the setting of objectives in the pupil’s studies, collaboratively by the teacher, parents and child. I felt it was most effective when that went together. I never had any other feeling than that there was a lot of flexibility, and all options would be tried, in order to meet the need. N didn’t take the national examinations, which made the process rather easier. M
In D’s case, continuous assessment is used, whereby the teacher assesses whether objectives have been achieved. Ordinary examinations are also adapted so that D can answer using a laser pointer or other methods which he can manage. The examinations are read aloud to him.
In the individual curriculum, objectives were set by some of the teachers (often determined jointly with parents and N), and when things went well the assessment was linked to them. I especially remember reading being taught by one teacher, who put the reading (the words N read, and the speed) into a bar chart. N observed it daily, and every week the assessment (bar chart) was put up on the wall, and then it went into a file which was brought home regularly. This was encouraging and got him interested in reading. It also worked, so that the study material was neither too difficult nor too easy – but just right. M
The assessment discussed in D’s case has the objective primarily of examining his study status. In his school report in spring, his status in study subjects is stated, as well as his status and achievement in special needs such as Bliss training and use of computer switches. D’s individual educational plan is reviewed in view of the assessment.

Legrand, a multinational geated towards wiring devices, asked Sempé – better known for her Ruché sofa for Ligne Roset and her feminine lighting for Wästberg – to come up with a new collection as part of its designer collection.
Debuted in late 2012, the collection includes a wall plate with a waffled texture; you press in the circles to reveal the outlets. It also features ultra-minimal light switches and outlets with covers that fold up like little umbrellas to provide access for plugs.
The redesigned outlet is enjoying a lot of play, and with such designers as Inga Sempé and Omer Arbel creating smart-looking sockets, there’s no reason to have a hideous wall plate in your home.Follow and like us

For Hannibal Lecter fans, prepare yourself for the thriller “Hannibal”, and one I’m definitely interested in watching is “The Carrie Diaries”, a Sex and the City prequel – both will air midseason.
A few returning programs include “New Girl”, “2 Broke Girls”, “Suburgatory”, “Revenge” and “Person of Interest”.

CLOCK TOWER AND FRENCH FACADE
- The most conspicuous object on Columbia Avenue in the
Manufactures Building
was the Clock-Tower, which is seen at the left of the engraving. It was erected by a self-winding clock manufacturer, and was operated in connection with the Western Union Telegraph Company. There were passageways underneath in both main directions, and the northern region of the building, or United States Section, may be seen through its arch at the right of the avenue. The dials were four in number, and measured seven feet in diameter. At each quarter-hour a series of chimes was struck which filled the building with festive sounds. At the right of the tower rises the column which surmounted the Tiffany and Gorham exhibits, the most creditable of the American displays in their department. In these pavilions the diamonds, the silver statue of Columbus, and the model Cathedral chancel and altar redeemed America from utter defeat in the concourse of nations. The magnificent facade of the French Section here shows its main portal, with Folguere's
Statue of the French Republic
at the entrance. This construction of twenty-six arches was erected under the supervision of Chief of Installation Mascart. The caryatides bearing the cornice, as seen at the right, were present along both main outer aisles, and beyond each arch was a drawing room displaying the finest household goods of which France could boast. The many alcoves within, and their contents, made a profound impression on all visitors.

4 reasons why students above 16 years of age should change their signatures soon enough
It doesn't matter what your age is. Any age is suitable for adopting a healthy signature. I find the 16 to 25 age group ideal for a signature correction, primarily because this is the time when a person decides to adopt a particular signature style.Pretty good spread huh?
Shame it's too tiny to be eaten.
That's right; I made some miniature food for my dolls house. Here's how;
Salt dough.
You'll need plain flour, salt and water.
I just got roughly the same amount of flour and salt and added water until it went doughy, but if you want to do things properly then just google a salt dough recipe.
To make everything in that top photo I only used the amount of salt dough you see in my hand there...
Once they've been in the oven paint the.
To make a croissant thinly roll some salt dough into a long triangle. Then roll it up, starting at the wide end, and curve into the right shape.
Once cooked, paint with a golden brown colour, a little darker on top.
To make donuts roll some salt dough into a ball and then flatten it. Use a kebab skewer or a thin drinking straw to make a hole through the middle.
After they've been in the oven, paint them golden brown and then different colours for the icing.
I also made scones, shortbread fingers, cupcakes, cookies, plaited bread, turnovers and Belgian buns. The possibilities are endless, just have a play around with the dough.
Here are two ladies enjoying a cream tea and a gossip.
Hungry kids waiting for the cake to be cut.
And a family having their continental breakfast of croissants.
I'd love to see what you come up with.
those are super cute- my monkeys love it when we make play dough.
I love your miniature food!!
These are great!! They look so real. =)
This is so cute!!
This is a really cute project! Puts me in the mind to play with some salt dough and see what I come up with.
: )
Great tutorial. I currently use polymer clay to make food for Barbie. It was nice to see the salt/dough equivalent.
Wow! I have done this kind of thing before, but thanks for the refresher course!.. And I LOVE the croissants and hot cross buns!.. So CUTE!!! ~tina
too cute to be true ^^
this is really cute ^_^
So cute food gifts for kids and more. Thanks
I used salt dough for about 20 years prior to polymer clay being available in the USA. the things you make are so intricate & beautiful, I worry that humidity over time will damage them... what do you do to preserve them? in my experience, the salt dough, even when coated with compatible varnish would, over time have salt puff up to the surface. do you have some secret tip to keep that from occurring?
Hi Mrs. Mother Made, I am not the person you were asking to, but I always use salt dough and the way that I preserve it is: When I bake it, I let it cool and then paint it with clear Nail polish or varnish.
It looks like great..Beautiful! I'm invating you to my blog.Whith love... ;)))
These are so adorable I can't even stand it! I also love your art page, you are very talented. I'm a soft pastel artist and seeing your work makes me want to start painting more!Police Report: Stoll Carrying Cocaine, MDMA In Back...

Before 1858, probate cases took place in a variety of different courts all over the country. We’ve gathered together scanned images of wills and other probate records created in these courts – let’s see what they can reveal about your ancestors’ lives.
We’ll adopt Joseph Pratt from Poole in Dorset as our 3x great-grandfather. We think he died around 1785. Can we discover anything about his life?
1Start your search in Dorset Wills and Probates, 1565-1858. Use Joseph’s name with the year 1780 for Any Event – but as we’re unsure, click ‘Show Advanced’ and use the +/- options to allow five years either way. The first result looks promising, so click ‘View Image’ to see the original will. This Joseph left all his belongings to his children – but he didn’t name them, as clearly they hadn’t been born when he wrote his will!
2The will was written in 1759, but there’s no note about when it was proved, so we can’t guess at when he died. This is unusual, so try clicking the right arrow to the top right to browse to the next page. You’ll see it’s a short note, stating that the will was proved by Elizabeth Pratt – his widow – on 24th March 1788. It looks like we’ve found our ancestor.
3Return to Dorset Wills and Probates, 1565-1858 to see if you can find a will for Elizabeth. Just use her name, and the first result is a will written on 16th March 1787. View the image, and you’ll quickly realise it’s the right woman, as she called herself the widow of Joseph. She left everything to her sons Joseph (junior) and James.
4We have no idea when the younger Joseph died, which may make it difficult to find his will. Let’s fix that in Dorset Deaths and Burials, 1813-2001. Search for Joseph Pratt, and we’ll guess he died in Poole, Dorset. You’ll see one obvious match – Joseph junior was buried on 11th March 1817.
5Now you can go back to Dorset Wills and Probates, 1565-1858 and look for Joseph Pratt in Poole, specifying 1817 under ‘Any Event’. The results are a bit confusing. The first one is obviously Joseph senior. But the second match gives the years 1846-1857. View the image to clear things up – this is a will from 1817 that has been bundled up with more recent records. Joseph mentioned his late mother Elizabeth, and asked for a John Dunford to look after his estate while he went to sea. Sadly, a note says the will was proved on 13th March 1817 – just eight days after it was written – so Joseph junior must have died almost immediately.
Too easy? See how you do in the Top Set
Take the advanced lesson
Not all our probate records are wills – other legal documents can also shed light on your ancestors’ circumstances. See if you can find a letter of administration for the John Dunford mentioned in Joseph junior’s will. The letter appoints him to deal with a dead relative’s estate – what is herShop wayfair for all the best rustic sideboards buffets enjoy free shipping on most stuff even big stuff.

Lockheed Martin Corp. will create a data repository for the Air Force under a contract modification worth $24.1 million.
As a result, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co., of Fort Worth, Texas, will develop a data farm for the Joint Strike Fighter U.S. Reprogramming Laboratory that will be located at Eglin Air Force Base in Okaloosa County, Fla., according to a March 9 Defense Department announcement.
The data farm will connect with the lab’s prime mission equipment that is used to store software and data from F-35 aircraft mission data testing, the announcement said.
Ninety-five percent of the work, which is expected to be completed in November 2014, will be performed at Fort Worth, Texas, and the rest in Orlando, Fla.
The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Md., is the contracting activity..According to a study by MIT, driving a car is as stressful as participating in an extreme action sport. What a horrible way to start–or end–a work day.
On the other hand, riding a bike is a well-known stress reliever. According to the British Medical Association, cycling just 20 miles a week can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 50%. It’s also a great way to appreciate your local world. How many fine details are missed traveling at 40 miles-per-hour that you’d catch from your bike?
Not owning a car my first five years in Norfolk I commuted almost exclusively by bike. I saved money. I stayed in shape. I had a great time. I suggest you try it. Here are some tips, provided by members of the local bike community, to get your bike commute off to a good start.
1. Be Smart About Your Clothes + Be Prepared to Freshen Up When You Get to Work
If you’re biking to work on a warm summer day wearing a tight gray shirt is obviously not the best idea in the world. Kelley Howell, who runs a monthly Friday Night Fun Ride, suggests keeping a spare outfit and shoes at work. Here are her tips for looking like you just came out of the shower–and not off a bike:
“I use witch hazel as an astringent to wipe down if I’ve been glowing. Women, of course, neither sweat nor perspire. We glow. After a hard ride, if you have a lot of glow, you can splash water on your face and extremities, dry off, then get the last bit of road grime of with witch hazel. For helmet head: Avon sells an apres-gym hair freshener. What it really is is a leave-in conditioner you can spray on to freshen your hair. Comb it through and style as I would at home.”
<ARTICLE SPONSORED BY EAST COAST BIKES>
2. Don’t Over-Stress the Bike
From Markus Wegener, President of Bike Norfolk and Chair of the Norfolk Bicycle and Pedestrian Trails Commission:
“My tip for people who are new to or just thinking about bike commuting is to not get sucked into the gear-head mentality. All you really need is a decent bike, depending on the distance there is no need for spandex, clip in shoes, and lightweight bikes. Even if you end up riding slower, that time is made up by not having to worry about changing clothes and prepping for the ride; just get dressed and get on your bike.”
3. Share the Road
“I have found that most cyclist are quick to shout it to passing drivers, but don’t always practice what they preach,” said Eric Throne, organizer of Critical Mass. “If you are riding with a group of your friends (with the exception of the last friday of every month/critical mass ride) ride single file allowing enough room for cars to pass comfortably. Big part of a happy bicycle commute is not getting buzzed or yelled at by drivers. Takes both drivers and cyclist to share the road.”
4. Pump it Up
“Too low of air pressure leads to high blood pressure, and or even flats.” — Andrew Hund, Hund’s Recyclefactory
5.Don’t be a Dummy
“Half of all cycling accidents involve only the cyclist. Learn bike handling skills. Practice on the weekend. Go on social group rides with.” – Kelley Howell
6. Invest in a Decent Lock
“Your bike is only worth as much as your bike lock,” said Wes Cheney, a bike courier with Carry Norfolk. “Skinny cable locks are convenient for cyclists to carry, and for bike thieves to cut. A twenty dollar pair of bolt cutters can easily cut a twenty dollar cable lock, padlock or chain, but not a twenty dollar U lock. U locks are sturdy, but not flexible. Sometimes it isn’t easy to find a suitable bike rack or post for a U lock. In those instances, ‘New York grade,’ heavy duty chains can be both flexible and secure, but at a heavier cost and weight. If you love your bike, lock it up, right.”
7. Ride with Confidence
Also from Wes, who is a founding member, Bike Norfolk and Commissioner of Bicycling and Pedestrian Trailways, Norfolk.
“Ride with traffic, not against it. Ride with lights at night. Ride with a friend. Few things scare a driver or a pedestrian more than the sight of a cyclist swerving down the street towards their shiny, new car. Ride your bike like you drive for a driver’s license test: cool, collected, alert, undistracted. Don’t be afraid to take a lane of the road. Stay at least three feet away from cars parked at the curb, so that you won’t get ‘doored.'”
8. Take Side Streets
“I like to go by the Hague because it is a nice route,” said Cindy Lewis, who runs the Coffee Shop Community Ride out of East Coast every Saturday at 9am. And the neighborhoods by the Lafayette River are nice. I like the scenic views from both routes. Less traffic and nice back streets to ride.”
9. Bike Even if it’s Nasty Out
“Make an effort to bike in on very bad weather days,” said Paul Forehand, unofficial Bike Czar of the City of Norfolk. “This will let you learn the capabilities of your gear, and increase your confidence. Be more cautious and slow your roll.”Fascination About clash of clans generator. undesirable u can Examine.. these days war my clan tag is #2PL2UUGY..

Dorian Lee Harper and Wanda Sue Larson, both 57, and of Union County.
UNION COUNTY, N.C. — A North Carolina married couple was arrested after authorities said a child was found handcuffed to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck.
The News & Observer reported that Dorian Lee Harper and Wanda Sue Larson, both 57 and of Union County, face various charges including child abuse.
Union County deputies said they were investigating an animal service complaint Friday at a neighboring home when the child was discovered at 4116 Austin Road, south of Monroe.
The investigating deputy said he came across a shivering child handcuffed by the ankle to the railing. The child was described as being around 10-12 years old.
Moments later, deputies said a man appeared on the porch along with another child that released several dogs on the officer.
The deputy reportedly went back to his patrol car and the man then removed the handcuffed child from the porch and put the dead chicken on a barrel.
Deputies said one of the suspects, Larson, is a Child Protective Services supervisor in Union County.
Officials said she and her husband had adopted four children and were serving as foster parents for a fifth child.
Deputies said when they searched the home shortly later; they found five children, ages 8, 9, 11, 13 and 14. Authorities said the children have been removed from the home.
Deputies said the suspects were charged with intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment and cruelty to animals.
They were both placed in the Union County Jail and have court planned for Monday. Harper was given a $500,000 bond and Larson a $525,000 bond.

I doubt voodoo, maybe it was so the dang dogs would attack the chicken and maul the child. If these trashy pieces of horse squeeze ever are allowed to hold custody over a child then the UNION county DA and Law Enforcment should apply for new jobs.
DSV
White Trash! Enough Said!!

I am sure these people are doing this just for the money and the social services they receive for these children. If one is in the foster care system, why was there no house checks? Not enough money in the budget to hire enough people to do the checks? I would give up a few days a month to do it for free. Someone has to keep an eye on these poor kids and make sure thy are treated properly.
Marly Duran
I don’t think it was due to lack of funds that the house wasn’t checked. It’s because the woman, Wanda Sue Larson, was the Social Services supervisor. I’m sure she bypassed home inspections to get all those kids into her home. Who knows what the families who are her cases are like. This case is going to get bigger before it gets settled. I wish it was a death penalty case.
Deanna Osborne Sutphin
Hope they both get the death penalty!! they don’t deserve to live
Angie
I say fry them both.
anhal
I cannot find word to express how sad I am for those children. How does a child ever get over abuse like that? I cannot understand how someone could do that to a child.
Ridiculous
I can’t believe they gave these people a bond they deserve no bond! They tortured and abused a child and an animal. I can only hope karma comes around and bites these two with a long prison sentence.
Joann Duke
I’m not surprised that they worked for DSS cause my 2 grandchildren told the cps about abuse themselves and nothing was done, so if this had of been reported by someone, they wouldn’t be in jail. A police officer called about my 2 grandchildren and still nothing has been done, only when 1 of them turn up dead will anything be said, it is a shame so much of this stuff happens and when it’s reported nothing happens
TeeTee
Picture=No Surprise, right Faith C?
missy
This is the reason children keep turning up dead. you have people like this over child protective services! The people that don’t need cps involved have them breathing down their neck and the ones like this have no issues! Just like the Zarah Baker case in Lenoir NC. CPS was called numerous times including reports with a black eye but they done absolutely nothing and she turned up dead!
terrie brown
Yep it’s sad that cps only bothers the ones that they have no business bothering and people like this can do the most evil things to children and worked in the hospital gross glad I don’t live in that county
Luther
At least the boy is old enough to testify against them at their trial.
Louise
So many ppl that want children and animals like this get to draw a check to abuse them. So said the justice system overlooks the innocent children and the elderly. There needs to be an overhaul of who is in chargeMay 22, 2015
Reaction to the city council's change of heart was mixed Tuesday morning. Bar owners called it a victory, while public health officials say they'll now ask the council to withdraw the proposal.
Council member Terry Werner says he's frustrated by the recent change among council members. He says he doubts the council will ever pass the ordinance now that it's been watered down.
The new amendment passed after Councilman Jon Camp changed his pervious vote against the food exemption. Camp says employees have a choice about where they work and that the government shouldn't legislate against the freedom of choice.
The council hopes to have a final vote on the proposal during their Dec. 15 meeting. The vote was delayed because Councilman Jonathan Cook was ill and unable to participate in Monday.So it's that time again, yet another teatox? Remember when I tried the HealthyMeTea? (Probably not) It's a teatox tea from the Aussie branch "SkinnyMeTea", although YourTea also is a Aussie brand I thought after so many positive reviews about it, I thought I would give it a go.
Also the fact hey had a 20% discount, kind of lured me into the teatox craze once again.
It's a tea blend made by the company "Your Tea", basically a group of friends that made their own teas, saw the results it gave and thought of sharing it with the world - read that off the box I got, but the thought is sweet~ I've heard both high and low about the "Tinytea" their teatox to aid weightloss and de-bloating of your stomach, help restore your clean glowy skin as well; sounds pretty win-win to most of us girls out there.
It's a herbal Chinese blend consistent of :
Oolang tea, Jue Ming Zi, He Ye, Shan Zha, Lai Fu Zi, Chen Pi, Mai Ya
(contains gluten)
That little added label "contains gluten" is weird, I bought the 28-day Gluten Free Tinytea package, but I won't question it if they say it's gluten free...maybe.
Anyways! In the SkinnyMeTea, as well as many other "teatox" teas, there's a Morning/day tea & Evening/Goodnight tea: where in most cases the latter one contains laxative herbs perhaps such as
- Senna,
Senna leaves are used in countless of "slimming herbal" teas, mainly because of the laxative effect. It can be very strong and hurt your bowels a lot, so I really hope you guys will be careful! Always be careful with those kinds of products, if you don't care and just go with it you might end up having to rely on the tea to actually..poop. Your bowels won't be able to do it properly by itself, it can be very dangerous!
Not to scare you off by teatoxes cause you never know "how much" of senna leaves they actually use but, just be careful like with most things online or "slimming" products ^0^ /
I was gladly surprised at how fast this company ships their products out, I ordered the 28D GL package on the 24th of September and it was by my door on the 29th (Sept) so basically 5 days; I placed the order at night so it got shipped out the day after. So glad! Great service.
About the box, I love the design. Compared to other companies that just put it in reseal-able bags; be it loose tea leafs, I think this method is much nicer. It looks more professional and clean. Comparing to my SkinnyMeTea experience with the loose tea leafs in a bag it was very troublesome to measure everyday to make sure I had enough for a cup - for the next 14 days. It was just a mess that didn't taste good at all, actually on the first try I gagged so bad I - TMI - threw up in my cup.
I loved how the scent of herbs and I dunno, calmness just oozed out of the box when I opened it. I love opening it just to get a sniff of that scent. (sounding like a lunatic, oops)
I love my tea
I've had a few cups so far, and I would say I enjoy the taste. I wasn't really skeptical on the taste since most of the reviews I stumbled upon was by girls, most likely non-herbal/traditional tea drinking ones, I bet a Chinese wouldn't even think twice about the flavor since they're Chinese herbal blends + they're tea drinkers.
Over all good first impression! I can't wait to try it out more and see what happens, hopefully my skin and body will welcome it's goodness if not, then..erm, it was the most expensive tea I've ever had. HAHA

I remember well the day Oklahoma Baptists made the historic decision to elect the first Native American president of our state convention.
It took more than 100 years for this wonderful event to take place. In truth, Emerson Falls was elected primarily because he was a respected pastor and leader among Oklahoma Baptists, not solely because he was Native American.
In many ways, the delay in electing a Native American to lead us seems strange. Oklahoma is the land of the red man. There are more Native American Baptist churches here than in any other state. Native Americans have served on our convention’s board of directors for years. So on that rainy November day in Tulsa, Falls made history. He served with great distinction and continues to be a significant leader in Oklahoma as well as among Southern Baptists.
I predict (don’t have to be much of a prophet to do so) that next week in New Orleans another historic event will transpire regarding a person of color. Fred Luter will be elected as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. He will be chosen not just because he is an African American, but because he is a respected pastor, beloved preacher and effective leader. Nonetheless, his election will mark the first time in the 167-year history of Southern Baptists that an African American serves as our chosen leader.
African Americans have long been a part of Southern Baptists. The presence of African American congregations affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention has grown steadily across the years. Racial segregation in Southern Baptist congregations has diminished greatly since the tumultuous days of the 1960s. I can’t think of any Southern Baptist church today that would not gladly receive members of any racial background into its fellowship.
That it took so long for churches not only to receive blacks, but also to welcome them, is a scar on our history. I am pleased that African Americans are members of our churches and that many serve in leadership. I rejoice that, today, the SBC is the most ethnically diverse denomination in America. Indeed, our African American churches and members are welcomed and cherished, as is every other racial group.
I believe the election of Luter will provide another stepping stone to eradicate the statement I have often heard—“In America, 11 o’clock on Sunday morning is the most segregated hour of the week.” Our churches need to reflect our culture. More importantly, our churches need to reflect Heaven. One day, we shall gather around the throne of God with the multitudes from every tribe, tongue and nation to give unceasing praise to the King of kings. We should take advantage of every opportunity down here on Earth to practice for that moment.
I love Oklahoma Baptist diversity. As I move among the churches of Oklahoma, I am met by the savory flavors and spiritual aromas that flow in them. It is a tremendous joy to experience the spice of the Hispanics, the enthusiasm of the African Americans and the dignity of the Asians. But when we are placed in the melting pot of one church, it is heavenly.
I look forward to casting my vote for Fred Luter and to serving beside him and looking up to him as my leader. After Hurricane Katrina, I walked through his home with the Oklahoma Disaster Relief mud out team as they prepared to clear his house of the debris. He has visited our state a number of times to preach at various conferences. Luter is loved in Oklahoma, and will be a great leader for the Southern Baptist Convention.Anyone still out there?
Hi, yes, well thanks for stopping back to see if I'm still blogging! Yes, it's been a verrrry long week, and I apologize for the delay in posts.
It seems impossible that it was only a week ago tonight I arrived in Omaha to take part in what turned out to be the (Im)perfect Storm. A week ago, despite Kerry's rise in the polls, we Deanocrats were sure our first-time voters would tip the balance in our favor. And there *were* tons of first-time voters, but they broke for Kerry and Edwards, the "electable" guys.
I spent last weekend in a flurry of activity for Gov. Dean. Friday night, I called Council Bluffs voters to remind them of a noon rally with Dean and Tom Harkin the next day. Saturday, we went to the rally and I saw Dr. Dean speak for the first time live -- I'd seen him last October in Boise, but that didn't count since I was in the overflow room there. After the rally, the Council Bluffs coordinator, Jordan, sent me to the town of Woodbine, population 1400, about an hour north. Over the next two days, I canvassed 118 homes in Woodbine to remind them about the caucus and ask their support for Dean.
Monday morning at 7:30, I was back in Council Bluffs, at one of the busiest intersections in town with several other Deaniacs. We stood holding Dean signs in the 4-degree chill, taking turns getting warm in our cars. After rush hour, I canvassed two neighborhoods in Council Bluffs. Now the focus was definite Dean supporters; we slipped reminders on their doorknobs and spoke to anyone who was at home, inquiring whether they needed a ride to the caucus, thanking them one last time for their support. I left Council Bluffs mid-afternoon to drive to Des Moines for the final hours. Many volunteers stayed on in CB to make final calls and get people to the polls, but to me, Des Moines was a magnet whose pull I couldn't resist. Des Moines is where we'd learn that Dean really did pull it off; where history would record the first victory of the greatest grassroots campaign of our time. As a journalist, historian, and Dean supporter, I had to be there.
I checked into the first Motel 6 I saw, took a shower (those orange hats were warm but, oh, talk about hat hair!) and went to observe one of the caucuses at Valley High School in West Des Moines, a location I chose mainly for its proximity to our after-party at the Val Air Ballroom. As people streamed into the room, I was heartened to see lots of Dean stickers and buttons, and the Dean camp had a nice position staked out near the door. But the other top-tier candidates seemed well represented, too. When the organizers finally asked the throng to break up into preference groups, I was genuinely stunned to see Dean get only 23 people in his corner -- two people shy of viability in this precinct. The local Dean leaders managed to get a Clark supporter and one other person into their camp to attain viability, but it didn't look good. I leaned over to another observer and said, "I hope this isn't representative of what's happening around the state."
Turned out it was. I got in my rental car afterward and heard on the radio that Kerry and Edwards were mopping up votes all over Iowa; that Dean was coming in a distant third; and that Gephardt was toast. The Val-Air thing wasn't starting for a while, so I made a halfhearted attempt to find Dean HQ without a map or directions. Failing that, I headed for the Val Air. People were milling around, muttering about the inexplicable 11th-hour deal between Dennis Kucinich and John Edwards that threw DK's supporters into the Edwards camp, happy that we'd at least beaten Gephardt. People weren't really downcast; we knew a third-place finish was good enough to move forward. Still, it was a fairly subdued and reflective scene.
Then, of course, it happened: A crowd coalesced around the stage. Fistfuls of American flags and pompoms were passed around, and we started chants -- "D-E-A-N, take our country back again" and "No more Bush." We pounded our feet on the floor. We whooped and hollered. The hall took on the air of a high school gym where our team had barely qualified for the playoffs and we were trying to pump ourselves up for the crucial contests ahead.
That was the atmosphere Gov. Dean walked into at about 9:30 Monday night. The place went nuts. Dean said on TV with Diane Sawyer last night that he is not a rock star, but you would've thought differently if you were there in the Val Air Monday night. The next 15 minutes were a blur of yells -- his and ours. It was frequently so loud that it was hard to hear what Dean was saying. The bottom line was this, though: We all left the ballroom buoyed and ready to rock on to New Hampshire, South Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona .... yeah! I hit a fast-food drive-through on my way back to the motel and when the clerk saw my Dean button, he sniggered, "You lost tonight." "No we didn't," I said. "We came in third."
When I awoke the next morning, I felt as if I had a slight hangover, even though I hadn't had anything to drink. I got dressed, went out to the lobby for the Des Moines Register, and started reading. "Iowans found Dean too angry, too liberal," Page 1 read. Then, inside, a five-column photo of Dean yelling into the microphone, red face, fist clenched. The accompanying story told of a "screaming address ... Dean's face shot red ... his voice, at times, cracked as he screamed." I turned on the TV and it got worse. Everyone was talking about Dean's rant. Driving back to Omaha to catch my flight, scanning the radio dial, I heard a shock-rock DJ do voiceovers to Dean's speech, basically saying Dean had gone over the edge.
Now I really felt like I had a hangover -- and that I'd entered some weird parallel universe, besides. Sure, Dean had been excited. Yes, he had yelled, just like the rest of us in the room. His speech had not meant to be an address to a Joint Session of Congress. It was a rally, for pete's sake. And yet ... and yet ... the dozens of TV and still cameras had captured evidence that yes, Dean, is an Angry Man. Dean scares little kids. Dean is unelectable.
So all this week, I have been defending Dean - not an easy task as the media replay the most bombastic 15 seconds of his speech over and over and over and over and .... One organizer of a satellite Dean Meet-Up group wrote to tell me he was abandoing Dean because he believes the media will not let Dean live this down. My brother, who likes Dean, warned me not to "drink the Kool-Aid." Meanwhile, Kerry has overtaken Dean's lead in New Hampshire.
But as of last night (Thursday), I think maybe the tide finally turned -- in the PR battle, if not in the polls. Dean appeared with his wife Judy on ABC's Prime Time. He said -- as those of us who were there Monday have been testifying all week -- that although his Monday tirade was hardly presidential, it was meant to be a thanks and a rally cry to those of us (the 3500 kids, he keeps saying) who worked and froze our butts off in Iowa on his behalf. Later, on Letterman, he did the Top 10 list on how he can turn his campaign around. ("Switch to decaf" and "Lift weights and develop an Austrian accent" were the funniest.)
I'm ending this post now so I can address where we go from here ...
Julie,
Thanks so much for all your hard work in Iowa.
There's a home video of the now infamous speech at which backs up everything you have said.
When you see the governor's speech in the context of the crowd noise, it seems not only entirely appropriate, but also quite moving.
Posted by: Kate in Oregon | January 23, 2004 at 03:29 PM
Jiminy Christmas, but stuff like this makes me cringe. I heard the "relevant" part of Dean's speech on the radio and never once thought "wow, that's weird," or "he sure sounds angry" or anything like that. I'm not even a Dean supporter. It wasn't until later that I started reading/hearing the journalism pack start (mis)characterizing the speech, and I had to shake my head and wonder if they were referring to the same clip I heard. It's like the 2000 campaign's "Al Gore lied about inventing the Internet" crapola all over again.
If this is what we have to look forward to through the summer and fall, it won't matter who gets nominated. Bush lies about being AWOL during his military service but nobody in the media cares. Dean dares to show exuberance in a crowd full of supporters and he's unhinged.
Criminy.

The single is only the beginning of new music for the singer – Abi has been in the studio for the better part of this year writing and recording new music, and is set to release a new EP in the fall.
The EP is very honest and genuine to my own experiences with love; the good and the bad. It’s taken me some time to get it where I wanted, but these pieces of work are my proudest yet and I can only hope when it is heard that you, as a listener, will hear a part of yourself telling the song’s stories!” states Abi

The story of Tito Ortiz getting punched out by convicted bank robber Lee Murray during an alleyway altercation after UFC 38 has grown into one of MMA’s most beloved bits of folklore. The most famous version — relayed second-hand from a drunken Pat Miletich and published in Matt Hughes‘s autobiography Made in America — ends with Tito Ortiz getting starched by "like, a five-punch combo," then boot-stomped.
On this Friday’s installment of Michael Schiavello’s HDNet interview series The Voice Vs…, Ortiz gets to tell his side of the tale. Basically, it was Ortiz’s friend that was getting stomped, and when Murray dropped Ortiz with a punch it was more of slip then anything else, and that only happened after Murray was running away like a little bitch, and Tito was able to pop back up anyway. As Tito explains, "I was never unconscious at the time, in my whole career I’ve never been unconscious, and I never will go unconscious." Also, Lee Murray’s robbery conviction was karmic revenge for this embarrassing story being spread around.
No mention of the best part of the Ortiz vs. Murray street fight legend, which involved Chuck Liddell knocking multiple dudes out with his back against a wall. Where were you back then, TMZ?

Tito's head so fat when he gets cut in a fight he uses bacon for band-aids.
Tito's head so fat he gots to iron his walk-out beanie in the driveway.
Tito's head so fat it sweats butter.
Tito's head so fat when he goes to the zoo elephants throw peanuts at it.
BTW, loved the reference Rick Ja...I mean EL Famous B
Fuck Yer Couch Nephew!!!
Say it isn't soooooooooooo
serious note; the fake nervous laugh said as much as the constant looking away. you got knocked out. And also note how he does not address Chuck laying people out all over the place, cuz that's gotta be the part of the story Tito hates the most.
I'm fucking telling you, CP. Knock this shit off. It's not funny.
Maybe when a mild mannered environmental engineer from Colorado named Bruce Bannister takes his horse pills and turns into the hulking Shane Carwin he might have a chance to KO Tito. But otherwise... I just don't see it happening.
I don't know... if someone busted into my hotel room in the middle of the night, woke my ass up, and told me about a giant bar fight with some friends of mine who happen to be the biggest stars in MMA at the time, I might remember that. And I doubt Matt and Pat talked about it that night, and then agreed to never speak of this event again. I'm sure there were some refreshers on the story during those years of training together.
Plus, If it comes to believing Matt Hughes over Tito Ortiz, I'll take Hughes. Hughes may be a lot of things, but Tito is a proven liar. Also, I think Tito's side of things largely confirms most of what Hughes recounted. Tito just refutes the head stomp (may be true?) and denies actually being KO'ed. But if Tito got knocked down by a quick 4 or 5 shots, whether out cold or not, I'm sure it looked that way to Pat while in the fray of the fight.
Im pretty sure he stole that quote from his wife's auto-biography.
The video uncovers Tito's secret "Fresh Prince/Carltonesque" defensive stance.
To avoid being knocked out, simply place you hands palms down on the back of your skull, close your elbows to cover your face, duck down and wait for the referee or police to arrive. To remain concious try to recite the names of men who have skull phucked your wife and lies you have told family and friends over the course of your life.
I've got $2 that says Ortiz/Hammill is declared a no-contest when, mid-beating, Jenna uses her flappy vagina to glide into the octagon like a flying squirrel and rescue Ortiz from the KO at the hands of the dude with the soft skull.
I'm one of the baddest motherfuckers of all time, one of the best singers and one of the best looking motherfuckers you've ever seen. Hold my drink, bitch.
The man speaks the truth people.Thursday, March, 15, 2007
Former Cougar basketball player in NCAA tournament action for Long Beach State this weekend
Former Columbus State basketball standout Aaron Nixon will take the court for 12th seeded Long Beach State University this weekend in the NCAA first-round action at Nationwide Arena, playing against No. 5 seed University of Tennessee.
The 49ers and Volunteers will play the second game of the day, slated to tip off at approximately 2:35 pm (EST).
Nixon, from Cleveland Heights, is the leading scorer for Long Beach, having transferred in 2005 on a full athletic scholarship from San Bernardino College, where he played his 2004-05 season. At Columbus State during the 2003-04 season, Nixon led the Cougars to the Ohio Community College Athletic Conference (OCCAC) title.
Nixon was named MVP in the Big West Tournament, where he was both leading scorer with 29 points and leading rebounder with 11 in the final game against Cal Poly.
He also earned Big West Conference Player of the Year honors, and Long Beach coach Larry Reynolds was named Coach of the Year.
The 49ers are playing in their first NCAA Tournament since 1995. Long Beach, 24-7 on the season, is a long shot to win in their first-round game against Tennessee, but as all bracket junkies know, the tournament is famous for its upsets.
Graduate goes Hollywood
This television season Cory has acted in guest spots on "King of Queens" (CBS) and "Studio 60" (NBC). He recently completed work on his first feature film, "The Comebacks," a comedy in which he plays a member of a minor league football team. "The Comebacks" will be released nationally in late August.
According to Dr. Tom Habegger, professor in Sports and Exercise Studies, Cory has been in contact with his former faculty members since graduating, and he continually thanks Columbus State for giving him the skill set needed to manage his new entertainment career.
AQIP Strategy Forum provides next steps
The Columbus State Strategy Forum Team recently returned from Lisle, Ill. where other AQIP institutions and AQIP reviewers had an opportunity to provide feedback on Columbus State's project proposals. While there, the 12-member Columbus State team was kept busy learning new tools that will help define quality projects, as well as hearing from institutions that have been implementing quality projects for a few years. The team came away from the focused sessions with the knowledge that "quality work is an iterative process, and that prior steps inform future steps," according to Sunday Zidonis.

Should you believe what Eric Schmidt says, or what Google does?
Actions speak louder than words. That's why I'm not putting much stock in what Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt says anymore.
Speaking at The All Things Digital Conference on May 31 Schmidt said Google decided not to implement facial recognition technology because of privacy concerns. He said he thought it's something that can be used in a "very bad way as well as a very good way."
"We actually built that technology and we withheld it," Schmidt told the conference. "As far as I know it's the only technology Google built and after looking at it we decided to stop."
I actually thought that concerns about Google riding roughshod over consumers' privacy might be getting through to the executive suites at the Googleplex.
Now I'm beginning to think Schmidt was really kicked upstairs when Larry Page resumed his position as chief executive office and is now completely out of the loop.
Guess what Google just bought? A facial recognition company, Pittsburgh Pattern Recognition, aka "PittPatt."
A statement on PittPatt's website said it was a "natural fit" to join Google. Price wasn't disclosed.
Looks like Page doesn't care what Schmidt says in public and doesn't care much about privacy either. And guess who the Internet giant is sending to testify before the Senate Judiciary''s Antitrust Subcommittee? Schmidt, not Page.
The senators should really insist on talking to the current CEO who clearly knows what Google is really up to. Actions speak louder than words.Sipp Sparkling Organics expands distribution into Southern California
Distribution agreement with Real Soda In Real Bottles offers West Coast potential
Philadelphia-based Sipp Eco Beverage Co. Inc., maker of Sipp Sparkling Organics beverages, announced that it will expand its products’ distribution into the Southern California region by teaming up with Gardena, Calif.-based distributor Real Soda In Real Bottles. The distributor will carry all four flavors of Sipp Sparkling Organics.
“Real Soda is constantly on an endless quest for the most delicious beverages in glass bottles; fully aware that ‘pallet’ and ‘palate’ are not merely differentiated by their spelling,” said Danny Ginsburg, founder and chief executive officer of Real Soda, in a statement. “… [W]hen we discovered Sipp, we realized instantly that we were going to have a great addition to what is perhaps unquestionably the best variety of bottled beverages available anywhere.”
Beth Parentice, chief executive officer and founder of Sipp, added: “We are very excited to start working with Danny and his team at Real Soda. His experience and expertise will be invaluable to Sipp’s expansion to the Southern California region and beyond.”
Real Soda’s distribution territory consists of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana, Idaho, Colorado and Nevada. This agreement will allow Sipp to expand into these regions of the United States and bring the products to many new restaurant and natural market chains.
Sipp currently has distribution in retail stores and restaurants in northern California, Texas, and across the East Coast. Retail stores include Whole Foods Market, Food Emporium, Central Market, Balducci’s, ABC Fine Wine & Spirits, and Roche Bros. The beverages are available in Summer Pear, Mojo Berry, Lemon Flower and Ginger Blossom varieties.

Every region in the state saw growth in 2012 from the previous year, although the most dramatic increases were predictably in New York City and Long Island.
The Finger Lakes region, which for the purposes of the report stretches east from Rochester to Syracuse and south to Ithaca, accounted for 5 percent of tourists’ spending.
The Hudson Valley, which includes New York City’s northern suburbs and stretches to north of Poughkeepsie, brought in another 5 percent of the spending. The four-county Catskills region, including Ulster and Sullivan, accounted for another 2 percent.
Central New York, which includes much of the Southern Tier and stretches east to the Albany area, brought in 3 percent.
New York City saw the largest growth in tourism spending, 7.3 percent, to $37.1 billion in 2012 from $34.5 billion in 2011. Long Island reported a 6.3 percent increase, from $4.8 billion in 2011 to $5.1 billion in 2012.
The Greater Niagara and Central New York regions saw increases of 5 percent or more in 2012. Buffalo and surrounding counties brought in $2.2 billion, while the central region’s tourism dollars reached $1.9 billion.
The Hudson Valley experienced a growth of nearly 3 percent, with spending surging to $3.2 billion, and the Catskills had a 4 percent growth to $1.1 billion.
The Finger Lakes saw a 2 percent growth in tourism spending in 2012 when the region brought in nearly $2.8 billion.

GAHHH that's genius. My inner-paula dean is going nuts.
-Jane @ Brunch at the Beach
Your look is nice, and that bun look good I would have never thought that it will look good with butter inside
You just made me extremely hungry. :(
mmmm now i'm extra hungry!
cute outfit!! that looks delicious!!
Love your top!
Love your jeans and your bun haha
Hah this post made me laugh. Oh my god that bun looks good!
And you look great, as always :)
X
damn it, you really know how to make people hungry "
Is Papparich an Asian bakery?? The buns look really familiar to pastries/bread I've had in Korean and Japanese bakeries... I live right by Pasadena so I'll have to go and see!
Ooh I live in Pasadena! I guess I better try those buns!
you had me at glob of butter. *heart*
ohh we've those buns here as well though not from paparich, but i gather they're similar from the way you described them. we've them in coffee flavour as well & those're awesome too <3
i love your style, your outfits are always so whimsical & reminds me of alexa chung :)
i love your outfit!! and the buns look amazing :D
page
you're like a way cuter version of charlene yi.
butter makes everything better.
holy mackerel, those look good. you had me with the "crunchy sugary exterior" and "soft and fluffy" insides, but there's BUTTER, too?! get in my belly!
Cute outfits! :)
The food looks really yummy!
so cute, love the whole outfit
BUNS WITH BUTTER. Holy lord. Why do you always find the most appetising looking stuff? Now I am craving. AGAIN.
Love the shoes most about that outfit, HEART chunky heels.
I love the blouse you're wearing but.
OMG OMG OMG! SUGARY CRISPY EXTERIOR?! AND A BLOB OF BUTTER IN THE CENTRE.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SNACK HEAVEN!
why must you do this to us, i'm salivating so bad. ugghh. Love the post though.
yumm yumm yumm, food porn alert!
guuuuuurl~~~ you really DO need to come to HK! We have this place, actually it's from Singapore originally but they have this toast that's got coconut butter spread on top and in between the two toast slices, is a glob of butter.
OR there's lai yao ju, which is similar to the one you ate. Crunchy on the outside and split in half and toasted again with a dollop of butter hahaha so good!!! Expect to gain like 15 pounds if you ever come here to visit!
i'd put in extra work at the gym for just one bite of what you describe. fluffy carbs, dallop of butter AND sweet outer crust goodness???
*faints*
You look so '70s, I love this look so much!
You had me at butter. These look incredible!
I die for butter. Especially darigold. Yes, I have a favorite brand of butter; that's how ridiculous I am.
OMG, they have that papparich chain in Seoul!!! i tried it there.. they're so sweet but yummy!
i really enjoy this outfit, it's kind of like the simple classy hippie outfit, haha.
AND YES i've seen the glitter nail polish at sephora! duh! i especially love the confetti one... i tried it on the tips of my nails in-store and they looked cool but a bitch to take off!
Oh! This bun was really popular in Singapore like 4-5 years back and many franchise and imitations started popping up, but it died after few months of hype!
And they had shop names like Mamabun, Papabun etc.
your blog always makes me so hungry!
ROTI BUNS :D
love your outfit and i'm gonna check it out soon, i'm 10 min away!
The buns do look nice, and you have nothing to worry about with filling the pants out. Just eat more buns! Kidding, your body looks very proportional which is the most important thing.
Haha, I love the bun/pun. :P But really, your outfit is lovely, as always and I want some papparich!
love your trasparent shirt, so chic! <3
Oh man, you made me really crave this bun, even though I've just had a huge slice of strwaberry cheesecake for breakfast... :o)
Adoring your jeans!!!
xoxo
That bun sounds so tasty!! I love when you put up the food pics, it's like porn for your hungry tummy, everything always look so yum :)
What a great outfit for hanging with friends: stylish and comfy. I wish I could pull this off.
Such a perfect look for hanging out with friends!
And now I'm dying for one of those buns. I can only imagine how delicious with the butter in the middle, too!

Hello !
I love this outfit and this cake looks yummy !
See U !
i discovered your blog only now and i have to say that i love it and love your style!! i'm definitely a follower ^_^
yummi!!! have a look at
You look straight out of the 60s and chic, I love it. I'm usually not a fan of bellbottoms but you pull it off well. Onto more important things, a papparich needs to open in chicago. NOW. It's such a tease reading about this but never stuffing it into my mouth :(
the outfits great... but i just want some buns...
don't feed the models. part 2.
loving that look, and the mouth watering treat. <3
just thought you'd be interested in this..if you're already not!
haha, so cute. i love your hair--i want to bring it to my hairdresser. i feel like i must've said this before, but its still true!
The way you love food and describe it is so mouth-wateringly delicious. Haha I'm a bit jealous of all the food you get to taste and try. And with all that food, you atill have a pretty figure, amazing!
By the way, your bangs are very cute :) They inspired me a couple of weeks ago , while I was looking at your blog, and also with my craving for bangs these past years to cut them myself, which was a very bad idea :< I cut them too short and choppy. Plus, even though I've trimmed my own bangs before, I don't have enough forehead and chin for it, my round-face syndrome (even a hair stylist was like no bangs for you!). But my weird bangs gave my friend a laugh and this fun experiment gone a bit wrong helped smother that bang-ing desire. In the end, thanks for the inspirations.

wonderful outfit and pics as always :-)!

Grow Up Blake! Blake Is The Ultimate Facebook TrollPosted on November 21, 2013Grow up Blake! Blake is the ultimate facebook troll.Hey everyone and Happy Monday. This is Stephanie and today I'm here to share a Veteran's Day layout with you.
I have a veteran husband and a veteran brother and they mean the world to me. I never tire of saying thank you...even though it doesn't seem like nearly enough.
Supplies: Cupid's Arrow: Confetti Hearts patterned paper(B side),decorative tape,enamel heart ;Lost and Found Record It-Antique:stickers,enamel dots;Cut and Paste-Adorbs:brads,chipboard stickers;Cut and Paste-Flair:tiny word stickers,Specs patterned paper (B side), bits&pieces;Cut and Paste-Presh:Die Cut Card;Chalk Studio:chipboard elements
This isn't a traditional military layout...or a traditionally masculine layout, come to think of it! I just went with it. I think you can make a military page without making it green, brown, black, or navy.
I even used a chipboard flower and enamel heart on this page. Since it's more about my gratitude for my husband than it is about the Army...I thought it was a-okay.
I cut the bottom part off of this chipboard piece from Chalk Studio. The bottom party says "To Fly". I discarded that part and used "It takes Courage". I think the sentiment fits oh so well.
The U.S. Army tag is actually another chalkboard piece from Chalk Studio. It says "us" on it. I added enamel dots for periods and cut up some tiny word stickers to build the word "Army".
I hope today I've shown you how it's possible to make military layouts without using military themed products.
Have a wonderful Monday...and thank a veteran if you have a chance!561-747-5111

I wanted briefly to announce the publication my article "Confessional
Pluralism and the Civil Society Effect: Liberal Mediations of Islam and
Secularism in Contemporary Turkey," which appears in this month's

contemporary Turkish-Islamic NGOs, both Sunni (e.g. the Journalists and
Writers Foundation) and Alevi (e.g. the Cem Foundation, the Haci Bektas

Product Reviews
- Dan Saugstad5 Stars Out Of 5March 3, 2007Dan SaugstadThis review was written for The Life and Diary of David Brainerd.Wow, I think every Christian who wants depth in their walk should read this book. Both Jonathan Edwards and David Brainerd were men of incredibly deep examination of themselves and their state before God. Something western Christianity seems to have lost today. Read it and take the examples to heart so that you can truly attempt to prize Gods grace to sinners.
- Robert Smith5 Stars Out Of 5October 27, 2000Robert SmithThis review was written for The Life and Diary of David Brainerd.Excellent book about a missionary to the Indians in the 1750s before our country became the USA. It will challenge you to seek God more and allow Him to use you for His honor and glory. I am reading it for the third time and will continue to go back through it to gain more insight into God's way of working a Revival.

* '''Straight''': June has an otter's body with bat wings, a long, pointed tongue and CuteLittleFangs.
* '''Exaggerated''': June has an otter's body, the forelegs of a canine, the rear legs of a horse, rabbit ears, a beak, a tongue that's forked ''and'' raspy, a rat's tail, a pouch, an udder, gills, tentacles, antennae, four eyes (two of which are on stalks) and the wings of a wasp. She breathes fire and can lay eggs.
* '''Downplayed''': June is a hybrid snake, like a "wall python" (woma/ball python); she has traits of both species, but not of anything that's ''not'' a snake.
* '''Justified''':
** June is from another planet where otterlike creatures have the aforementioned bat-like traits.
** Alternatively, June is a commonly-accepted mashup with a long history of use in fiction, such as a gryphon or jackalope.
** Also alternatively, June is a mashup that's possible in RealLife, such as a liger or goat/sheep hybrid.
* '''Inverted''': June is all-otter on a planet where everyone else is a mix-and-match critter.
* '''Subverted''': The wings, tongue and fangs are part of a disguise...
* '''Double Subverted''': ...which conceals a much more elaborate chimera.
* '''Parodied''':
** June contains so many composite, mismatched animal character traits that she looks like a gargled mess (for instance, one leg is a tentacle, one leg is a duck's foot, one leg ends in a hoof and one leg is a human's). Basically like exaggerated, only more random.
** Alternatively, everything that's living on this planet is a bizarre hybrid, even the plants and technology.
** The hybrid also has a mix and match name that is a IncrediblyLamePun.
** [[{{Squick}} It is revealed that a mermaid was born when a woman slept with a fish]].
* '''Zig Zagged''':
** June's parents are an otter and a bat. She has three other siblings: a normal otter, a normal bat, and a bat with webbed toes, whiskers and a long, thick tail. The bat with otter traits marries a kangaroo, and they have a kangaroo-bat child and an otter child.
** June lives in a world where both this trope and normal animals co exist.
* '''Averted''': A bat and an otter have kids, but the kid is either a bat or an otter.
* '''Enforced''':
** The writer was told to make all of the characters composites of at least two animals.
** The writer wants to make a ShoutOut to ''WesternAnimation/TheWuzzles'', ''WesternAnimation/{{Spliced}}'' or any other work with mix-and-match critters.
* '''Lampshaded''': "It's like I'm half-bat or something."
* '''Invoked''': June undergoes surgery to attach the aforementioned bat traits.
* '''Exploited''': ???
* '''Defied''': A scientist tries to get a bat and an otter to breed, but doesn't consider the experiment a success until the offspring are "normal" animals.
* '''Discussed''': "Apparently, June's parents are an otter and a bat."
* '''Conversed''': "You gotta love science. We can mix any two animals together now."
* '''Deconstructed''': Finding that she is the last wild bat-otter, scientists capture June and closely analyze her to discover how she became that way.
* '''Reconstructed''': Over time, they successfully get her to breed with both bats and otters and thus save bat-otters from extinction.

Thursday, June 13, 2013
Three New York state men have paid a total of $3,645 in fines and restitution for illegally hunting elk in Montana.
Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks Warden Todd Anderson of Glasgow said Lawrence Butler, 61, and Richard Levandowski, 63, each of Clay, N.Y., and Richard Haselmeyer, 44, of Syracuse, N.Y., were charged with misdemeanor criminal citations in Lewis and Clark County Justice Court in Helena, Mont., for the violations during the 2010 hunting season.
According to court records, Butler was fined $1,305 and ordered to pay $500 in restitution for possessing an unlawfully killed bull elk, hunting an elk without a valid license, and using another person’s hunting license. Butler also lost hunting, fishing and trapping privileges for two years in Montana and the 38 other states participating in the Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact.
Levandowski was fined $770 for loaning an elk license to another person and unlawfully possessing and transporting an illegally killed elk. Haselmeyer was fined $1,070 for hunting a game animal without a valid license and unlawfully possessing and transporting an illegally killed elk.
Glasgow-area FWP Warden Todd Tryan, FWP Region 6 Investigator Lennie Buhmann and FWP Region 7 Warden Mike Krings traveled to New York last year to investigate. They were assisted there by officers with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. One unlawfully killed bull elk was recovered in the case.
“This case would not have come to a successful conclusion without the assistance of the New York conservation officers,” Buhmann said.A FREAK ice storm that created lethal driving conditions led to the death of a driver, an inquest heard.
Aaron Frost, a 25-year-old kitchen fitter, was travelling home from work along the A27 at Emsworth on January 13 this year when he was caught in a hail storm that turned the road into a sheet of ice.
An inquest at Portsmouth Guildhall on Friday heard Aaron lost control of his BMW saloon and crashed into a concrete barrier at the side of the road.
The car then hit a lamppost and overturned before coming to rest on its side in a ditch, close to the onslip at Emsworth, just before the Shell garage.
The inquest heard Aaron was travelling back home to Bognor Regis, having worked in the Petersfield area.
He was chatting on a hands-free mobile phone with his best friend, Jake Gladwin.
In a statement, Jake said he suddenly heard Aaron swear.
He said: “I heard a crash sound. I tried calling for five minutes, but did not get a response.”
Wayne Angus, a lorry driver, said the weather changed very quickly that evening, about 7.50pm.
“The hail was not coming down, it was coming sideways,” he said.
“That’s when everything started to go crazy.”
Several cars and a van on both sides of the road started to skid and spin.
Mr Angus stopped his lorry and spotted the stricken BMW down an embankment.
“The ice on the floor was thick,” he said.
“I nearly fell over. Everyone was skidding.”
Paramedics took Aaron to St Richard’s Hospital, in, recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying Aaron was ‘blameless’ in what happened.
He said: “What happened to Aaron happened in a split second.
“From driving on a perfectly safe road, in a split second, they were all in an extremely dangerous position where we had this flash ice storm.”
After the inquest, Aaron’s aunt Glenna Frost, from Bognor Regis, said: “He was a lovely lad and his family really miss him.
“It’s such a tragic accident. It was just the wrong place at the wrong time.”

Hundreds Gather in Pittsburgh to Tackle Pressing Human Rights Concerns; Environmental Rights, Death Penalty Are Front and Center
Amnesty International Human Rights Conference Highlights Organization’s 50th Anniversary, Takes Place Nov. 19-21
PITTSBURGH, PA - Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) will bring together hundreds of activists from five mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia from November 19-21 for the organization's annual regional human rights conference. This year's theme, Shine A Light: 50 Years of Activism, highlights Amnesty International's 50th anniversary and spotlights some of the most critical human rights issues today. Open to the public, the event will take place at the Omni William Penn Hotel, 530 William Penn Place, Pittsburgh. The cost of attendance ranges from $40 to $75, on a sliding scale.
"This is a landmark year for Amnesty International and its more than 2.8 million members worldwide," said Folabi Olagbaju, AIUSA's Mid-Atlantic regional director. "As we approach our 50th anniversary, our mid-Atlantic activists will show Pittsburgh the organization's powerful legacy of defending individual freedoms and human dignity. From the death penalty to tackling extreme poverty, our membership from Pittsburgh and beyond has demonstrated the dedication needed to effect real change."
Opening the conference on Saturday, AIUSA Executive Director Larry Cox will highlight a half century of successful human rights activism. Other keynote speakers include Mexico's Rodolfo Montiel Flores, a former Amnesty International "prisoner of conscience" who was wrongly imprisoned for more than a year and a half on drug- and firearm-related charges after authorities extracted a confession under torture. He will speak about his struggles to protest multinational corporations' clear-cut logging in his country and how the support of Amnesty International members helped secure his freedom. Ellen Dorsey, executive director of Wallace Global Funds and former chair of AIUSA's Board of Directors, will look to the next frontier of the human rights struggle as AIUSA prepares for its next 50 years of human rights work.
At 4:30 p.m. on Mellon Square (across from the Omni William Penn hotel), more than 200 activists will kick off the organization's 50th anniversary by joining an aerial art project. Using the anniversary theme of Shine A Light, participants will form the iconic Amnesty International candle and barbed-wire logo and illuminate it at dusk with LED lights. Media can photograph and film the event from the upper stories of the hotel. The project will mark Amnesty International's presence in Pittsburgh and will serve as a model for similar activities in communities throughout the mid-Atlantic region during the 50th anniversary year.
Next conference-goers will attend a special Saturday evening forum on community human rights co-sponsored by the United Steel Workers Union (USW) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The forum, from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m., is designed to connect priority AI campaigns with important human rights issues in the community. Speakers include Celeste Taylor of the Regional Equity Monitoring Project (REMP); Fred Redmond, USW's international vice president; Gayle Moss, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP); and Witold "Vic" Walczak, legal director of ACLU-Pennsylvania. AIUSA Deputy Executive Director Gouri Sadhwani will moderate.
On Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., activists will explore key areas of Amnesty International's work as former prisoners of conscience and human rights defenders share their stories, followed by a question and answer session. Ray Krone, who was exonerated from Pennsylvania's death row after being imprisoned for two years and eight months years for a crime he did not commit.

A horse has died despite being rescued from a cliff face where it was found hanging by a tether around its neck.
The animal was still breathing when cut down from the cliff by an RSPCA officer about 19:30 GMT on Friday, at Pakefield, near Lowestoft, Suffolk.
In a race against the tide, the unconscious pony was rescued from the beach and taken to the Norfolk-based Redwings Horse Sanctuary for treatment.
The horse died from a collapsed windpipe on arrival at the charity.
RSPCA inspector Nicky Thorne, who responded to a call from the public, thought the horse was already dead when she found it dangling from the cliff.
But she realised it was still breathing and cut it loose with a pocket knife.
'Untold distress'
The horse was unconscious and the fire service gave oxygen during the six hour rescue.
Ms Thorne said: "By this point, I was shaking and in shock - all I could think about was the horse and I didn't want to leave him.
The fire service were absolutely excellent, I can't thank them enough."
John Tiffen, from Suffolk Fire and Recue, said: "We had to try and work out how to rescue the horse, which was difficult due to its location in an isolated spot between Lowestoft and Kessingland, further complicated with an incoming tide."
The cob died just as he was being unloaded at the Redwing sanctuary.
Vet Nic de Brauwere said: "This was a tragic and totally unnecessary loss of life.
"A matter of a few feet in where the pony was tethered would have meant the difference between life and death.
"The experience must have caused him untold distress."
Ms Thorne added: "I was so upset - I kept telling the horse he would be the most famous and looked after horse in Suffolk if he pulled through.
"To lose him after six hours of trying to save him was awful."Alice Hunt, 89, of California, died Feb. 2, 2013.

Visitation will be 11 a.m.-1 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 7, at the Peoples Funeral Home in Butler. Funeral will immediately follow. Interment will be at the Oakland Cemetery in Grants Lick.In response to something I wrote about the Don Imus saga Friday, Matt, a journalism graduate school friend of mine, replied and made his case quite succinctly. Another friend, Karl, weighed in, as did I. With our back-and-forth in mind, I'd like to add some detail to my point-of-view. If I may make so bold, Matt's entire argument can be summarized in his own words: "By calling for (and ultimately causing) the firing of Don Imus, it sets a bad precedent for free speech." I disagree, and, though I am as firm a defender of free speech as he, I would like to take this argument in a different direction, speaking to both the issues of our freedoms and the role of the people-powered movement in the debate.
Before I do that, however, I'd like to address another of Matt's central assertions, the importance of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson in determining Imus's eventual fate. Matt wrote, "What happened here was a vast minority of people took full use of the media resources around them (in this case, Rev. Al and Jesse Jackson) and created a situation where there was a perceived national outcry against this particular discussion. Advertisers and corporate executives were pressured into firing Imus lest they be subject to continued protesting outside of their offices. In the face of this pressure, advertisers dropped out and corporate was forced to fire Imus." Quite simply, no.
Sharpton wasn't responsible for Imus's firing. Nor was Jackson. Nor was I. Don Imus was responsible for what happened to Don Imus. He said something both woefully stupid and incredibly bigoted, millions of people took note of the man's sad track record of similar statements, and they responded. What Imus-defenders may perceive as the start of the story - the response - only occurred because Imus so polluted the airwaves. The fault is clear: It begins and ends with Imus. Now, back to my point, about what I think is the collision between the old way of doing things and the new way of doing things. This intersection is especially apparent in the uproar surrounding Imus's statements.
Imus - and his many, many peers still gainfully employed (Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh, for instance) - represent what I'll call "active assholery". In the past, active assholery was met only with what I'll call "passive participation" or, worse yet, nothing at all. In other words, people like Beck would enjoy free rein to pollute the airwaves with all manner of hate speech, while the rest of us had to sit there and take it. If you don't like my choice of phrase, why not use Matt's chosen frame, the free market model? There, our choice was easy: Listen, or don't. Take it, or ... take it. Even the most aggressive tools at our disposal were anything but.
I'm not interested in capitalism winning out. I'm interested in democracy winning out. Expect the market to take care of people like Imus? If that's the case, the market has been doing a terrible, terrible job. In my model, on the other hand, active assholery meets active participation. When confronted with the Imuses and Becks of the world, we no longer have to take it. We can, and should, do something about it. And I fail to see why their rights to speak out trump ours. Referring to the Imus matter, Matt wrote, "The way it was done, in my opinion, subverts that Constitution and opens up a whole different discussion about what free speech truly is." Not so. What would have subverted the Constitution would have been to embrace the old model, to do nothing. By taking back our rights, we actively embraced all that's good about that brilliant document.
Thinking about it through this frame, I see nothing at all wrong with contacting journalists, their employers or their corporate partners and voicing our concerns. How is that different from contacting our elected officials? Sure, the outcome may not be the same, but the intent often is: Seeking responsiveness and the awareness of a particular point-of-view. By likening what happened to Imus to what he believes could happen to me, Matt does a tremendous disservice to his argument. Why? Because, at the core, we're not talking about punishing speech with which people don't happen to agree. We're talking about fighting back against what has been a steady stream of hate speech. Matt's counterexample to the Imus firing - a coordinated right-wing response to my writings - falls flat because my criticisms of those whom the right-wingers admire never, ever wade into the use of flatly bigoted language.
These are the sort of traps we face on a near-daily basis: Contact an advertiser about a prominent media personality using bigoted language and we're taking part in a partisan witch hunt, but make legitimate criticisms of the Bush administration and face ouster simply because we said something with which conservatives disagree. See the problem? As a progressive, I've become used to being confronted regularly with these sort of false equivalencies. And when we're not being held subject to such scrutiny, we're being barraged with muddying arguments like those now being made about rappers' use of the word "ho". This is why, I'm sure, someone will accuse me of being a hypocrite for writing something like this in the past. You told people to change the channel. We're telling you to change the channel. What's the difference? But what I wrote about then - content with which one disagrees - bears no similarity to what I'm writing about now, truly bigoted content.
Who, in the long run, will be more hurt by what Imus said - Imus, or the Rutgers women's basketball team? Certainly not Imus, who, after some time in civil society's penalty box, will surely be back, perhaps on satellite radio (and perhaps, due to the attention now being paid him, at an even higher pay grade). When that happens, there's nothing in Imus's history that tells us his contrition won't be short-lived. The team, meanwhile, will, no matter what heights the women reach in their lives, always face the stigma of being called "nappy-headed hos". This goes far beyond hurt feelings and, in doing so, beyond a simple First Amendment argument. Imus hasn't lost his freedom of speech, He's lost his job. His employers terminated him not because his actions posed a First Amendment crisis; they did so because his continued employment posed a bottom-line crisis. So, in that way, what happened was a victory for the market. And democracy.
Comment PreferencesToday I am joining up with Lisa from Pine Ridge Treasures for her My Favorite Things blog hop. She sent us a wonderful collection of beads, all of her favorites, and I can't wait to see what everyone made.
I of course forgot to take a picture of everything before I started. I received a lovely mix of rose quartz, crystals and pearls. I also received these beautiful beads, but I have no idea what they are.
They are pink and grey and just sparkle. The pictures don't do them justice. I have 2 of them left, I think they want to be a bracelet.
I hurt my neck and shoulder 2 weeks ago and it's been very hard to sit and make any jewelry. I did manage to finish one piece, but I still have so many ideas floating around in my head for the rest of the kit. I can't wait until it is better and I can make some more pieces.
Here is the necklace I made. I wrapped the focal with black steel wire. I was going to do a tassel at the bottom, but I really think I like it the way it is.

Kim Dworak, Cianci Blue <-------- You are here!The streets of Minneapolis were a hard pill for this Portland local to swallow. They were devoid of true classics short of the sunny Sunday posers. Portland on the other hand is the Mecca for classic cars that are actually used daily. I guess this makes sense considering the harsh Minneapolis winters and corrosive salt capable of destroying cars, old and new, in no time. So I was surprised and impressed to see this rusty, oil-leaking Swedish classic stationed near the Walker Art Center. B18 badge and Swedish flag proudly displayed, I wondered if this survivor belonged to one of the Scandinavian natives of Minnesota (Viking or something). It was an odd combo, Walker Art Center, the home of modern art, and a half-dead, classic 122S. Nevertheless a pretty good choice for the slippery Minneapolis roads – it was the first car with three-point seat belts, and the first to have any kind of seat belt as standard equipment. They don’t call ‘em safe for nothing folks.
