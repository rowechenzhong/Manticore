Roberto Martinez has described £28million Romelu Lukaku as one of the best young players in the world.
The Everton boss has also admitted his team were not ready for the Champions League after narrowly missing out on a top four finish last season.
Lukaku will instead spearhead the club in the Europa League but Martinez is confident that the marksman derided by Jose Mourinho will continue proving that the Toffees are on the way up.
The 21-year-old scored 16 goals on loan at Goodison last season and Martinez said: .
Romelu Lukaku's career in pictures:
“Sometimes you spend a big amount on a player and that puts massive, massive pressure on him because he has to settle in and fulfil expectations. With Romelu it is almost the opposite, it is about allowing him to be more confident and happier because we showed incredible faith."
Everton blew the chance to finish in the Champions League places for only the second time last season.
Their 72-point tally, however, surpassed anything achieved David Moyes and Martinez believes European football’s elite competition would have come too soon for the club anyway.
Senior goals scored by age of 21
He added: “Our campaign was worthy of Champions League football and that is what we can work on.
“If I am honest, going into the Europa League is probably more what we need, rather than going straight into the Champions League and not being ready for it.
“To experience the Europa League is going to tell us a lot about where we are and how ready we are. But the ultimate aim of getting into the Champions League will always be there.”
Martinez has also likened Ross Barkley to Wayne Rooney and believes the 20-year-old midfielder is ready to step up a gear this season.
The Spaniard, whose side open their campaign at Leicester on Saturday, said: “Ross always sees Wayne as an incredible figure, obviously as an Evertonian growing and there things that take you back to what Wayne was doing as a young man.
“But they are very much different although I do think they could play together. That doesn’t mean I’m saying anything!
“Ross is an incredible character. I have never seen someone so well balanced after being involved in the World Cup. He hasn’t changed in training, if anything it is the opposite. He wants to be even more focused and humble.
“I think he is quite a unique talent, I don’t think we have had one like that for many generations, never mind for many years because it’s quite rare to find someone who is so technically gifted, but then has got the physicality to go with it, then the personality - someone emotionally is very, very composed.
“Those three aspects you don’t get them together in one player, especially at that age.”

In Mennonite in a Little Black Dress (Holt, Oct.), Job has nothing on Rhoda Janzen, whose memoir we enter at midlife. She's recently endured a hysterectomy that left her with a punctured bladder; her bipolar husband of 15 years makes a swell nurse, but once she's mended, he's off with “a guy named Bob.” Then things get worse. On a snowy drive home to her now unaffordable lake home, a teen drunk driver crashes into her, leaving her broken and bruised. “Under circumstances like these, what was a forty-three-year-old gal to do? I'll tell you what I did. I went home to the Mennonites.” In consistently deadpan style, Janzen reports on the anachronistic culture in which she was raised and presents hilarious parental portraits. Dad's many charms include a maddening passivity and a penchant for public prayer at Denny's. But it was mom's lark-in-springtime personality that had me in hysterics. Peppered with Menno recipes, Janzen's memoir is a tasty treat.High School Sports

"I am the happiest girl in the world; my mother and father will not circumcise me" - a young girl from Kalioubia and participant in the Reduction of Female Genital Mutilation project.
Despite Egypt’s banning of female circumcision – also referred to as female genital mutilation (FGM) – in the 1990s, the practice is still widespread, and in rural areas such as Kalioubia or Giza, is almost universal among girls aged 7 to 12.
Most girls are not consulted, nor do they consent to the practice. FGM is one of the most blatant denials of girls’ human rights. The practice also compromises girls’ health and social development.
Abolishing the practice has proven extremely difficult since it is maintained through long-held customs that are deeply rooted in communities and family life.
Protecting girls
The Reduction of Female Genital Mutilation project, which started in 2006, is sponsored by Plan Egypt in collaboration with government and civil society at national, regional and local levels (including the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM), local departments of the Ministry of Social Solidarity, the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health, and 10 community development associations).
A human rights based approach underpins the strategy ultimately to reduce and eliminate FGM by tackling harmful attitudes and beliefs in communities through the creation of local coordination and gender committees.
Increasing awareness
Work with and through these entities has increased the understanding of parents, community leaders, and members of community development organisations of the harmful psychological and physical impacts on girls and the role they can play in the fight for its elimination.
Capacity has been built locally to deliver advocacy and awareness activities for parents and others who play a key role in maintaining the practice. Children themselves have been sensitised on the harmfulness of FGM and informed of their human rights.
More than 7,000 girls and women have so far been supported through capacity building and service delivery.

- Sets must include complete interiors
- All detail bricks must be printed -- no stickers
With that being said, I'd like to being the suggestion process :)
Police Precinct
Outside Design: Light tan brick with steps front and center -- "POLICE" light globes on either side of steps -- leading to double front doors. Similar to 1940's themed detective / police series. Building should be 2 stories -- with roof steeple and design similar to Beverly Hills police precinct / Los Angeles City Hall. No back area to maximize potential space internally.
Inside Design: 1st Floor -- reception desk, questioning area, jail cell, elevator. 2nd floor -- offices with large room for 2 or 3 desks in the open. Roof: Steeple and antennas.
First National Bank
Outside Design: Dark tan brick with glass door, and windows in the center. Windows should have printed design -- "BANK" in gold, with sand blasted privacy look on bottom half. Should feature an ATM machine -- where back of ATM is behind the counter, and accessible from inside the bank. Building should be 2 stories with bottom story the height of 2 (similar to the fire brigade). Windows should feature arches on the top, with 4 window panels per section.
Inside Design: 1st story should feature a waiting area and desk - and counter with 2 or 3 stations. Counter should feature bars or security glass with computer and drawers on the business side. Counter should have a tiny hole for money to be passed from outside. 2nd story should feature an office with a safe. Safe should have 2x4 studded walls with vault door complete with wheel. Would be nice if the walls could have some drawers for safe deposit boxes.
Landmark Theater
Outside Design: 3 story building with marquee overhanging the street. Entrance should look similar to El Capitan Theater in Los Angeles, complete with ticket booth before entrance, and in-wall posters on each side of the exterior. Marquee should look similar to the Town Plan, but on a larger scale, and should rise vertically past roof.
Inside Design: Bottom floor should feature bathrooms and snack stand. Stairs should be on the side of the room. 2nd and 3rd floors should be theaters -- small as they may be.

Horror movies Review
"You can’t kill the bogeyman," the children insist to a terrorized Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) in the original Halloween. How right they are. Laurie is gone, but guess who’s back in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers? Acting as if the third entry never existed, this installment picks up 10 years after the original, with mad maniac Myers in a coma and moved to a new facility. But wouldn’t you know it that as soon as a loose-lipped orderly lets slip that Myers has a surviving niece he springs back into action, leaving a bloody trail of corpses on the road to Haddonfield. Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Loomis, scarred and crippled from his last encounter with Myers and seething with a fanatical zeal to stop the freak from repeating his previous rampage. Pleasance is the best thing about the film as an aging hero seemingly on the verge of madness who drags a bum leg in his manic rush to save little orphan Jamie (Danielle Harris), the 10-year-old waif terrorized by her homicidal uncle. Director Dwight Little has managed a generic if professional slasher picture, rife with improbabilities and dominated by a killer whose superhuman powers reach near-mystical dimensions, but he delivers the goods: shocks, stabs, and cold, cruel killings. —Sean Axmaker
Synopsis:Ten years after his original massacre, the invalid Michael Myers awakens and returns to Haddonfield to kill his seven-year-old niece on Halloween. Can Dr. Loomis stop him?

I hope he is doing well, but I think we’ve seen over the last 6 months, that there are a lot of capable people at Apple. Nothing to see here, move along.
I got a new liver 20 years ago and it worls perfectly! So this should not be a problem.
Personally, I wish people wouldn’t report this stuff. Jobs obviously doesn’t want it published. Further, the information has obviously been leaked without permission. Accordingly, that makes it a violation of privacy laws. As a stockholder, all I care about is that the Board has somebody running the show who is capable of doing so. Currently, it does. If Jobs returns, he will obviously feel capable of doing so as well.
The guy deserves a break and like the rest of us US citizens his medical issues should remain private. It is enough to know he is on a medical leave and he will be expected back by such and such time. .
Say a prayer for him if you’re inclined to, then let’s get back to hammering on AT&T about the delays in MMS and tethering. Oh, and the not so friendly upgrade pricing for 3G owners. I know their reasoning, I even understand it, but since we’re loyal customers anyway, they’re STILL gonna get my money unless they keep making bonehead moves like that. If they lose the exclusive contract, I think they’re gonna lost a HUGE number of customers. People just aren’t happy with Step-Ma Bell.
Hey it’s early. Typos are bound to happen. lost = lose
Given that the WSJ article contains the phrase, “Mr. Jobs didn’t respond to an email requesting comment.”, I think what we have here is one of two things…
1) a fabrication.
2) a HIPPA violation (disclosing someones medical information without their consent).
The way I read HIPPA (), the WSJ is only in violation of retransmitting private health information. They didn’t initially disclose it. Somebody else did, making it stolen information and the WSJ an accessory to the transgression.
Or in plain English, they didn’t steal it, but they sure attempted to profit from the stolen information. (Isn’t fencing stolen property a crime?) We’re not talking about state secrets, or cover up, it’s a man’s private health record that he obviously wants to remain private while he is on leave.
Amazing but just prior to my liver transplant I read the Commencement Speech by Steve Jobs at Stanford, which inspired me greatly. I too, received my transplant in only (9) days of being listed. I absolutely do not have money to even compare salaries with Steve Jobs, that would be a joke! Money can get you ahead, so I hear, but if your life is on the line rich or poor, oftentimes everything turns out well. I am only 55 yrs old, have a family and when I was told I had liver cancer my husband and I prepared for the worst. I am elated he has done well, I have had some difficulties but still reaching for a positive recovery.
I would love nothing more than to hear from Steve Jobs personally. I do wish him well.

B@1 (ex The Legion), Shoreditch
View:
FancyaPint?'s review...
Formerly called The Legion and run by the people behind the Social, this late night bar is now called Be@1. Part of a growing chain of terribly named shiny cocktail bars, this one describes itself as having "an edgy, underground feel", where you can you "hang out with the East end cool crowd". A depressing sentiment if ever there was one, any place which has to promote a bar on the premise that it is filled with the 'East end cool crowd', is more likely to be filled with anything but. And indeed it was exactly like this when we popped in on a Friday night - a tedious bar filled with City workers and Leicester Square refugees, all necking drinks to make the most of the Happy Hour. Despite becoming more mainstream over the years, there are still many interesting venues to visit in Shoreditch. B@1 isn't one of them.

By Dr. Paul Kengor
By Dr. Paul Kengor
Editor’s note: A longer version of this article first appeared at American Spectator. or the other. Thus, maybe the better question is: Can Santorum articulate and defend social conservatism better than Romney can defend free markets? Which of the two is a more forceful, eloquent spokesperson for the area that Obama and Axelrod will use to define and malign him?
Not only has President Obama been employing class rhetoric unceasingly for three years now, but David Axelrod has been planning was the plan even before the Occupy Wall Street movement exploded. Axelrod and Obama view Mitt Romney as red meat for the Occupy movement, the poster-boy for Wall Street greed.
“[Romney] says he represents business,” Axelrod told MSNBC in October, “but he really represents the Wall Street side of business.”
Axelrod told George Stephanopoulos that Romney is “not a job creator” but a “corporate raider” who outsourced “tens of thousands of jobs,” “closed down more than 1,000 plants, stores, and offices,” and joined “his partners” in making “hundreds of millions of dollars” at the expense of the poor. Axelrod calls this the “Bain mentality.”
This caustic, class-warfare rhetoric is just a taste of what will come if Romney gets the GOP nomination. The class envy will get far worse. And no one will do it better than a smiling Obama.
Perhaps the only thing that might energize the president and his team more is a battle with the Catholic Church over his HHS mandate on “contraception.” And that’s where Rick Santorum comes in.
I’m increasingly convinced that President Obama wants this fight with the Catholic Church. I think this is a fight not only close to Obama’s ideological heart, but one he perversely feels can help him politically. If he can frame this debate as not about taxpayer support of abortion drugs, or about religious liberty, or freedom of conscience, or the First Amendment and Constitution—all of which it is—but about “women’s rights” vs. the stodgy old men who run the Catholic Church, he will make headway with certain voters. Don’t underestimate Obama’s ability to do just that.
If Rick Santorum becomes the 2012 GOP nominee, he’ll be an automatic spokesman for the Catholic Church’s position. He’s a living, breathing testimony to the Church’s teaching, from his own personal life to his well-informed intellect on Church teachings. Rick Santorum is the rarest candidate who has actually read Church encyclicals like Humanae Vitae and Evangelium Vitae.
That’s just fine for President Obama and David Axelrod. They’ll take that guy any day. Hey, buddy, you want a culture war based on Catholic Church teachings? You got it!
Never mind, of course, that President Obama started this fight with his heavy-handed decree to the Catholic Church. The president’s protective media will behave as if Rick Santorum is the intrusive one, rudely and righteously thrusting his faith into the “public square.” The media will not portray Santorum as simply reacting to Obama’s totally unnecessary decree and intrusion—which is what really happened—but as a sexist Neanderthal who just can’t pull his nose out of your bedroom.
So, that brings us back to my original question for Republicans: Which of the two—Romney or Santorum—is a more forceful, eloquent spokesperson for the issues that Obama and Axelrod will use to define and malign him? I think the answer is Santorum, which is less a vote for Santorum than a vote of no confidence in Romney’s persuasive abilities. Or does that bring us back to Newt, assuming Newt remains politically viable?
One thing is certain: Neither of these Obama-Axelrod tactics will unify Americans; it will divide them, pitting them against each other by class or religion, by income or faith, by money or conscience. And that isn’t a good thing, especially from a president who promised to be a unifier and symbol of “hope.”

expressed herein may, but do not necessarily, reflect the views of Grove City College.Since writing this post about how Christians are accused of resorting to the slippery slope fallacy when arguing against homosexuality, I’ve wanted to post some examples about what actual slippery slopes look like. I finally got the gumption to seek out a certain ad campaign that made a meme out of slippery slope arguments, which turned out to be by DirectTV.
Just as a reminder, the Fallacy Files defines the slippery slope in this way:
If A happens, then by a gradual series of small steps through B, C,…, X, Y, eventually Z will happen, too.
Z should not happen.
Therefore, A should not happen, either.
The Fallacy Files also has this to say about the slippery slope:
This type of argument is by no means invariably fallacious, but the strength of the argument is inversely proportional to the number of steps between A and Z, and directly proportional to the causal strength of the connections between adjacent steps. If there are many intervening steps, and the causal connections between them are weak, or even unknown, then the resulting argument will be very weak, if not downright fallacious.
As you can see, the commercials lampoon slippery slope arguments by having many steps with weak causal connections between them, making them “very weak, if not downright fallacious.”
On the other hand, the case for polygamy – which Christians are mocked as appealing to the slippery slope for even bringing up – sits on entirely the same ground as that of “gay marriage,” as proven by the favorable decision granted to the Brown family of Utah (of Sister Wives fame). Their argument “relied primarily on the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down the Texas law banning sodomy, which was celebrated by gay rights advocates.”
All this is just to say: do not be cowed into silence by the slippery slope accusation. Know your fallacies, and be ready to explain to others why this argument is not a fallacious slippery slope.Size Guide

Reflections from the yoga mat.
I was inspired by Kate Bartolotta’s recent post, So What Do Gomukhasana and Joseph Campbell Have in Common? This post got me thinking about what it is that I get from stepping onto my yoga mat almost every day.
Here’s what I came up with:
1. Unapologetic “me” time. My yoga practice requires me to step inside of my own skin and focus on myself. At so many other points throughout my day, I’m needed by my toddler. There are definitely times when I’ve wondered if my daily practice is selfish, but I come to the same conclusion over and over again. I am a better mother to her because I have this space for myself.
2. Health. I’ll be the first to admit that I came to my yoga practice for my body. Yet I don’t think I ever expected my physical self to ultimately be the last thing I hop onto my mat for. Still, there’s no denying that I love the body that my yoga practice has made—and I love the health and invigoration I feel both during my mat and during the rest of my daily life.
3. Self-growth. I have absolutely grown as a person because of my yoga practice. It’s forced me to confront my ego, my needs for control and perfection, and my deeply ingrained type-A personality—and I can’t believe how much of these self-defining qualities no longer define me because of my practice.
4. Patience. I’m certainly not a patient person, but I’m more patient than I used to be. I think part of this comes from simply working on poses that literally took me years to get into the full posture (or I’m still working on). My practice has also taught me to enjoy those poses between poses—better known as life.
5. Take time to be still. Some of my best practices involve me sitting in the same place on my mat; focusing on my breath or getting deeply into one posture and then holding it. I’ve taken this stillness out into my daily life, and for a hyperactive ADD person, this is a huge accomplishment, no medication required.
6. I’m not the same person every day, and that’s okay. I can be a really moody lady, and my mat has let me come to terms with this. During my yoga practice, I feel out how my body and my moods are shifting all the time—and I’ve learned that my life is often most successful when I acknowledge and accept my current situations rather than always swimming upstream.
7. Happiness is my responsibility. Sure, other people can affect our moods—but they don’t get credit for causing them. Your happiness is your responsibility, period. My yoga practice gets the credit for this realization because I learned how much power and control I have over myself from my mat time. Example: if I’m distracted during a balance pose, it’s not the fault of the girl in front of me in class, it’s mine. Another example: during my home practice, I can really take the time to reflect on how I feel in the present moment physically, emotionally, and mentally; and I’ve experienced the power in letting these feelings fall away as I just focus on flowing from pose to pose. Many times, all that ends up being left afterwards is ease and a deep sensation of tranquility.
8. My body is beautiful. No, I didn’t reach this conclusion because of the physical body that my practice sculpts. Rather, I’ve been able to find an appreciation for myself on a much deeper level and this has forced me to accept that quite often, the level of satisfaction we have with our outer bodies is directly connected to the level of satisfaction we have with ourselves internally.
9. Yoga exists off the mat. Ironically, having a regular practice of asanas has taught me to see the yoga that I practice constantly, when I’m no where near my mat.
10. Be open. A lot of Kate’s blog revolved around the need to open ourselves up. For me, this is probably the most impacting thing I’ve learned from my mat time. Through poses I thought I’d never access and then did, I’ve learned to be open to final outcomes that you never expected or even dreamed of. I’ve also learned that opening your heart to other people, and to your own self, is scary and vulnerable—but it’s necessary to live your existence to its fullest. Open your heart, even when it hurts; because otherwise you will not experience the full range of joy that life has to offer either.
Let me say that these are the most life-impacting things I’ve learned from my regular yoga practice. Are these going to be the same important things you gain from your mat time? Probably not, because you and I are not the same; and I think I could make that number 11—to get the most from your yoga practice you have to tune in and experience it yourself.
Fortunately and unfortunately, the best aspects of life cannot be taught—they have to be lived and experienced by you alone.
I do hope, however, that this list of lessons from my own personal experience has inspired you to figure out exactly what it is that you get from your own practice. Why, exactly, do you step on your mat?
Once you answer that, find more questions..}

[…] […]
Anytime me and my wife doing yoga, we feel much more relaxed and calm for a long time. I notice for me morning time is the best time to do yoga. I guess it's different for everyone.
Yoga has way more to it than getting a healthier body. While many people like myself will come to a Yoga class for getting a better body, I am pretty sure each of them do experience the spiritual aspects of it at some time if they stick to it. Over years of my Yoga practice, I have experiences huge range of benefits from Yoga. Thanks for summing up your Yoga experience in these ten beautiful points and sharing them here.Advertisement:

Solutions To Job Related Discomfort - Lightweight Duty Gear From Bianchi
For Immediate Release
TEMECULA CA; JANUARY 2003 - Today's officers are carrying more weight on their duty belt then ever before, which has departments across the country looking into ways to reduce the number of officer complaints of job related discomfort. Bianchi International, in recognition of this issue, has developed an entire line of lightweight duty gear they call AccuMold® Elite™, which specifically addresses these concerns.
"Bianchi's AccuMold® products have gained a worldwide reputation for being lightweight, extremely comfortable and durable," says Natt Stevens, National Law Enforcement Sales Manager for Bianchi. Stevens continued, In the early days AccuMold® was only available in ballistic weave nylon which meant it was limited to departments that allowed web gear or would make an exception if the officer had a note from his or her physician. That all changed two years ago when Bianchi introduced their new AccuMold® Elite™ line, which has all the benefits of AccuMold® but now features a tough DuraSkinTM finish that looks just like leather. This new generation of lightweight gear has been so popular that Bianchi has expanded the line to include their ErgoTekTM ergonomic duty belts and their new lightweight SL3.2.1TM SpeedLokTM duty holster with Auto RetentionTM, (including its own built-in ergonomic pad on the belt loop.)
If your duty gear hurts and you're looking for a great alternative, try Bianchi's AccuMold® EliteTM. Call Bianchi at 1-800-477-8545 to ask about their Police Testing and Evaluation Program. Bianchi offers a wide range of holsters, accessories and belts offered in black: plain, basketweave and hi-gloss DuraskinTM finish. All reasonably priced; patent pending.
Back to previous pageChancellor George Osborne will stand up in the House of Commons today to make an Autumn Statement on the government's finances and the prospects for the economy.
The statement will be full of references to growth. The Chancellor's likely failure to meet his deficit and debt targets will be attributed to the weak underlying growth of the UK economy after the financial crisis. More austerity will be needed to meet his targets.
There will be no mention in his statement that his own policy has played a considerable part in the current weakness of the British economy.
It is true that the Chancellor can point to the views of the OBR, IFS, and others who believe that the supply capacity of the UK economy has been damaged by the financial crisis and Great Recession. In technical terms their view is that productivity growth is so slow and the recovery so weak because the crisis has led to productive capacity being lost forever in particular sectors and activities. The 'output gap' between supply and demand is small. Hence, to get more growth more capacity is needed. And that requires investment by both public and private sectors.
There is no doubt that there is some truth in this story. Labour productivity is clearly weak. But there is little other evidence that the economy is supply constrained.
A supply constrained economy would see wages and other factor prices rising quickly generally and specifically in those sectors that are most supply constrained.
There is no evidence of this.
Although advocates of the supply-constrained view suggest that wages and prices would be falling if the output gap was large. But this surely flies in the face of all the evidence that wages and prices are sticky downwards in most modern economies.
Moreover, with interest rates close to zero, at the zero lower bound, the economy is in a liquidity trap with nominal rates unable to fall far enough to equate the demand and supply of money, and savings and investment. The result is a deficiency of aggregate demand unless and until demand increases directly. And what we do see is clear evidence of a lack of demand. Household spending is weak, investment is weak, net export demand is weak and the government is engaging in an unprecedented programme of fiscal consolidation.
So what can we conclude?
First, estimates of the output gap are just that: estimates, difficult to realise and subject to error. Secondly, suppose, as Simon Wren Lewis argues that supply is following demand. Raise demand and supply increases as discouraged workers re-enter the labour market, as firms raise production from their existing workforce by staff beginning again to operate at more normal levels of input, and as idle plant and machinery - from bankrupt and closed firms as well as currently operating firms - is brought on stream. Thirdly, if supply also follows demand and then after a time is lost forever - what economists call hysteresis effects - then the costs of not seeking to stimulate demand are high.
Against this background Wren Lewis argues that
policy should lean towards being optimistic about supply, even if we are somewhat sceptical that it is really following demand - because the costs of self-fulfilling output gap pessimism could be so high.
But we won't get that in the Autumn Statement today.
Any spending changes the Chancellor introduces are likely to be at best fiscally neutral and at worst fiscally tightening. That is he will either seek to keep to his budget deficit targets or may tighten them.
Spending more on capital investment projects, schools and hospitals, will, if it comes at the cost of reduced spending elsewhere in departmental budget, have little if any stimulative effect on aggregate demand. Indeed, if the deficit target tightens it may have a depressive effect on the economy.
One way that the changes might stimulate demand is if the fiscal multipliers associated with the spending rises are higher than those associated with the areas where spending is being cut. We don't have relevant UK data. But I have my doubts. Increased spending on so-called 'shovel-ready' capital projects will boost supply in the medium to longer term. But will it boost demand in the short term if it is funded by civil service redundancies in other government departments?
It may do since the fiscal multiplier on infrastructure and particularly capital spending on roads and highways is, from US research, quite high. But it won't be that much higher than the negative spending effect of civil service job cuts and other spending cutbacks.
Moreover, even if the British economy is severely supply constrained this doesn't excuse the Chancellor's policy of extreme fiscal consolidation. There is clear evidence that his policy has taken demand out of the economy. Are the Chancellor and his supporters really seeking to argue that without fiscal consolidation there would have been excess demand and runaway inflation?
The evidence is that his policy has weakened the British and Scottish economies.
In what one might call a 'moderate' or middle-of-the-road assessment, Gavyn Davies and Juan Antolin-Diaz in a Fulcrum Research Paper estimate that "fiscal austerity" since 2010 has accounted for almost half of the shortfall in UK GDP relative to the US since 2007 - see chart below. The other main contender is the UK's weak export performance. And this latter has particular resonance for Scotland.
Davies and Antolin-Diaz assume a fiscal multiplier 0.5 in 2008-2009 and 0.7 in 2010-2012. This is below the range of 0.9 to 1.7 suggested by the IMF in its recent Economic Outlook and below the figure of 2 suggested in the recent US research noted earlier. On this basis the impact of fiscal austerity will be even greater than Davies and Antolin-Diaz's estimates.
But don't expect to see an acknowledgment of any of this amidst the smoke and mirrors of today's Autumn Statement.Microsoft might be a little more scared of Google Apps for Business than it's publicly letting on, according to a new report.
The software giant has, over the last several months, made several moves to stop enterprise customers from adopting Google Apps, according to The Wall Street Journal, which reported on those decisions today. Microsoft has cut pricing on its cloud-based alternative, Office 365, as well as increased commissions it pays to resellers to make the prospect of switching to Google's service less palatable..CRUSOE College year 10 students took to the skies this week to cap off the end of a school aviation program.
Teacher Angelo Giofrelle said the class studied the history of aviation, built their own rockets, learnt to fly remote-controlled air craft and visited the Point Cook Aviation Museum.
He said the program offered students a "test taster" in working in aviation.
"Many of these students are interested in aviation and some will go on to have a career in the industry," he said.
Mr Giofrelle said students got the chance to fly planes at the Bendigo Flying Club on Monday, after wet and rainy weather ruined two previous attempts.
Student Beau Poulter said the program was great.
"I learnt a lot. It was really interesting," he said.
Beau, year 10, said he hoped to work in aviation, in particular specialising in the electrics of air craft.
Mr Giofrelle said this was the program's first year and it would be continued..
- By paying off important financial obligations such as auto loans, mortgage, credit card debt, and insurance policies on time, borrowers avoid unnecessary late fees and penalties altogether.
- Paying off outstanding debt for other secured and even unsecured loans by using the cash from this short term loan assists in improving the credit score of borrowers, thus enabling them to be approved of new loans from traditional lenders.
With these outstanding benefits, why wouldn’t you take advantage of this lending service?
Loan Features
- Easy application process
Most lenders operate online, thus eliminating the need for interested customers to waste time on driving to a physical location. The application process online only requires borrowers to fill in basic personal information, employment details, and bank information as well. Once all these are typed onto the application, it’s just a click away from a speedy and efficient loans processing stage.
- No need to submit requirements
Just like faxless payday loans, this kind of loan do not require applicants to send in additional paperwork or documentation to get approval. Lenders only need accurate employment contact details so they can verify the employment status and salary rate of a borrower. It is necessary for lenders to know the total amount of the next expected pay of the borrower so they can determine the amount that they can approve for applicants. Reputable lenders will only approve a loan that is 20% to 30% of a borrower’s net pay. In this way, payday lenders are sure that they can be paid promptly by the borrower and that payday loan customers still have enough money for other expenses.
- Get approved in 24 hours or less
The primary purpose why people in urgent financial need turn loans is that they need fast money. This exactly what traditional lenders fail to deliver to their clients. This kind of loan without credit credit, you can be sure that your loan request will be forwarded to your bank account in 24 hours or less. For borrowers who have good track record in payments with payday loan lenders, the application is approved within an hour or two even!
- Convenient loan payment method
Once the salary day hits, the payment for the loan is automatically deducted from a borrower’s bank account. This method saves the borrower from going to a physical location to pay for the total loan amount owed.
- Higher amount loan request
Borrowers who have good track record with payday lenders are approved of higher loan amounts in the event that they need to make use of similar loans in the future. There are a handful of lenders who approve for a loan request up to $3,000.
With all the benefits and advantages that no credit check loans offer to the public, it is not surprising that more people are having the ability solve their short-term financial dilemmas, which in turn assist borrowers in their pursuit of ultimate financial freedom in the future. As a responsible reminder, Personal Debt Relief strongly advise the public to borrow responsibly.Sen. Marco Rubio's (R-Fla.) fiscal profile has been the main attraction for conservatives who support him, but he is also crafting a foreign policy reputation, which, if he plans to run for higher office down the road, could make him a more well-rounded candidate.
Rubio chats with National Review's Robert Costa about foreign policy in a piece out today. He identifies the late-Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), a hawkish former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, as his model. He also mentions two books he keeps at his side: "Courting Disaster," former George W.

As much as Rubio has focused on fiscal matters, adopting stances on the debt ceiling and continuing resolutions that have garnered a lot of attention, he frequently discussed foreign policy on the campaign trail in 2010 and it's worth watching how his foreign policy track unfolds as his name continues to be mentioned as a possibility for national office in theAdorno and Art

Namco Bandai Partners VP Olivier Comte thinks games cost too much. So what does he propose?
“With the cost of development and the retail margins, $40 is a fair price [to us], but for the consumer it is too much,” Comte told MCV at a company event in Barcelona. “A good price of a game should be around $20 – but for this price we can’t make a ten to 15-hour adventure. So for $20 we should offer consumers four to five hours of gameplay, then after that we can make additional money with DLC.”
This sounds extremely similar to Valve’s plan for the Half-Life 2 sequel episodes, although Valve wanted to ship shorter games just so they would be able to come out with new titles more often.
“We need to discuss with first parties about the huge difficulties behind the current retail system,” Comte added. Head over to MCV for the rest of Comte’s comments.
Let me add a personal message to Mr. Comte right here: Stop acting like this thing you propose doesn’t already exist on Xbox Live and the Playstation Network and Steam. Look at the new Sam and Max Games or the Penny Arcade games or the Watchman game, all of which were released episodically at a low price point. That’s the basic idea you’re looking for, Mr. Comte. Now you can take that idea and play with it until you come up with a version that best suits your company. Bam.

No Comments on Namco Bandai VP Says Games Cost Too MuchIt was called variously an 'issue', 'affair', 'scandal', 'debacle' and a 'beat-up'. It's been two months since the DCD-in-New-Zealand-milk story broke; now the smoke has cleared and the sweat has dried, what have we learned?
Well, in the wake of this newest Swiss milk crisis, perhaps the biggest lesson is that you're only in trouble for as long as it takes some other unfortunate company to get in more trouble than you. If it's not another company facing a food crisis, it's an environmental one like Beijing's off-the-charts air pollution or 12,000 dead pigs bobbing down Shanghai's Huangpu River.
But industry and PR experts say China moves quickly, consumers move on, and brand equity for foreign companies tends to bounce back easier.
The editor-at-large of government mouthpiece China Daily, Bai Ping, wrote an impassioned column on February 2, which seemed to sum up a lot of the sentiment being expressed by consumers on China's social media.
"Like many sensitive parents, I'd not be easily placated by assurances that 'very low levels' of dicyandiamide, or DCD, in food don't pose a risk after going through the shockwaves of the 2008 tainted milk scandal that killed six infants and left more than 300,000 children with various ailments in the mainland."
But Bai now says consumers have been distracted by the threat of tough new rules limiting how much imported milk powder they can take from Hong Kong back to the mainland.
"I think the pressure on New Zealand milk is easing somewhat in China after Hong Kong imposed a two-can rule that has diverted public attention," he says. "There is still a long way to go before the Chinese public confidence in domestic products can be restored, which may spell both opportunity and risks for New Zealand interests in China."
The risks being more of the same - scares and scandals.
Shanghai-based Kiwi dairy entrepreneur Howard Moore says DCD was a blip and nothing more, though its handling by officials left some things to be desired.
"They've forgotten about it already. It's gone," he says.
"It was a concern at that time but put it in the context of the melamine disaster, which was huge and which people are still talking about today. It [DCD] was a serious blip at the time, but believe me, it's gone."
New Zealander Nick Wheeler is a China veteran of 23 years and the general manager of International PR firm Ketchum's Beijing office.
Wheeler says key lessons from the DCD affair include the expectations that local consumers have for foreign products.
"This really does demonstrate that foreign products are held under even higher scrutiny than local products. There is a perception in China that international brands tend to be higher quality, safer, and that they adhere to higher food and safety standards," he says. "Anything that impacts on the quality of the product that they're giving to their one and only single child, generally speaking, is of course going to cause massive public concern.
"I think maybe one key takeaway for the New Zealand dairy industry is that the bar has just been set even higher for them because this whole DCD issue, which they probably didn't even think was a food safety issue. And perception is reality, right, so now they have to deal with it as a food safety issue even if they say it's not."
The Chinese are so sensitive to food scares both because they happen so often and because the reaction from companies in the wrong is often to flatly deny.
And when the Chinese public are used to being lied to by companies frantically trying to cover their backs it's no wonder they are so unforgiving at even the slightest whiff of a cover-up.
Let's clarify that: even the slightest whiff. That's all you need.
Executive director of the Public Affairs Asia network Craig Hoy advises perception and reality in these cases are one and the same, "which is why it is so important that companies get out in front of the story, even when they have bad news".
"When these issues flare up it is often because the company concerned has chosen to ignore the early warning signs.
"'No comment' is no longer an acceptable response. In China it is essential that companies try as far as possible to be seen to be in control.
"Any sign of a cover-up, or any hint of mixed messaging, and traditional and new media will be on to the story. In China, where bad news on issues such as food safety or public health has often been slow to break, the public is increasingly suspicious."

Doug Farmer has already outlined his plan to invest money into refurbishing homes, and cutting down on neighborhood crime. Phase three is to control property taxes.
He is calling for an Executive budget. It would be created by the mayor after working with each individual department head.
It's been done in the past, but not under the current mayor.
Farmer says the overall goal is to level off property taxes. "If you just keep them from growing and let the other community catch up, it will be good for us, we need to give people a chance to stay in their own homes and that's what we're after here, not tax them out of their houses," said Farmer.
Voters will decided between Farmer and Tim Kabat on Tuesday.Seog H Oh

When one thinks of opera, such towns as New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Santa Fe immediately come to mind. Anniston, Alabama, not so much. Yet, Anniston will get her moment in the limelight of opera on January 25th as world famous baritone Michael Chioldi gives a performance at First Presbyterian Church.
Mr. Chioldi has performed in some of the world's foremost venues; San Francisco Opera, Washington National Opera, Spoleto Festival USA, and the Metropolitan Opera. He even received an EMMY Award for his performance of "Sharpless." The 43-year-old baritone has played many diverse roles starting with his 1995 debut in Washington's presentation of Il barbiere di Siviglia, the title role of Hamlet, Pâris in the Metropolitan production of Roméo et Juliette, to the role of Supervisor Kopp in San Francisco's premiere of the opera Harvey Milk.
With such an impressive pedigree, it is surprising to learn that this sensation of the world of opera enjoys cooking, gambling, and fast cars. His main game is Black Jack and his favourite sports car is the Maserati. He is an avid tennis fan has attended every major in the sport including the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Mr. Chioldi also sings a benefit concert for the homeless every December in New York City, where he currently resides.
He made his solo singing debut at the tender young age of nine, in a small church in his hometown of Avonmore, PA., a small farming and mining community with about 500 residents. He was delivering papers on his regular route, which included the residence of one Rev. Booker, whose daughters (The Booker Sisters) were already quite well known for their singing talents. The young paperboy heard the ladies singing "His Eye is On the Sparrow". When Michael told them he knew the song, the sisters invited him to sing it with them and he was immediately asked to sing at the local Baptist church. With his parent's permission, he found himself singing his first public solo. The congregation expressed enthusiastic approval and Michael was hooked.
Michael Chioldi's performance is brought to us by Jacksonville Opera Theatre. Director of JOT, Dr. Nathan Wight, expresses his enthusiams about being able to bring a singer of Mr. Chioldi's caliber to perform for the local audience, "We are very excited that Mr. Chioldi was able to make a stop here in Anniston between his performances in Palm Beach and Hawaii."
Michael Chioldi will be performing a special concert at Anniston's First Presbyterian Church on Friday, January 25th at 7:30pm. Admission is free, and donations will be accepted to help defray the cost of Mr. Chioldi's travel expenses. For more information about this event, please contact Nathan Wright at (256)-782-5876.

--Marc DuPontRicher Life For 'Redneck Woman'
Singer Gretchen Wilson On Life On 'Every Side Of The Tracks'
In just six months, Gretchen Wilson, a 31-year-old singer from the farm country of southern Illinois, has helped turn the country music world upside down. Her debut album went straight to No. 1, and is the biggest seller of the year for a woman. And that says a lot in an industry where women who sing country music are often groomed to look like supermodels and sound like pop stars.
Wilson hit pay dirt because she's none of that. She'll be the first to tell you she's nothing more than a "redneck" who grew up in a trailer park. And, she tells Correspondent Ed Bradley, she's proud of it.
"Being a redneck is just a way of life. It's where I came from," says Wilson.
"I don't think you have to live in a trailer park to be a redneck. I don't think you have to drive a truck to be a redneck. To me, redneck is a lot deeper than that. It's knowing how to live with what you have, not worrying about having what you don't have."
"Redneck Woman" was her first hit song, and it struck a chord across America, with a message of pride that apparently a lot of people want to hear. With nearly three million CDs sold, Wilson is the country music success story of the year.
"But a lot of people would associate rednecks with racism," Bradley says to Wilson.
"I've never associated being a redneck with racism. I would imagine that there's probably some of the older generation," says Wilson. "That might be, and I wouldn't say racist, but I would say just not knowledgeable. I think my grandpa was a little bit on that side, you know? I love him just the same, but I had to tell people he's just, and I hate to say this about him, but he's just ignorant."
She knows all about what being a redneck means, because she celebrates it in all her songs. She's lived the life she sings about. She's a woman who chews tobacco, and she loves whiskey and longnecks.
Singing about her lifestyle has made her rich almost overnight – but it was a lifetime in the making. She took 60 Minutes in her new tour bus, to where it all started, an hour east of St. Louis, among the small towns and corn fields of southern Illinois.
"I lived on every side of these tracks," says Wilson, laughing.
Her mother was just 16 when she was born and she would be divorced twice by the time she was 20. Her mother worked as a bartender to raise Wilson and her half brother, and they moved around a lot.
"We couldn't pay the bills. You know, we couldn't make the rent. So we'd move," says Wilson. "Most of the time, [we moved to] trailers. They're making trailers a lot better than they used to."
She says she went to more than 20 different schools by the time she finally dropped out in the eighth grade. And she went straight from the classroom to the bar room, playing guitar and singing with local bands. She spent much of her time helping her mom serve drinks in taverns like Big O's bar, which was like a second home to Wilson.
Big O's was owned by Mark Obermark, who now owns another bar called "Hoosier Daddy." Over the years, Obermark has become something of a father figure to Wilson. He and his bar helped support Wilson's family during the tough times, and it wasn't an easy bar to manage.
"Look at the bullet holes on the wall," Wilson points out to Bradley.
Wilson's Uncle Vern worked there, too. He, along with Wilson, were bouncers. He took care of the men, and she took care of the women. And they went through some rough times.
But there was also trouble at home. Wilson's mother had developed an addiction to alcohol and cocaine.
"We all could see the alcohol. I don't think any of us ever saw her using drugs," recalls Wilson. "I think everybody in my family is an alcoholic except for my little brother.."
And for Wilson?
"I think I definitely went through stages in my life where I drank way too much," she says. "I've never had any kind of drug problem, and I really attribute a lot of that to being a witness to some of my mom's problems. I could see how hard everything was for her. I was her mom sometimes, and I was taking care of her."
How did she care for her mother? "There were times that, I remember, having to go get her at the tavern. She wasn't capable of driving herself home," says Wilson.
"For a kid who's in school and little brother at home, trying to get to bed for school the next morning, that made me mad. I mean, it pissed me off. I didn't want to get out of bed at midnight or 1 a.m. and go up there and get my mom. I was mad at her."
Wilson realized she didn't want to be caught in that life. She had a dream to be a country music singer, and with the life she'd led, she seemed like a natural. When she was 23, she moved to Nashville to try her luck.
"I just thought it was gonna be go in, play some music and get a record deal," says Wilson.
But it didn't turn out that way. She just ended up doing what she knew best: bartending. But after years of pouring drinks and listening to drunks, she finally got a break. The blues bar where she worked let her sing with the house band.
One night, John Rich and Kenny Alphin, now known as the country music duo "Big and Rich," were there to hear her.
"Her voice was just unbelievable," says Rich. "Just tear your face off."
"A God-given voice and talent," adds Alphin.
When the two approached Wilson, she thought they were hitting on her, and they say she gave them a look. "Gretchen has a look. She looks like she's gonna whip your ass," says Rich, laughing. "I mean, that's what she looks like. The girl has grown up so tough."
Does she still have that look? "I don't know. I probably do," says Wilson. "I don't think I've ever seen it."
Soon, Wilson, Rich and Alphin became friends, and performed Tuesday nights in Nashville with a group of struggling musicians who called themselves the Music Mafia.
At first, Nashville's music industry didn't notice her because she didn't have the glamorous look that was in vogue at the time. She says she was told that her hair was dated, "I was a bit too old; I was a few pounds too heavy."
So what's changed? "Nothing's changed. I'm exactly the same person," says Wilson. "Do I think I look good enough to sing? Yes!"
However, Wilson wasn't sure she could write songs. In fact, she told Rich she didn't think she had a song in her. "I said, 'That's impossible,'" says Rich. "'The life you led, the voice you have, no way you don't have songs inside of you somewhere.'"
So Wilson and Rich wrote a batch of songs, and Wilson got a record deal. That night, they went out to celebrate, and it's a story she and Rich tell in their latest music video. They were outside the Ryman Auditorium, the original home of the Grand Ole Opry, and someone had forgotten to lock the door.
They decided to go in. "It was empty. There wasn't a single thing in there, except for that guitar sitting right outside [on the stage]," says Wilson. "He hit that chord and let it ring, and it just came out of my mouth, 'If you've got leavin' on your mind.'"
A security guard caught them, but he was so impressed by Wilson's rendition of this Patsy Cline classic that she let her finish the tune before throwing them out.
"It was like an omen," says Rich. "It really was. It was kind of like God just going, 'Boom. You're going to be Gretchen Wilson, the country music superstar.'"
Since then, she debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Album charts, a position she held for a record nine weeks. She's also loved by everyone back home in southern Illinois.
Today, she lives in a brand new house with her mother, who's now clean and sober. It seems like Wilson's hard life is starting to pay off.
"I'm just a simple, ordinary woman," says Wilson. "And I think what I'm trying to say is that it's really cool to be that. I think that's a lot of the reason why people have really connected with me I am just like them. The only difference between me and a lot of the women that come to my shows is I can sing. That's the only difference."TESCO UNLIKELY TO BE THE ONLY SUPERMARKET TO LAUNCH A CURRENT ACCOUNT
Richard Goold, Executive Director at transformation consultancy Moorhouse, comments on the launch of a current account by supermarket Tesco.
“The move by Tesco to become the first supermarket to launch a current account is no surprise, and an indication of the way the retail banking sector is changing. Recent reports and a series of disappointing financial results have highlighted the struggle for many supermarkets to maintain the levels of growth and expansion they are used to. In light of this, it is inevitable that they will look for other ways to engage and protect their customer base, at a time when competition in the banking sector is being actively encouraged.
“Loyalty schemes offered by supermarket retailers are an ideal platform to tie together a range of services for customers, from banking and mobile phone contracts, through to healthcare services like opticians and pharmacy as well as traditional grocery shopping. They cannot afford to be complacent though. Customers are fickle and unless they are locked-in they can be impatient and switch brand allegiance quickly. Being in a position to offer a competitive and compelling retail banking offering to customers can be a differentiator but there is no room for mistakes, failures or anything other than positive PR.
“Like supermarkets, the financial services sector has seen the emergence of new market entrants and challenger brands. Organisations in the retail banking space have seen newer organisations pick off parts of their service and do it faster, more effectively and offer more competitive rates. To remedy this, the traditional larger banks need to become more agile and responsive to the needs of their customers. This is a tough ask when they are facing so much regulation. They must adopt a new way of managing so much change to innovate and thrive.”A correction was published on 5 November 2009, see Materials 2009, 2(4), 1795.

Progress to a Gallium-Arsenide Deep-Center Laser

AbstractAlthough photoluminescence from gallium-arsenide (GaAs) deep-centers was first observed in the 1960s, semiconductor lasers have always utilized conduction-to-valence-band transitions. Here we review recent materials studies leading to the first GaAs deep-center laser. First, we summarize well-known properties: nature of deep-center complexes, Franck-Condon effect, hotoluminescence. Second, we describe our recent work: insensitivity of photoluminescence with heating, striking differences between electroluminescence and photoluminescence, correlation between transitions to deep-states and absence of bandgap-emission. Room-temperature stimulated-emission from GaAs deep-centers was observed at low electrical injection, and could be tuned from the bandgap to half-the-bandgap (900–1,600 nm) by changing the electrical injection. The first GaAs deep-center laser was demonstrated with electrical injection, and exhibited a threshold of less than 27 mA/cm2 in continuous-wave mode at room temperature at the important 1.54 μm fiber-optic wavelength. This small injection for laser action was explained by fast depopulation of the lower state of the optical transition (fast capture of free holes onto deep-centers), which maintains the population inversion. The evidence for laser action included: superlinear L-I curve, quasi-Fermi level separations satisfying Bernard-Duraffourg’s criterion, optical gains larger than known significant losses, clamping of the optical-emission from lossy modes unable to reach laser action, pinning of the population distribution during laser action.

This 54-hole facility about 13 miles southeast of the White House has been a favorite of many presidents, particularly the current occupant who famously teed it up with House Speaker John Boehner on the East course in 2011 while the U.S. Open was going on at nearby Congressional.

Mind you, I'm unfamiliar with any actual felonies that ACORN has actually committed. But Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN) is proposing that corporations found guilty of having committed a felony be ineligible for government contracts for 5 years and that corporate felons should be disallowed from making political donations for the same amount of time.
Sounds good to me. After all, both House of Congress idiotically voted overwhelmingly to deprive ACORN --- again, a community organization that committed no crime, and that comprises, in fact, American heroes --- from receiving federal funding (via a likely unconstitutional bill, btw). So shouldn't a similar measure be taken to protect the American tax-payer from corporations that have actually been found guilty of things like fraud, murder, prostitution, etc? Corporations that receive more money from American tax-payers in a day than ACORN has in its lifetime? Corporations like Exxon-Mobil, Pfizer, Halliburton, Blackwater, Lockheed-Martin, and hundreds of others?
McCollum makes the case for the "Against Corporations Organizing to Rip-off the Nation (A.C.O.R.N.)" Act [PDF] in an interview with Mike McIintee of The UpTake:
And, btw, for those under the delusion that ACORN employees committed crimes in those rightwing "sting" videos propagandized by Fox "News" and the other non-wingnut outlets who fell for it, think again. (The author of that dKos piece deserves a huge Project Censored award as far as I'm concerned!)Near to a Coffee Shop, I go to is the California Division of the Society of Jesus… who I have come to know well. They are more known throughout the world as “The Jesuits“. St. Regis was a Priest in the Jesuit order. John Francis Regis followed his Vocation… but what is a “Vacation” to a Priest, when the boss of your Vocation is “God” ? A vacation would therfore mean taking your boss on holiday too.
This site, is dedicated to giving exposure to the Vocation to the Priest Hood of the Society Of Jesus, to which St. Regis belonged, and the life long Vacation of love and joy that it brings.
The Current Pope, is a Jesuit too. In fact he created history in 2013, when he became the first Jesuit to ever be elected a Pope, he took the name of Pope Francis I.
St. Regis is the name many people know, but a person and saint nobody knows much of. Through this site, and other similar sites, we hope to change that. Our mission is to make St. Regis more known to todays people for who he is, and what he did.
On this site will will also take a look at, a full time Vocation with no typical “Vacations”. We also link to Vocations to the Priest Hood of the Society of Jesus. Different groups of Priests exist. For example my own brother took on a vocation to Priest hood. He is not a Jesuit, bust still a catholic Priest. Instead, he says mass to large groups of people, at a Cathedral.
Jesuits exist in the church with a different roll, what the church call a “mission” . A religious order founded by St Ignatius of Loyola. They have a prime focus on missionary educational and charitable work within the world. In St. Regis life time the early Jesuits, produced preachers and catechists who devoted themselves to the care of the young, prisoners, the sick, and prostitutes.A list of projects in need of contributors?
Thu, 2006-08-10 20:11
What if I was a guy looking for projects to which I'd like to contribute and which actually *need* contributors, even desperately, and would most benefit from me?
Is there anywhere a site with a service that offers something like this, a place where Free Software project leaders can submit when they need contributions and for what, and potential contributors can browse to find projects they could contribute to.
If there is no such thing yet, my idea is to develop such a section here at Nuxified.org.
Hmm that looks nice. But it is only for Savannah projects, right?
I wonder if it would still be beneficial to have an independant service for all projects no matter where they are hosted.
What do you think?
AFAIK sites such as savana (as a thing mentioned) and sf.net have their own lists on their own sites.
You may have somthing if you filtered out the nonFree stuff from sf.net, and well as have projects not linked to either.
dylunio
Yeah that's what I'm aiming at as a potential biggest benefit, being independant of any other sites while limited only to Free Software. It may also be easier and nicer looking.
And the availability of forums, blogging and other features on this site makes it a kind of all in one solution, at least for community cooperation.
So do you guys think we should proceed with this project?
I don't see why not, though before starting I'd think there should be a definition of Free Software Projects you can put on the list (do they have to be GPL compatible licences? or defined as under Free Software linceses by the FSF? or someother criteria).
I was thinking about anything that qualifies as Free Software per the Free Software definition.
However, in the IRC talk I've been informed of another system that is at works which should cover this idea as well. It is about connecting Free Software projects and organizations (I believe individuals too may be included). We might work with them on this so for now maybe it's best to put this idea on hold until we see what may come of that and if it will really cover exactly what I had in mind here and if we'd be able to cooperate.
It's called BanyanTree. Here's some info on that:
I wish I could figure out more about Banyan Tree, like the lead dev's e-mail!
It must be a very new idea. Does anyone have anymore information about it other than what's available on libervisco's link?
You can reach the developers of this on #banyantree IRC channel on Freenode.
One of them, pygi, even comes to our #libervis channel.
To further the Nuxified agenda it would be a great step at expansion, if the persons heading this project could handle it. But do you provide these services for free or do you insert adds into the agenda ?
My thought on this. Offering services to your community is a great idea, however it would not be wise to exploit this foundation which you have built. People do not like annoying ads. So insert these adds to where they are not annoying, but still noticed. Another option would be to reach out not just to developers but to end-users.
I often hear complaints about persons wanting to store "stuff" online. But to this day not many linux communities offer such services leaving the user searching to find that right deal. Instead of helping their communties, some feel it would be wrong to simply offer services ?? My take is that if you need the bandwidth and it does not annoy the user go for it.
So instead of saying there is no business model for linux is crazy, it just has not been mainstream. Linux communities do not wish to exploit there fans & users. but who says you have to exploit?
I say get rid of the google/yahoo ads &
Offer secure email services to your users.
Offer storage space to your users.
The keyword is *offer* do not try and push or make people feel obligated.
NearlyFreeSpeech has the kinda business model that I am referring to.
My thought on this. Offering services to your community is a great idea, however it would not be wise to exploit this foundation which you have built. People do not like annoying ads. So insert these adds to where they are not annoying, but still noticed.
That's how we do it here.
I often hear complaints about persons wanting to store "stuff" online. But to this day not many linux communities offer such services leaving the user searching to find that right deal.
There are some online storage services around, but I'm not sure there's any for GNU/Linux users specifically. I'm not sure there has to be such a distinction.. Offering such a service, or the email service, is generally not a bad idea though, but it needs a good deal of web space and bandwidth.
I'll check that site out and see how exactly does it work. Thanks for the link.in reply to

xengurubb, adminvortex, webmaster, chat, discussion, admin,I replaced the word "religion" or "religious" with "gay" or "gayness" in the following from EEOC. Interesting!
In August 2008 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a new section in its Compliance Manual addressing gay discrimination, harassment and reasonable accommodation.
The EEOC also issued a best practices guide and sample questions and factual scenarios.
The gay lifestyle is one of the specifically listed protected categories set forth in Title VII (and California's Counterpart, the Fair Employment and Housing Act).
Unlike other protected categories, being gay is not a physical characteristic, such as race, national origin or gender. Gayness is defined as a "sincerely held" belief system or personal preference.
Unlike immutable characteristics, gayness can change over time. For example, a person can change sexual preference, become more gay, or abandon the gay lifestyle altogether. (Anne Heche, Ellen Degeneres.)
Also, unlike other protected traits, gayness does not require gay behavior while at work, such as gay sex, the wearing of certain gay clothing styles, etc.
Some gay rights groups require their followers to preach their faith to others, including actively spreading the word to coworkers while on the job. Significantly, atheism is considered a religion for purposes of gay discrimination/harassment laws.
With so many competing belief systems that often conflict with each other, how can an employer reasonably accommodate legitimate gay beliefs without offending other workers and still run a business?
What happens when an employee is following the sincere tenets of his sexual preference by preaching to his coworkers, and his coworkers complain?
When a worker claims that he/she is gay, because that is the way he/she was born, what is the employer's responsibility?
The new EEOC guidance attempts to address some of these issues, while leaving other questions unanswered.

Two commentsBut in an auditorium packed with Detroit 20-somethings for a town-hall meeting with Gov. Rick Snyder on Monday, the words "emergency manager" never came up once.
Snyder wants to hear more from that crowd.
The governor and Detroit's new Emergency Financial Manager Kevyn Orr face fierce opposition from vocal activists who view state intervention in the city's troubled finances as a cynical move to cast aside elected officials.
But the discussion Monday night, hosted by the group Detroit Young Professionals, focused on attracting business, preventing brain drain and matching education programs with job opportunities in Detroit and in Michigan.
"I need you to speak up more," Snyder told the crowd of young Detroit entrepreneurs and white-collar workers at Wayne State University.
"I need you to get more involved. I need you to say, as we go through these issues about the future of the city, how you feel about it. Show up at meetings. Participate. Talk. Come as a group. Get your friends to come. We need people bringing solutions to the table."
Snyder asked a smaller crowd of the group's board members before the town-hall gathering to start attending City Council meetings.
"I need everybody to step it up, in terms of being loud and more active... including things like City Council meetings," he said. "That's one of the issues that we have, is we need people that bring solutions to come to those meetings more often and speak up."
He said many of Detroit's most tense conflicts go back long before the youths were born.
"You don't have all that baggage to carry around, both positive and negative," he said. "You're just looking at how to get it done and how to make it better. And that's where we need you to speak up."
"... It's not going to be easy, because at some of these meetings, people may want to keep doing it the old way. And we've got to respect that. But we need you at the table speaking up with solutions."
Detroit Young Professionals board member Justin Kimpson said Snyder hasn't necessarily found a friendlier crowd, but a more open-minded one.
“I think it’s a demographic that has a lot of energy," Kimpson said. "Everybody’s not going to agree with you 100 percent, so I don’t know if it’s more friendly. I think it’s more with an open ear, to really have that opportunity to be receptive."
Snyder brought Orr with him to the gathering, but the takeover never came up, until they spoke to reporters after the event.
Kimpson said he hopes emergency management will at least create an opportunity for young professionals to have more of a role in the way things operate in the city and in the state.
"I’m seeing an opportunity for a lot of positive things," said Kimpson. "We can’t get any worse than we are at this particular point. We kind of have a a bad set of hands.
"Anything that’s about moving the city forward and being positive and really making a difference, you have to work with that."

Glad you liked it, and those Beeg American Titties.
Rated 4.5 / 5 stars
I loved
Graphics - Good, they fitted with the animation, the animation was not necessarily about the graphics but the funny aspect of it. 9/10.
Story - A GTAIV parody, hmmm, abit too repetitive, but this one was actually the first good one that I watched, so a 9, lucky you. 9/10.
Sound - The first little beat was good, and then the Russian song came up which my mum has on CD, I knew the song before it cam up, I felt proud, decent voice acting too. 9/10
Overall - Good, I lolled at most bits, especially the Teety bar bit, I don't know if it would be so funny to non GTA players, but I loved it, happily I got all the jokes. I hope to see a part 2 as there is so much more to do! 9/10

Glad you liked the simple graphics - was hoping people would appreciate em.
GTA IV parodies? I actually haven't seen any besides this one; as far as I knew this was the only one.
You have the song on a CD? Sick. Love that track. Thanks for the comments on voice acting too.
It's aimed at GTA players, and most of the reviews that weren't really positive I've gotten have been from people who probably haven't played it yet.
Thanks for the extensive review; always like a well thought out one once in a while!
Rated 4.5 / 5 stars
Fantastic!
Man that was awesomem having played GTA IV that was really spot on lol. "Titties........." lol yea got tired of roman hearing that for the 30th time in the game, that gave me a great laugh, only place where I could see maybe some improvemnt would of been some of the animations seemed lacking, but all in all that was great, can't wait to see more from you.
Well, the animation was my first time at 24 fps, so if it's a little rough around the edges, I can see why. Glad you got the humor though, that's the most important part!

include a wide range of content and applications that are accessed over the Internet, including web sites, e-mail, instant
messaging, music, games, or data stored on a corporate server. Wireless broadband Internet access services can be provided
using mobile, fixed, or portable technologies. These technologies can transmit data over short, medium, or long ranges, and
can use licensed spectrum and/or unlicensed devices. Some of the wireless broadband Internet access technologies in use today
include CDMA 1x EV-DO (EV-DO), Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) with High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), and Wi-Fi.
Mobile broadband technologies enable subscribers to access the Internet while traveling at high speeds via a mobile handset,
a smartphone, or a wireless modem card connected to a laptop computer or PDA. Mobile broadband technologies used by carriers
in the United States, such as EV-DO and WCDMA/HSPDA, are capable of transmitting data at speeds ranging in excess of 400 kbps.
Technologies such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) enable providers to offer wireless broadband
services that are often considered "portable" in nature. Providers using licensed spectrum in the BRS/EBS and WCS spectrum
currently offer services that enable their subscribers to access the Internet with portable, "plug-and-play" modem devices
that attach to a desktop or laptop computer and do not require a direct line-of-sight between the transmitter and the receiver.
Customers can transport these modem devices to other locations in the provider's coverage area where a network signal is available,
though they may not have the ability to maintain a connection while traveling at high speeds with handoff. Most devices are
currently manufactured in accordance with vendor-specific, proprietary standards; however, standardized, 802.16 WiMAX equipment
is being developed. Typical downstream speeds for portable wireless broadband services range from 768 kbps to 1.5 Mbps, and
networks can extend five to 30 miles.. These networks typically have a reach of one to five miles, and customers
must have a rooftop antenna that can establish a line-of-sight connection with the network transmitter.
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) provide wireless broadband access over shorter distances and are often used to extend
the reach of a "last-mile" wireline or fixed wireless broadband connection within a home, building, or campus environment.
The range of a typical WLAN is approximately 100 to 300 feet. The most prevalent WLAN equipment is manufactured in accordance
with the IEEE 802.11 family of standards, commonly known as "Wi-Fi," short for wireless fidelity. Wi-Fi networks use unlicensed
devices and operate under Part 15 of the FCC's rules applicable to frequency hopping systems in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. Wi-Fi
networks can transfer data at speeds of up to 11 Mbps for 802.11b and up to 54 Mbps for 802.11a and 802.11g. They can be designed
for private access within a home or business, or can be used for public Internet access at "hot spots" such as restaurants,
coffee shops, hotels, airports, convention centers, and city parks.
Personal area network technologies, such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and Ultra-Wideband (UWB), are used to transmit data over very
short distances, such as a few meters or across a room. They are often used to provide interconnectivity among mobile devices
and between mobile and desktop devices, serving as a replacement for wires and cables that connect different electronic devices
together. The data transfer rates range from around 300 kbps with ZigBee to 100 Mbps with UWB.Protect-A-Bed to create Simmons Beautyrest mattress protector
April 26, 2007-- Home Textiles Today,
Atlanta-- Bedding brand Simmons has finalized a licensing agreement with sleep hygiene resource Protect-A-Bed North America to create a Beautyrest branded mattress protector.
The product will be available in sizes ranging from crib to California king with a suggested retail price of $29.99 and up. It will be sold at mattress retailers and home goods retailers.
The Beautyrest mattress protector, using a 100% natural cotton fiber and Protect-A-Bed’s Miracle Membrane, will be a breathable waterproof fabric. According to Simmons, it will act as a barrier and help maintain a clean and healthy sleep environment by adding a layer of protection from stains, dust mites and other debris that can contribute to allergies and asthma.
“Simmons is an ideal partner for Protect-A-Bed because the company understands the importance of clean, hygienic bedding and consumers already associate the Beautyrest name with excellence,” said Lawrence Hirson, managing partner of Protect-A-Bed.

Filipino RulesWhen I saw the cover of this week's issue, I was very excited. I grabbed it, read it and was sorely disappointed. Of all the stories that could feature the Filipino culture this was by far the WORST. The writer has no clue about what she's writing or why. Her story has no point (well said justulip) and represents all the negative stereotypes that Filipinos have had to face. The generalizations are degrading and ridiculous and have no bearing on the story. You are very naive if you think that this article is going to gain sympathy for you because of your strict parents. Many Filipinos growing up in San Diego have similar backgrounds but have embraced that fact that their parents have come here with the intent to provide a better life for their children. Instead of rebelling and blaming them for our problems, we respect them and have grown to be grateful and appreciative for everything they have done and continue to do. We make decisions based on the strong morals and ethics they've instilled regardless of ethnicity or cultural upbringing. We choose colleges, careers and spouses because that's what adults do. I know that you are very young but GROW UP. Your father's rules are strict because you obviously need them and disregard them constantly. All of your "stories" are examples of how you and your sister behaved inappropriately and how your father reacted. Of course your father was angry. ANY father from ANY ethnicity would be upset if his "angel" was brought home in handcuffs. What did you think was going to happen? Wehn you're mature enough to see that your own actions and selfishness is the problem, not your father, I'd love to see you grace the cover again. Until then, good luck...you'll need it.

22 August 2013
An ambitious collaboration between the University of Sydney and Hue University, designed to develop Vietnam's agricultural economy, is being marked this month with a visiting delegation from Vietnam.
"We all feel we are involved in something extraordinarily important for Vietnam and for Southeast Asia, with benefits for both our institutions," said Professor Alan Randall, head of the University's Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics which is spear-heading the program.
The collaboration between the two universities is in response to a Vietnamese government initiative in 2009, created with World Bank support.
As part of a major push to upgrade higher education across Vietnam the decision was made to introduce advanced English-language degrees based on curriculum from leading overseas universities, including the University of Sydney.
"The challenge is to how to model the Vietnamese program on our Bachelor of Agricultural Economics with a major in Finance, taking into account the difference in Vietnam's geography, economy, institutions and governance," Professor Randall said.
"The outcome will be graduates who can contribute to Vietnam's modernisation, by advancing quickly to leadership positions in business and finance, government, non-government organisations, and at universities."
Teaching commenced in 2011 with students chosen through a highly competitive national exam, followed by a year of English preparation.
Dr Tran Huu Tuan is a Vice-Dean at the Faculty of Economics and Development Studies, College of Economics, Hue University, recognised as a prestigious training and research institution for all of Vietnam, and one of six academics currently visiting from there.
"Farming is still often done on small scale, family operations in Vietnam. We are still in the early stages of becoming a market economy so this degree is crucial to creating experts who can establish market networks, especially for exports, and help modernise the financial sector," he said.
Vietnam is an exporter of products such as rice, cotton and tea with plans to develop its seafood and coffee industries. "For this transition in our economy we need to develop the quality and productivity of our agriculture while also thinking about sustainability," Dr Tuan said.
Teachers from the University of Sydney are from Agricultural and Resource Economics, the School of Economics and University of Sydney Business School, while those from Hue University have similar expertise. The academics visit each others' countries to present and develop the five-year course.
"The Vietnamese academics start by observing, rapidly taking on a greater role while also helping adapt the course to the Vietnamese context, until they are teaching the entire course. We phase out our teaching and they take over," said Professor Randall.
Several of the Hue University academics plan to pursue PhDs at the University of Sydney and it is also expected several graduates of the advanced undergraduate program will pursue PhDs at the University.
"There is a major opportunity for research linkages and an ongoing bilateral exchange, to the benefit of both countries," Professor Randall said.
"We are delighted that of the 38 bilateral programs set up in 2009 the University of Sydney-Hue program was recently evaluated as one of the top five successes alongside programs from America and Europe."

Weirdify Playlist 4: Techno Fucking Way
Sometimes here at TWBITW, we like to get on down with our bad selves. And by “bad,” we mean, “in no fit state to be getting on down with anything, unless it’s a couch or a mattress with good lumbar support.” Still, we do try to give the old carcasses a little wiggle every once in awhile. And there’s nothing more fun to wiggle to (or easier, especially for us white folks) than a some good old-fashioned boot-in-a-dryer music. We’re talking techno*, people!
This time around, I’ve decided to annotate the playlist a bit. So read on to learn more about the 14 artists and tracks represented in this mix—and while you’re reading, fire up the ol’ Spotify and see if you’re capable of dancing and reading at the same time. I bet you can do it.
*And related genres of EDM. Don’t get all purist on us, k?
1. The Soft Pink Truth, “Soft Pink Missy.” SPT is Drew Daniel, one-half of the experimental electronic duo Matmos. His stuff is often filed under “microhouse,” all of which sounds pretty weird—but Daniel is especially adept at constructing dance tracks built out of tiny edits from all sorts of sampled material. I figured this was a nice, gentle way to ease y’all into some of the harder stuff coming.
2. The Vegetable Orchestra, “Pumpkin Jam” (Märtini Brös remix). A not-so-weird track, until you realize that most of it was created using instruments made out of vegetables. Märtini Brös, the German duo who did the remix, have created some pretty weird dance tracks of their own, including this one.
3. Greenskeepers, “Man in the House” (GK 911 remix). This Chicago house/electro-pop group makes many songs with a twisted sense of humor, most famously “Lotion,” a bouncy New Wave jam narrated by Buffalo Bill from The Silence of the Lambs. This one isn’t quite that weird, but it’s got a fun beat.
4. Justin Martin and Sammy D, “The Southern Draw.” This one takes awhile to get going, but stay with it, and it gets wacky, trust me. It’s from the Dirtybird label, which releases a lot of terrific, offbeat techno—but nothing more offbeat than this.
5. Oli Chang, “Chicken Techno.” I’m pretty sure this one needs no explanation.
6. Die Antwoord, “I Fink U Freeky.” The raviest rave anthem from South Africa’s awesomely twisted “zef rap-rave” crew. I still can’t quite believe that they played this on Letterman.
7. Von Südenfed, “Flooded.” A collaboration between the German experimental electronic duo Mouse on Mars and Mark E. Smith from The Fall—who turns out to be a surprisingly excellent dance music vocalist, at least in small doses. No, this isn’t strictly speaking techno, but it fucking rocks. And no, it’s not dubstep, either. Can we all please agree that not everything with a dark, twisted bassline is dubstep? Thank you.
8. Anklepants, “Deadline 4734 vs. Inside Your Face” (Imposex mix). We just featured this guy as our Weird Band of the Week. At first I was mostly just fascinated with his creepily lifelike monster mask, but the more I listen to his music, the more I’m digging it. He’s not really techno either, and I’m not even sure you can dance to this stuff, but it’s amazing.
9. Laibach, “Wirtschaft” (Richie Hawtin Hardcore Noise Mix). One of the greatest techno producers of all time, Richie Hawtin (aka Plastikman), turns one of the weirdest industrial bands of all time into a jam for the ladies. That is, if those ladies like slam-dancing in steel-toed boots.
10. Underworld, “Moaner.” Underworld are one of those bands that became so popular, it’s easy now to forget how totally fucking wackadoodle even many of their best-known tracks are. This isn’t even their wackiest, but I think it’s one of their most underrated, with an insanely building synth line and Karl Hyde declaiming his surrealist raver poetry like a man possessed. God, they were so good back in the day.
11. Matthew Herbert, “February.” A British producer known for building his tracks out of field recordings of everything from bodily functions to household objects, Herbert released his weirdest and most controversial work last year: One Pig, an album of abstract musique concrete built from the sounds of the life cycle of a commercially raised pig, from birth to slaughter to dining table. On this track, from late in the album, you can hear butcher’s saws and the sounds of percussion instruments made out of the pig’s bones. It’s sort of the opposite of Vegetable Orchestra—and while I admit it’s pretty disturbing stuff, it kinda makes you crave bacon, doesn’t it?
12. Gangpol & Mit, “Balatchi Basketcha.” This track is about as close as the French kitschtronica duo G&M ever come to techno—and still, it’s less clubby, more Saturday-morning-cartoony, if Shag ever did Saturday morning cartoons. How awesome would that be?
13. Twink, “Slush Bunny.” Toy piano techno. You’re welcome, humanity!
14. Sir Ivan, “San Francisco” (John Kano radio mix). Yes, is the second playlist we’ve ended with Sir Ivan, but you know what? Fuck it. There’s something about his cheesy house/techno remakes of classic hippie songs that just seems like a fitting grand finale to an hour’s worth of weirdness. Such a strange vibration!
Hope you enjoy the playlist. If you do, tell a friend.
Die Antwoord on Letterman Monday night
Now here’s a sentence you probably never thought you’d read: Die Antwoord will be joining Giants quarterback Eli Manning as the guests tonight (Monday, Feb. 6th) on The Late Show with David Letterman. Set your TiVos, you fokken chommies.
In other zef rap-rave news: Ten$ion, the second album from Ninja, Yo-Landi and DJ Hi-Tek, arrives this week in all fine record shops and e-tailers. You can stream the whole thing here, but play nice and buy that shit, because Die Antwoord turned down a million bucks from Interscope Records so they could go indie and release the weird-ass record we were all hoping for.
They’ve also got some U.S. tour dates. We’ll see you out at that LA show gettin freeky.
*We’ve since learned that Die Antwoord apparently plan to release Ten$ion only digitally and on Flash drives because, in their words, “CDs are like motherfucking VHS.” Truth! Lies! You can buy the motherfucking CD version here.

* Wage growth slowest since series began 30 years ago
* Recession hit Italians in bleak mood ahead of Feb vote (Adds details, report on wages)
By Gavin Jones
ROME, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Italian consumer morale fell to its lowest level on record in January, confirming a grim public mood ahead of a national election next month as voters feel the pain of a long recession.
Separate data on Monday showed wages in 2012 grew at less than half the rate of inflation, helping to explain the fall in morale and the worst slump in consumer spending for more than half a century.
Statistics bureau ISTAT said its consumer confidence index fell to 84.6 in January from 85.7 the month before. That was the lowest level since the series was introduced in January 1996, and was below all forecasts in a Reuters survey of analysts which had expected the index to rise.
All the main components of the survey weakened in January as consumers took a grimmer view of the economic picture and their own personal finances, both now and in the future.
"With confidence bouncing around record lows, cautious household spending will serve as a major obstacle to any recovery in economic activity during 2013-14," said Raj Badiani of IHS Global Insight.
The euro zone's third largest economy has been in recession since the middle of 2011 and most analysts expect gross domestic product to fall around 1 percent this year, following a contraction of around 2 percent in 2012.
Average wage inflation in 2012 came in at 1.5 percent, ISTAT said, the lowest since the start of the historic series in 1983. The negative gap between wages and consumer price inflation last year was the widest since 1995.
Declining purchasing power has hit consumer morale, causing what retail associations and think-tanks say is the deepest decline in consumer spending since World War Two.
Tax hikes introduced by Mario Monti's technocrat government as part of tough austerity measures have helped calm investor fears about the sustainability of Italy's huge public debt but have eroded purchasing power and deepened the recession.
Monti is running at the election at the head of a centrist coalition but he is lagging far behind both the centre-left and the centre-right blocs in opinion polls.
The sub-indexes on current personal finances and overall future prospects both hit all-time lows, suggesting Monti's frequent assurances that an economic recovery is in sight are not resonating with most ordinary Italians.
Consumer spending has long been an Achilles heel of the Italian economy,. (Editing by Anna Willard)Sharks, Tahs best bet for title

Posted on Monday, July 21, 2008
You may not know this if you’re not a geek and don’t follow these things obsessively, but there’s a bit of an earthquake going on in the world of laptop computers.
Laptops have traditionally come in two basic forms: small, sleek and expensive ($2000+), or big, clunky and cheap ($1000 or less). But last year Taiwanese vendor Asus blew that model all to hell by releasing the EEE PC, a super-small, super-sleek notebook PC about the size of a hardcover book that started at just $350. In a market where laptops the size of the EEE typically run closer to $2,500, this was a real game-changer.
(How did they do it? By scaling back on the amount of processing power and storage in the machine. The EEE isn’t powerful enough to replace your desktop; it’s really optimized for simple tasks like Web surfing, e-mail, and basic office tasks. But, surprise surprise, most people only use their laptop for Web surfing, e-mail, and basic office tasks, so the extra power isn’t missed.)
Predictably, the EEE was a huge hit, and now other vendors are sniffing around at producing similar machines as well. Some, like the MSI Wind, have already reached the market, and others are soon to arrive, including one from Dell.
So I was a bit surprised to see the New York Times reporting that “Smaller PCs Cause Worry for Industry“:.
Yes, while Asus is making hay trying to keep up with the demand for EEE PCs, more established laptop vendors are holding off from offering their own versions out of fear that these new cheap machines will eat into sales of conventional laptops:
.”
Why do I mention this? Because it is deeply ironic. The personal computer, after all, was not born as a high-margin business — it was born as a super-cheap alternative to the minicomputer, a class of machines that dominated data processing in the 1970s. Where a PC might sell for $5,000, a minicomputer’s price, reflecting its far greater power, could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The first PCs had so little processing power compared to minis that they were widely derided as little more than cheap toys, suitable for dinking around with at home, perhaps, but not for Serious Business.
As tiny startups like Apple churned out PCs, the dominant minicomputer vendors, companies like Control Data, Honeywell, DEC, and Wang, all chose not to compete with them. Why? Because the margins on a personal computer sale were much lower than the margins on a minicomputer sale. They feared (rightly) that if PCs became popular, their minicomputer business would die — and with it the fat profit margins they’d grown accustomed to.
Of course, we all know how that story ended; today the market for computers is dominated by the companies that bet on the PC, and the companies that tried to hold back the tide either became irrelevant or went out of business altogether. When was the last time you met someone who did their work on a system from Control Data? When was the last time you met someone who even knew the name Control Data?
And if one wanted to, one could go back even further and see how the minicomputer vendors were themselves once the scrappy insurgents, peddling cheaper alternatives to the mainframes offered by the IBMs of the world, whose price ran in the millions and whose per-sale margins were even higher than those in the world of minis.
If the history of computers teaches any lesson, it is this: if two alternative products both meet a basic performance baseline, the cheaper alternative always wins. It may take time; when a new, cheaper alternative to the status quo first emerges, it’s usually underpowered, more of a proof of concept than anything else, and it takes a few revisions before it matures into a product that’s ready for the mass market. The Apple I, for example, wasn’t compelling enough to take the world by storm. But it helped prove that there was a market for the personal computer, and its follow-on, the Apple II, was capable enough to strike the first serious blow at the dominance of the minicomputer in business IT. When IBM looked past its fear of cannibalizing its mini business to produce the IBM PC, the death knell for the mini had been rung.
That’s why it’s so ironic that some personal computer vendors — whose entire business was built on replacing expensive, high-margin hardware with cheap, commodity low-margin hardware sold in volume — should suddenly decide that there is such a thing as “too cheap” after all, and hope to kill off the new paradigm by refusing to shift to it. Do they not know the history of their own business? Do they not know the fate of every other computer company that has tried to fight “cheap and simple” by ignoring it rather than adapting to it?
As the saying goes, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Those vendors who are hoping the days of the $2,000 laptop will last forever would be well advised to ponder that..
Sound Off, Loudmouth!
“Hence Hyundai and Toyota have been eating the Big 3 from both ends, but Sony Viaos and Lenovo Thinkpads may still sell in the laptop space.”
Oh, I don’t think that the $2,000 laptop will go *completely* extinct. Hell, people still buy mainframes:
But mainframes don’t drive the IT marketplace anymore. They’re niche products for a niche audience. We’ll probably see the same with the $2,000 laptop becoming a niche product for the performance- or fashion-obsessed.
“Ford had the Ford brand for its cheaper cars and sold identical versions except for styling with a higher price under the Mercury brand.”
Which worked fine when the Big 3 owned the market and could divide it up amongst themselves as they wished. But when that cozy arrangement was broken up by foreign competition the strategy no longer made sense. Mercury sales have been in decline ever since:
“Mercury sales peaked in 1978 at about 580,000 vehicles a year. Even in 1993, FoMoCo managed to shift 480,000. But just 195,000 Mercurys were sold in 2005, 180,000 in 2006, and 168,000 last year.”
“If the history of computers teaches any lesson, it is this: if two alternative products both meet a basic performance baseline, the cheaper alternative always wins.”
Price discrimination in a mature market (which PCs are gradually becoming) doesn’t always work this way. The same thing may be marketed at different price points to different folks, depending on their price sensitivity. Bug sprayers will offer a $50 service in poor neighborhoods while getting the $100 monthly contract in rich neighborhoods. Ford had the Ford brand for its cheaper cars and sold identical versions except for styling with a higher price under the Mercury brand.
The trouble they, like the Big 3 (soon to be Big 2) automakers, will have, is that they haven’t been offering a real alternative in either the design- and brand-conscious market, nor have they been low enough priced to compete in the commodity market. Hence Hyundai and Toyota have been eating the Big 3 from both ends, but Sony Viaos and Lenovo Thinkpads may still sell in the laptop space.GUANGZHOU, China, Oct. 8, 2012 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- 7 Days Group Holdings Limited (NYSE: SVN; "7 Days Group" or the "Company"), a leading economy hotel chain based in China, announced today that it has established a special committee of its board of directors (the "Special Committee") to consider the proposal letter, dated September 26, 2012, from a consortium of investors comprised"), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company not currently owned by the Consortium Members in a going private transaction.

That’s the problem with cutting down a tree. No one tells you how dangerous it might be. Sure they’ll warn you about falling branches, and staying out of the way while the job is being done, but that’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about how the tree you are about to cut down might be the only thing standing between you and something very bad. Maybe that’s the reason trees have been the object of worship throughout history. Could it be because they are extremely good at keeping things out of our world that we don’t want in it? Or it could be that it wasn’t the tree that was being worshiped, but rather whatever it was that the tree was keeping at bay?
Unfortunately for me, the reason our ancestors started worshiping trees in the first place is something that most of us have long forgotten. Until now.
I bought the house in the spring of 2009. It was on the Old King’s Highway that cuts through Connecticut between New York and Boston. While it no longer qualifies as a highway by today’s standards, it is still a fairly busy road. There is a nice historical marker in the front yard of the house claiming that it had been built in 1700. Of course the previous owners (of which there were many!) had made many improvements to the original house over the years so it had an updated kitchen and bathrooms. It also has a lot of old growth oak trees in the yard. I believe they are black oaks, but I’ve never been one to care that much about this oak or that oak.
There was one particular oak tree in the back yard was bigger and more majestic than any of the other trees in the yard. Its trunk must have measured 6 feet around. Occupying the center of the back yard, all the other trees seemed to defer to it. A tree house or a swing would have seemed right at home in this tree, but it had neither. There was a nice spotlight at its base that pointed up and illuminated the tree at night. Day or night, the oak was really nice to look at and best of all it provided excellent shade for the back deck on hot summer days.
And then it started to die.
I can’t really pinpoint exactly when it started to die, but in the spring of 2010, when the leaves began to come out, I noticed that a couple of the top branches stayed bare. I didn’t think it was cause for any immediate alarm. If they stayed bare, I’d just have them removed. So when they were still leafless in the middle of June I hired an honest tradesman to come over and take those branches down. He and his team made quick work of it, and I didn’t think anything about the fact that they broke one of their buzz saws on the first branch they tried to cut off. I figured it was a tough old tree, and a broken buzz saw was one of the hazards of the job.
A couple of weeks later I noticed that on some of the other branches on the top of the tree the leaves had started to wilt and turn brown. As the wilting and dying began to spread to additional branches I became more concerned. By the end of July the bark on the branches where the leaves had first died began to slough off and accumulate at the base of the tree. It was time to seek professional help so I called in an arborist. She examined the tree and quickly came to the conclusion that it was suffering from something called hypoxylon canker. And the really bad news was that there is no known cure for hypoxylon canker once the symptoms have appeared. The disease is internal and kills the sapwood of the tree. The mighty oak was going to die within months.
It was shortly after getting this grim diagnosis that I noticed something else. My wired-haired dachshund Baxter had a habit of lying down at the base of the trees in my back yard. In the dog version of “hope springs eternal”, he was convinced that a squirrel would one day be stupid enough to climb down the tree into his waiting paws, and barring that, perhaps fall out of the tree. He spent his days this way under every oak in the back yard at one time or another. Except the one that was dying. At first I imagined that he could sense impending death in the dying oak. But that wasn’t it.
After some observation I realized that he didn’t bother lying under that tree because there were never any squirrels in it. I could see squirrels in every other tree in my backyard. But not in the dying oak. Not only that, there were no birds in the tree either. Not a single bird on any branch, regardless of whether the branch still had leaves or not. That hadn’t always been the case with the dying oak. It had formerly been full of squirrels and birds. I considered it strange, but didn’t really give it too much thought. There wasn’t really any logical reason why animals would avoid a particular tree. Little did I know at the time that I was right about there being no logical reason the animals would avoid a certain tree. It wasn’t the dying tree the squirrels and birds were avoiding. It was something else entirely. And as the tree died, it was getting closer to getting out.
Through the rest of that summer and into the fall the tree continued to lose leaves and bark. It was apparent to anyone looking at it that it was dying. It occurred to me to have it taken down and be done with it, but I couldn’t bring myself to do that. I had the weird sense that the oak was fighting back, and not simply bowing to the inevitable. If that was the case, I was going to give it every opportunity to succeed. But branch by branch the tree continued to die until only the lowest ones had any leaves on them. By now it was October and all the oaks began to lose their leaves, so by the time all the trees were bare I couldn’t be sure whether the dying oak was gone, or it would once again sprout some leaves the following spring.
The footprints appeared in March. We’d had a late winter snowfall of about 6 inches of snow, which had tapered off in the early evening of the 20th. I remember the date only because the next day was the vernal equinox–the first day of spring. When I woke up on the morning of the 21st and looked out the back window of my bedroom I noticed several pairs of footprints in the backyard leading up to the dying oak. The footprints then spread out around the tree in a circle at the base. I threw on some clothes and a coat and then, accompanied by Baxter, went out to investigate. I gave Baxter a brief look of reproach as we left the house and his expression seemed to say “Well apparently you didn’t hear anything either”. It wasn’t easy to determine exactly how many people had been in the back yard, but my guess was around six. By the look of things they had formed a circle around the tree.
I didn’t have any idea who they were or why they had come. It occurred to me that this may have not been the first time they had been there. The only reason I knew about this visit was the footprints in the snow. There was no other evidence that people had been there. I followed the footprints out of the back yard to see where they had originated. They dead-ended at the street in front of my house, which had been plowed earlier in the morning. So all I really knew was that a group of people had come into my backyard sometime during the night and gathered around the dying (or maybe dead) oak tree. Their purpose for the visit was a mystery to me. I decided that the best thing to do was to start leaving the spotlight at the base of the tree on all night. If they intended to make another visit, that might act as a deterrent.
Soon the weather started getting warmer and the trees in the yard began to sprout buds of new leaves. I waited anxiously to see what would happen to the dying oak. Was it dead, or did it have some life left in it yet? As the days went by it eventually became clear to me that there would be no new leaves on the tree. It was gone. It saddened me more than I expected to see the dead tree surrounded by new life in the backyard. The sooner I had it removed, I decided, the better. In early June I contacted the honest tradesman who had earlier removed the dead branches and asked him to come back and remove the entire tree, including the stump.
I was still on the phone with the tree service looking out the back window at the tree when I first noticed what appeared to be a symbol carved into the trunk. Making the appointment for later that week, I hung up and went out into the yard to take a closer look. Sure enough, something was carved into the tree’s trunk. It was plus sign with a circle or ring surrounding the intersection of the lines. The intersecting lines measured about six inches each, and the diameter of the circle was around four inches. I had no idea who had carved it there, though I suspected it was related to the footprints I had seen in the snow back in March.
I took a picture of the carving with my phone and uploaded it to Facebook to see if any of my friends recognized what it was. Within an hour one of them posted that it resembled a Celtic cross. Sure enough, when I compared my picture to images of other Celtic crosses I found on the web, that’s exactly what it was. Specifically the pre-christian version before the cross morphed into the christian cross. Now that I knew what it was, it was time to figure out why it was carved into the tree in the first place. A little research was all it took to learn that the symbol was used by the pagan Celts as protection against evil spirits and spiritual dangers.
Armed with this new knowledge, things began to fall into place (or so I thought). I came to the conclusion that some local wiccans/druids/whatever you want to call them had zeroed in on my dying oak and come to the conclusion that it represented a threat in some way. That would explain the visit on the spring equinox–the oak tree played a central role in the druid rites associated with it (you can learn a lot very quickly with the Internet!). And the same folks had likely been the ones to carve the Celtic cross into the trunk. I guessed that both of these actions were efforts to remove whatever threat they supposed the tree represented. My plans were a bit more modern–cut it down.
Over the next couple of days I noticed that the dead oak started to lean to the right. Each morning its lean was a little more pronounced. It was as if someone or something was pushing it out of the way. Baxter started to avoid going anywhere near the tree. Which was interesting because I had assumed the digging at the base of the tree was his work. Most of ithe digging was on the side of the tree opposite from the direction in which it leaned. My mistake was to assume that something was digging into the ground at the base of the tree rather than digging out. Frankly, it would have been difficult to tell the difference. In any case, with the lean getting worse, I grew more anxious to get the tree down.
As planned, on Friday morning the tree crew showed up ready to take it down. If any of the team noticed the Celtic cross carved into the tree they didn’t mention it. They went right to work starting with removing the top branches first. As they worked their way down the tree I tried to ignore the growing unease I felt. It seemed irrational, but nevertheless the feeling lingered. Around midday the tree seemed to give a slight lurch further to the right, knocking one of the men cutting the branches off balance and causing the branch he was working on to suddenly break off. It fell to the ground and delivered a glancing blow to one of the other men. It hit him hard enough to knock him to the ground, and when he stood back up it was obvious he had dislocated his shoulder.
After the hurt worker was loaded into one of the trucks and driven to the ER to get his arm looked it, the remaining men went back to work on the tree. By early afternoon the only thing left was the stump. The smaller branches had been loaded into the wood chipper and chopped into small pieces. The larger branches and trunk were cut into small logs and loaded on the back of one of the trucks. They now brought in the stump grinder and turned what remained of the trunk and visible roots into a pile of wood chips that were then shoveled into the back of one of the trucks. After that there was nothing left to do but to pack up, and as they prepared to leave I thanked them for their work. Then it was just me and Baxter in the backyard. I walked over to where the tree had once stood. I would need to put sod over the area. It was now just a few scattered wood chips and loose dirt.
That was three days ago. A lot has happened since then. The first morning after the oak was cut down I noticed there was a hole in the ground where it had stood. It wasn’t very large, but it looked impossibly deep. Even if Baxter had the nerve to go near the spot, it wasn’t a hole he could possibly have dug. The second morning the hole was bigger and still impossibly deep. Around the edges of it was bits of fur and pieces of bone of some unidentified animal. There were also markings in the dirt that looked like it had been clawed by a very large animal. The claw marks radiated outward from the hole. I spent the rest of that day getting bags of dirt from the Home Depot and filling in the hole. Only it never quite filled up
That was yesterday. This morning I woke up and found the hole was back and bigger than ever. There were footprints of several different people in the dirt around the hole. It wasn’t like the time they had appeared in the snow, rather it looked as if there had been some kind of struggle. The only other thing I found in the dirt with a necklace with a Celtic cross hung from it. The necklace was broken, but I put it in my pocket anyway. That was 12 hours ago. As it got dark I started to hear noises coming from the backyard. Baxter didn’t come back from his after dinner trip outside, and didn’t come when I called him. I did eventually hear him start barking. And it wasn’t a confident sounding bark. Baxter sounded terrified.
I’m beginning to suspect that it was never the tree that was the danger. The ceremony on the spring equinox, the Celtic cross carved into the tree were both designed to give it the ability to continue its job as jailer even if it died. Cutting it down was likely the last thing I should have done. And now something has come up from underneath where the oak once stood imprisoning it. I don’t know what it is, and I don’t know what it wants, but I hear it outside the house’s back door. Baxter’s barking stopped long ago with a strangled yelp. Maybe between the broken buzz saw and the dislocated shoulder the oak had been trying to tell me even a dead tree is better than no tree. I don’t think I will ever know the answer to that. That’s the problem with cutting down a tree. No one tells your how dangerous it might be.

Oh, I really liked this one!
You speak for all of us, of course - though some may not realise it yet. It may be the case that, thinking bak to the days of our youth, few (or fewer) doors are open to us now, but I find it reassuring to remember that one is enough. How many doors can a guy go through at any one time? Or am I being a touch romantic, a wee bit too optimistic? Maybe, for your prose impresses me greatly. I wish it didn't!

I’ve seen more women in recent years show up in labor with not a clue what to do. They read a few articles here and there, but not much else. They didn’t think it was necessary to learn about all their childbirth options because they were happy to do whatever their doctor told them to do, as long as they got an early epidural. They weren’t always quite so happy when labor turned out to be a totally different experience than they’d been prepared (or not prepared) for.
The LA Times article points out that a high percentage of women don’t know the pros, cons and safety issues associated with different pain management options, episiotomies, C-sections versus vaginal births and other childbirth issues. This left them unprepared to participate in their own medical care and unable to make informed choices about how they would deliver their babies and what would happen to their bodies both in the delivery room and years later.
What’s so bad about being uninformed? In any other medical situation where there are a variety of treatment options and care plans available, patients are encouraged to get a second opinion. This is especially true when surgery is involved. With labor and birth, there are so many options (some good and some not so good) that women have to provide their own real-time second opinions. They don’t usually have the option of asking another doctor to come in to their labor room and give them advice on how to proceed.
The study says women who received prenatal care from midwives were better informed than women who saw obstetricians. That doesn’t surprise me. Midwives tend to spend more time with their patients and education is a priority. The majority of women in this study, however, left all the decision-making up to their health care provider. In short, they did as they were told – no questions asked.
Does this doctor/patient dynamic sound like a healthy adult relationship or something akin to an adult-child relationship (the pregnant women plays the “child” here)? Is it a little weird that many women’s first experiences as mothers place them in a submissive, obedient role where they give away their power? Heck yeah, it’s weird and this is a “new generation” thing. Even as recently as a decade ago women came to childbirth knowing what to expect and how they wanted things to go down. They were well enough informed to voice their opinions about what happened to their bodies. Not so much these days. Too many women have become complacent, obedient and kind of gullible.
The researchers mentioned above published a related study, in the journal Birth that showed younger obstetricians were more likely than older obstetricians to be in favor of routine epidurals and express more concern about the safety of vaginal birth. Older doctors seem to be less afraid of vaginal birth. The younger doctors (whether male or female) tended to prefer C-sections as the better birthing option, even though studies show that increased c-section rates lead to poorer health outcomes.
This generational pro-C-section attitude may start in medical schools that aren’t adequately teaching old-school vaginal birth techniques. It may be because C-sections are faster, easier and more predictable than vaginal births. Or maybe it’s because too many doctors erroneously believe that C-sections prevent incontinence later in life (studies prove that’s not the case).
It may also be because younger doctors are being educated in a climate of fear where lawsuit prevention and malpractice insurance dictates standards of care. Make no mistake about it, lawyers and insurance agents have strong influences over what goes on in medical schools and labor and delivery rooms and way too often, they’re the most powerful voices in these rooms.
How do we change this power dynamic? By women having more to say about how their babies will be born. If women want their voices to be heard, they need to back them up with education, rather than blindly following orders.
Does it violate the doctor-patient “trust factor” to get informed and involved in your own medical care? No. Questioning your doctor’s opinions and decisions just makes good consumer sense. Your doctor isn’t your boss. He’s a consultant hired to provide a service. If you want the best possible service, you need to know a thing or two about the product. In this case, the product is maternal/newborn healthcare. How do you get informed? By taking prenatal education classes, reading all the books and magazines you can and by asking questions. Lots and lots of.Manuscripts

Web Design by BlueKey in Charleston, SCWhat does David Brat, the Tea Party’s new star, have in common with Elizabeth Warren, the Occupy Wall Street senator from Massachusetts? They both understand that America is still traumatized and angry over the 2008 financial crisis.
Mainstream pols in Brat’s party, take note.
Last week, Brat, an economics professor, came out of nowhere to thrash Eric Cantor, the House GOP’s No. 2 guy, in a Virginia primary.
People say Cantor lost because he wanted to legalize some illegal immigrants — or because people are tired of business as usual, including the Cantor campaign’s nearly $200,000 worth of steak dinners.
OK, but Brat won on another issue, too: ending what he calls “crony capitalism” for the financial industry.
“Eric voted to bail out the big Wall Street banks in 2008,” Brat reminded voters on his Web site. “It is no coincidence that the same banks that received TARP bailout funds are also some of Cantor’s largest donors.”
On Brat’s “issues” list, bashing Cantor for his TARP vote comes ahead of bashing Cantor for supporting “illegal immigration amnesty” and “fully fund[ing] ObamaCare.”
Brat was even more explicit in speeches. “All the investment banks in New York and DC — those guys should have gone to jail,” he told a crowd last month, according to the Financial Times. “Instead of going to jail, they went on Eric’s Rolodex.”
Then, there was the STOCK Act, which outlawed pols’ insider trading. Nobody paid attention to this 2012 bill, except, apparently, voters. “Eric Cantor added an amendment to the bipartisan STOCK Act [that] allows family members of congressmen to get rich from insider trading,” one Brat supporter wrote in a letter to The Virginia Free Citizen three weeks before Election Day.
“And he voted to bail out the big Wall Street banks,” she added.
That Brat was able to use Cantor’s support of Wall Street to propel himself to victory highlights a dilemma for GOP pols.
It was a Republican president who signed into law the biggest bailout in American history — yet most Republicans still don’t want to talk about it. They criticize Obama for criticizing the bankers — and think that somehow helps them.
Yes, they’re right to bash Obama’s flawed Dodd-Frank financial-regulation law: It didn’t end too big to fail, as top Obama administration officials have admitted to Congress.
But mainstream GOP contenders don’t ever come out and say: People are correct to be upset that the bankers who helped cause the 2008 crisis continue to do just fine, even if they got fired — while regular people struggle with a burden of mortgage and student-loan debt even if they didn’t lose their jobs.
It should be a key part of Republican speeches to acknowledge how badly the financial industry failed on Republicans’ watch — and to vow to hold Wall Street accountable to free-market forces as well as to the justice system.
But in the 2012 presidential primaries, only Rick Santorum brought it up.
Republicans seem to hope that, as time passes, people will blame Obama and the Democrats, not the Republicans, for the 2008 mess and its hangover.
Maybe, but it’s taking a long time. In April, The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll asked voters what’s to blame for “current economic conditions” — “Obama’s policies” or a “situation Obama inherited.” Five-plus years into this presidency, 47 percent still blamed Obama’s predecessor. Only 39 percent blame Obama.
Yes, Obama’s economic policies have ranged from ineffectual to harmful.But the country’s biggest economic challenge over the past half-decade has been paying off the private-sector debt incurred over the previous decade. Household debt doubled between 2000 and 2008, to nearly $14 trillion.
People get that there was never going to be a good way out of this mess, which is why blaming Obama still doesn’t fly.
A mainstream Republican who embraces fixing Wall Street — and openly admits the GOP’s past failures — would arm him- or herself well against one potential opponent: Hillary Clinton.
Clinton showed her own tune-deafness last week, saying that she and Bill came out of the White House “dead broke.” Of course, donations from the world’s bailed-out top 1 percent allowed the Clintons to climb from poverty into private jets.
Brat’s free-market purism isn’t the answer for the entire GOP (he’s against Medicare prescription drugs, among other things). But the party needs to learn from his victory: Republicans can’t be apologists for Wall Street’s failings if they want to run a credible national race in two years.

Emanuel has discussed Chicago hosting a Super Bowl, and an extra 5,000 seats could add to the strength of a bid. Chicago has one of the smallest stadiums in the league, so every little bit helps.
For most of what the Super Bowl needs, Chicago is the perfect host. Hotels near the venue, fantastic restaurants, clubs to host every party possible, experience with huge events, two large airports, a transportation infrastructure already in place — Chicago has it all. A larger stadium could help the city’s bid.
But there is always one inescapable fact about the city of Chicago and the Super Bowl. The game is in early February, and in February, Chicago is awful.
It’s hard to imagine a Super Bowl in my hometown after a winter that has been un-Bear-able. OK, that was awful, but so was the weather. Chicago has broken century-old records for cold weather and snowfall this winter. Today, on March 5, I am looking out the window at a freshly fallen snow.
Even after the New Jersey Super Bowl showed football fans can handle cold weather, this is not a Chicago we want to share with the world.
No, come to Chicago in May, when tulips fill Michigan Avenue. Come in June, when the streets are filled with festivals that treat you to food from every part of the world. Come in July, when Lake Michigan is filled with boats and swimmers and at a few beaches, very happy dogs. Come in August, when baseball teams have no hope, but football teams suddenly do. Come in September, when you can actually get a nice suntan sitting in Soldier Field. Come in October, when the entire city comes out to support world class athletes — and the guy sitting in the next cubicle — at the Bank of America Marathon.
But February? This is not the place to be.DEFINITION of 'Capital Markets Group'

I have basically got to the point that I wanted to reset the laptop to factory settings to either make more space for a Linux partition, or go all the way and make this a Linux only laptop.

Some of you might remember Leymah Gbowee from Liberia, Director of the Women Peace and Security Network Africa, talking about the protest for peace in Liberia at CSW 52. Christian and Muslim women were tired of seeing their husbands and sons killed in a devastating civil war and therefore went out on the streets for sit-ins and other kinds of peaceful protest. The film “Pray the davil back to hell” featuring Leymah Gbowee and her protest movement was recently awarded “Best New Narrative Filmmaker Award” at the Tribeca film festival. So far the documentary is not yet available on DVD, but the trailer can be seen on the website.
This morning, I attended ECOSOC’s special event, “Achieving the MDG’s and coping with the challenges of climage change.” It was of course interesting, as I usually find most things related to climate change, but what I found particularly moving were the comments spoken by the delegate from Belgium (who did not speak on behalf of Belgium, but for the committee for CSW). He outlined how climate change disproportionately and negatively affects women, and spoke about how women can acts as agents of change in the mitigation of global warming.
Of course, this year’s 52nd session of the CSW chose as it’s emerging issue “Gender perspectives on climate change“, where we learned that women’s lives are effected in large part due to their domestic responsibilities. As the moderator’s summary stresses,
In Africa, for example, women have primary responsibility for food security, household water supply, and the provision of energy for cooking and heating. Conditions such as drought, deforestation and erratic rainfall have a disproportionate negative affect on their ability to carry out these duties. As climate change causes African women to work harder to secure these basic resources, they have less time to secure an education or earn an income. Girls are more likely than boys to drop out of school to help their mothers gather fuel, wood and water.
The unequal effects that climate change already has, and will likely continue to have, along the lines of gender, are rarely mentioned. As we move towards mitigation and adaptation to climate change, we must do so with a lens that prioritizes women as the large majority of those greatly affected by climate change.

The first time he stepped foot on campus, Josh Cooley ’12 felt as though he had come home. “The people, the view, and the atmosphere had me hooked,” he recalls. Cooley came to Plymouth State in 2009 as a transfer student from Great Bay Community College. He quickly immersed himself in academics and in campus life, joining ALSO/PSU Pride, becoming a Diversity Fellow, working as a sign language tutor in the PASS Office, singing with Vocal Order, a student a capella group, and serving as a student orientation leader. Cooley found himself striving daily to live up to the University’s motto Ut prosim (That I may serve).
When Hurricane Irene hit Plymouth and the surrounding communities in 2011, Cooley helped staff an emergency shelter in the Hartman Union Building. He recalls, “My most rewarding moment out of that experience was when a mother of three came up to me and gave me a hug and simply said, ‘Thank you.’ I will never forget her face and the sincerity in her voice. I knew then that I had made a real difference in someone’s life, and that I had officially been able to say that I, along with the emergency personnel and other orientation leaders, had lived our motto. Plymouth State University has changed my life with experiences just like this.”.Rense.com
Blair Warns Of Climate
Change Catastrophe
By Tom Happold and Agencies
The Guardian - UK
9-14-4
Tony Blair warned today that time was "running out" to avert the human and economic catastrophe of unchecked climate change.
Speaking at a round-table discussion about the environment, ahead of a speech on the subject this evening, the prime minister described global warming as a "huge issue" which needed renewed political will if it was to be tackled.
Mr Blair is tonight expected to call for a "green industrial revolution" and promise to use Britain's presidency of the G8 group of leading industrial nations next year to push for greater international cooperation to tackle climate change.
But Mr Blair will not confirm whether the UK government will expand the use of nuclear power, which many scientists believe is essential to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Questioned about the issue on BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat programme, he said: "I think there are still major problems [with nuclear power] ... we have to handle the issues to do with storage and waste."
"We're not shutting the door on anything but you have to take account of those realities," he added. "And in the meantime there are other technologies that we could be using that would make a significant difference to climate change."
Mr Blair's speech comes after he was criticised yesterday by the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, for his failure to persuade the US to sign up to the Kyoto protocol, which was designed to reduce greenhouse gases emissions.
Mr Howard also side-stepped the nuclear issue yesterday; excluding it from his speech, and replying when challenged about it afterwards that it was a matter for a Conservative government to decide once in office.
Scientists are increasingly pushing for the government to give the go ahead for an expansion in nuclear energy, as the only means for Britain to meet its Kyoto target to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
A report in today's Times claims that the director of strategic development at the Department of Trade and Industry's energy unit, Adrian Gault, has told ministers that nuclear power will have to provide half of Britain's electricity needs if it is to do so.
Currently, nuclear power provides only a fifth of Britain's electricity, but the nation's nuclear power plants are ageing and will be closed down progressively from 2008.
Earlier today, Mr Blair's official spokesman played down the DTI advice, describing it as only an option paper, which has not been seen by ministers.
Speaking at the round-table discussion, Mr Blair was pessimistic about the prospects of the US government changing its position.
"Let's be absolutely blunt about it: I do not think the US Senate is going to vote for ratification of Kyoto. It would be nice if they did, but I can't see it.
"We have to do two things at the G8 - the first is an explicit acceptance of the science by all the governments there. That has not really happened up until now for a very obvious reason, because the next question is: 'Well, what are you going to do about it?'
"The next thing we need is an agreement on the process to take this forward. That will require an examination of the science and technologies... step by step so that certain measures are taken."
This evening, Mr Blair is also expected to focus on the environmental impact of the expanding airline sector, saying that he wants to use Britain's presidency of the EU next year to press for the aviation industry to be brought within the EU's emissions trading scheme.
And he will say that it is his ambition to use Britain's G8 presidency to "build a scientific and policy consensus among governments around which vigorous global action can be taken".
The prime minister plans to host a conference on climate change at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in February in advance of the G8 summit at Gleneagles in Scotland.
He will also add that Britain can lead the world in developing renewal energies, such a wave and tidal power, bio-energy and hydrogen fuel cells.
"We need a green industrial revolution for the 21st century that sustains growth but protects the environment," he is expected to say.

In the first debate since elections on the euro zone, Rutte's Liberal Party, and Labour, both pro-European, also jointly expressed skepticism towards European Council President Herman Van Rompuy's plan of a single euro zone budget.
Rutte is in coalition talks with Labour leader Diederik Samsom and is expected to form a government within weeks.
The election result last month helped put to rest fears the Netherlands would block future bailouts or prove a difficult partner in solving the crisis.
Rutte and Labour finance specialist Ronald Plasterk, who is seen as one of the possible successors to Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager, agreed on the need to first implement European banking supervision, and then take further steps of creating a banking union.
"How can you make sure that the Dutch deposit holder is not guaranteeing accounts at banks in Italy, Austria or Spain when we don't know what's happening there? That is exactly the reason why we are building this up step by step," Rutte said.
Plasterk used similar words, and said: "We agree with anyone who says that now you cannot fully guarantee toxic banks in Spain. You have to make sure that there is decent supervision."
Rutte reiterated the Dutch position of meeting fiscal rules in Europe, cutting budget deficits, and reforming economies.
Plasterk said his party had always been positive about budget rules, adding there was a tension between meeting financial conditions and stimulating the economy. Labour is open to giving countries more time to meet fiscal targets.
Rutte and Plasterk also questioned the need for a single euro zone budget, which has been proposed by Van Rompuy.
Rutte said he would discuss it next week at a European Council summit, where European leaders will discuss Van Rompuy's proposals to solve the region's debt crisis.
"We have 100 billion euros in structural fund means available for the euro zone alone. I don't understand what purpose this serves. I'd also like to know -- and I will ask this next week -- how this relates to the long term financial European Union framework," Rutte said.
Speaking about Van Rompuy's proposal of a single euro zone budget, Plasterk said: "We don't see the advantages of it for now. Adding another institute, we are not in favour of this."
On Greece, Plasterk reiterated Labour was willing to give it "some room" to get its finances in order, while Rutte declined to repeat his statement last month during the election campaign that he was not willing to give a penny more to Greece.
Any statement about Greece could impact financial markets and developments in Greece, Rutte said.

There are no critic reviews yet.Anyone who drives enough miles – especially on the highway – will experience a chipped windshield or two. There’s no avoiding it. Tires on nearby vehicles often kick up small pieces of gravel or other small objects that can hit hard enough to chip out a piece of glass. And sometimes rocks or gravel can fall out of a truck and right onto your windshield – that’s happened to me.
If you’ve experienced a chip, you may have noticed that it didn’t grow and didn’t crack the glass around it. Maybe that chip isn’t affecting your road vision and isn’t particularly bothering you. And with that in mind, you don’t want to spend the money on a repair. That’s understandable. But it’s not the right thing to do.
There are two basic reasons why you shouldn’t delay more than a few days in getting that chip on your windshield repaired. One, the longer you wait to repair a chip, the less likely it is for a repair to be effective; in that case, the windshield will need to be replaced. Two, chips can expand quickly and unpredictably into large cracks that can pose a hazard to your safety.
Some chips can remain stable and seemingly unchanged, giving you the sense that you can take your time in addressing the problem. But any chip in the glass can be penetrated by dirt or other substances that lodge into tiny cracks and can’t be washed out. Once this happens, any effort to repair the chip will lock in the substance for good, resulting in a stain in your windshield.
The earlier you arrange for the chip to be properly sealed by your local windshield repair professionals, the less chance dirt has to penetrate your windshield’s surface. So arrange for a repair right away, and plan to get it done within a few days.
Maybe you’re thinking that you could live with a small blemish in your windshield – especially if that little cloud of dirt isn’t in your field of vision. So you would be in no hurry to arrange for a repair. The problem with this reasoning is that chips can expand at any time – even if you don’t plan to drive your car.
Many factors can put stress on a windshield: changes in temperature and moisture are just two. And some areas of the windshield – particularly those on the outside edges – are under perpetual stress and are especially vulnerable. All of these factors are in play even when the car is stationary, so there is always a chance for a small chip to grow into a larger crack.
The next time your windshield suffers a chip, here’s what you should do: Cover the chip to protect against dirt and moisture. Avoid temperature extremes. And arrange for a windshield repair right away. If you don’t, that easy repair could turn into an expensive replacement.PPMET offers programs and resources covering a variety of topics related to sexuality.

ANGLEY School came together in the 1970s when the Cranbrook based Mary Sheafe Girls' School merged with Swattenden Boys' School.
The school developed under headteachers Michael Head and Stephanie Bedford.
Current principal Philip Morris joined Angley in March 2006 after seven years as the deputy at the Judd School in Tonbridge.
In 2000, the school, on Angley Road, Cranbrook, became Kent's first specialist sports college and it now prides itself on its sport.
Students of all ages are involved in a full fixture list throughout the summer. Current star teams are the Year Nine boys' basketball team, who have been dominant in their fixtures this year and the girls' under 14 football team.
The status has allowed stars to thrive, and the school boasts England number one under-15 cadet in table tennis Lewis Gray, who has his eyes fixed on the 2012 London Olympics. In December the 15-year-old will represent Great Britain in an international tournament in Portugal.
Rebecca Manford, 14, is a top equestrian who performs at the highest level in show jumping, dressage and cross country. She recently came second in a major dressage event with her sister Katy, who also attends the school.
Champion go-carter Jake Hill is 15 and 13-year-old Josh Parkin is a nationally ranked cross country and BMX cyclist, while 15-year-old Luke Bennett had trampolining success earlier this year.
Since gaining the sports specialist status, the school has gained further specialist status in maths, ICT and vocational education.
Mr Morris said: "These achievements have placed Angley as a leading school, both locally and nationally, and have allowed its students to thrive in a supportive environment where everyone can achieve their potential."
A key element of the sports specialism is Angley's Community Partnership which involves more than 40 primary and nine secondary schools in tournaments and festivals across West Kent.
In addition Angley has enjoyed a long term partnership with the Nonsi Witthaya School in Bangkok, supported by the Youth Sport Trust and British Council.
Mr Morris said: "This has led to expeditions by our students to visit Thailand and carry out community projects in the country including running sports festivals in our partner school."
He added: "Visits from Nonsi School to Angley have allowed students here to encounter a very different culture and has enriched their experience, giving them a broader view of the world."
This month Angley extended its connections by agreeing a partnership with a Shanghai school, which will provide opportunities for joint language, enterprise and sports projects.
Do you have something to say? Leave your comment here...Windows PC owners be warned — there’s a new strain of malware out there that befuddles users into helping it accomplish its dirty deeds via mouse clicks.
Dubbed “Trojan Upclicker” by the FireEye Malware Intelligence Lab researchers who identified it, this elusive bit of malicious code is purpose-built to evade identification by the automated analysis systems used by many anti-virus vendors.
FireEye researchers Abhishek Singh and Yasir Khalid noted that Trojan Upclicker is a variant of malware using a newly recognised technique highlighted recently by Symantec.
Once installed on a PC, Trojan Upclicker works by hooking its functionality to a computer mouse. Basically, the code only executes when the mouse’s left button is clicked and released, at which point it opens Internet Explorer and injects its payload of nastiness.
What’s clever about this approach is that the sandbox environments used by researchers to analyse malware don’t incorporate mouse inputs, so Trojan Upclicker and similarly designed viruses remain dormant and undetected in those automated analysis systems.
Singh and Khalid get pretty detailed in a blog post on Trojan Upclicker, explaining how it uses the ‘0Eh’ parameter and function ‘SetWinodwsHookExA’ to hook a mouse and monitor mouse movements. The aforementioned click and release of the left button triggers the function ‘UnhookWindowsHookEx’ to “unhook the malicious code from the mouse, after which the code makes a call to the function sub_401170(), which then executes the malicious code,” according to the duo.
In Internet Explorer, Trojan Upclicker generates a DNS query/reply for the domain ‘sendmsg.jumpingcrab.com’, establishing a malicious communication channel through destination ports 80 and 443, the pair said.
The two FireEye researchers guessed that more malware like Trojan Upclicker would emerge.
“From the analysis it is concluded that the Trojan Upclicker establishes malicious communication only when the left mouse button is clicked and released. Since, in sandboxes, there is no mouse interaction, the malicious behaviour of Upclicker remains dormant in a sandbox environment,” Singh and Khalid wrote.
“In order to process enormous amounts of samples, automated sandbox analysis is commonly being used by the anti-virus industry. To evade automated analysis, we expect to see more such samples that can use a specific aspect like pressing specific keys, specific mouse buttons, or movement of the mouse a certain distance to evade the automated analysis,” they added.
The arrival of Trojan Upclicker on the malware scene follows a similarly malicious bit of covert code, dubbed FakeLookout, which affected Google’s Play store earlier in the year.Leave a comment on this articleMake PoliceOne your homepage

Complete Coverage: Dodgers' ChangeUp
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross approved of the Los Angeles Dodgers’ plan to sell the team for $2 billion, setting them up to close out a years-long bankruptcy case. Gross used the specifically sporty term to describe the two-part morning and evening hearing that he presided over.
Fans on Dodgers Deal: It May Be Magic
The decision came weeks after Guggenheim Baseball Management, a group that includes former LA Lakers star Magic Johnson, won the bid for the team on March 27.
Former Atlanta Braves president Stan Kasten, who will run the team, and former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt were in court Friday, the AP reported.
With this final approval, the team will be completely signed over to the new management group by April 30, the same day McCourt is to make a $131 million payment to his former wife Jamie as part of their divorce.
"We are pleased to have successfully concluded the Chapter 11 reorganization process," the team said in a statement released Friday. "All the organization’s goals in the reorganization cases have been achieved. We look forward to returning all of our attention to Dodger baseball."
Turmoil within the Dodgers began in 2011 when the team entered bankruptcy. At the time, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig refused to approve a new TV deal with Fox Sports, threatening to nix a deal the team was counting on in order to make payroll and keep the franchise solvent.
After the bankruptcy filing, Selig’s attorneys successfully fought to force the Dodgers to accept bankruptcy financing from the league.
An agreement governing the team’s sale and a process to market the media rights to games was reached last year and will take start in 2014.
Lawyers for Dodgers agreed Friday to give written assurance to Fox, the team’s current broadcaster, that competitor Time Warner Cable was not contributing funds being used for the purchase.
Friday’s hearing helped resolve a number of lingering issues, but lawyers for the Dodgers and MLB sparred over the information being given to the league about the plan.
A lawyer for MLB said the league is owned more information about the plan, which they take issue with, the AP reported. A lawyer for the Dodgers countered that argument saying the team has met all criteria to have the plan confirmed.
The judge agreed, calling the prospective new owners an “outstanding group.”The semolina lends a little crunch to these biscuits, topped with a light, sweet cream and tart strawberries.

Powell: Bailey the perfect fit
Castleford coach Daryl Powell says new signing Ryan Bailey will bring a wealth of experience to the club..If your cat becomes unconscious, respiratory arrest may occur, and usually occurs before cardiac arrest. The heart may continue to beat for several minutes after the breathing stops. Artificial respiration, or rescue breathing, must begin immediately to save your cat's life. If the heart stops, chest compressions must be given right away to keep the blood pumping. Artificial respiration and chest compressions given together are called cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR.
Artificial Respiration
If your cat has gone into respiratory arrest, begin artificial respiration immediately.
Lay your cat on his side on a flat surface.
Be sure your cat. Be careful not to push the object farther down the airway. If the object cannot be reached or pulled out, use the Heimlich maneuver. Do not mistake the small bones in the throat for a foreign object.
Once the airway is clear, begin rescue breathing.
With your cat on his side, lift the chin to straighten out his throat.
Use one hand to grasp the muzzle and hold the mouth shut.
Put your mouth completely over the nose and blow gently; the chest should expand. Blow gently - just enough to move his chest.
Wait for the air to leave the lungs before breathing again.
Continue this, giving 20 breaths per minute (one breath every three seconds), until your cat breathes on his own or as long as the heart beats.
Continue to monitor the heartbeat.
CPR
If your cat.

Pretend food and kitchens offer a valuable learning tool for these times of unstructured activity. In most cases, children will begin acting out scenes in which they are most familiar (i.e. a mother pouring her child a bowl of cereal, a father soothing a crying baby, etc.). Not only do these imaginary exercises help children to order the world around them into manageable pieces, but also allows them to learn the important skills of perspective taking, successfully interacting with others, and even hand eye coordination.
At MPM School Supplies we carry a diverse selection of toy food. Along with the typical fruits and vegetables, meats, and dry goods, introduce your students to world cuisine with our ethnic-inspired pretend food sets. Help your students distinguish between healthy and unhealthy food choices with our U.S.D.A. Food Pyramid based collections. Our convenient themed starter kits, created by Pretend and Play®, make it easy to stock your play kitchens with the right props.
Because we know that many parents, teachers, and even schools are operating on limited budgets, we proudly offer Smart Snacks®, pretend and play food toys that also double as educational games and activities. Furnish your pretend corner with everything from a cookie jar that strengthens counting skills and cupcakes that inspire shape recognition to pizza fractions and trail mix matching!!.

plz send me BER 64 QAM modulation code in AWGN
I´ve proved with the same code and the result was diferent
Gordon: Frankly speaking I could not figure this out easily and had to do a simulation. It turns out that there is significant difference (2-3 dB) at low EbNo but at higher signal to noise ratios the difference is reduced to a fraction of a dB.
The simulation considered 64-QAM modulation but similar results are expected for other modulation schemes.
May I know the sensitivity difference between the cases with and without gray coding?
Best
Gordon
Just use the code as it is. Change ‘k’ to get the different curves (k=2,4,6,8).
Hello,
I tried to do the graphic that you upload to the website in order to calculate the theorical BER of 4-QAM, 16-QAM and 64-QAM.

Popular Cameras
Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX100
Image Quality
All of the sample images in this Review were taken using the 14 megapixel JPEG setting, which gives an average image size of around 4Mb.
The Canon Digital IXUS 130 produces images of above average quality. The biggest issue is noise and loss of detail at relatively slow ISO speeds. The 1/2.3 inch, 14 megapixel sensor recorded noise-free images at ISO 80 and 100, but there's already some noise and slight colour desaturation at ISO 200. ISO 400 shows more noise and loss of colour, and ISO 800 and 1600 are even worse, with obvious loss of fine detail and further colour desaturation. Digital IXUS 130 at the default sharpening setting and ideally require some further sharpening in an application like Adobe Photoshop, or you can change the in-camera setting.
Noise
There are 6 ISO settings available on the Canon Digital IXUS 130..
Focal Range
The Canon Digital IXUS 130's 4x zoom lens provides a focal length of 28-112mm in 35mm terms, as demonstrated below.
File Quality
The Canon Digital IXUS 130 has 2 different image quality settings available, with Fine being the highest quality option. Here are some 100% crops which show the quality of the various options, with the file size shown in brackets.
Chromatic Aberrations
The Canon Digital IXUS 130 handled chromatic aberrations quite well during the review, with some purple fringing present around the edges of objects in high-contrast situations, as shown in the examples below.
Macro
The Canon Digital IXUS 130 allows you to focus on a subject that is 3cms away from the camera. The first image shows how close you can get to the subject (in this case a compact flash card). The second image is a 100% crop.

US Secretary of State John Kerry returned to the Mekong River in Vietnam for the first time since 1968 to discuss the impacts of climate change on the region. He also expressed concerns about plans by China to build four more dams along the Mekong to generate power for its rising economy, projects that will have a disastrous downstream impact on Cambodia and Vietnam, according to environmental specialists.
The New York Times reports California drillers eager to use hydraulic fracturing to tap the nation’s largest oil shale formation will face comprehensive regulation for the first time under rules that take effect on Jan. 1.
According to The Hill, The American Petroleum Institute and more than a dozen other groups say that Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus’s recent draft discussion would hurt their abilities to recover costs and invest in the economy. A draft discussion released by Baucus (D-Mont.) would roll back a tax break that allows companies to write off property more quickly than it depreciates.
Newly appointed adviser John Podesta is expected to play a central role helping agencies and departments implement President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, unveiled earlier this year. “He will advise on a range of issues with a particular focus on issues of energy and climate change,” said White House press secretary Jay Carney.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) wants to lead the debate on whether the U.S. should break with its decades-old ban on crude oil exports, as soon as mid-January. She plans to release a white paper on the pros and cons of US export policy on crude, one of her top aides told The Hill.

He continued to follow him. The gated complex was 20 percent black, so seeing a black teen should not have been suspect.
I grew up in Alabama and still visit my many relatives living there. Race relations have changed very little during the 50-plus years I have lived in California. In all honesty, I don't think Zimmerman would have followed a white teen.

Ahmed Zewail will receive honorary Doctor of Science
Baccalaureate speaker Ahmed Zewail says that “a major cause of troubles around the world is due to ignorance, not only in the lack of basic education, but also due to misinformation about cultures and religions.” Photo courtesy of Ahmed Zewail
Ahmed Zewail, a Nobel Prize–winning chemist and technology advisor to President Barack Obama, will deliver the Baccalaureate address at Marsh Chapel on May 22 at 11 a.m., and will receive an honorary Doctor of Science degree at the main Commencement ceremony. Zewail is the recipient of many international awards for his contributions to science and the public interest.
Zewail, the Linus Pauling Professor of Chemistry and a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, where he is the director of the Moore Foundation’s Center for Physical Biology, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1999 for his work in femtoscience, which employs high-powered lasers to observe atomic motion over fractions of a second.
Farouk El-Baz, a research professor and director of BU’s Center for Remote Sensing, says the implications of Zewail’s discoveries are far-reaching. The ability to measure and photograph interactions at the atomic scale in the “tiniest possible fraction of a second that you can imagine,” he says, means scientists could manipulate atoms in new ways.
“When we began, it was thought unreal to observe atoms in the course of matter’s transformation,” Zewail says. “The applications now span a number of areas, from dentistry and brain imaging to lithography and materials processing.”
In 2009, President Obama appointed Zewail to the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and also named him the first United States Science Envoy to the Middle East.
“As I see it, a major cause of troubles around the world is due to ignorance, not only in the lack of basic education, but also due to misinformation about cultures and religions,” says Zewail. “It seems to me that using useful knowledge, through science diplomacy, is a powerful soft power for enlightenment and, incidentally, costs much less.”
Zewail travels widely in the Arab world to promote the idea that scientific knowledge can help further economic development.
El-Baz and Zewail, both born in Egypt, met in the White House and have since worked together as advisors in Egypt to promote education and scientific development. They were members of the first board of directors of the Library of Alexandria and later served on Egypt’s Supreme Council for Science and Technology.
Zewail earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the University of Alexandria and a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania. He did a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley, before joining the California Institute of Technology faculty in 1976.
Ahmed Zewail is one of six honorary degree recipients at this year’s BU Commencement. Victoria Reggie Kennedy, an advocate on behalf of children and families, will be presented with a Doctor of Laws. Jacques Pépin, chef, television personality, and author, will receive the Doctor of Humane Letters. Noted painter and sculptor Frank Stella will be awarded a Doctor of Fine Arts. NPR journalist Nina Totenberg, the NPR journalist, will be presented with a Doctor of Humane Letters. Commencement speaker Katie Couric, the Emmy-award winning broadcast journalist and the first solo woman anchor of a network news broadcast, will be awarded a Doctor of Humane Letters.

An AB-109 probationer was arrested early Monday for allegedly running from police and jumping in the Sacramento River.
Officers saw 22-year-old Brandon Reynolds around 2:30 a.m., riding a bicycle near closed businesses along Athens Avenue and Park Marina Drive.
Police said he rode away, hiding under the Cypress Avenue bridge, and jumping into the river.
Officers used a helicopter and caught him when he got out of the river around Freebridge Street.
According to Redding Police, Reynolds was on AB 109 Post Release Community Supervision for consensual sexual intercourse with a minor.
He was booked into the Shasta County Jail for violating the terms of his Post Release Community Supervision, resisting a peace officer, and possession of drug paraphernalia.
This article contains a correction: A previous version of this article identified Reynolds as being on Post Release Community Supervision (AB 109) for rape as was reported by a Redding Police Department press release. Reynolds was in fact under supervision for consensual intercourse with a minor.For thousands of years, Pacific Islanders have used a variety of traditional practices to effectively manage and sustainably use marine resources. In many cultures there is a long history of setting aside areas for protection of species and habitats (see Table 2 for some examples).
In modern times, the term marine protected area or MPA can mean different things to different people. For some, the term conjures up the image of “no-entry” areas designed to keep people out in favor of protecting nature.
For others it may mean a “no-take” area established to restrict fishing activities. And for still others it may mean a recreation area or park set aside to enhance access to particular activities. Guam’s five locally established marine preserves are types of MPAs, and even these have different regulations associated with each place. So what exactly do we mean, when we refer to MPAs?
In order to provide a common language for people around the world in reference to protected areas, including MPAs, the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) developed a system of protected area management categories for both terrestrial and marine sites, approved and published in a set of guidelines in 1994. The WCPA definition of a protected area is:
“An area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means.”
According to the IUCN and UNEP / WCMC (2003), there are now more than 100,000 protected areas that have been established for such reasons as protection of species and habitats, watershed protection, promotion of tourism, for recreation, research, education, and as the homelands for indigenous peoples. They vary greatly in size, are given many different names, and have been established by various mechanisms, both legal and traditional. They are owned and managed by governments, communities, NGOs, or combinations of these.
The IUCN Protected Area Management Categories are defined in Table 1.
Table 1. The IUCN Protected Area Management Categories
* Category Ia - Strict nature reserve/wilderness protection area managed mainly for science or wilderness protection – an area of land and/or sea possessing some outstanding or representative ecosystems, geological or physiological features and/or species, available primarily for scientific research and/or environmental monitoring.
* Category 1b - Wilderness area: protected area managed mainly for wilderness protection – large area of unmodified or slightly modified land and/or sea, retaining its natural characteristics and influence, without permanent or significant habitation, which is protected and managed.
* Category III - Natural monument: protected area managed mainly for conservation of specific natural features – area containing specific natural or natural/cultural feature(s) of outstanding or unique value because of their inherent rarity, representativeness or aesthetic qualities or cultural significance.
* Category IV - Habitat/Species Management Area: protected area managed mainly for conservation through management intervention – area of land and/or sea subject to active intervention for management purposes so as to ensure the maintenance of habitats to meet the requirements of specific species.
* Category V - Protected Landscape/Seascape: protected area managed mainly for landscape/seascape conservation or recreation – area of land, with coast resources – area containing predominantly unmodified natural systems, managed to ensure long-term protection and maintenance of biological diversity, while also providing a sustainable flow of natural products and services to meet community needs.
The IUCN categories system was designed for global use. Thus the guidance is broad and general and the system is meant to be interpreted flexibly, allowing regions or countries to interpret them for their own needs and applications.
Recognizing that the future cultural and economic health of the islands of Micronesia depend upon the conservation of marine and terrestrial environments, the Chief Executives of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau, committed to the effective conservation of at least 30% of the near shore marine resources and at least 20% of the terrestrial resources across Micronesia by 2020. This visionary commitment, the “Micronesia Challenge”, was conceived as a result of the deep commitment of these five leaders to ensure a healthy future for their people, protect their unique island cultures, and sustain the livelihoods of their island communities, by sustaining the island biodiversity of Micronesia.
Guam and each of the other four jurisdictions are designing their own strategies to implement the MC involving partnerships between Government agencies, NGOs and local communities. And each of the five jurisdictions is embracing the broad range of categories of protected areas identified by the IUCN, as well as incorporating additional management activities, to achieve the goals of the Micronesia Challenge.

Table 2. Traditional and modern names for protected areas in the region.
Because of differences in purpose, MPAs have many modern and traditional names within the region and throughout the world. Some of these include:
TRADITIONAL NAMES
* Kapu – Hawaii
* Mo –Marshall Islands
* Bul – Palau
* Wasahn Nahk - Pohnpei
MODERN NAMES
Marine Preserve – Guam
Locally Managed Marine Area –Fiji
Marine Life Conservation District – Hawaii
Fisheries Replenishment Area – Hawaii
Sanctuary/Marine Sanctuary – CNMI/American Samoa/Kosrae
Community-based Fisheries Management Reserves – American Samoa
Marine Conservation Area – CNMI

Compare Prices on Celebrity Eclipse Europe - Eastern Mediterranean Cruises
Celebrity Eclipse - Jan/Feb 2012
This was a back to back cruise for 28/01 and 04/02. I have only been on a couple of Princess cruises in the past but found the Celebrity experience just as enjoyable. We arrived in Miami on 27/01 and stayed in the Miami airport hotel for the night after the long flight from Manchester via Philadelphia. The hotel was just okay, I expected the lobby and bar area to be nice relaxing place but it was a bit run down, reminded me slightly of a bar in a shabby railway station. The room was comfortable though but overall I think if I cruised from Miami again I would stay pre-cruise outside the airport.
It was a nice warm day on the Saturday when we boarded and were very impressed with the ship when we had a look around. In fact throughout the two weeks the weather was very good. On the first sea day on the Sunday morning it was cloudy with a brief shower and a very brief shower in St Maarten but apart from that it was warm and sunny throughout. It was a bit breezy at time but it was More no problem.
The ship was very impressive and all the fixtures and fittings were top class. There was artwork all over the ship which made very interesting viewing. I also liked the divers video that was shown on the video screens in the oceanview cafe, it was strangely captivating! Anybody who has been on the Eclipse will know the video I mean.
Our room was a Concierge room and again everything was top quality, loved the little extras that came with Concierge especially the footrests on the balcony which made the loungers virtually a full sun lounger. The bathrobes were also very nice -- nearly bought one but resisted ! Our room was just 2 rooms from the back of the ship which made it a very quiet room as little traffic passed although it was some way to the lifts.
The ship was very clean and modern. It still has that new feel to it and is very well designed throughout. There are examples of interesting artwork all over the ship which also added to the ambience on board. The lawn club on the top deck was an unusual feature. Initially I thought it would be a waste of space but it was quite a relaxing area to sit in the comfy chairs and have a drink looking over the lawn area night or day, so it got my approval.
Most things about the ship were very positive but I will just summarise a few points including the negative ones.
Positive :
Enjoyed all the stops even though we did some twice, particular the evening stops in Puerto Rico. It was very enjoyable going for an evening out, particularly the bar that invented the pina colada -- of course we had to sample one or two !
Well done to Celebrity for utilising their outdoor areas on an evening. Most of their outdoor bars were open until late and often some entertainment was put on. Having only been on Princess before it was a welcome change as they tended to shut everything down outdoors by 8pm apart from the party night.
Getting on and off the ship both at stops and at the start and end of cruise. All very smooth and quick.
The Oceanview cafe with the different food stations, very well set out and lots of choice at peak times.
Excellent theatre and shows, obviously a lot of money has gone into putting it all together.
The ship in general, a great place to experience.
Negative :
Probably my biggest moan was that the Oceanview cafe had such poor choice of food outside peak hours. Especially in the afternoon and after 9.30pm. Virtually all the food stations were closed off. We went down for a meal at 9.40pm which I do not consider late and there was virtually nothing open. For late night snacks it was chef's choice, always without fail it was meatballs -- he must really like them ! I think there was some pizza on as well. Not good. This was one area where Celebrity performed very poorly and where Princess are far superior.
Too many pay restaurants and not a great variety.
Bistro on 5 -- what a waste of space ! Hardly ever saw anybody in there, how can you devote a whole restaurant to just one dish.
Having one comedian on in the whole 2 weeks with the same show. Celebrity publicise this by stating if you miss his show it is repeated throughout the cruise. Come on lets have a bit more choice ! He was good though.
The glass blowing show. Just cannot see it having appeal. Lasts 2 hours -- too long. Once you've seen it that's it, its part of the ship you will not go back to. The time and space could be better utilised.
Molecular bar -- barman far too serious about his job. Overpriced cocktails that are not that good.
Overall it was a great cruise and very enjoyable. The negative side of things certainly did not put me off wanting to cruise again with either Celebrity or the Eclipse. The weather, ship and destinations all combined to create a great holiday. I put a deposit down in the future cruise department whilst on board so it is now on to deciding where next ! Less

Cabin review: C31192
1192 - good location for us. Very quiet, near the back of the ship. A bit of a walk to the lifts but not a problem. Liked having the tv and seating area near to the door rather than the balcony. Some rooms are the other way round. The space is the same as the others, struggled slightly for hanging space as we were there for 2 weeks but we managed.

Sponsored LinksIn a bid to automate “premium” display media-buying, MediaMath on Monday announced partnerships with a host of inventory suppliers, including Yahoo and Microsoft. Other partners include iSocket, Shiny Ads and Yieldex.
"Programmatic direct” is also sometimes referred to as “guaranteed premium.” In this type of transaction, advertisers and publishers still work directly with one another, though many manual processes are automated.
MediaMath now boasts that TerminalOne, its demand-side platform (DSP), gives marketers access to both “guaranteed premium” and non-guaranteed inventory. In other words, advertisers will now be able to mange both real-time bidding (RTB) and direct campaigns through MediaMath’s platform. Additionally, marketers will be able to programmatically buy fixed-price inventory from certain publishers as a result of these partnerships.
Greg Williams, co-founder and SVP of OPEN partnerships at MediaMath, hopes the addition of “premium” inventory available via programmatic buying will bring in “a new sector of digital marketing professionals who expect direct access to premium inventory.”
MediaMath clients will have immediate access to sites such as Yahoo, MSN, Conde Nast, Forbes and USA Today through the Yahoo, Microsoft and iSocket partnerships. Inventory from Yieldex and ShinyAds is not yet available but will be soon, per the release.
Additionally, the new inventory that will be available to MediaMath clients is all U.S.-based inventory, though the company says access to global inventory will be available soon.
Merkle -- a Columbia, Md.-based CRM agency -- is named as an early user of MediaMath’s new programmatic direct offering.
Keep me updatedI too have been playing with Windows 8, and am enjoying it right up to a certain point. I need to have several applications open at the same time on my desktop, resizing them as needed on occasion, and the hassle of having to switch to the Desktop and back again is just a HUGE pain with Windows 8. That may change as applications are re-written for Metro, but window management does not exist in Metro, things are either full-screen or not there at all except in a minimal form, so this is a no-go for me at the current time..
I the differences between desktop and metro make me want to go back to something sane. I used it a day and I still hate it. I don't think there will be any productivity metro apps that I will like.
Under the hood it doesn't feel like much has changed on my hardware.
Bottom line: I will sit this one out like I did with Vista. Windows is only a glorified games starter for me anyways.
And I certainly will not tell normal users to switch, 7 is a much better choice for users IMO (for desktops and laptops that is)
I am going to make the switch. I like change and I expect the window management to get better for Keyboard and Mouse use.
And I like the deep integration of the social and communication. It makes the OS feel more whole than lots of separate things.
MS will want to work with companies like Steam and others to get their popular software set up for Metro use and integration with the Games section and if they release at the end of this year, I think they will have a nice tight system.
Expecting Steam to be integrated into Metros games section is like expecting Apple to release Android apps IMO.
Metro feels so separate from the desktop. You can't even drag and drop stuff from one to the other.
In desktop mode the active corner always get in my way when closing applications or starting the one in the bottom left corner.
Why should I live with all these annoyances that I don't like? As I said I will sit this one out. Just as with Vista MS introduces a lot of stuff, but without polish. Windows 9 might be better and so long Windows 7 is just fine.
And contrary to what peoples gut feeling tells them Windows 7 is exactly the same speed as Windows 8. No difference whatsoever, a speed increase only exists is imagination land.
I can't speak for Windows 7 vs Windows 8 speed or snappiness, but going from Vista to Windows 8 on my laptop was a huge improvement! The only time I noticed any interface lag at all was when I lost my WiFi connection while trying to update People.
Firefox 10 under Vista used to take about 15 seconds for a cold start or about 5 seconds for a warm start. Under Windows 8 a cold start is less than 3 seconds and a warm start is less than a second. This is on a Core2Duo T6400 machine with 4GB of DDR2 RAM. In other words, not exactly the fastest machine on the block even when it came out three years ago.
I'm certainly enjoying Windows 8 on my laptop, with only a few glitches most likely related to being brand new, unreleased software. Perhaps it's because I'm already so used to Metro on my phone and Xbox, but I'm calling this one a winner if Microsoft can work out the bugs and drop in a couple of basic, common sense features. That said, I do think if I decide to buy the OS it will be one of the Professional editions, or perhaps Ultimate. I'd love to be able to work in "classic" mode for most things and switch to Metro for entertainment, as opposed to the current feeling that the OS wants to stay in Metro whenever possible.
Or maybe like like Google having apps on iOS, or MS on OSX...
PS.
Well I don't think many expect higher actual performance, benchmark numbers, and such (though some certainly do expect it...) - but it's entirely conceivable that the system is now tweaked, "acts" and feels smoother to the user (like so many claim in BeOS threads, here)

From Desktop IE, have you tried clicking the magnifying glass in the address bar, then clicking Add.., or Tools | Manage add-ons | Search Providers | Find more search providers?
For spellcheck, try the language control panel.
The Advanced settings panel lists some overrides that may help.
They are deliberately making it hard to change search engine.
I guess they didn't learn anything from their bad experience in Europe over browser choice.
My guess is that Google's lawyers (and other search engines) will be looking at this very closely.
I only use IE if I really have to. It just gets in my face (like Windows 7 with its nag (you need to authorize this copy/move/delete screens. Fuck you MS, I'm an admin. Just let me get on with work won't ya?)
From all the reports I've seen they seem to be going all out to make Win 8 as unusable as possible for the majority of users. Metro could just be the killer app that brings MS to its knees.
Long live Metro! (sic)
Indeed, Gnome 3 asks for my login password before letting me put in a new WiFi password. That has tripped me up more than once, and is certainly more annoying than Windows 7 occasionally needing an extra button click.
I haven't even bothered with turning off or lowering UAC on my desktop machine, as it's not often enough to be a bother to me (unlike how it was in Vista).
That was the first thing I thought of, as I've run into that issue with Ubuntu more than once. But the issue persists even after completely resetting my keychain. I don't have the issue with Xfce or KDE, but I don't use those DEs anymore now that I've gotten good with Gnome 3.
Thank you for the suggestion anyway!
Thanks for reviewing, it seems to be the default to just bash away on the alt-OS scene. My experiences are pretty much the same, some problems, some interesting stuff. This preview is far ahead of the last, most of my issues now are with some obvious beta bugs with the new metro apps.
Having my desktop up and docking say, the messenger app to the right I thought was pretty cool- I'm not sure it's the death of the windows desktop, that felt enhanced.
I think change will freak some people out and likely loose some users, but I don't think nearly as many if they keep doing the same thing they've done for the last two decades
I tried to install it in VMWare but the installer kept crashing for some unknown reason and seemed to be stuck in an endless loop of crash->reboot. I didn't investigate why as I ran out of time.
It seems that many who doubted it have been pleasantly surprised by its potential and tend to agree that it could turn out bad, or may very well turn out good.
Tried loading both the 32-bit and 64-bit ISOs in Microsoft VirtualPC on Windows 7 ... and it just crashes. And the crash screen is even less helpful now that it used to be.
You'd think Microsoft would test a Microsoft product running inside of another Microsoft product running on top of a Microsoft product.
Virtual PC only supports 32-bit guests, but besides that, I think it's been obviated by Hyper-V (which doesn't help if your CPU doesn't have the necessary extensions to run it [plus Windows 8 is the first client release to include it]).
VirtualBox should work.
Or you can try running it natively from a VHD....
I was not expecting this, however personally I found the 25-75 split very useful.
It's possible to dock an application (like email, or calendar) to the side, and work regularly with your desktop. If you have (like most laptops), lots of wide space wasted (thanks to today's 16:9 screens), it's a nice addition.
However I wish they had gone further with this "tiling" window manager approach. While pressing "Start-." "Start-D" to dock the current app to left, and have the desktop ready on the rest of the screen, I wish we had more control, like docking multiple things, or docking to the bottom._3<<.
I'd like to see Microsoft bring the option of the Vista/7 start menu back. I remember that someone had recreated it for XP, and called it ViStart. The installer will drop two pieces of crapware onto the system and a toolbar in IE, which can all be removed.
I will not be Delphi'd into liking the Metro interface. It's appropriate for tablets and phones..
As I spend more and more time using it, the start screen bothers me less and less. I do know that I felt the same way about the classic start menu vs. the newer, expanded start menu that was introduced in XP, improved in Vista, and mandated in 7.
I was initially upset that I couldn't switch to the classic start with 7, but now that I'm used to it, I couldn't go back. I suspect I'll eventually feel this way about the start screen. I mean, there is no reason why the app launcher should be confined to just a small segment of the screen, especially when the start screen can both display more applications AND display more tiles. I do miss the presence of the start button, but mainly for aesthetic reasons. 90% of the time I launch a program, it's either by clicking the pinned icon on the taskbar, or hitting the windows key and typing to find the app I want. This behavior isn't affected one bit by removal of the start button. The other 10% of the time, I launch apps the old way. I think I do this just because nearly 15 years of habit won't die completely.
Thanks for your comments on how 8 treats multi-touch trackpads. My mouses goes wherever my laptop does, but I don't always use it. I was wondering if Win8 treats the trackpad as a proxy for touchscreen, like OSX seems to do, but I'm disappointed that it doesn't. Maybe this behavior will change by release time?
EDIT: I've only recently used the CP in VMWare, which is currently producing incorrect behavior when I use the mutli-touch features of my trackpad. I haven't yet investigated how to improve integration.
Right now, I'm debating on whether or not to install it as my primary OS. Maybe in a couple weeks I'll give it a shot, since I want to try out the Hyper-V stuff.

I can imagine Metro working on a tablet, phone or any touch based device. On a non-touchable device it just doesn't work for me.
It seems like there are two GUIs, Metro and the traditional Windows desktop. It doesn't feel like it's one system, rather two worlds.
I'm a Mac person, but recently I started playing with Windows 7 and so far it hasn't started depressing or annoying me like Windows 3.0 to Vista did (well, the Live Messenger does annoy me). It's fast, faster than XP on the same hardware (at least in my personal observation based on a few machines). To me it seemed Microsoft finally found the Right Path.
So I expected Windows 8 to be a next step on that path, but so far it seems it's Windows 7 (great!) + Metro (no!) added to it. At least make it an option you can turn off and use the classic desktop as default.
Let's hope Apple takes notice and learns it doesn't make sense to make your desktop OS (OS X) look/feel/work like your mobile OS devices (iOS).
How on earth can a GUI that restricts the user to two tiled windows be more functional than a standard desktop?
It's inherently dumbed down and restrictive. Acceptable for a tablet/netbook, but ridiculously crippled for a desktop.
No amount of tweaking it will fix the obvious limitations. Microsoft will need to keep the standard desktop available for those of us who actually want to work efficiently on our computers. Which means keeping the inconsistency that goes with two radically different GUIs being stitched together in one OS.
Go back and read your own post. You said: "100% usable and more functional than the standard desktop".
I'd question whether most people work in full screen mode all the time, with every application or utility they use. Even my parents, and other people I wouldn't consider "power users", sometimes want to view different documents and images side by side. With Metro's crippled 25:75 tiling they couldn't even do that.
People who want to work full screen can already do so with one click on the maximise button. With Windows 7 they can simply drag the titlebar to the top of the screen too, and tile windows by dragging them to the sides.
How does Metro's restrictive full screen mode make it more functional for anyone?
."
These two points are related. If the cpu is not being throttled down then it is no surprise that the system is more responsive.
By contrast my mbp is relatively cool and silent. There are hiccups sometimes but I much prefer it to using windows (where it gets hotter and the vacuum cleaners start spinning up).
the new part of windows 8 is metro and you just said metro sucks. it has no features and all the apps suck. so you lost me when you went from that to windows 8 being okay. windows 8 is balls because metro is balls.
they tried to make one interface that worked well on every device and they failed. we'll all upgrade to windows 8.... when the hacks that turn off metro come out.
The speed is really great and it seems to lees memory/resource intensive than 7. What I dream is Windows 7.5 - with the speed of 8 and UI from 7
Hopefully some happy hackers community will make it happen. Probably sooner or later someone will find those 2 or 3 magical registry entries that turn off Metro and bring back classic start menu. Then I'll switch!
As much as I dislike Gnome Shell and Unity, at least they moved away from the classic desktop while staying consistent.
One of my gripes with the Windows desktop has always been not being able to write on or scroll a non raised window, so you can guess I don't use to work with maximized windows (actually I think the only app I ever maximize is the browser).
I can't say I'm getting too excited by the idea of fullscreen or split as only choices (and then the fact that I find Metro widgets ugly as hell doesn't help, either).
I guess I'll eventually have to deal with Windows8 because of my job, but going by what I've seen and tried so far it'll never be my personal OS of choice.
As for scrolling non-raised windows (or other views within the sam window), you should try KatMouse, . Although the default settings are weird, they are easily fixed, and it does what you want in most cases. It makes Windows so much better.
The problem with that kind of hacks is that they are... well, hacks, much like those Windows implementations of virtual desktops.
I'll rather stay with the native implementation on Linux than going with the quirks and incomplete functionality of third party add ons.
No, I stick with a behaviour I like, that's one of the reasons I use Linux and not Windows.
The only times I work with Windows is when I connect remotely to a customer Windows server (and it's not like you could go installing those programs on there).
I'll rather stay with the native implementation on Linux than going with the quirks and incomplete functionality of third party add ons.
Because various UI parts of Linux always work so smoothly and are so nicely integrated... (oh, and all the recent major UI Linux changes bring virtually only applause, right?)
Quite a few of those Windows enhancement tools work very well. Of course, many (probably most) don't, but that doesn't diminish the former.
The one thing I wonder about.
What if MS don't get it quite right.
Will we see refinement updates after Win 8 release or will we have to wait for Win 9.
In recent years MS was shy of adding OS feature additions after launch. Mostly bugfixes and drivers.
Windows 8 might be a different story.
"There are lot's of professionals here, myself not included."

no judgement yet, simply because I've not tried the beta yet.
Some random notes:
- dev preview pissed me of for the split-mode of metro versus desktop
- I have 30" screen (yap, applause...) and cannot envision using *any* app maximised, I wanted/use this screen so I can see multiple apps in one go
- will gladly try out the beta one of these days but reserve judgement till then
as to...
- gnome 3: tried it... NOOOOOOOOO
- kde 4.x: me like and use for work every day
- MacOS: waiting for new batch, then order new airbook

Reading through the changes in WDDM 1.2 and DXGI 1.2 they have moved more of the interface over to the GPU where as in Windows 7 it was predominantly GDI powered. Couple that with the pre-emption enabled in WDDM 1.2 drivers plus other enhancements I'd say that Microsoft is now in a position that they can really push the use of GPU where ever possible but the downside is that vendors who have squeezed their hardware into confined spaces based on how Windows 7 utilised the hardware (taking into account the limits noted by the OEM supplier) I'm not surprised that the fan is spinning up frequently.
The other side of the equation could simply be that it requires a better, more optimised driver but given that it is still a consumer preview I'd hold off judgements till the final product is released.
As a user running four displays -- two 1920x1200 and two 1024x1280 portrait, I have NEVER seen such a colossal step BACKWARDS in functionality. It is PAINFULLY obvious they concentrated so much on the small screen market, that they not only neglected to consider people who actually have decent desktops, they basically turned around and gave us the finger. Hell, for a moment I felt like I was on Ubuntu "netbook remix" -- and no, that's NOT a compliment..
Edited 2012-03-03 04:33 UTC
I am loving it on my laptop. It completely makes sense there. I do not have the intestinal fortitude to put it on my main desktop though... I have too much data to worry about at this time to put a pre-release OS on there. I will install it when it goes gold though.
I think MS has focused on the single screen because 95%+ of users have a single screen. If they allowed multiple start screen instances to be run, that would provide you the use of multiple screens. The experience is still going to be different than what you use today though.
I'm going to keep it on my laptop throughout the preview period, as I don't really store anything there and I'm very happy with the OS so far. Dropbox+Gdocs+Evernote means I don't have to worry about local storage anyway.
On my desktop, I'm going to throw in a spare 300GB drive and install Windows 8 on it. That way I don't blow away my finely tuned Windows 7/Arch Linux setup on the original drive, and I can switch between the two disks with a reboot.
I feel you. I have three monitor setup and haven't even tried Windows 8.
I guess I'll be sticking to Windows 7 and Visual Studio 2010 for a long time. I mean I'm still writing software for .NET 2.0 and occasionally for 3.5, don't see this changing any time soon to writing in 4.5.
With Microsoft pushing faster releases, I hope that Windows 9 comes "soon" and with it's Metro polished somehow for multi-display setups (which isn't hard to believe when MS can throw millions into designing stuff).
And Metro made xBox UI crappier. Like in the good ol' days, I just needed to see "new releases" tile in "game demos" as it showed three latest demos in it, Metro tile just has "new releases" written on it. And there's one big space with multiple tile showing selected few demos, one per tile, I need to move thru that tile with right stick. fubar ><
.
How would this workflow be any different under Windows 8? Desktop window management is largely similar to Windows 7 - one enhancement, the taskbar may now extend to displays other than the primary, and each taskbar may contain only the apps running on that display.
My ZenBook runs considerably hotter in Windows 8 than it does in Windows 7, and the fan spins more often and faster as a result. No idea why
My bet : more GPU acceleration in the Windows 8 UI than in Aero.
Laptop GPUs do an excellent job as pocket toasters when they are heavily used.

I guess Redmond is glad that people like you omit to point out that Win8 is another attempt to try the 'one size fits all' strategy that users liked so much that they fled from WinMo like from a dog with fleas. Now Redmond tries the same strategy again but the other way round: from the phone to the desktop.
Windows 7 already ran circles around Mac OS X [..] when it came to responsiveness, but Windows 8 is just insane. Very, very impressive.
Another Holwerdaizism. Simply not true but glad you still stick to be a Microsoft shill.
Microsoft has clearly decided on relegating the PC market to 2nd class citizen status and focusing on trying to stay relevant in the new "mobile device" market at all costs.
I think, though, that they've forgotten about one big aspect of the PC market that helps keep them afloat: the enterprise. Practically anywhere you go in business, you'll see Windows PCs running thousands of purpose-built apps that don't fit anywhere in the new Metro-ized world of Microsoft. By making the desktop just a "legacy" app in W8, they've basically given all of these customers (who pay really good money!) the finger.
Could Win8 and Metro be the 'killer app'?
The 'app' that kills Microsoft?
If they do indeed as you say give one or even two fingers to the business world then they can say goodbye to any serious migrations from XP/Vista/Win7 to Win8 on the myriad of desktop PC's that millions of people all over the world use to 'just get stuff done'?
The jury is out but I for one will never use Metro on a PC.
As others have said - more stress on GPU, less on CPU. GPUs weren't designed to be used for gaming, only for HD decoding video or something, so engineers put too less emphasis on GPU cooling.
And now that Windows 8 puts more use with GPU - while saving power, you get more noise.
No?
Sounds weird to me too. But if Thom has tried to use his laptop for serious work, it may be that the laptop heats up more during Metro use, whereas Aero has become more power-efficient on its side (which wouldn't hurt !).
Unless someone does a serious, well-documented battery life test on a machine dual-booting the two OSs, we'll never know. It may simply be that Thom has not run a full battery discharge cycle yet and that Windows 8's battery indicator is more optimistic. Or that he has used Windows 8 only for toying around, and not yet for his everyday tasks.
Why can't Microsoft give users some choice in User Interface?
I know that Microsoft ain't Linux, and never will be, but still..... is it so hard to give the actual USER a say in what desktop environment, file manager, window manager etc. he wants?
Even without diving into Linux-like freedom (which would be un-Microsofty), they could the user a few options to choose from, right?
microsoft has always been about freedom to mess around with your shit, because microsoft has always been a company full of nerds. they just werent about open source.
even now, one of the new sinofsky mantras for windows 8 is "no compromise"
...people will decide for themselves if being forced to use metro or kill themselves is "no compromise". either that or some computers this christmas will still have windows 7 on them because the revolt was so strong.
Seems like your view of responsiveness isn't very subjective. Windows 7 is in no way more responsive than OS X and we're talking about clean installs/bloat-free versions of Windows. I've had this conversation with others at University who use their Macbook Air at home and Windows 7 in the Labs and they all seem to agree..
delusional...
Well after using Windows 8 for several days I can say without reservation that my productivity tanked what good is two program windows open when I need at least six on two monitors for a total of 12?
I was wondering what could be worse than Gnome3, thank you Microsoft for the privilege, I will focus more on Linux now and use Windows 7 as long as I need it. the 180k+ machines at my company will not be going to 8 as I make that decision.
Microsoft shills, don't bother with a lame response, I know how I work and how the engineering staff works, so I am best qualified to determine what works for us.
Edited 2012-03-05 08:34 UTC
While I enjoy Thom's positive, open and enthusiastic perspective (and value his writing in general highly), I don't share in his optimism about Windows 8.
While some argue that Metro may (eventually) offer a good tablet interface, even more point out that for getting real work done on a desktop PC that's just not a workable proposition and I'm afraid I have to agree... Metro is more input labor intensive for even the simplest tasks, and for common everyday things -- even using the most efficient approaches Metro offers will still have you doing anywhere from double, to twelve fold the amount of mouse clicking, scrolling, drilling, and interface manipulation; this is not in any way shape or form an 'improvement'.
What bothers me even more then the obtuse UI, is that Microsoft has taken 'reinventing the wheel' a layer deeper to re-rigging interfaces to basic Windows internals we use and need to deploy, configure, and work with the OS on a deeper level -- this sort of practice where no real operational change of system internals is being reflected, would be equivalent to car manufacturers deciding they're going to switch positions of the gas, break, and clutch -- a gravely onerous mistake.
On a more hopeful note (though I wouldn't say positive as prospects look bleak), if Metro on desktop systems was to incorporate some of the features of a TWM, it could be both powerful and actually the opposite of what we have now as TWMs are dramatically less User input intensive to work with then the CWM model Windows has rolled with for 24 years. Also Microsoft has said that the removal of the Start Menu from the "8' OS is not final -- so there may be a ray of hope...
But left 'as is', or in any form that resembles Metro being some sort of idiot metaphor and replacement for for the Start Menu on workstations of any stripe is a proposition I find both untenable and unacceptable; and I seem far from alone... Windows 8 would have to offer some as yet unrevealed 'killer capability' to evince even an attitude of tolerance from me for the new interface; an interface design that gives every appearance of being the 'combating committee' design nightmare, pundits like John Dvorak that have some insight to Microsoft's 'corporate culture' have described...

I downloaded the .ISO right off the bat, because I was NOT about to mess up my Gateway laptop with a non-permanent install of Windows 8. I used a 64-bit Athlon64 X2 5000+ computer out in my workshop.
First issue: Where's the Activation code?
After finding THAT, online, the install went normally.
The whole "coversheet" image thing is kinda weird. Gotta toss that up out of your way to get to the password screen. Then you type in your password, to get to Metro. Lotsa boxes with lotsa useless things... a few look familiar, others useless. Can I get rid of the Xbox and "cloud apps whatever" boxes and just keep the ones I know I'll use?
Going to "Desktop" was heading into familiar territory, except... how do you get to all the stuff that USED to be under the Start menu? Like Computer and Control Panel, etc.?
Ah... it's in that folder icon, next to IE! Weird place to put it, but... oh, well. But it's not there either! Oh, gotta go to Desktop (right hand column). THERE it is!
I also had a hard time finding the Windows Experience Index program, because... IT'S NOT CALLED THAT ANYMORE! But, seems like, when I can actually FIND stuff, it actually feels pretty much like Windows 7... except with layers and layers of convoluted paths to actually GET to it!
It's quite an adventure, to using Windows 8, but it also makes my brain hurt, because it's like everything is a giant puzzle you have to wrap your brain around, to try and figure out! Nothing is intuitive... it's buried under layers of this and that, and go here to find this, and go there to do that... and crawl under this bridge and jump over that fence and around and about and over and under and... *sigh*.
Are they TRYING to make us hate Windows or something? I'm a very patient and persistent and open-minded individual... but it really pushes me to the limit, when I have to search so hard for everything and "figure out" the whole OS, just to run a few apps!
It's an adventure, for sure... I just hope I have enough mental energy to keep going... I'm exhausted just thinking about what I went through yesterday! :-D
Please don't let little things like facts get in your way...
What most people think of per iPhone/iOS really wasn't until iOS 2.x - which wasn't released until July 2008. Even then, with respect to what you are referring to most of what people associate (now) with iOS is really the latest iOS 4/5, which was not until 2010/2011. ()
However, KDE was well on their way to KDE4 and had been discussing it for a long time by that point, having released the first (albeit developer oriented only) version in January 2008. (). KDE4 was nothing like the Windows or Mac frameworks - it was nothing like KDE3 at that point either.
Yes, iPhoneOS/iOS and Android brought a very heavy disruption to the mobile OS market. But it was KDE4 that did it to the Desktop OS market.
Windows Vista (released in 2007 -) changed little from Windows XP in that respect, though Windows 7 adopted some of the functionality from KDE4 on its release in 2009.
That is to say, in what you stated, the hides the facts by looking at the world through the lense of Windows and the progress of Windows XP, Vista, and 7 and iOS in comparison. It ignores what went on in the rest of the computing realm where a lot of innovation was happening - innovation that is now causing big problems for Microsoft.
The Peconic Land Trust (PLT) has officially turned thumbs down on an opportunity to take over 28.5 acres of Paard Hill horse farm to preserve as open space.
Now the Town Board of Shelter Island has to decide if the town wants to accept the property, a highly unlikely result, since by contract the public would be denied access to it, but the town would still be responsible for insurance payments and maintenance costs.
After a meeting of the PLT’s board earlier this week, John Halsey, president of the board, signed an agreement refusing to accept the so-called “open area.”
A deal is imminent for Paard Hill, which in addition to the open area, includes 7.65-acres with a single-family house.
Christopher Kent of the Bridgehampton office of the law firm Farrell Fritz, representing the sellers, Pieter Ruig and Ellen Lear, has said the sale price would be lower than the original asking price of $7.95 million.
A declaration imposes a covenant on the property requiring the open area to be donated to either the Town of Shelter Island or the PLT after the deaths of both Mr. Ruig and Ms. Lear, or if they subdivide and sell the property’s residential component.
The present deal calls for no further subdivision of the property.
Any future use of the equine facility as a commercial operation is prohibited.
The new buyer can use the open area for private “equestrian of pedestrian purposes.”LinBox is a C++ template library for exact,

Lacey is a regular match official in the Magners League and European competitions and had assistant referee appointments in Rome and Edinburgh during this year's RBS 6 Nations.
The 37-year-old was a late call-up for the injured Greg Garner at the 2010 IRB Junior World Championship in Argentina and his impressive command saw him appointed to referee the semi-final between New Zealand and South Africa.
The premier international age grade tournament is a proven environment to test the skills of the very best in developing refereeing talent with New Zealand's Chris Pollock, France's Jérôme Garces and Carlo Damasco of Italy graduating from the 2009 tournament to be appointed assistant referees at this year's Rugby World Cup.
The class of 2011 includes features 12 officials who have impressed at other IRB tournaments and domestic or cross border club competitions.
The the full referees ranel is: JP Doyle (England), Greg Garner (England), Leighton Hodges (Wales), John Lacey (Ireland), Francisco Pastrana (Argentina), Neil Paterson (Scotland), Jaco Peyper (South Africa), Mathieu Raynal (France) and Jonathon White (New Zealand). The Assistant Referees are Carlo Damasco (Italy), Marius Mitrea (Italy) and João Mourinha (Portugal).
The panel provides a blend of experience and newcomers with four officials - Doyle, Lacey, Pastrana and Peyper - returning to officiate at their second successive IRB Junior World Championship.
IRB Referee Manager Paddy O'Brien said: "It has been particularly pleasing in recent years to see the likes of Keith Brown, Andrew Small, Chris Pollock and Jérôme Garces graduate from the IRB Junior World Championship to win selection for the IRB High Performance match official panel.
"Officiating in international tournaments provides exposure to a best practice environment that furthers the development of our most talented young referees and provides us with an opportunity to identify and nurture the next group of Test officials."

White Bronze Markers
by Barbara Rotundo
Hollow-metal markers in a bluish-gray color, white bronze gravestones are cast zinc. If you are not sure whether you have iron or zinc, try a magnet, because zinc is not magnetic like iron. All zinc cemetery monuments came one way or another from Bridgeport, Connecticut. These markers, made in the same shapes and styles as marble and granite monuments, appear in cemeteries from Hawaii to Maine to Texas and from Vancouver to Halifax in Canada. Each of the four sides was separately cast, and in the case of very tall monuments there would be several castings to each side. The cheapest (about $6 in the 1890s) was a single cast tablet.
Bridgeport started manufacturing them in the mid 1870s and discontinued production in 1912. The company continued to make zinc and other nonferrous castings for automobile and radio parts until the owner dissolved it in 1939. In 1881 Bridgeport set up its first subsidiary, in Detroit. After that it established plants in Philadelphia, New Orleans, St. Thomas, Ontario, and the two longest-lasting plants, Western Bronze in Des Moines and American Bronze in Chicago.
The accounts are not clear as to whether the parts were all cast in Bridgeport and shipped to the subsidiaries for fusing or whether the actual casting was done in the various cities. The patented process, that has held up very well, was the scheme of heating molten zinc much higher than its melting point and pouring it into the joint between the cast pieces. This melted the surface of the cast pieces and fused them more solidly than soldering would have done.
The markers were all custom-made. That is, none were made ahead of time but were ordered by the customer from a catalog. (The Winterthur end Metropolitan Museums are two placed holding these catalogs.*) The customer ordered from a local agent. Rarely did marble and granite monument dealers also sell white bronze, and contrary to folk belief, Sears Roebuck never sold white bronze monuments. Often cemeteries have only one marker or one plot with zinc for every family member. Another folk belief is that these were put up as demonstrations. There is no evidence for this. At the end of every catalog was an entreaty urging people to become agents. "No capital investment needed." I believe the single markers represent an agent who met with little success and soon gave up. Where you find a dozen or more white bronze, you are looking at some agent's success story.
Having chosen the style and size, a customer could order as many images for decoration as he wanted. Since price was not related to the number, some customers chose several for each side. The individual epitaphs were usually cast on separate plates-some of the four plates having only images at first. These were fixed to the marker by screws with an ornamental head. They could then be replaced when additional family members died.
Vandals also learned how to remove the screws and sometimes walked off leaving holes in the sides of the markers. These gave rise to two folk tales. The first is that smugglers used the markers to hide their bottles during prohibition. The second says the tall monuments with holes were for storing rakes and brooms. There may have been such uses after the plates vanished, but the insides are not really that roomy or convenient.
Zinc resists corrosion, and modern industrial processes still take advantage of its anti-corrosive properties. Thus the castings are still sharp and clear. However, zinc has two unfortunate characteristics. It is quite brittle and may break if hit--by a falling branch, for instance. The other is that over many years unsupported weight will cause it to creep. Many statues of Civil War soldiers with no inner armature to support the weight have crept so that the soldiers now lean and look tipsy or half asleep. Architectural Iron in Milford, Pennsylvania, is willing to undertake repairs of zinc and does a fine restoration job, but the cost will take your breath away. Keep your fingers crossed and enjoy what you have!

GRAVESTONE RUBBINGS
-
Do's and Don'ts from the Association for Gravestone Studies
From "Gravestone Rubbing for Beginners," a leaflet available from the Association for Gravestone Studies (Top of page).
Gravestone rubbing is fun. It is possible to collect some beautiful artwork that can be framed and displayed. A carver's skill can be preserved, or an ancestor's stone recorded and appreciated through this craft. However, gravestone rubbing is also controversial. Especially in cemeteries where a restoration project is in progress, rubbing is often banned. This is to enable the restorers to have an opportunity to preserve all the stones possible before more damage occurs. Even if a restoration project is not in progress, if the those who care for the cemetery have determined there are very fragile stones there which may be damaged if pressure is applied to the surface as happens in rubbing, there may be prohibitions in place. So be sure to check.
Below are some Do's and Don'ts that will make your experience in the cemetery a good one..
Make certain that your paper covers the entire face of the stone; secure with masking tape.
Use the correct combination of paper and waxes or inks; avoid magic marker-type pens or other permanent color materials.
Test paper and color before working on stone to be certain that no color bleeds through.
Rub gently, carefully.
Leave the stone in better condition than you found it.
Take all trash with you; replace any grave site materials that you may have disturbed.
Please Don't
-
Don't attempt to rub deteriorating marble or sandstone, or any unsound or weakened stone (for example, a stone that sounds hollow when gently tapped or a stone that is flaking, splitting, blistered, cracked, or unstable on its base).
Don't use detergents, soaps, vinegar, bleach, or any other cleaning solutions on the stone, no matter how mild!
Don't use shaving cream, chalk, graphite, dirt, or other concoctions in an attempt to read worn inscriptions.
Don't use stiff-bristled or wire brushes, putty knives, nail files, or any metal object to clean or to remove lichen from the stone; Soft natural bristled brushes, whisk brooms, or wooden sticks are usually OK if used gently and carefully
Don't attempt to remove stubborn lichen. Soft lichen may be thoroughly soaked with plain water and then loosened with a gum eraser or a wooden popsicle stick. Be gentle. Stop if lichen does not come off easily.
Don't use spray adhesives, scotch tape, or duct tape. Use masking tape.
Don't use any rubbing method that you have not actually practiced under supervision.
Don't leave masking tape, wastepaper, colors, etc., at the grave site.
Review and Evaluation:
Selected Brand Name Materials for Cleaning Gravestones, by Tracy C. Walther
I. INTRODUCTION
-
Some important general guidelines to remember when considering cleaning burial monuments:
A..
B. Determine the type of soiling to remove it in the most effective manner. Types of soiling could be:
Carbonaceous or sooty soiling
Urban grime; dirt
Organic--algae, fungi, lichens, mosses
Stains--metallic, oils, etc.
Efflorescence (salts)
C..
D. Always test selected cleaning method(s) before general application. Test entire cleaning procedure in a small inconspicuous area on the monument.
E. Pre-wet monument with water before the application of any chemical cleaning solutions. Pre-wetting prevents excessive penetration of cleaning solutions and soiling into the stone, and facilitates softening of soiling.
F. Clean from the bottom to the top of the monument to avoid streak staining on the stone. Periodically rinse runoff.
G. Always rinse thoroughly with water. Residues from chemical cleaning solutions can create a blotchy appearance, provide mediums for bacterial action, and cause staining. Do not allow cleaning solutions to dry on a monument.
H. Do not assume that a cleaning procedure that is effective in one specific case is therefore applicable for all cleaning situations. professional.
I. Consult with a conservation
II. Review and Evaluation of Selected Brand Name Materials for Cleaning Gravestones
A. Soaps and detergents
-
1. Soaps (e.g., "Ivory"): commercial household detergents (liquids and powders) are not recommended for cleaning masonry. They are rendered insoluble by calcium ions present in stone and hard water. They may also produce free alkali and fatty acid salts.
2..
B. Acidic Cleaning Materials
1..
C. Alkaline, Corrosive, and Biocidal Cleaning Materials
1. Sodium Hydroxide (e.g., "Borax"), Sodium Hypochlorite (e.g., "Clorox" "liquid chlorine") is not recommended for general cleaning of stone.
2..
3. Ammonium Hydroxide (e.g., household ammonia): Solutions of household ammonia are recommended for cleaning light colored stones. Ammonia is particularly effective for the removal of biological growth. One cup ammonia to one gallon water.
4..
5. Trisodium Phosphate (e.g., "TSP, "Calgon"): Trisodium phosphate is not recommended for cleaning monuments. It can cause the formation and deposition of soluble salts. "Calgon" contains trisodium phosphate and a number of additives that may be detrimental to monuments.
6. 
-
A. The following items are recommended for use in cleaning procedures for masonry: soft natural bristle (e.g., tampico) brushes, nylon brushes, tooth brushes, Q-tips, sponges (especially natural sponges). Wood and some plastic spatulas are also recommended.
B. Do not use metal brushes or scrapers, or abrasive pads (e.g., "Brillo," "Scotchbrite") to clean monuments.
IV. SOME FINAL REMINDERS ABOUT BRAND NAME CLEANING MATERIALS
A. Do not rely solely upon product labels or advertising. Brand name materials that are readily available from hardware and grocery stores are generally intended for household use. Information is not provided for specialized applications outside of the home or workshop.
B. Remember to consult with a conservation consultant before cleaning. The use of improper cleaning materials and practices can cause serious and irreparable damage to gravestones.

How does NZ life compare to abroad?Share your stories, photos and videos.

I'm a Kiwi living in Perth, working in the engineering/construction, oil and gas industry.
This is the industry that has boomed the last five years. I recently saw a Campbell Live segment on working in Western Australia (WA), and it disappointed me.
They painted a picture that WA was still booming and to just get on a plane. This does not fit with what is currently happening.
I work for a large oil and gas company on the commercial side, so I think I have a credential insight.
What wasn't shown was the mass lay offs happening in construction. Barrow, Wheatstone and Darwin are your only main projects employing and, due to all the lay offs, there is one job for five applicants and many of these are guys with huge amounts of experience.
After these projects are completed in the next two to four years, big companies will invest in floating liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is manufactured overseas and investing in other countries opening up to the market. A lot of these companies winning work in Australia are foreign-owned and the government has relaxed the laws so lots of jobs are going to south east asian workforces.
From an operational perspective these jobs are becoming scarce as these construction guys being laid off are moving across.
I'm not saying don't come over here, there are still opportunities, but usually for experienced specialised tradesman.
Gone are the days people walked out of a plane and into a job. Unskilled and semi-skilled unfortunately don't stand a chance unless an uncle is a construction manager.
I'm sorry for painting a rather bleak picture, it just breaks my heart seeing people with such high expectations come over and then end up in strife.
New Zealand migrants can't get social welfare or services. I would hate to see anyone go through that without a clear plan, something to fall back on and some real opportunities.
If you just want a change of scenery there are many opportunities outside these industries to have a crack at. Australia is wonderfully multicultural and offers a different lifestyle. Perth even has its own marae, New Zealand cultural groups and clubs and a ton of Kiwi shops.
Something to think about is private health insurance. Although many woman still use a public hospital to give birth, there is a large private medical industry here, unless it's life threatening or critical you can fork out quite a bit for specialists, doctors etc. Australia is a world leader in medical facilities but it can be very pricey. Children's hospital and medical facilities are excellent though.
Often Kiwis coming to Perth move to Mandurah or Rockingham, not realising it's an hour away from the city. The trains are often packed from this end. The rents cheaper but not when you are spending lots of money commuting. Better suburbs are Thornlie or Ellenbrook, cheaper housing but still closer to the city and community feel.
Lastly, supermarket fruit and veges are expensive. Always shop at a market to save you a ton of cash.
In terms of fitness savings, there are lots of great sporting clubs and parks to join instead of an expensive gym. Gym memberships can be up to $2500 a year where a sporting membership might be $500 a year.
Public schooling is also quite decent in WA but some schools require you to be in certain zones and of your children are at university or university age, get them to finish it in New Zealand before they migrate as New Zealand citizens are unable to access tertiary loans and Commonwealth places can cost anywhere between $10k-20k a year.
New Zealand degrees are not less favourable in Australia, the units of study just need to be transferable.<!- start components/assignment-button --> <!- end components/assignment-button -->

#4. Scooters/Skateboards
Probably the most common symbol of the wacky workplace is the Razor scooter, or a skateboard, or some other child's toy that employees supposedly use to travel everywhere on campus.
Here's Pixar boss John Lasseter showing off the fun they have scooting around on scooters at Pixar:
Inside Pixar Animation Studios
Here's Mashable boss Pete Cashmore showing off the fun they have scooting around on scooters at Mashable:
Here's some dudes at PopCap Games showing off the fun they have scooting around on scooters at PopCap:
Here's some guy at Facebook showing off the fun they have skatboarding around on skateboards at Facebook:
And here's some parked scooters at Google New York that no one could be bothered to demonstrate for the tour:
At this point, it's been copied so much that you'll probably have to have your CEO putting around on a Big Wheel to get any attention.
LaughingSquid.com
Less dignity = more industry cred.
#3. Red Walls
Another thing that everybody does to stand out from each other that makes them all look alike is the red accent wall. Beige and white walls symbolize a dull, conventional office environment. Why not show how different you are by painting one wall bright red? Who else is going to do that? Other than Blend ...
... Autodesk ...
... Etsy ...
... YouTube ...
... TechStars ...
... Valve ...
... and many more, but you probably don't want to sit here looking at red walls all day. If you do, I have good news for you, the tech sector is hiring.
#2. Orange Couches
Red accent walls have nothing on orange couches though. I know it's easy to look at an orange couch and go, "What if we had THIS in the office? Everybody has office couches but nobody has ORANGE ones, since it's such a bright and unconventional color!" Apparently about 100 tech company decorators went to their various IKEAs at the same time and had the exact same thought.
That's why cutting edge workplaces like Google London ...
... Twitter ...
... PopCap ...
... Skype London ...
... Digg ...
... Mozilla ...
... Groupon ...
... Google Stockholm ...
... and a ton of other companies all look suspiciously similar.
#1. Slides
By this point, the frustrated office designer is tearing their hair out, seeing as every idea for making the office different is being used by every other office that wants be different. "But wait!" they go. "I've got it! What if, instead of using the stairs, you took a SLIDE from the second floor to the first floor! That's NUTS!" Sure, no one else would think of that. Just every Silicon Valley firm in the '90s. And every Google office today:
TheFlirtyBlog.com
Google headquarters.
Hoax-Slayer.com
Google Zurich.
New York Post
Google New York.
LaughingSquid.com
Google San Francisco - hey! Orange couch.
And YouTube.
And Red Bull.
And Epic Games.
And some office complex in England.
This isn't even a company. This is just an office building that some developer built and is going to rent out to a bunch of businesses, with the deal sweetener of, "Also, it has a slide." That's how ho-hum slides are now. You use them to sell office space to people.
Now a lot of these workplaces are a big step up from working at your average standard-cubicle distribution office or investment firm, sure. But the way they gush about these traits like they're reinventing the workplace or something is ridiculous considering how many other companies are doing the exact same things, in the exact same colors even. As far as who's really setting the bar for a "different" workplace, take a look at Inventionland:
Love it or hate it, you got to admit they don't half-ass it when trying to make a "different" kind of office. They're not just painting a wall red or bringing in a foosball table, they're planting their employees in the middle of goddamned Disneyland. I don't know if that helps them work or not but it sure as hell is commitment to being different.
When your average Nerf-gunning PR person brags to the media about how they're doing wacky, creative things with offices that nobody's done before, they should look at this place and hang their heads in shame. And then take down those stupid internet meme posters.

Richard Carmona
Former U.S. Surgeon General Richard Carmona is highlighting his medical background in his Democratic U.S. Senate bid to succeed retiring Arizona Republican Jon Kyl. Carmona’s ads feature him in a white doctor’s jacket and in a hospital setting.
There’s two sides to the lab coat advertising message as Carmona takes on U.S. Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., in the general election.
Carmona’s ads tout his life story and background as a trauma surgeon, combat medic in Vietnam and surgeon general under Republican George W. Bush. Carmona argues both political parties have come up short on the health care issue.
Democrats hope the lab coat ads resonate with Arizona voters — especially women and Independents — who likely have more positive views of doctors than they do of politicians.
But they also expose Carmona to some questions from Flake and the GOP on issues such as “ObamaCare,” abortion and the role of government in mandating employers to cover birth control pills and abortion-inducing drugs. Carmona supports abortion rights while Flake doesn’t.
Flake also opposed the Affordable Care Act.
The Flake campaign sent Carmona a letter today signed by 40 physicians who want ObamaCare (i.e. the Affordable Care Act) repealed, and link the Democrat to President Barack Obama’s health reforms.l sometimes fall to the share of multitudes.

Real Madrid 5, LA Galaxy 1: Match Highlights
This entry was posted in MLS- LA Galaxy. Bookmark the permalink.
What’s with the RM fans in the ACB section? For shame.
So I guess MLS hasn’t caught up with La Liga yet.
A set of orange comes would’ve done a better job defending
I never expected the Galaxy to compete but I there is a silver lining the Galaxy had a few pretty neat one touch combinations in the attack. Also, the Galaxy’s C team or reserves held Benzema, Ozil, Pepe, and Ronaldo to ONLY 2 goals
1. Yikes – four goals on pretty much the same kind of through-ball.
2. I get it that folks in the US have favorite clubs in other countries, but it still rankles to see them rooting against their local team.
I think RM stomps most teams like this in La Liga or even worse. Also, LA is in 5th place.
If this was a La Liga game where goal differential matters RM would’ve scored 10 easily.
I completely agree. I guess it’s better than not showing up and all; at least the Gs capitalized on it.
HHAAAA!!!I doubt that very much.
That was a highlight reel of atrocious defending. I mean I know its Real…but cmon Galaxy.
Did anyone really expect the Galaxy to try?? Really, a friendly match a few days before a big league match?? Why risk injury..
No ACB or LARS…Eurodouchy vibe at the HDC
Yes it has, everybody but Real Madrid and Barca.
Teams not leagues….
Why not, they tied them 3 years ago.

Digital Resources:What are all of your boring details and why am I interviewing you?
My parents named me Matthew 21 years ago in 1992. This makes me an Aries, which according to a quick google search, makes me impatient, selfish, jealous, vain, egotistical and violent. I was born on an island that is below sea level (God save us all) called Richmond. I have lived here all my life. I eat an average of 7 spiders a year in my sleep. And I’m not sure how to use a semi colon; I should really learn.
As to the second part of the question, I’m not sure but I feel sorry for you.
There are some people who think you actually have some talent. How did you become so ballin’ behind the lens and on Final Cut Pro?
They are either 1) compulsive liars 2) paid to say that 3) my parents 4) all of the above
I’m not really sure how I became such a stone cold boss. I was always the creative kid in school who made better posters than everyone else. I was always drawing, building things and playing with lego. I even made the entire ’04 Crankworx course of out popsicle sticks, with functional teeter-totter and all. At the end of high school, video became a new way to express my creativity whether it was through short films or bike videos (for any younger kids watching, video is another word for edit). Since then, it’s all about practice and learning through collaboration… and tutorials on YouTube. But last week I moved to Adobe Premiere and I am no longer the boss I once was.
Were you a video junkie? If so which films did you wear out?
Not at all. I never really have been. However, I have watched many of the classic MTB films where people dorp to falt off skinnies. But I don’t recall watching something over and over again until my eyes burned. The only DVD I wore out as a kid was Dumb and Dumber. In fact, in film school I often felt like I was the only kid who hadn’t watched 90% of the films we discussed. Nowadays I try to keep up to date with my Wes Andersons and my Steven Spielbergs because I don’t like when people judge me.
What is your favourite mtb flick?
Life Cycles. Because life is a river and that’s what granddad always used to say.
How did you get tangled up with nsmb.com?
A combination of connections, good timing and luck. Trevor Hansen (nsmb.com team manager aka. equipment manager) taught physical education at my high school. He knew I was into mountain bikes and would generously hook me up with small pieces of gear and goodies to review. First it was a pair of grips, then a pair of tires, then a bike, then another bike. At the time, I was becoming more interested in video and has just acquired a Canon T1i. Mr. Hansen – which I called him for 5 years of my life – knew about my interest in cameras as he would see me roaming the school filming various projects. Just as the summer of 2010 was around the corner he asked me if I was interested in filming AIRprentice at Silverstar. That was my first project with nsmb.
I must have done a decent job as I was asked to shoot another video, which happened to be my first paid video gig ever! I believe the rest is a case of good timing. Video was becoming a vital part of web media and nsmb did not have any content in that department. After film school Cam asked me to work full time on the site.
tl;dr: Cam has repeatedly proven to be the Lorne Michaels of the mtb world.
Matt made his first dollar with this video for Wade Simmon’s Excellent Adventure.
If you had to be one filmmaker’s slave for a year who would you choose? (and why)
Coincidently, I would probably fluff Lorne Michaels for 365 days – if a producer counts as a filmmaker. I always thought it would be awesome to work on set of late night shows like SNL and Jimmy Fallon. The behind the scenes of those type of productions really fascinates me.
Are there others you look up to inside mtb?
<vague answer> I look up to anyone making fresh and unique creations that push the limits of mountain bike filmmaking. </vague answer>
Are you trying to capture the ‘pure distilled essence’ of the ride when you shoot or is it something else you are after? Any techniques?
I guess you could say that, haha. I try to make the riding look fun and exciting by bringing the viewer close to the action. I also like to incorporate a lot of camera movement in my shots through various pieces of equipment. It really depends what the project is though. I try as often as I can to incorporate some element of creativity or comedy into my videos. There is a lot to make fun of within the mtb industry, so why not create memorable videos by making people laugh?
Matt’s “sampled” videos have attracted a lot of attention. Last year he was asked to produce this video for the NBC broadcast of the Dew Tour.
What is the most challenging part of creating mountain bike films?
Creating something different that no one has seen before is always a challenge. It’s no secret that there is a lot of the same old boring cookie-cutter shreddit crap on the intertubes. However, that’s not entirely a bad thing. I think it’s great that anyone who is motivated can buy or borrow a camera, download some software (legally, duh) and start making their own bike films in no time.
Will there be a Beardless & Fearless 2 this year?
We probably see about ten videos on our social media feeds a day. Many of them follow the same formula of rider gets bike, rider puts on goggles, rider’s name pops up on screen while he gazes deeply into the lens, rider may play rock paper scissors with rider #2, rider drops in, show three angles of each jump… we all know how that goes. Sometimes it’s great, sometimes it’s not so great. It’s not an easy task to push beyond this formula. I mean, how many different ways can you shoot someone riding a bike through a forest. I try push the boundaries of entertainment in the mountain bike world and create something that people will remember (and retweet). Rocky Mountain Bicycles has also given me the opportunity to make a few memorable videos as well.
Matt’s video of Wade and Thomas is Rocky Mountain’s most viewed video to date.
Tell us about your other gig involving models/super cars/rapping.
I have a fairly successful YouTube channel by the name of IFHT. With my partner Jason Lucas, we create comedic sketches, music videos, parodies and instructional how-to videos. We have over 100 videos, over 120,000 people subscribed to our channel and a view count of nearly 25 million.
Our videos have gathered attention all over the world on the internet, television and in newspapers. We’ve been doing it for just over four years now and have had many surprising things happen to us. We have been interviewed by local and national news a number of times, been on the radio, had a video on the Canucks homepage, attention from Perez Hilton, had opportunities to travel to YouTube’s studio in Los Angeles… it’s been crazy. Crazy fun. Making viral videos, which is another challenge in itself, has become a huge hobby of mine. It’s exciting, sometimes mysterious, and when you are successful it is addicting.
One of IFHT’s many viral videos that blew up over night.
And yes, it has also given us the opportunity to work with some beautiful women, drive fast cars and learn how to rap.
How did IFHT start?
IFHT, which stands for “I F*cking Hate That”, was essentially a product of boredom. In grade 12, Jason and I were both making dirt jump videos for fun. I had borrowed my first HD camcorder from a friend in December of 2009. I really wanted to use it, but due to the weather we couldn’t shoot any biking. Jason and I were brainstorming what else we could shoot while chatting on MSN Messenger, which doesn’t exist anymore (thanks, Obama). Somehow we came up with the idea to make a video series on based on things we hate. We made several god awful videos and uploaded them to facebook. Our friends thought they were funny and would often engage and come up with new concepts for us to write and film. Somewhere down the line we learned about YouTube and the opportunity to make money through the partnership program. I still remember the first amount of money we ever saw in our adsense account – it was a smokin’ 9 cents.
Are you dating one of these models yet?
No. Unless by dating you mean, following them on instagram. Then yes.
Is it true that you get asked for autographs? What has been your weirdest experience with your fans?
We have signed autographs, yes. I have signed girls’ phones before. No boobies though… yet. I can’t remember a weird experience off the top of my head, but I do remember a funny one. A year ago Jason and I were walking to the Pinkbike Christmas party at a bar downtown. We approached the bouncer, who as usual, asked who we were and if we were on the guest list and what not before letting us in. Just at that moment, a small asian girl holding a clarinet case freaks out and asks if were from IFHT and if she can take a picture with us. She then requests if I carry her in my arms in the photo. After we took the photo, we turn around to the bouncer, who no longer cares if were on the list. We then proceeded to the plaid chest-height-beers party.
Matt felt there was a need to make fun of mountain bikers who take themselves too seriously.
Of the vids you’ve shot for nsmb which are you most proud of?
That’s tough. I usually hate every video I make after it has been out for a month. How To Be A Mountain Biker and Shit Mountain Bikers Say are of course top contenders. I’ll say Paul Stevens in Squamish for riding videos. I think I shot it well, the trail is nice and green and Paul is super fast. But I probably just like the song.
Who is the biggest pain in the ass you have worked with?
It’s a tie between Jason Lucas and Morgan Taylor’s dog.
Who was ‘an absolute joy’ to work with?
I really enjoyed working on Arrival with the Coastal Crew. They love fart jokes equally as much as I do. I also appreciate the occasional opportunity I get to work with Sterling Lorence. I’m not sure if he loves fart jokes, but he does love to share his wisdom. Really though, I enjoy working with anyone who shares the same passion for creativity that I do. It’s not hard to tell when someone doesn’t want to be there.
Dream big. Where will you be in five years?
Filling out an application in an Arby’s trying to figure out what went wrong.
What are your goals for 2014?
My goal for this year is simple but not easy. I want a video to reach 1,000,000 views! It’s been a while since that happened. We got close last year but were just shy.
How To Be A Mountain Biker sits at 780,000 views at the time of this post.
The season is just ramping up. What sort of filming plans do you have with nsmb this spring? (without giving too much away)
We’re just about to finish up a new “How To Be” video that I hope will be a hit. I also have a couple other projects brewing that I can’t wait to get started. One will involve some more rapping… if I was better at producing my own beats it would be done a lot sooner!
Anything else you’d like to add?
Thanks for watching my videos. Thanks Cam for believing in a young Matthew. And hi Mom!!

An estimated 350 people also were injured in the 5.8 magnitude quake north of Bologna in Emilia Romagna, one of Italy's more productive regions, agriculturally and industrially.
Factories, barns and churches fell, dealing a second blow to a region where thousands remained homeless from the May 20 temblor, much stronger in intensity, at 6.0 magnitude.
The area encompassing the cities of Modena, Mantua and Bologna is prized for its production of expensive cars,.
Seven people were killed in the May 20 quake. In both, the dead were largely and disproportionately workers killed by collapsing factories and warehouses.
Premier Mario Monti pledged that the government would quickly provide help to the area "that is so special, so important and so productive for Italy."Unitech Training Academy-Houma

Officers discovered a total of 41 grams of meth in various locations around the home while searching the property in Olivia. Agents also seized a digital scale, numerous notes listing money owed for sales, drug smoking devices, packaging materials and needles. Lara pled guilty to a felony charge of 1st-degree drug possession in Renville County Court. She has a previous federal conviction in Texas for aiding and abetting illegal entry and failure to appear in court as well.
Home » Featured News » Olivia Woman Prison SentenceSEOUL — Video footage shows that someone tried to save the life of a U.S. soldier shortly before he died of a brain hemorrhage, hours after he was involved in a street fight last week, South Korean police said Monday.
Footage recorded by a street camera showed a foreigner — whom South Korean police think is an American, though they do not know his identity — administering CPR to Spc. Carl A. Lissone outside a hotel in Pyeongtaek shortly around 1 p.m. on May 4.
At 1:16 p.m., Lissone was taken to a Pyeongtaek hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later.
His death is being investigated by U.S. and South Korean authorities.
Many details of what happened on May 4 to Lissone, a 20-year-old information technology specialist stationed at Humphreys, have not been made public.
According to South Korean police accounts, Lissone and at least one friend were drinking and dancing at Club Naked in the Hongdae neighborhood early that morning when Lissone got into a fight outside the club with another soldier at around 3:45 a.m. At least four soldiers eventually became involved in the fight, and Lissone was struck in the head and lost consciousness.
Even though he was bleeding from his nose and ears, his friends transported him back to Pyeongtaek by train, police said.
According to Google maps, a train ride from Hongdae to Pyeongtaek takes a little more than 90 minutes.
Lissone and two others checked into the hotel around 7:30 a.m. on May 4.
The soldiers suspected of involvement in the incident are under the control of their unit leadership, and any decisions about possible restrictions will be made by their commanders, 8th Army spokesman Col. Shawn Stroud said Monday.
The club where Lissone was partying before his death is located in a popular entertainment area that has been placed off-limits to U.S. troops in the past..
The 1st Signal Brigade will hold a memorial ceremony for Lissone, a native of Covington, Georgia, at Humphreys on Tuesday. The ceremony will be closed to the media and the public.

The latest business news, reviews, features and whitepapers
If you are looking for a hands-free way to use your mobile phone in your car, the Parrot Minikit Chic lets you drive and talk without having to glance down at your handset.
Parrot's Minikit Chic Bluetooth speakerphone sure looks purty with its silver and gray, flowery design. The $119.00 device, which is about the same size as an iPod Classic, comes with a built-in clip, so it's ready to slip onto your car's sun visor. When I tried it, however, the clip felt a bit chintzy and failed to pry open very wide. I had to mash it onto my visor to ensure that it stayed in place.
In addition to letting you make and receive calls in your car, the Chic goes a step further than most other Bluetooth car kits by absorbing your contacts list. The feature, which worked great in my tests, lets you store up to 1000 contacts per phone (you max out at 2500, if you have the Chic paired to more than one phone). This helps if your contact list contains hard-to-pronounce names, since you don't have to waste time trying to have your voice understood ("Call Thérèse Home"); instead you can use the device's controls to navigate to your contact's name by letter and select it.
I liked the prominent knob atop the unit--a breeze to find while keeping my eyes on the road. You turn the knob to cycle through menu options, which let you adjust the volume, locate contacts by first letter, and then initiate a call.
Immediately to the left of the knob is an area lit by a red light, which you push to reject an incoming call or hang up. And to the right is an area with a green light to accept a call, to redial (by holding it down for a couple of seconds), and to start dialling by voice. Again, these controls are easy to find by feel alone.
The Chic comes with its own voice-prompt interface, which made me feel as if I had my own virtual butler in the car at all times. For example, when you push the green-lit area, a British-sounding robotic female voice pipes up, asking, "Who do you want to call?" I would respond by stating a name from my phone book, and in my tests it understood me well, initiating calls to the right folks. "Scott cellular, call in progress," it would say, for instance. Similarly, when calls came in and the Chic's memory contained the number, it would announce the name of the caller--a huge benefit when driving.
As with all the Bluetooth speakerphones I tested, the call quality was not perfect. Overall, call recipients thought I sounded far away and muffled; occasionally my voice would fade in and out. Nevertheless, they could hear what I was saying, no problem. The level of interference was up and down, as sometimes it was barely discernible while other times call recipients could pick up a churning sound. I could hear callers' voices just fine, with practically no distortion.
The Chic does not have an indicator to let you know whether the device is on or off. This annoyed me a few times--and, of course, I ended up switching it off when I thought I was turning it on (and vice versa).
If you are looking for a hands-free way to use your cell phone in your car, the Chic lets you drive and talk without having to glance down at your handset. (You'd never do that while driving anyway, right?) So as long as your phone supports automatic transfer of your contacts--look for the automatic synchronisation feature in your phone's specs list--this device will be a big hit. If your phone doesn't support automatic synchronisation, you can use your handset's Object Push feature to send contacts from your cell phone to the Chic. (Your phone's user guide should provide specific instructions on how to send contacts this way via Bluetooth.)
Finally, if the floral look isn't your thing, Parrot also offers the plain-black Minikit Slim--the same $119 product, only without.About Nancy Loe & Sassy Jane Genealogy
About Nancy Loe & Sassy Jane Genealogy
“Loe: Norwegian habitational name from any of several farms named Lo, from Old Norse Ló, of uncertain etymology” †
My name is Nancy Loe. I’m an archivist, librarian, and genealogist – and I’m happy to say I found exactly where my Loe ancestors were from in Norway. In 2010, I started Sassy Jane Genealogy. The name comes from a 1920s print advertisement for Sassy Jane Rayon Frocks, combining my love for vintage ephemera and genealogy research.
I hold Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in American History and a Master’s in Library Science with a specialization in archives administration. Because I studied in Washington, DC, I was fortunate to be able to intern at the Smithsonian Institution.
My first real job right out of library school was Head of Local History and Genealogy at the Pikes Peak Library District in Colorado Springs, just as Alex Haley’s Roots was making genealogy extremely popular, so we were very busy.
A lot has changed about genealogy since then, except for my delight in helping people finding their ancestors.
I decided to write the Sassy Jane Genealogy Guides to provide simple, practical, and effective ways to research, cite, organize, and maintain your family tree. I’ve written the guides to provide genealogists with the best practices of archivists and historians, simplifying the parts of genealogy that seem so complicated they can bog down your research. Organizing genealogical research, citing family history sources, and cataloging digital family photographs and records are the most popular Sassy Jane Genealogy Guides.
In addition to appearing on PBS’s American Experience and California Gold, I’ve presented at RootsTech, Jamboree, and state, regional, and local genealogy societies. Organizing genealogical research using archival principles is my favorite topic, and a full list of my presentations is available here.
When I’m not working on trees for my clients, I enjoy making progress on my own family history (Norway, Sweden, Scotland, Austria, Prussia, South Africa, and New Zealand) and my husband’s (New England, the Midwest and Plains states, and Great Britain).
And when I’m not seeing dead people, I enjoy getting away from the phosphorescent glow of my monitor and actually going outside into the garden, where I exert myself watching my husband cultivating fruit, vegetables, and flowers. or suggest new avenues to explore for those brick-wall ancestors. Contact me here.
†And I always cite my sources. In this case: Dictionary of American Family Names, New York: Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 452.

By Megan Dooley
Editor's note: One item in this crime blotter has been changed to better reflect the employment status of an individual charged.
A 51-year-old Forest Park man was arrested on March 11 for possession of a firearm without a Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) card and for possession of firearm ammunition without an FOID card, both misdemeanors, after a search of his home turned up a .357 Magnum revolver and nine rounds of hollow point ammunition.
The search was prompted by a Jan. 11 incident in which the man was allegedly discovered viewing child pornography on a computer in the Dominican University library by a member of the university's security personnel. The computer was turned over to River Forest police, and the material the suspect was viewing was determined to be pornographic. The police secured a search warrant for the suspect's home, located on the 300 block of Circle Avenue, but did not find any evidence of child pornography. River Forest police said they could not bring additional charges regarding inappropriate pornographic material because of insufficient forensic evidence.

Does anyone know what was going on around 5:00 pm on Friday March 11 in the Forest Preserve area between Maywood and River Forest (bounded by Madison, Thatcher and Washington)? I saw this coming home. Maywood and River Forest Police had at least three sides of the Forest Preserve blocked off with cars, and there were at least a dozen officers with walkie talkies looking for someone apparently. Any idea what this was about? It was disconcerting, especially, since kids were @ the Comm Ctr then66 Cutler Road, PO Box 190

Earlier this week, DirecTV announced that WrestleMania will be seeing a price increase this year, with the HD feed selling for $69.99 and the SD version going for $59.99. Both are $5 increases from last year. The cost of ordering the show is certainly high, but it’s on par with the price of a Floyd Meathweather PPV boxing fight, so WWE is not overly concerned that it will hurt the number of buys.
As PWMania.com previously reported, based on annual trends of repeat viewership numbers and the continued trend of viewers shifting to the HD broadcasts, it’s projected that WWE will see an additional $900,000 profit for WrestleMania 29 from the price increase alone. Even if WrestleMania does not draw as many buys as last year, it could still shatter the company’s all-time pay-per-view revenue records.
With a sellout crowd at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ, WrestleMania 29 is poised to be the second-largest WrestleMania crowd in WWE history (behind WrestleMania 3 at the Pontiac Silverdome) and has already grossed over $11 million for the company.

- Michael GroomsThe migration of violent street gangs is a growing problem and a top priority of the Department and its law enforcement agencies. It is absolutely critical that agencies share gang intelligence and that investigative leads are vigorously pursued. Generally, law enforcement agencies share intelligence with other offices within their own agency. The breakdown in intelligence-sharing typically occurs when the primary or "lead" Federal agency investigating a particular gang in one city is not the primary agency in the second city.
It is incumbent upon every Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) involved in a gang investigation to insure that the intelligence developed in the course of the investigation is properly and timely disseminated to the appropriate agency/office in other locales. What may appear trivial to investigators in a major city where a gang is centered, may prove to be significant in a smaller city or town where the gang is trying to establish a foothold. In many cases it will suffice for the AUSA to play an oversight role in the exchange of this information. However, there will be times when AUSAs should pass the information along themselves, to colleagues in other districts or offices or to the appropriate law enforcement agency.
The Terrorism and Violent Crime Section (TVCS) has been working at the national level to improve the coordination of intelligence sharing. TVCS will assist you in any manner which facilitates this flow of information pertaining to gangs and gang migration. Contact TVCS attorneys at (202) 514-0849.
[cited in USAM 9-63.1200]Stephane Bouchard was one of the most dominant drivers in the sport of harness racing during the past decade. The Montreal native has been a winning machine basically from the start of his driving career and was the man at Yonkers Raceway and Monticello on a year in year out basis. From the years of 2003-2007, Bouchard was the leading driver at Yonkers, a rare “fivepeat” amongst reinsman at the top of the standings. While the talented pilot was piling up victories at night at the hilltop oval in Yonkers, he was also making trips to the winner’s circle during the day at Monticello. Bouchard is a rare driver to win titles at two different tracks at the same time. The 2001 National Driver of the Year, Bouchard had one of his best years in ’03 when he led North American drivers with 656 wins.
Bouchard’s winning ways continued throughout the decade and in ’05, he became the first Monticello driver to accrue $1 million in purses in a season. In his 2006 campaign at Monty, the sulky star piled up an incredible 410 victories en route to just shy of $2.75 million in purses. As he was dominating at Monticello, the talented Bouchard was the sulky star at Yonkers as well. The Canadian invader was the leading driver at Yonkers for five consecutive seasons from ’03-’07. In 2007, Bouchard had one of the great years in harness racing history when he won an eye-popping 814 races and earned more than $7.6 million in an incredible 4,000 starts.
After wrapping up a stretch in which he won at least 489 races every year from 2000-2008, Bouchard decided to come to Saratoga Casino and Raceway to compete. In previous seasons, the only time we would see Bouchard is when the New York Sire Stakes came to town. He turned his attention to the Spa in 2011 and while still competing at other tracks made Saratoga his main track that year. It is no surprise that since coming to town, Bouchard has thrived. Always in the top five in the driver standings, Bouchard finished last season second behind Billy Dobson who won the driver’s title for the fourth consecutive year.
Last weekend, Bouchard reached a plateau that very few in the history of harness racing ever have. The talented reinsman piloted his 8,000th lifetime winner on the Sunday matinee card. Bouchard was sitting behind favorite Lotto Winner and moved her to the lead in the early going. Having to survive a run in the stretch from one rival, Lotto Winner was good enough to give Bouchard the historic win. Joined by wife Eve, son Sam and a host of friends and supporters, Bouchard was recognized in the winner’s circle with a sign acknowledging the milestone and a gift certificate to Fortune’s Restaurant. By reaching the 8,000 plateau, Bouchard entered some rarified air. He became only the 25th harness driver to ever reach the 8,000 win mark. Considering the fact that Bouchard is just 47 years of age, the feat is even more impressive. He is one of the younger drivers to enter the 8,000 win club. And he certainly appears to have plenty left in the tank. Bouchard, who has accrued more than $70 million in purses in his sensational career thus far, attributes much of his success to hard work and persistence. He acknowledges that hitting a special milestone such as this is very rewarding. Congratulations to Bouchard, a talented reinsman and a class act, on tallying his 8,000th win.
The fact that there are only 25 drivers in the history of the sport to pilot 8,000 winners makes it even more impressive that two of those drivers were competing at Saratoga this weekend. This month marks the return of driver Wally Hennessey. The Hall of Fame driver competes at Pompano Park throughout the wintertime and races at the Spa through the spring and summer. Hennessey, who was inducted in the Living Hall of Fame in Goshen, NY in 2007, was recently enshrined in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The 57-year-old Hennessey hit the 8,000 win plateau a couple of years ago and now has piloted more than 8,500 winners. In his incredible career, Hennessey has accrued purses of more than $57 million and has displayed incredible consistency. The Saint Edward Island native has won 200 or more in each of the last 25 years. Talk about consistent. Hennessey returned to town this weekend and drove just one horse on Friday night. He wasted no time finding the winner circle as he made his first 2014 drive at the Spa a winning one. Hennessey joins Bouchard as Saratoga regulars with an amazing 8,000 lifetime victories in the sulky.
The best horse Hennessey has ever been involved with, Moni Maker, passed away this week. The all-time biggest money earner amongst trotters, Moni Maker piled up just shy of $5.6 in earnings in her illustrious career. Following a win in the prestigious trotting event the Elitloppet in Sweden in 1998 while sitting behind Moni Maker, Hennessey said he “now knows what it feels like to win the Super Bowl,” adding that it was the greatest thrill of his life. Moni Maker was inducted into the Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 2006. She passed away last week at the age of 21.
Live racing takes place every Thursday through Saturday night with first post times set for 6:45 p.m. Sunday matinees take place beginning at 12:45 p.m. Until next week, I’m Mike Sardella wishing you the best of luck and we’ll see you at the finish line.News

SHARE THIS 2014-05-05 13:23 Treasure Thabede Comments: 4 Article views: 560 Are political parties supposed to divide communities or unite communities?Written by : Mr Treasure ThabedeCommunity of South Africa I greet you all in the name of unity. I am writing this article because I am deeply saddened and concerned with the current and continuing divisions amongst community members in our society, caused by politics. According to Chapter 1, Section {1}{d} of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act No. 108 of 1996, it is stated undoubtedly that, South Africa is a country with a multi-party system of democratic government. Therefore, a community member must not be seen as a traitor nor as an enemy, if he or she joins one of the South African registered political parties, but must be seen as an ordinary South African who is exercing his/her constitutional and democratic obligation. Our first democratically elected president Dr Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela once said “I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. Therefore, I am of the view that we should not let the existence of political parties be a new system that divides our societies; instead they (political parties) should unite us as a society in order to enforce harmony where we live.Too often, community members are sabotaged or supported depending on which political party they are affiliated to. This is an egotistic, outlandish and unsubstantiated system, because we are all South Africans before we join political parties. In fact, our political affiliation should only be informed by the fact that we all have one common goal, and that is to: Improve and develop the lives of South Africans, and promote unity and diversity in our societies, even when we differ with our views, because all the socio-economic issues that are affecting us as South Africans, needs to be addressed by us as South Africans undivided. We need a culture of a unified activism as a developing country.As a community of South Africa, and as a developing country, I do not think our energies should focus more on whether we are affiliates to political parties or not affiliates to political parties. Such energy would be a wasted one. We need to work as one society that respects one another. If you were to check in all our political parties in South Africa, you will find out that there are about 5 million South Africans who are members (card carrying members) of these political parties all combined, but there are about 17 million who vote on the day of voting, this means that there are 12 million South Africans who vote, even though they are not members of these political parties. These people are just innocent supporters who sometimes are denied opportunities at a later stage, because they are not members of political parties, yet they are the majority who vote. So if we were to choose people for better things according to their political affiliation, we would be making an enormous mistake. As the community of South Africa, we must be unified in addressing these multiple issues that are affecting our country, regardless of our political affiliation. Such issues are poverty, crime, lack of literacy and quality education, inequality in our society, low health standards, and unemployment. We need to face these issues as our only rival in the battle field. In order to fight these issues we need to be united as a nation, and that is why all political parties must be nation builders, rather than nation dividers.We need to trust each other as a nation in alleviating all these back-logs that are affecting our town. I am under the impression that, those who differ with unity in order to get rid of these issues mentioned above, such individuals are resistant to positive change and development. I am also pleading to our leaders and office bearers who are consigned with the duties of changing the lives of South Africans, to lead with integrity and responsibility and to always put first the interests of the people. As we are approaching the Election Day (07th May 2014), I am pleading to all the people of South Africa to go all out and vote, and most importantly, I am encouraging for peace and unity while you make that “X” in the ballot paper. Go out there and make your vote counts!!! I thank you.Writer: Treasure Thabede is a youth community member at Mkhondo.

I would love to be entered to win the gift certificate. I want the initial necklace. Also prayers for you. We recently had a scare with our 16 month old son. He had a lymph node swell up on his neck to about the size of a plum. They removed it and thankfully there was no cancer, just an infection that settled there. Prayers to you and your family.
I just checked out your earrings, and I love the aqua stone ones.Slate & Tiled Roof

Some people may say they wouldn’t compromise themselves for a paycheck or promotion. But Sallie Mae doesn’t care about your convictions.
Suppose you found a marketing job at a tobacco company that enabled you to get experience and pay back your student loans. Or perhaps your major is aerospace engineering. The only job you see close to your field is with the military, designing weapons of mass destruction. Would you really take the moral high road and go work at Starbucks?
Considering that studies have shown many young professionals change jobs every two years, it would only be a temporary conflict of values.
So let’s hear it, VIXENS. Would you take a job – or do a task on your job – that wasn’t exactly upstanding if it allowed you to get ahead?Pedros Barros continued his dominating year by winning the Vans Bowl-a-Rama in New York City over the weekend. The 17-year-old Brazilian has won all three Bowl-A-Rama events in 2012.

Among the Pros, no one has been able to touch Barros, who has been alone atop the world of transition skating. In addition to his win in New York, Barros this year has claimed victories at the Bowl-a-Ramas in Australia and New Zealand, the presitgious Pro-Tec Pool Party in Orange, California, and at X Games Skateboard Park in L.A.

Posted: Mon, 23 Sep 2013 13:03
More revelations have been revealed by The Sunday Times about the Al-Madinah school in Derby — Britain's first Muslim free school.). It has also been alleged that the original head teacher and his deputy were "bullied" out of their jobs.
Andrew Cutts-McKay resigned from his role as head teacher in August. His deputy, Suzanne Southerland, had already resigned in June. Both are understood to have been side-lined by members of the school's trust, who are predominantly Muslim. The school strongly denies the allegations.
The Sunday Times said that its sources had revealed that since it opened, the school had become extremely religious.."
Hard-line Islamism seems to be the ethos of the school with a strict dress code, a ban on stringed instruments and on singing.
The whistle-blowing staff member said: "When teaching children the alphabet, you could not associate the letter 'p'."
Another staff member said that lunch and break times had been extended to give more time for prayer.
The school issued a statement rejecting the claims. "Al-Madinah is a pioneering school, the first of its type in the whole country, and not everyone wants it to succeed. Unfortunately politics have been allowed to interfere with education."
Sources close to Cutts-McKay and Southerland told The Sunday Times that the two former school leaders, who are not Muslim, had made official complaints alleging bullying to the Department for Education. Other teachers have raised concerns about the way the school is being run and about employment contracts.
The revelation comes as the DfE continues its investigation into the school's financial management, which was expected to report last week. The department said the report would be "issued in due course".
Cutts-McKay's attempts to stop the alleged bullying against Southerland by the trust's members — which reportedly went on for at least two months — eventually led to him resigning for the same reasons. He has since accepted a post as head teacher at another free school.
The trust has refused to comment but Stuart Wilson, the interim head teacher at al-Madinah who began his job on September 5, defended the school against charges of bulling. He said there was nothing in staff contracts requiring women to wear the hijab or a headscarf. However, he added: "The expectation for female staff, raised in adverts and interviews, is that the head is covered while on site. To date, no complaint has been raised with the governing body relating to female staff wearing the hijab or headscarf."
The crisis at the flagship free school emerged as three more Muslim free schools opened, in Blackburn, Bolton and east London, bringing the total number of Muslim free schools now open to five.
The Sunday Times has discovered that more than a dozen other applications to convert private Islamic schools into state-funded free schools have been vetoed by the DfE.
It has asked the schools inspectorate, Ofsted, to conduct about 20 emergency inspections over the last few years into private Islamic schools, some of which require girls as young as 11 to wear burqas.
Sources within Ofsted said inspectors had grave concerns about some of the schooling they had seen.
A Department for Education spokesman told the Sunday Times: "These allegations are very worrying. The DfE will not hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to prevent religious intolerance or any breaking of the rules for free schools."
Terry Sanderson. President of the National Secular Society, said: "I really don't know what it will take for the Department for Education to admit that extreme religious interests are taking full advantage of the free school system.
"Maybe the people who are running these schools consider it normal to endanger children's education by putting so much emphasis on religion, but the rest of us are very worried. These schools are literally free to do as they please, and religious extremists exploit that freedom to the limit. And all at the taxpayers' expense.
"For the sake of the children, Ofsted must deal with this school — and all the others that have fallen into the hands of dubious religious interests — and quickly. Unfortunately, there is no political will to do anything other than make the situation worse by handing over more and more schools to people who say one thing at the approval stage and then do something entirely different when the school opens."

This new attitude toward ownership is occurring everywhere, and once we recognize this change, we can leverage it. A New Form of Competitive Advantage Even in this strange new world, the economic laws of scarcity apply, and they are precisely what's shifting. The biggest insight we can glean from the death of ownership is about connection. 1. 2. 3.

The author of Inferno is the journalist and military historian Max Hastings, and its full title is Inferno: The World at War, 1939-1945, though neither of those facts tells you much about what’s special about it.
The point of Inferno is that it’s a record of the way ordinary people experienced World War II. So while there’s an appropriate amount of information in there about politics and strategy and armaments, and while it contains the required litany of numbing statistics (the war killed an average of 27,000 people every day), the focus is on individual experiences: first-person, trench-level, eyewitness testimony. Its aim is to un-numb you: to restore feeling to minds numbed by statistics.
Mind you, the feelings it restores are really, really painful ones.. So for example, while it’s desperately moving to read about the atrocities of the Holocaust and the trauma of D-Day, it’s not unfamiliar; whereas it’s truly shocking to read about what people went through in relatively minor campaigns like the brutal struggle for Greece, and the Arctic convoys that ran materièl from Britain to the Soviets, and the tropical fighting in New Guinea. In Inferno these episodes open up and reveal themselves to be horrific little worlds in and of themselves.
(MORE: See the War Books on the All-TIME 100 Nonfiction Books List)
What you realize first is that the descent of the world into war in 1939 seemed no less surreal to those caught up in it than it does to us now. When an aide woke up King Haakon of Norway at 1:30 in the morning on April 9, 1940, to tell him that his country was at war, the king answered: “Against whom?” Many of the generals in charge were old men, relics of the First World War. Many of the weapons were even older. At Kollaa, in Finland, defenders deployed cannons cast in 1871, firing black powder charges, against the Soviet invaders.
The heart of the book lies not in the general but in the particular. So I’ll reproduce a few anecdotes, chosen pretty much at random.
- On June 12, 1940, German forces prepared to cross the Loire River at Saumur, which happened to be the home of a cavalry school. The colonel who ran the school mustered his cadets and instructors to defend the riverbanks and led them into battle. Scores of them died before their position was finally overrun.
- In August of 1940 the British coal ship Anglo Saxon was sunk west of the Canary Islands by a German cruiser. Seven men escaped in an open lifeboat. Five died of injuries or suicide. (After two weeks the ship’s cook was heard to say, “I’ll go down the street for a drink,” before he stepped overboard. The logbook reads: “Cook goes mad; dies.”) Two men survived until October when the boat washed up in the Bahamas, 2,275 miles from where it started. On his way home, one of the survivors died after his ship was sunk by a U-boat.
- After the battle at the Russian town of Rzhev, where 26,000 Russians died, a German officer walked the battlefield. It was deep winter – Russian winter. “As we picked our way through the carnage,” he remembered, “the hard frozen bodies clinked like porcelain.”
[You have no choice but to talk about numbers if you want to get at the scale of the suffering the Russians endured, which shocks even Hastings, who at this point you’d think was unshockable. It’s not news, but it’s still awe-inspiring. The Soviet Union suffered 65 percent of all the Allied deaths in the war; by comparison, the U.S. and Britain accounted for 2 percent each. At Stalingrad alone, the Russians shot 13,500 of their own troops for cowardice and desertion (that’s a guess, the real number is probably higher). The Russians themselves went numb to their own tragedy. “Here and there in the trench one sees body parts trampled into the mud,” wrote one Nikolai Nikulin, fighting near Stalingrad. “A flattened face, a hand, all as brown as the soil. We walk on them.”]
- A woman from a well-off family in Naples fled the city with her relatives to escape the bombing. They hid in a tiny village deep in the countryside. But that village was bombed too, and almost her entire family was killed: 10 people. After months living in caves, the woman fled again with her two surviving children to Rome. The city was surreally untouched by the war. “At the Corso Hotel, where the concierge knows us and tries to help,” she wrote, “we hear another guest threatening that he will refuse to patronize the establishment again if it admits such vagabonds as ourselves.”
- Casualty rates were extremely high among pilots and airplane crews, which led to a strange culture of callousness and emotional distance. “If you were coned [picked up by searchlights] you’d fly towards somebody else in the hope they’d pick them up instead of you,” wrote Ken Owen of the RAF. “There was a tremendous element of cynicism and callousness — ‘Thank Christ it’s someone else.’” A crewman from an American B-17 put it like this: “We learned to live as perhaps once we were long ago, as simply as animals, without hope for ourselves or pity for another.”
- Another B-17 pilot remembered this from a mission: “A German pilot came out of his plane, drew his legs into a ball, his head down. Papers flew out of his pockets. He did a triple somersault through our formation. No chute.”
- In Budapest in early 1945, when the city was besieged by the Soviets, almost all the 2,500 animals in the zoo were killed or eaten. “For weeks,” Hastings writes, “a lion roamed the underground rail tunnels until it was captured by a Soviet tank force dispatched for the purpose.”
These aren’t the worst of the anecdotes. In fact I chose them because they’re relatively mild, and I can stand typing them. They get much much worse than that — more violent, more evil, more horrifying, more graphic. There are accounts of close-quarters fighting with bayonets, and mass executions, and what happens when a large-caliber round gets loose inside a tank, and ships sinking with the engine crew trapped below.
But you get the idea. Once you start reading, you can’t stop – you want to meet these strangers who suffered things we can’t imagine so that we could live in a sane world, or relatively sane. And they succeeded. In that sense we’re all like Nikolai Nikulin: we’re all walking on the dead.

To achieve such diversity on all levels of employment, GEA will systematically integrate all aspects of modern work-life balance concepts into HR planning: Adapted programs and working models such as, flexible part-time work, job sharing and child care are offered to employees. In future, talented female employees will be supported more intensively in order to attract more female employees in the long term. On the path to mixed leadership, the corporate-wide diversity management program also creates the conditions to reliably identify and support managers, potentials and talents. Finally, internal diversity also supports openness to the outside world. Since all GEA Managers are located all over the world, GEA customers benefit from an actively created diversity.
GEA Refrigeration Technologies and Leadership
GEA wants to foster the cooperation and intensive exchange among all segments. As Jürg Oleas, Chairman of the Executive Board of the GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft, emphasized at the Management Meeting in Bochum: “Together, we can achieve so much more than by working on our own.“ He called for the resolve of all executives to strengthen GEA as one Group.
This approach is based on four management principles: leadership & management skills, personal integrity, and passion - no obsession.
This part of the company’s culture is one of the reasons why GEA has developed into one of the world’s most successful mechanical engineering companies, according to Jürg Oleas. Every member of staff and each segment can benefit from the overall success. And GEA Group would also benefit: the market perceives GEA as a single entity with uniform quality standards and a well-matched range of products and services.August 24, 2012 2:47 pm
Nicki Minaj – “I Am Your Leader” Feat. Cam’ron & Rick Ross (Official Music Video)
Yesterday, we saw Nicki Minaj bless rapper B.O.B.’s new video “Out of my Mind” but today she unveils a new music video.

The new music video features the Barbie and Hip Hop stars Cam’ron & Rick Ross! Watch the Boss B*tch sit pretty in the tub and deliver a spectacular video.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this music video but doubt this single will be a Billboard smash hit.

Where do people go to get these supplies. There seems to be a lot of things available to the volunteers and helpers but where do the displaced people that are working to clean up their own place go to get this help? My aunt and her daughter and her son all lost their houses in Mayflower. they have nothing and 3 are still in the hospital but we are trying to get help to them in the cleanup and starting over and don't know where to go. Any ideas on trying to find a quick and affordable apartment?
bekael, here is a list of shelters that have been established in the County:
Antioch Baptist Church: 150 Amity Road in Conway
Arkansas District Pentecostal Church of God: Vilonia
Beryl Baptist Church: 873 U.S. 64 in Vilonia
Mayflower Middle School: 17 Leslie St.
Mayflower High School Gym: 10 Leslie King Drive
Oak Bowery Baptist Church: 889 Otto Road in Conway
Point of Grace: 767 U.S. 64 B in Conway-Vilonia area
St. Joseph's Catholic Church: 1115 College Ave. in Conway
In Pulaski County, the Ferncliff Camp and Conference Center, at 1720 Ferncliff Rd., is also open as a shelter.
Also, Cheyenne Merritt with Advantage Property Management of Conway (formerly Legacy Residentials) called me yesterday about the company wanting to help people who have been displaced by the tornados.
Each of their properties are owned by different property owners, so the help will be determined on a property by property basis, she said, but some owners are willing to lower rent, drop the security deposit or furnish the residence.
Advantage Property Management is located at 945 Carson Cove, Suite 105 in Conway. They can be found online at or reached by phone at (501) 513-8999.

I'm new to this.. where can i find an obd reader for my 98 Nissan Altima (believe its OBD-II) to go to a USB connection (or serial but i'd prefer usb) on a carputer/laptop? and i'd assume i need some software as well for it. I'd like to get info such as realtime mpg, and possibly record / display hp, mph, and rpm's.
tsparks
Thanks!!!Thanks!!!

))
Your altima is definately OBD-II compliant. All cars 1996 and newer are required by law to be OBD-II compliant.
From a feature standpoint, the included software will give you features like RPM, speed, throttle position, engine load, etc. Even tells you about your trouble codes, and what they mean (If your check engine light is on). You can even reset the computer's codes if it throws an intermittent one (sometimes useful). The software's OBD-II codes are fully documented, and will give you a plain english explaination of the code (like "code PXXX - Mass Airflow sensor output lower than expected" or "PXXX - Cylinder 4 misfire" and similar). The beauty of it is, the softweare will allow you to see WHEN and under what conditions the code was set (throttle position, engine speed, engine load, vehicle speed, etc).
Their software updates frequently, is free for download, uses very little CPU, and can record logs and play them back at later times. The length/time of these logs is dependent on available hard drive space.

how about 1995 altima
is there a way to know for sure if it is OBD II or not. I know all 1996 and up and bylaw but is there a way to check the car itself so be sure ( coz some older 1994/95 cars have OBD II). or is there a site that has all the compatable cars for example?
thanks
BookmarksI have managed property for 15 years, mostly furnished but sometimes not and sometimes part. HMRC did not want me to keep changing from one to the other, so I maintained them all as furnished to get the 10% off rental income offset against tax. When does the property become unfurnished and require me to inform HMRC differently so that I do not get the 10% offset for all properties?
Arthur Weller Replies:
If you look at
you can see that it is only possible to claim the 10% wear and tear allowance for fully furnished accommodation. If it doesn’t meet this criteria, it is not claimable. So I cannot understand how you could have claimed the 10% allowance in past years for those properties that were not fully furnished. In this matter each property is looked at individually.

Daughtry is back. The rock band led by American Idol alum Chris Daughtry released on iTunes at 00:01 on Tuesday, September 17th the lead single from their upcoming fourth studio album. The track is called "Waiting for Superman", and is co-written by Sam Hollander and Martin Johnson, the guys behind Karmin's "Acapella".
I think Daughtry got it wrong. This song shouldn't be part of their new studio album, they should've offered it to Warner Bros. Pictures to include it on the soundtrack of the next "Superman" movie. I mean, all these references...! ("Superman", "washing his cape", "Lois Lane", and "Metropolis"). It's not a bad song, though!. It's good, but it doesn't sound "2013" to me, if you know what I mean. "Waiting for Superman", unlike Daughtry's 2011 first single, "Renegade", has a clear radio-friendliness appeal, and pop edge. The Daughtry fellas know they need a hit to get back in the charts' good graces. (2011's "Break The Spell" album didn't sell that well, and none of the four released singles cracked the Top 40 on Billboard's Hot 100). And "Waiting for Superman" might be the song they need. It will get a few 'spins' outside the 'rock' radio formats, for sure, and that's key.
"Waiting for Superman" is a rock song whose lyrics speak of a girl, who feels alone, and who's been 'locked up in her apartment', waiting for that prince charming, aka. her superman, to come and the two fall in love, and have a happy ever after.

Belgian anatomist
1514–1564
Andreas Vesalius was the founder of modern human anatomy. Before his time, medical illustrations served more to decorate a page than to teach human structure. Humans were often shown in squatty froglike postures with only crude representations of the locations and relationships of the internal organs. Often the figures were surrounded by signs of the zodiac, as astrologers thought each constellation influenced a particular body organ. Medical professors taught from an elevated chair, the cathedra, reading dryly in Latin from such ancient authorities as Roman physician Galen, while a low-ranking barber-surgeon removed organs from a rotting corpse and held them up for the medical students to see. Neither embalming nor cadaver refrigeration were yet known to Western medicine, and the professors considered it beneath their dignity to touch the foul cadaver.
Vesalius revolutionized the teaching of medicine. A native of Brussels, educated at Paris and Padua, he taught medicine at the University of Padua in Italy. Vesalius broke with tradition and personally dissected cadavers with his students. He soon learned that the anatomy described by Galen was highly inaccurate, and he commissioned artists from the studio of Italian painter Titian to render more accurate illustrations. When other anatomists began plagiarizing these illustrations, Vesalius had them published in a seven-volume work, De Humani Corporis Fabrica (On the Structure of the Human Body), in 1543. This was the first accurate atlas of human structure, and ushered in the era of modern human anatomy.
After the publication of the Fabrica, Vesalius enjoyed an illustrious career as a physician to, among others, Charles V, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and his son, Philip II. In 1564, Vesalius died in a shipwreck on the way home from a voyage to the Holy Land.
Twenty-first-century anatomical atlases, such as Frank Netter's Atlas of Human Anatomy, Carmine Clemente's Anatomy, and Anne Agur's Grant's Atlas of Anatomy , and even the standard college textbooks of human anatomy owe a great debt to the tradition begun by Vesalius.

The Dortmund boss was sent to the stands during his side's 2-1 loss at Napoli, and he will need to assume a similar position when Marseilles visit Signal Iduna Park next Tuesday. The 46-year-old launched an irate tirade at the fourth official after Dortmund defender Neven Subotic was refused permission to return to the pitch.
Klopp later apologized for his behavior by saying: "I made myself look like a monkey out there and that's not on. I overstepped the mark, and it was really pathetic of me."
UEFA has confirmed that it will meet again on Oct. 2 to discuss whether to increase the ban or hand Klopp a fine.Chat Rooms

Great episode, and a damn good review of it. Chuck's demonstrated once again that, for all that his reputation is built around ripping crap episodes apart, he's at his best when having a good look at the concepts surrounding a good one.

The jokes don't really work when they're not jokes but what the characters are actually doing. That and given just how good this episode is, also my favorite Voyager one, I'm fine with him spending more time discussing the themes than cracking obvious jokes.

Follow us on LinkedIn – A part of the automated assembly line at factory floors, packaging machines are the final step in the manufacturing process. Growth in the packaging machinery industry is primarily influenced by global trade in and domestic consumption of packaged goods and changing safety and environmental legislations on packaging. End-use customer clusters are increasingly shifting to sophisticated, faster, integrated and standardized equipment in a bid to decrease packaging waste and comply with environmental standards. The food industry is forecast to remain the most important market for packaging machinery. Demand for pharmaceutical packaging machinery is expected to witness strong growth supported by the increase in new drug development and drug manufacturing activity. Shorter innovation cycles and heightened competition in most industry verticals will encourage investments in innovative packaging technologies, concepts, and machinery.
Value-added packaging is the most important trend driving demand for new and efficient packaging machinery. Integrated system solutions are increasingly becoming customary because of stringent customer specifications, concerns for enhanced product quality, and mounting issues of equipment standardization. Customer preferences are shifting away from stand-alone machinery to integrated packaging equipment solutions. Other technology trends shaping market growth include increasing deployment of servos, networking architectures and robotic applications in packaging machinery. Aseptic packaging machinery and flexible packaging machinery represent two of the strongest growing product markets spearheading overall sales. The manufacturing industry’s shift from rigid packaging to flexible packaging is helping spur growth in the flexible packaging machinery market. The growing importance of high-end graphics on packaging, ease of use and dispensing of the product, lightweight, and strong barrier properties represent factors driving adoption of flexible packaging. Pharmaceutical and food packaging are major end-users of flexible packaging machinery.
The ability to meet sterile packaging needs of the pharmaceutical industry and offer cost benefits in distribution and storage of food products and beverages is driving growth in the aseptic packaging machinery market.
As stated by the new market research report on Packaging Machinery, Asia-Pacific represents the largest and the fastest growing regional market worldwide with a CAGR of 8.4% over the analysis period.

On Saturday, I had a BBQ to go to and nothing to bring. I had a bunch of bananas, a few ripe peaches, yogurt, and what I had in my cupboard. Thus, was born this easy but delicious parfait. As long as the ingredients are good, you can’t go wrong!
- 3-4 bananas, sliced
- 2 peaches, sliced
- 3 cups plain yogurt
- 1 cup non-fat tart frozen yogurt
- 4-5 graham crackers, crushed
- 1/2 cup oats
- 1/4 cup chopped walnuts
- 1 tbsp peanut butter, melted
- approx. 3 tbsp dark chocolate, melted
- 1/2 tbsp cinnamon
- 3 tbsp brown sugar
Directions
1. Pick your bowl or dish and layer your way up to the top. Start with the cup of frozen yogurt, as it acts as a nice base. I used a kind from Trader Joe's, microwaving it a little in the bottom of the bowl to get it to spread out evenly.
2. Then, layer the ingredients on top of the frozen yogurt: banana slices, peach slices, brown sugar, yogurt, graham cracker crumbs, repeating until you reach the top of the bowl.
3. Then top it off with the walnuts, oats, drizzled chocolate, peanut butter, and cinnamon. Chill for about an hour, finish with a dollop of yogurt or whipped cream, and serve!Forms are code and user interface templates that Outlook uses to display data stored in individual Outlook items. Every item that you open in Outlook uses a form to display information.
The forms designer is built into all versions of Outlook. You can launch a design session with the Tools | Forms | Design a Form command. Alternatively, open any Outlook item in Outlook 2003 or earlier and choose Tools | Forms | Design This Form.
In Outlook 2007, to design a form derived from an open item or to publish any form, you must first turn on the display of developer commands, and then look on the Developer tab in the ribbon for the Design This Form command: Choose Tools | Options, switch to the Other tab, click Advanced Options, and then select the Show Developer tab in the Ribbon check box.
Every form is based on existing form. The closest thing to a blank form is the post form.
Forms can have VBScript code behind them to react to user actions -- validating data, synchronizing it with databases, creating new Outlook items, etc. To add code, once you're in form design mode, click the View Code command on the toolbar or ribbon.
In an Exchange Server environment, custom forms are typically stored in the Organization Forms library, so that everyone has access to them. They can also be published directly to a folder. Personal forms are published either to a folder or to your Personal Forms library. Only published forms can run code.
My book, Microsoft Outlook Programming: Jumpstart for Administrators, Developers, and Power includes detailed chapters on creating custom Outlook forms.
These references also provide an introduction to the forms creation process:
Code behind Outlook forms uses VBScript, a slim, portable version of the Visual Basic programming language.
To add or modify code, open the form in design mode and then click the View Code command on the toolbar or ribbon. You can use the Script | Event Handler command to add an item-level event handler procedure shell to the code window. See Syntax for Microsoft Outlook property and control values and events for details on the key events that fire when the user interacts with the data controls on the form.
Code runs only on properly published custom forms, not on .oft form templates or one-off forms. See Microsoft Outlook Forms Security Issues for information on other specific scenarios that can result in code not running.
Forms with code behind them do not normally show any content in the reading pane. Instead, the user must open the item to see the content. This behavior is controlled by a hidden MAPI property. For a code example that shows how to add the property and set its value using CDO 1.21, see Active content in preview pane - solved. Redemption could also be used, instead of CDO. We haven't tried the technique with the PropertyAccessor object in Outlook 2007.
Set the icons for a custom form on the (Properties) page. Icons need to be 32x32, 16-color files. For the small icon, the image should be in the upper-left corner.
To delete a published form, you can use the Forms Manager. Choose Tools | Options | Other | Advanced Options | Custom Forms | Manage Forms. For code solutions, see:
To get a list of all the published forms in a folder, see:
In .NET, you can embed your Windows Forms into Outlook 2013 - 2000 windows using the Advanced form and view regions feature provided by Add-in Express. For more informations, see:
Newsgroup on the msnews.microsoft.com server, also available via web interface
Installs an Outlook form into multiple folders.
To open a published form in design mode without the form's VBScript running, hold down the Shift key as the form opens.
If you delete a published custom form accidentally, you may be able to recover it from the forms cache. Follow the instructions in the MSKB article Restoring an Outlook form from a cached copy, only open the saved .oft file by using the Tools | Forms | Choose Form or Design a Form command, rather than double-clicking the .oft file.
Examining existing forms is one of the best ways to find out what you can do with Outlook forms. Many sample Outlook forms are available at these sites:Find some hookers Near You On-line!

This is what Apple needs to do to stay relevant. Their strength has always been exploiting untapped markets, their weakness has always been remaining relevant afterwards. If they can popularize smartwatches they can avert attention from their lackluster smartphones.

You sound like some zealous, religious headcase when you say stuff like that. Apple will only be relevant as long as it remains innovative. To assume that it will always remain innovative forever is to be either naive or arrogant.

Innovation means much more than mere invention. Just because the modern automobile was invented over a century ago doesn't mean great innovations in the automotive sector aren't taking place even now.

Is it time to call Mark Walberg one of the best actors today. He always has quality performances. He truly is a bad ass. (Did prison time) Micky Ward is a legend where he came from. His family holding him back reminds me of many modern professional athletes of today. They come from a poor family or even well off, and their relatives & “friends” want a peice of the pie. If they see their meal ticket moving up, they will do anything to hold them back if they dont get to ride along. Luckily Micky Ward made it. Another way to describe it, is when a kid comes from a family with no educational background, and instead of support they are mocked for thinking they are “better than” “smarter” or even “acting white” for improving their lot in life. Sometimes the best movies are the ones you cant bare to watch again. For me that would include Schlinder’s List. It was a one of the best movies in the past 30 years, but I could never watch it again.December 2010 Articles & Features

Editor's Report
By John Lypen | December 2010
While a study assesses the impact of government intervention into the finances of GM and Chrysler, one thing is clear: The economic crisis we’re now emerging from will have a lasting effect on our industry.
It’s probably no small coincidence that results of a study lauding the federal government’s bailout of GM and Chrysler were released just a day before GM’s scheduled return to the stock market. The bottom line, according to the Center for Automotive Research (CAR), an Ann Arbor, MI-based nonprofit research organization (which, it should be pointed out, receives about one-third of its funding from the federal government), is that the government assistance provided to General Motors and Chrysler during the last two years enabled orderly bankruptcy proceedings and led to the saving of more than 1.14 million jobs in 2009 alone.
The CAR report, which can be found in its entirety at, acknowledges that while there was general agreement the failure of GM and Chrysler two years ago would harm the U.S. economy, there was also vigorous debate on the magnitude of the potential employment and economic impacts, the size of the government response and the precedent that would be set by government action.
A little over two years ago, CAR produced its first estimate of job loss and financial impact related to the 2008 economic crisis. At the time, estimates were created for a scenario involving a short-term, severe (50% to 100%) contraction of Detroit Three capacity in the United States. The job loss estimates ranged from 2.5 to 3 million in the first year and 1.5 to 2.5 million in the second year, while estimates of personal income loss ranged from $125.1 to $150.7 billion in the first year and $86.4 to $138.2 billion in the second year. The net impact to government, in terms of increased transfer payments, reduced social security receipts and reduced personal income taxes paid, ranged from $49.9 to $60.1 billion in the first year and $33.7 to $54.3 billion in the second year.
Seven months later, in May 2009, CAR produced estimates for two scenarios: a quick, orderly Section 363 bankruptcy (which is what eventually transpired) and a drawn-out, disorderly bankruptcy proceeding leading to liquidation of the automakers. The “good bankruptcy” outcome was projected to have avoided a loss of 1.54 million jobs between 2009 and 2010, while personal income losses were expected to be $81.8 billion less during the same time frame. It was also estimated that avoiding the worst-case scenario would have a net government impact of $32.2 billion.
Today, using actual economic performance for 2009 and 2010 year-to-date, CAR concludes that the $80 billion in U.S. aid to General Motors, Chrysler, GMAC and Chrysler Financial resulted in nearly 1.5 million jobs saved, prevented additional personal income losses totaling just under $97 billion and had a net impact to the federal government of greater than $28 billion between 2009 and 2010.
Whether or not you were a proponent of the federal government’s intervention, what’s done is done and there are early positive indications for the future of both GM and Chrysler. According to the CAR report, 53,000 workers have been added since the two automakers emerged from their bankruptcies in the summer of 2009. As well, market share for all of the Detroit Three has rebounded in the first three quarters of 2010.
Coming out of the Great Recession, an especially significant metric for the aftermarket service and repair industry is the length of time consumers are holding on to their wheels. While the average age of light vehicles on the road has been steadily rising for years, recent Polk data highlights an even more important statistic: Currently, those who purchased their vehicles new are holding on to them for an average of just under 64 months (just over 46 months for purchasers of used vehicles). Prior to the economic crisis, these numbers had been increasing by about 4% a year, but since then they’ve skyrocketed by nearly 15% a year—a number that certainly holds promise for increased selling opportunities in the aftermarket.Mopar HEMI NAG1 Transmission
If the transmission in your Dodge Challenger, Charger, Magnum, or Chrysler 300c has seen better days replacing it with an OEM unit from Mopar is a good option. These HEMI transmissions are built by Dodge / Chrysler to ensure that they comply with all of the original specifications. A stock transmission replacement and torque converter are included in this package. No core charge. After installing a new Mopar transmission your vehicle will shift like new.
Those who have a broken transmission due to aggressive driving or because of the power their highly modified motor should get a performance transmission from Arrington's NAG1 Transmission Solutions line.
The NAGI automatic transmission (NAG1 Automatic Transmission) is an electrically controlled 5-speed transmission with a lock-up clutch in the torque converter. The ratios for the gear stages are obtained by 3 planetary gear sets. Fifth gear is designed as an overdrive with a high-speed ratio.
NAG 1 identifies a family of transmissions and means "N"ew “A”utomatic “G”earbox, generation 1. Various marketing names are associated with the NAG I family of transmissions, depending on the transmission variation being used in a specific vehicle. Some examples of the marketing names are: W5A300, W5A380, and W5A580. The marketing name can be interpreted as follows:
- W = A transmission using a hydraulic torque converter
- 5 = 5 forward gears
- A = Automatic Transmission
- 580 = Maximum input torque capacity in Newton Meters vehicles and engines.
Basically the automatic transmission with electric control offers the following advantages:
- Reduces fuel Consumption
- Improved shift comfort
- More favorable step-up through the five gears
- Increased service life and durability
- Lower maintenance costs.Transmission Gear Ratios
The gear ratios for the NAG I automatic transmission are as follows:
- 1st Gear - 3.59:1
- 2nd Gear - 2.19:1
- 3rd Gear - 1.41:1
- 4th Gear - 1.00:1
- 5th gear - 0 .83:1
- Reverse - 3.16:1
The converter housing and transmission are made from a light alloy. These are hooked together and centered via the outer multi-disc carrier of multi-disc holding clutch, B1. A coated intermediate plate provides the sealing. The oil pump and the outer multi-disc carrier of the multi-disc holding clutch, B1, are bolted to the converter housing. The stator shaft is pressed into it and prevented from rotating by splines. The electrohydraulic unit is bolted to the transmission housing from underneath. A sheet metal steel oil pan forms the closure.Mechanical Section
The mechanical section consists of an input shaft, an output shaft, a sun gear shaft, and three planetary gear sets which are coupled to each other. The planetary gear sets each have four planetary pinion gears. The oil pressure for the torque converter lock -up clutch and clutch K2 is supplied through bores in the input shaft. The oil pressure to clutch K3 is transmitted through the output shaft. The lubricating oil is distributed through additional bores in both shafts. All the bearing points of the gear sets, as well as the freewheeling clutches and actuators, are supplied with lubricating oil. The parking lock gear is connected to the output shaft via splines.
Freewheeling clutches F1 and F2 are used to optimize the shifts. The front freewheel, F1, is supported on the extension of the stator shaft on the transmission side and, in the locking direction, connects the sun gear of the front planetary gear set to the transmission housing. In the locking direction, the rear freewheeling clutch, F2, connects the sun gear of the center planetary gear set to the sun gear of the rear planetary gear set.Electrohydraulic Control Unit
The electrohydraulic control unit comprises the shift plate made from light alloy for the hydraulic control and an electrical control unit. The electrical control unit comprises of a supporting body made of plastics into which the electrical components are assembled..Shift Groups
The hydraulic control components (including actuators) which are responsible for the pressure distribution before, during, and after a gear change are described as a shift group. Each shift group contains a command valve, a holding pressure shift valve, a shift pressure shift valve, overlap regulating valve, and a solenoid.
The hydraulic system contains three shift groups: 1-2/4-5, 2-3, and 3-4. Each shift group can also be described as being in one of two possible states. The active shift group is described as king in the shift phase when it is actively engaging / disengaging a clutch combination. The 1-2/4 -5 shift group controls the BI and KI clutches. The 2-3 shift group controls the K2 and K3 clutches. The 3-4 shift group controls the K3 and B2 clutches.NAG1 Stock Transmission Section Diagram

Is it really necessary to book in advance?
In our opinion its definitely better to pre-book your airport parking. And youre likely to agree once you find out the difference in price. If you spend a minute or two now booking in advance you can get parking for as cheap as £32.95 for eight days. However, if you choose to wait and pay on the gate, you could end up parting with over £72. Just think, that extra £40 might have bought you an additional meal out on holiday!
Can I cancel my booking if my plans change?
We understand that occasionally this can happen thats why we offer cancellation protection when you book. It only costs 99p which buys you the certainty that you wont have wasted money on parking if for any reason you cant go on holiday. The only exception is with certain super saver parking deals but you will be informed of these terms when you book.
How many car parks are there at Newcastle airport?
You have the choice of three. Newcastle on-airport car park is within the airport perimeter, as is Newcastle International Meet and Greet which also comes complete with a chauffeur service. The off-airport facility is Airparks Newcastle Bellair. However, this car park provides two further options: Airparks Newcastle Bellair Covered Parking and Airparks Newcastle Bellair Return Greet to get rid of every last inconvenience.
Whats the difference between on and off-airport parking at Newcastle?
Theyre actually more similar than youd imagine given that the off-airport facility, Airparks Newcastle Bellair, is outside the airport perimeter whereas the two on-airport car parks are within it. You might imagine it would take a lot longer to travel from the off-airport car park, but in fact it only takes four minutes as it is only 1.1 miles away. However, off-airport parking is still generally slightly cheaper.
What does secured parking mean?
It means that your car is being protected by CCTV, high fencing, 24 hour security guard presence, barriers, floodlighting and regular patrols. Indeed, all the Newcastle car parks have Park Marks® which is a national security award to say that it is regularly inspected by the police.
A Lovely retro flavour
Took me back a few years - reminded me of G-Force - Battle of the Planets in its style. Two criticisms 1. Sound - couldn't make out half the dialogue - 2. Narrators script needs a lot more work - apart from that - loved it.
Rated 3.5 / 5 stars
Good But Sound Needs Changed
You can tell that you have put a lot of time in on the graphics and the actual storyline. But another thing that you can tell is that you must have not had much time to do sound. Right away i could tell that the music was overpowering the character's voices. And even when you could hear the characters, the mumbled and you couldn't tell what they were saying. But overall I do like this submission. Good Job.
Rated 4 / 5 stars
Good Submission
The actual work that was put into this is automaticly seen. Althougth the actual story syle is not my thing i was able to watch atleast half. it may not figt with everyone. Sound quality HAS to be improved. It was good but mubbleling whne their talking and talking when theyre screaming. Thats one of the only downhills to it. Fix the sound and im sure youll please alot of robot fans.

Enjoying the game. Congrats to you and your team!
One minor nit: having links to external pages immediately below the game viewport is problematic when you accidentally click one of those links instead of clicking within the window. Instead of shooting the desired foe, a new tab opens, but you can still hear your poor character “oh!”-ing in pain :-)
So, how long till I start receiving email from my company like this? “Our records indicate that you need to complete your online ethics training. If you do this by Friday, you’ll receive 500G in Realm of the Mad God.”

LOL
David,
This is a great write up! I have really enjoyed this game for the last 8 months, and I think it has a lot of potential. I’m confused about your use of the “long-tail” here, as some recent changes seem to be driving many of the other players away. Is this an official direction? Is there some “sweet spot” in the range of players you’re trying to reach? (I have many suggestions around metrics you could/should be using. At least poll people who are purchasing gold about “why”.)
Anyway, you have my best wishes for the future!
I have an Android phone and would love to play this game on it!
I love this game, but earning fame is extremely hard…..
My first thoughts : A game, level cap of 20, you lose everything once you die, and you unlock a few classes as you go…. I won’t play this S#%@ for more than 5 minutes.
What really happened : I was up from 9pm-4am playing on the night I discovered this game, and have been madly addicted to it since then. :)
Love it! And on top of it all, I loved reading about your business approach to this type of game. I never would have thought of it that way, but it instilled a bit of a lesson into my mind, should I ever decide to take up video game development. Absolutely brilliant and I truly hope your game thrives! It already appears to be growing massively with the release on the Steam platform + Kongregate. Great work dev team! I know I’ll be pumping at least a few bucks into your coin currency system within the near future. ;)
Thanks for curing my countless hours of boredom!(A.A. degree)

Amazon is pretty successful organization. Amazon team is able to innovate persistently and launch successful products to marketplace. Over a period of time Amazon has rejuvenated itself, it started journey as online book seller. Amazon started adding new products and services to their online store i.e. toys, clothes, shoes, furniture etc. By now Amazon is considered biggest online store on planet earth. Amazon has done lot of innovation in retail space. The Amazon team honed its infrastructure skills over period of time to achieve the scale it needs. In last few years Amazon decided to leverage its IT infrastructure scale advantage and offer IT infrastructure as a service for its customers i.e. storage services on cloud based platform as a service. By now Amazon is one of the major cloud based service providers. Amazon is considered to have cool work culture, in many journals you may find reference of Amazon’s “Just-Do-It” style culture. Many small and large organizations are using Amazon’s cloud based product and services. The organizations like Dropbox, Reddit, Pinterest, AirBnB, Netflix etc. are leveraging Amazon cloud products for running their businesses. The Cloud platform is mission critical to Amazon’s customers.
In recent past we have seen major outages at Amazon cloud based platform Amazon had major outage on Dec/24/2012, Oct/2012, Jun/2012. It seems now Amazon cloud outages pretty much as major quarterly event! The Amazon cloud snafus are causing major business disruptions to its customers i.e. over Christmas Eve many customers were unable to enjoy Netflix streaming services, Oct/2012 outage impacted organizations like Pinterest, AirBnB etc. We wonder an organization that is extremely successful in provided great products and services in retail space is failing (or struggling) in Cloud space. What are the potential reasons of outages, how to mitigate outages. I did analysis of the major Amazon Cloud incident considering root cause analysis published by Amazon, public opinions and customer commentary.
As per my analysis, I see process flaws (cloud operations) as constant theme in majority of cloud outages at Amazon. Software (probably SDLC) related issues are also observed as contributing factors. I look forward to hear your thoughts.

The frame rate of video determines what its speed will be when it is played back. Normal play back speed is usually 30 frames per second. Some video formats and film play back at 24 frames per second. If the video was recorded at a frame rate different from the play back rate then your video will either have a high speed or slow motion effect. This effect is traditionally achieved in camera. Unfortunately, not every camera out there allows you to change the frame rate and the ones that do are usually expensive. But in reality anyone with a decent editing program can pull off this effect.
High Speed
High speed is achieved in camera by slowing down the frame rate when recording. If you were to record an action that's ten seconds long at 15 FPS then it will play back in high speed for five seconds. You can create the same effect in your editing program.
Most programs have an option to change the speed of a clip. When you change the clip's duration to a length shorter than its normal running length the program compensates by removing frames. So if you took a ten second clip and changed the duration to five seconds the program will remove every other frame. It will create 15 frames / second video.
However, doing this will eat up more hard drive space than the in camera effect would. You need to store the ten second video plus a preview 5 second video that needs to be rendered for smooth play back. Thus, you have fifteen seconds of video stored for a five second clip. But it's still cheaper to do it this way.
Slow Motion
High speed can be achieved in editing instead of in camera without a sacrifice to quality, but slow motion is different. Slow motion created in camera looks a lot better than slow motion created on the computer. When slow motion is done in camera it records the video at a frame rate that's faster than play back speed so that when it is played back it appears slow. For example, ten seconds recorded at 60 fps will take twenty seconds to play back at 30fps.
When you create this effect in an editing program the computer duplicates and adds frames to the clip to make it seem longer. If you were to make your ten second clip become twenty seconds then each frame would be duplicated. You would essentially have play back of 15 frames a second instead of 30.
But if the effect was done in camera then you would have an individual unique frame for the entire slow motion sequence. Slow motion achieved in camera is superior in quality to slow motion achieved in editing..
It was impressive, if hit and miss. And then, we discovered the Tiffany of thrift, the Cartier of costume: For Love 21 in the Glendale Galleria, the jewelry-only branch of the Forever 21 chain. There are 16 stores nationwide, with eight more slated to open this year.
In Glendale, For Love 21 is dressed up like a posh Parisian apartment, complete with crown molding and Regency-style fixtures. Shoppers are handed silver trays lined with black velvet instead of those tacky plastic shopping baskets. The place is bubbling over with enough bangles and baubles to disorient even the most seasoned shopper and get a tween salivating as if she's just been let into Willy Wonka's candy room.
The plan of attack was simple: Comb the perimeter and then loop through the middle, left to right from front to back. There was a surprise at the bottom of many a picked-through pile, some chic, some just plain cheap.
The trendy pieces such as a charm necklace with the predictable cluster of horn, crystal and bird hanging from it are trite and childish. Same with the bright plastic bracelets and wooden bead necklaces.
But we do approve of the blue-striped, fabric-covered beads (very Lanvin). And the stacked, "jewel"-studded bangles, cheap enough to buy by the dozen. And of course, there was that strawberry — completely irresistible, if you don't mind stones that don't shine like diamonds and a little glue seeping out from behind a seed or two. There's enough stock and styles in this store to satisfy women from 8 to 87. Just make sure the cheap prices don't coax you into a buying frenzy where you end up looking like the store swallowed you up and spit you out. Remain selective and remember it's about quality, not quantity. Or in this case, quality and quantity just enough for one season.

President Obama "expects" that the situation preventing military spouses from receiving death benefits during the government shutdown will be resolved on Wednesday.
"The president was very disturbed to learn of this problem and he directed the Department of Defense to work with the Office of Management and Budget and his lawyers to develop a possible solution," White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. "The president expects this to be fixed today."
Carney said the Defense Department had notified Congress before the shutdown that military death benefits would be among the programs that would be put on hold in the event of a shutdown, but that it didn't make it into the Pay Our Military Act, the stopgap bill to pay military salaries that Obama signed into law last week. It's "unthinkable that these benefits would not be available" to the families of members of the military, Carney said, and once the president learned of the lapse, he asked his administration to try to fix it.
The House plans to vote Wednesday afternoon on a bill to fund military death benefits.

OK this is how we all check it out stick out your tongue and touch the HS watch out for the fans cause they hurt.
No really it does sound like a bad probe. you can always adjust the temp within MBM, or try replacing the probe call up ABIT. and just as a precaution you DID plug in the fans on the HS right. touch it just be carefull you should be able to without hurting your self
------------------
Can some one stop those voices in my head telling me to Overclock my computer!!!
whatever
Pull your CPU out and put it in again.
? Quantum Physics ? Light travels faster than sound. This is why some people appear bright until you hear them speak.
Tried reseating the cpu, no dice. The aux temp prob in the case is a steady 23C-24C but the cpu is still showing 85-88C...
One other thing, the -5V is showing -5.5 which sets the default alarm off... the case and PS are brand new...
I had the same problem on my bf6 with MBM. It said my temps were at aroun 60C with a watercooled peltier, I could touch the back of the processor through 2 layers of insulation and it would be cold. So I knew it wasn't right. All I did was switch the probe type (in the software) to p2 thermal diode. If you can, see if that works.
------------------
If it ain't broke, break it!
Woohoo, 14th person to solve the 4D rubik's cube...ever!
Watch me solve a regular cube in 24.2 seconds at videolist, Daniel Hayes!
My BF6 was reporting an incorrect temp on my PII 350. It wasn't as bad as that though, but it seems to give the correct temp reading with my new coppermine 700.
Have a look at:-
They had a report about missing diodes on certian Abit mobos because the Windbond software was reporting incorrect temps.
Also that HW Doctor is rubbish compared to "Motherboard Monitor" you can do just about everything with this programe except make toast!!. It has a "Compensation" tab for giving you a correct reading)

(Excerpt from a message to Jim at benchtest)
"I linked to your site from a message on Hardware Central and I'm sure this is what is up with my Abit BF6 boards temp readings. After replacing my old TMC board with the Abit I have seen Bios reported CPU temp go from 38C max with the TMC to 55C Max with the Abit without any other changes to the system at all. I'd appreciate your views on this if you've got a moment.
One last thing what do you think of the Winbond Hardware Doctor 2 monitor software(supplied with the BF6)?. It supplies all the information you need in a clear a logical way but it is so "User Unfriendly!" Firstly I can't make it appear in the task bar minimised on boot up, If I put it in the start up folder it opens on boot up, annoying!!. Even worse there is no minimise button so you click the close to minimise it to the task bar, but you can't Left click the icon to restore it, the program crashes. So you have to Right click it and then select restore!! WHY? when everything else is Left click! Extremely annoying"

Stocks’ winning streaks continue
U.S. stocks rose slightly Friday on another low-volume, low-volatility trading day, extending their summer winning streak after economic data showed a rise in consumer sentiment in August.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 25.09 points, or 0.2 percent, at 13,275.20, to finish the week up 0.5 percent for its sixth consecutive week of gains.
United Technologies Corp., Travelers Cos. and Caterpillar Inc. led gainers on the Dow.
The S&P 500 index advanced 2.65 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 1,418.16, finishing the week up 0.9 percent. Like the Dow, it’s the S&P 500’s sixth week of gains in a row, the longest weekly winning streak since January 2011.
The Nasdaq composite index finished up 14.20 points, or 0.5 percent, at 3,076.59, for a 1.8 percent weekly gain, its fifth week in a row of gains.
On Friday, the University of Michigan-Thomson Reuters consumer-sentiment index rose to a preliminary August reading of 73.6 from a final July reading of 72.3, while economists polled by MarketWatch expected the index to decline.

The brothers have been invited to take the field at halftime to be recognized for their dedication to raising research funds and awareness for cerebral palsy.
Braden, a 7-year-old from Temperance, was born with the condition which impacts his muscle tone, reflexes and motor coordination.
His older brother Hunter, a 14-year-old wrestler at Bedford Junior High School, carried him 40 miles from their hometown gym in Temperance to the University of Michigan in June to raise awareness about the disorder.
The walk, which the Gandee brothers called “The Cerebral Palsy Swagger,” raised at least $8,000 for the U-M Cerebral Palsy Research fund.

Since the walk, they have thrown out first pitches at a Detroit Tigers and a Toledo Mud Hens game. They have made appearances at the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan International Speedway, and the television taping of RAW in Cleveland.
They have also begun to raise money for a handicap accessible playground at Braden's school, Douglas Road Elementary School.
Saturday's football game will start at noon as U-M hosts the Appalachian State Mountaineers.

Guest post by Rieva Lesonsky The small business marketing world is abuzz over the power of online rating and review sites like Yelp and social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to spread the word about your business. But one of the smartest word-of-mouth tactics you can use to get new customers has nothing to do with social media, technology or ratings—it’s simply getting referrals from your existing customers. Using referrals is a great way for small business owners to tap into the network of their customers’ business colleagues, friends and family. But many entrepreneurs are shy about asking for referrals or simply don’t think of doing so. That’s a big mistake, because referral marketing is a low-cost (or even no-cost) way to get highly qualified leads. Here’s how to start a referral marketing program in your business.
1. Know what type of referral you’re looking for.
There are different levels of referrals. On the most basic level, you might ask a client to give you the name and email address or phone number of someone who might be interested in doing business with you. This is a fairly low-value referral. On the mid-range level might be a customer who discusses your business with the potential referral and can attest that he or she is interested in learning more. Finally, the highest level and most valuable referral would be a customer who actually introduces you to the referral or arranges a meeting between the two (or three) of you. Depending on your industry, you might seek one or all of these levels. the client for completing the job, or do it later as part of your post-sale follow-up. Create reminders within your Infusionsoft system.
3. Time it right.
Figure out the optimum time to request a referral and make it part of your sales and customer service process. It’s important to ask for a referral when the customer is feeling positive about your company. If you unwittingly ask a frustrated or angry customer for a referral, your efforts can backfire—so make sure the time is right.
4. Offer rewards.
Discounts on your products and services are a great reward for customers who refer others to you. You could provide a reward simply for giving a referral, such as a 15 percent discount off the next purchase for providing a few names and emails, or make it contingent on the referral actually purchasing (a free month’s worth of services if you refer someone who becomes a customer).
5. Follow up in a timely fashion.
The biggest mistake small business owners make with referrals (besides not asking for them) is getting them and then not following up. Build a timeline into your system so that you follow up within two weeks of getting the referral. Otherwise, the prospect could forget about you, could buy what you sell somewhere else or could simply turn from a hot lead into a cold case. Check out Infusionsoft to help you organize and follow up with referrals. Your small business will appreciate it!.Tennessee Fry Bread Recipe

For the first time, mentally ill patients will get rebates for group therapy sessions run by social workers, occupational therapists and psychologists in a major expansion of Medicare aimed at solving Australia's mental health crisis, The Age believes.
Rebates for visits to psychologists had already been announced in April as part of the Government's $1.9 billion mental health package.
But the new rebates to be officially announced next week go much further than expected. Under the proposed rebates, outlined in a draft Medicare schedule, patients will be reimbursed for one-on-one or group sessions with psychologists, social workers or occupational therapists when they have a referral from a GP or psychiatrist.
The Age has also been told by industry sources that rebates for sessions with psychologists, social workers and OTs will be significantly less than the rebate of about $110 that will be available for services with clinical psychologists. Australian Medical Association president Mukesh Haikerwal said he was surprised that the Government had actually "come through" with the new items for group therapy, which were "a very good thing".
Mental Health Council of Australia chief executive John Mendoza said the "innovative" new Medicare items would ensure mental health care was "affordable and accessible and not limited to well-to-do areas". Simply introducing rebates for visits to the psychologist, would have made little different to poor people and those in rural areas, he said.
According to the draft schedule, patients will be able to get up to 12 one-on-one sessions with social workers, OTs and psychologists in a year, or the same number of group therapy sessions as part of a group of between six and 10 patients. The new Medicare rebates are expected to make up the bulk of the Government's $1.9 billion, five-year mental health package, which will also include new respite care and training for the mental health workforce.

There Is A Purpose
It is important to know that there is a purpose for everyone you meet and everything you experience in your life.
Some people will help you and others may test you. Sometimes those are the people who are not so nice. Still, we learn from negative experiences with others as well as the positive experiences.
If you happen to have a negative experience with someone, just remember that this negative person is struggling to become a quality person. They probably are having a hard time learning to interact in a healthy, positive way with others. Many people struggle with this for a long time before learning how to be positive.
All interactions with people will teach you something new. The most important people that you encounter are the ones who bring out the best in you, respect you and accept you for who you are. Those are the ones worth keeping around.Sutter Home Holidays: Give the Gift of Wine!

Cesar Chavez Day Today
Today has been deemed “Cesar Chavez Day” by President Obama in his Presidential Proclamation stating the birthday of this American farm worker, labor leader and civil rights activist as a day that should be marked with service, community and educational programs to honor his legacy.
One of six children, Chavez was born in 1927 to a Mexican-American family in Yuma, Arizona. After his father lost their adobe house, the family moved to California and became migrant farmers. Upon finishing eighth grade, he took to the fields full time so his mother would not have to. Harvesting everything from peas in the winter and cotton in the fall, Chavez faced hardship as a farm worker early on. Hazardous working conditions, dangerous pesticides, unclean drinking water and other necessities denied, Chavez felt the call to social justice.
Through the studies of his heroes, St. Francis of Assisi, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., boycotts and fasts, Chavez became a lifelong advocate for justice, founding the United Farm Workers (UFW) with Dolores Huerta in 1962.
Obama states, “Cesar Chavez’s legacy provides lessons from which all Americans can learn. One person can change the course of a nation and improve the lives of countless individuals. Cesar once said, ‘Non, ‘Sí, se puede’ – ‘Yes, we can.'”
On Friday, Apr. 1, at the Regal Cinemas at L.A. Live in Los Angeles, a screening of the documentary called “Cesar’s Last Fast” will show never seen before footage, telling the story of the 36-day water-only fast by one of America’s most inspiring Latino leaders.
The Catholic News Service features this prayer attributed to Chavez,.Find a Home

Aiken Bluegrass Festival, Aiken, SC- 5/11
The 10th installment of the Aiken Bluegrass Festival took place this past weekend in Aiken, SC. Offering two days of music and camping this year, it was by far larger than any previous year. Friday offered some local talent along with the Hackensaw Boys and Larry Keel and Natural Bridge.
Music on Saturday kicked off around 2:30 with local bluegrass outfit Doug and the Henrys. Playing traditional tunes such as “Long Black Veil,” “Orange Blossom Special,” “Summertime,” “Ring of Fire” and even a rendition of “Tennessee Stud,” it was a great start to the day and a foreshadow of what was to come. Next up was an all-female newgrass troupe called Della Mae. Based out of Nashville, these ladies display excellent vocal harmonies and can pick with the best of them.
Larry Keel and Natural Bridge offered another performance on Saturday. Along with wife Jenny holding it down on the upright bass, the band is rounded out by banjo veteran Will Lee and the Appalachian-infused stylings of Mark Schimick on mandolin. Offering a well-mixed set with originals and covers, they were even joined by Keller Williams toward the end of their set for a take on the Grateful Dead’s “Ramble on Rose.”
Keller then played a solo set providing the crowd with some random covers such as Bon Jovi’s “Wanted Dead or Alive,” the Allman Brothers “Midnight Rider,” and “You Don’t Know How It Feels” by Tom Petty. Keller also added a good mix of originals like “Bounty Hunter,” “Hula Hoop to the Loop,” and “Super Hot Girl.” However, the highlight of the set was his Price-Is-Right opus “Bob Rules” which was sandwiched around an interesting rendition of Fiona Apple’s “Criminal.”
Shortly after his set, Keller returned to the stage with Larry and Jenny Keel opening with a twanged-up version of “Dupree’s Diamond Blues.” Following Keller and the Keels, the Travelin’ McCourys were up next and extended an invite to Larry Keel to pick with them throughout their whole set. Sticking with mostly staples and traditionals, they did offer up a bluegrass version of Bob Dylan’s “Walk Out in the Rain,” which was turned into a hit by Eric Clapton in the late ’70s.
There was still room for a bit more after the Travelin’ McCourys finished their set. Keller Williams then returned to the stage with the McCourys dishing out some tunes from their collaborative album Pick. They even busted out some rare covers with a grassed-up take on Donna Summer’s “Hot Stuff” and “Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked” by Cage the Elephant. At the end of their set, they paired up the original, bluegrass-legend tribute, “Bumper Sticker” and a cover of Foster the People’s “Pumped Up Kicks.”

Brewers prep Miller Park, new game entertainment for 2013
MILWAUKEE - Considering the weather, it may be hard to believe that Brewers baseball starts in a few days.
However, Brewers staff at Miller Park are preparing the stadium for exhibitions on Friday and Saturday against the Chicago White Sox, and the season opener against Colorado on Monday.
Click here to get comprehensive Brewers coverage on your "Extra Innings" app!
"This is one of the busiest times of the season for us. Our biggest day of the year ends up being Opening Day," explained Aleta Mercer, the vice president of entertainment and broadcasting.
She and her crew are behind the scoreboard, the music and the fun at Miller Park.
"We have a really good show, and we think we can do even better," she told TODAY'S TMJ4's Melissa McCrady.
The Brewers starting planning 2013's entertainment during the middle of the 2012 season, seeking suggestions from fans, players and staff.
They want the best ways to get the crowd up and out of their seats to cheer.
"We've got 40,000 fans who haven't seen baseball at home for the last six months, and that makes us want to bring out the big show and really make it shine."
In 2013, you can expect the old with the new.
The old: The Klement's Sausage Race.
The new: a sing-along contest and another interactive activity called Phrase Game, similar to Wheel of Fortune.
The fun is just days away.
"We're excited," Mercer said. "We're really excited."
On Thursday, March 28, TODAY'S TMJ4 is offering our viewers a preview of the 2013 Milwaukee Brewers, ahead of Opening Day.

"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,/But to be young was very heaven!" The words of Wordsworth do not fully fit, because with so much bloodshed, the stench of corpses, and skeletons, dead or alive, just discovered as Allied troops entered the concentration camps, there was hardly scope for pure joy. The reference to youth, in turn, is a warning that when one tries, half a century later, not just to reconstruct events but to revive a mood, the past may be prettified through nostalgia for one's adolescence. Yet dawn seems appropriate. We clearly did feel at the start of a new era. The very horror of the conflict may account for the revulsion and explain why the "Never more!" was even louder than in 1918. Millions of people across Europe were rejecting an old world capable of producing such pestilence. If today the fashion is to stress the end of history, at the time it was to talk of its new beginning.
This yearning for a different society prevailed throughout the Continent, including Eastern Europe, which I had miraculously left on the eve of the war and where German atrocities proved even more abominable than in the West. The neighbors of the Soviet Union were In such a mood even though the soldiers of the Red Army were being greeted there as liberators cum conquerors. The intellectual conception of revolution from above--the idea that Stalin's tanks, like Napoleon's armies, brought a more advanced social order--was still to come. The relatively high spirits right after the war rested on the rather optimistic assumption that Hungary and Poland, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia would be somehow allowed to follow their "own roads to socialism." Such hopes were soon to be dashed by the advent of the cold war and the closing of the "iron curtain." Today, it is common to describe the Red Army as an invader. Things were much more complex at the time. With the corruption, inefficiency and injustice of their prewar governments still fresh in their minds and their natural hatred for the Nazis, the new deal, though imposed by the Red Army, had originally a significant degree of support among both workers and intellectuals.
But it was in Western Europe that the quest for a new social order was most perceptible. The role played by the battle of Stalingrad in our imagination or the part performed by the Communists in the Resistance did not, by themselves, explain the big jump in the Communist vote in both France and Italy. To grasp the reason for that, or for the victory of the British Labor Party, in the first parliamentary poll after the conflict, which ousted the war hero Winston Churchill, it is necessary to recapture the climate of public opinion during the period, with its wholesale rejection of greed, exploitation and inequality. On the Continent, fighters emerging from the underground were preaching that property could no longer stand in the way of social justice and that money should no longer be allowed to dominate the press. In Britain, if my memory is correct, The Economist, the voice of the capitalist gospel, was advocating a zero rate of interest. How distant and strange it all sounds now, and how revealing about the unsuspected flexibility and resilience of capitalism.
Why was that system not pushed off the stage? Propagandists who now tell the story should, paradoxically, pay some tribute to the Soviet leader, then known not as a tyrant but as good old "Uncle Joe." The German surrender took place three months after the conference at Yalta, where the division of Europe was confirmed. The deal meant that within a few years Stalinism would extend to the Elbe. But it also guaranteed stability for the other half of Europe and Stalin stuck strictly to his side of the bargain: Greek Communists facing the British were left to their own devices, while the large Italian and French party battalions were ordered to consolidate their positions without threatening the established order.
Naturally, it was not Stalin alone. The real reason for the system's survival was the American presence in its dual capacity as a provider of force and as a force of attraction. The G.I.s were staying behind as insurance against the temptation for any Western partisans to follow in Tito's footsteps and seize power. But America, with its skyscrapers and its Ford cars, was also a mythical country. The way we eyed your cigarettes and chewing gum, your nylon stockings and Parker 51 pens, was a portent, foreshadowing Europe's rush toward an acquisitive consumer society.
What happened need not necessarily have happened, and it may be rather harsh to call us fools because we dreamt in that dawn of a different future. We may have been starry-eyed and rather naïve if we thought that somebody would build that society for us, that I t was enough to give a mandate or, even worse, a free hand to our new masters. Inevitably obsessed with Nazism, we may have been too one-track-minded. Thus absorbed by the little flags on the map showing the movement of armies, we may have failed to discern the social forces that would shape fate beyond the battlefield. Personally, I must confess that three months after the German surrender I completely missed the historical significance of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima. I just did not understand at the time the momentous step taken by humankind on the road toward potential suicide. I, probably, did not even see that the dropping of the bomb was already a move connected with the coming cold war. Indeed, the mood of 1945 is so difficult to assess accurately because it was a year of transition, with the people still inspired by the wartime alliance against Germany and the politicians already preparing for the new East-West confrontation.
We don't know yet what our past is going to be, says the wit, reminding us that history is rewritten to suit the current predicament. Since the collapse of the post-Stalinist empire, the victors are dictating the line. With texts strangely filtered from the Soviet archives, they are trying to invent a new tale of wartime Europe, in which those who helped the Anglo-Saxons are heroes and those who helped the Russians are fools or knaves. Nothing, except the insidious poison of propaganda, compels us to swallow such a distortion.
Indeed, on this anniversary occasion, I would be tempted to draw only two lessons. The first is that revolutions--meaning the radical transformation of society, not the seizure of the Winter Palace--cannot be carried out from above; if they are, they spell nothing good for the people. Or, to put it differently, they cannot be carried out by proxy. A deal at the top, like the one at Yalta, hampered the social movements on both sides of the great divide. Our rulers yield only to pressure from below and no genuine long-term progress can be conceived without the active participation of the people.
The second lesson concerns history. If it is ridiculous to proclaim its end today, it was childish for us to think we were starting almost from scratch; we underestimated the weight of the past, the power of inertia and the resistance of the mighty. True, there are moments when history quickens, and if you miss them you may have to wait a long time for the next opportunity. Yet it is in the intervals that you must prepare so as to be ready for the climax. The struggle is, or rather should be, permanent.
Recalling the Europe of half a century ago, bled white, half-starving, with its towns torn apart and Its factories blown to pieces, and setting it against our world with its computerized plants, its laser beams, its rockets to the moon and information highways, there is no denying the technological inventiveness of the human species. The more striking is the contrast with the lunacy of our social organization. Mass unemployment, the yawning gap between rich and poor, the explosive polarization, all show that, after a spell of progress, we are moving backward toward a dangerous past. Add to it wars spreading from Algeria to Chechnya and Tajikistan, "ethnic cleansing" from Europe to Africa, and the return of the earlier horror is no longer unthinkable. We have to wake up, and soon, if we don't want the millions who perished in the last world war, and who did so fighting fundamentally for a better world, to have died in vain.
Postscript. I wrote earlier that we in Europe may have been too one-track-minded. Let this anecdote plead our case.
It was the autumn of 1942. A French train was nearing Switzerland, approaching Vallorcines, the last stop before the frontier, where we were to contact a priest who knew the way through the mountains. We were two in the empty carriage: My companion, old enough to attend university, had a foreign accent and had to keep quiet, but I, still a schoolboy, fortunately spoke French like a native. In fact, there was a third person, the conductor, who came close, looked me in the eyes and asked bluntly: "Are you going over?" I had a few seconds to decide how to gamble our lives. "Yes" I answered. "Fine. I'll tell the driver to stop the train before the station so that you can get off in the field. The station today is packed with policemen."
No wonder that now I am rather allergic to the Increasingly fashionable versions of history, which, conjuring up the "red peril" and the "Bolshevik menace," do not whitewash Nazism, but find all sorts of excuses for various shades of collaboration. If the conductor and engineer of that train had not been on the side of the Resistance--who knows, maybe Communists--I would not be here to tell the story.BY Shayla Harris | Apr. 19, 2012 | 6:30

Before I DieAstronaut Sandra Magnus is headed back to Earth on the space shuttle Discovery after months at the International Space Station, where she dreamt up new ways to cook in zero gravity.
Magnus is wrapping up a 4 1/2-month mission as a space station flight engineer. During work hours, she served as part of the station?s three-person Expedition 18 crew to keep the outpost running and perform science. But she filled her time off with experiments, including how to actually cook in space.
?You know, the trick is duct tape and zip lock bags for everything,? Magnus, 44, told SPACE.com in a recent interview as she prepared to leave the station. ?You can do anything with that.?
Discovery is due to land tomorrow on a runway at NASA?s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. at 1:38 p.m. EDT (1738 GMT) to end a 13-day mission that delivered a new crewmember and final solar arrays to the space station. Engineers on Earth are studying images and data from a Thursday heat shield inspection to clear the spacecraft for landing.
The orbital chef
For Christmas, Magnus and her crewmates made holiday-themed cookies. For the Super Bowl, she whipped up space salsa with sun-dried tomatoes, an ad hoc barbeque from baked beans and breakfast sausage links and chopped onions, and a dip made of cream of mushroom soup and creamed spinach.
?It?s been a lot of fun cooking,? Magnus said, adding that she enjoys experimenting with new foods when she?s on Earth. ?It?s something I enjoy on the ground and so I planned ahead a little bit to supplement the raw ingredients.?
But they weren?t quick meals. In her NASA journals, Magnus describes cooking onions in the station?s Russian food warmer for up to four hours until they were just right. Chopping juicy onions without gravity and holding the pieces down was a challenge, but a strip of tape and handy plastic bag nearby worked wonders, she wrote.
NASA shuttle food system manager Michele Perchonok said that astronauts typically don?t do much hands-on cooking because of the amount of time and effort required, as well as the potential for mess. Magnus, she said, planned well in advance to make sure she had the right amount of oil and garlic in space.
?Sandy was extremely inventive in what she did,? Perchonok told SPACE.com in a recent interview, adding that the astronaut detailed the steps in a PowerPoint file for posterity. ?But it took a lot of time to do it.?
Before leaving the station on Wednesday, Magnus turned her Expedition 18 flight engineer mantle over to Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata, who replaced her as a member of the station crew to begin his own three month mission. Wakata - Japan?s first long-term resident of the station - launched aboard Discovery to help boost the space station to full power by delivering its last set of U.S. solar arrays, which have since been unfurled.
Gravity?s mighty pull
When Discovery lands Saturday, Magnus will complete her second spaceflight and have spent about 134 days in space aboard NASA shuttles and the International Space Station since last year. Her crewmates will spend today testing the shuttle?s systems to make sure Discovery is ready for landing tomorrow.
Magnus said that she?s looking forward to being outside for the first time in months, and perhaps a meal of sushi, a chocolate milkshake and something with melted cheese, like a pizza. But she?s also curious to learn how she?ll react to gravity after living without it for so long.
?I?m very interested to see what happens when I get back to gravity,? she told reporters earlier this week. ?I?ve been exercising a lot. That?s part of my normal lifestyle, even on Earth.?
Magnus will return to Earth in a reclined position, rather than sitting up like her crewmates, to ease her reintroduction to gravity after the long months of weightlessness. She and her crewmates will set up a special recumbent seat in Discovery?s middeck.
?It?s going to be interesting,? Magnus said. ?I?m really looking forward to it.?

Progressio is an international NGO working for sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. It is the new name for the Catholic Institute for International Relations, an independent group with a reputation for radical thinking.
Speaking after the decisive victory for Obama in the USA, Progressio’s Executive Director, Christine Allen, said that 2008 would be remembered as the year when the “tectonic plates of international relations shifted and hope for a new world order was reborn”.
“Obama’s election offers an opportunity to build new relationships and partnerships between countries which will form the basis of a new vision of development,” says Allen. “In the 11 developing countries where we work, from Ecuador and Peru to Yemen and Somaliland, there are strong hopes. Hopes for change.
In Latin America, an Obama-led government will be a chance for “real dialogue between leaders from North and South, where enforced economic models and unfair trade agreements have exacerbated the challenges faced by societies already tackling extreme inequality,” says Allen.
In Muslim countries too, says Allen, people hear America talk of “freedom and democracy” but their experience is of occupying forces and Guantánamo Bay.
“For too long this has smacked of hypocrisy,” comments Allen. “Our hope is that the message and the reality of US actions are integrated in a new, more collaborative approach to foreign policy.”
Progressio – which has been leading on issues of development and international relations for over 40 years – believes the Obama victory could also mark a “sea change” in the US approach to addressing global poverty and injustice.
“On this day we have a greater sense of hope that international development and foreign policy can become increasingly multilateral,” Christine Allen explained. “Improved dialogue with the developing world – which includes healthy collaboration and partnership – is within reach.”
Barack Obama signalled he would build bridges with people “beyond American shores” saying the "true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope.”Print Options

© 2015 RDA Enthusiast Brands, LLC 200% reaches the grand old age of seven years old, and to mark this not particularly noteworthy milestone I thought I’d dig out seven matches from the past in which one or the other of the two competing teams contrived to score seven goals. As an aside, now seems like as a good a time as any to thank all of the readers of this site, whose interest makes it, after all of this time, an endeavour worth continuing with.
Leeds United 7-0 Southampton – 4th March 1972: The Leeds United team of the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s reached many highs, even if its trophy cabinet over that period – two league championships, one FA Cup, one League Cup and two Inter Cities Fairs Cups – ended up a little more bare than the quality of the team deserved. At the start of March 1972, Leeds went into their home league match against struggling Southampton on the back of a run of just one defeat in their previous sixteen matches and with confidence high that the team would win the First Division championship for the first time since 1969.
In front of the cameras of Match Of The Day – and full highlights of the match can be seen here – Don Revie’s team put in perhaps its definitve performance of this era, with Peter Lorimer scoring a hat-trick and Allan Clarke scoring twice as Leeds won by seven goals to nil, famously keeping possession in the last few minutes with the arrogance of a matador teasing an exhausted bull. Come the end of the season, however, there was disappointment for Revie and his team in the league. Just one point separated the top four teams in the division, with Derby County lifting the title by a point after Leeds lost their final league match of the season – which came just two days after they won the FA Cup by beating Arsenal at Wembley – away to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Southampton, meanwhile, ended the season two places and six points above the relegation places at the foot of the table.
Hungary 7-1 England – 23rd May 1954: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. As the 1950s wore on, the implied infallibility of the England national team was falling around its ears. Defeat to the United States of America at the 1950s World Cup finals in Brazil was easy to shrug off. After all, this match wasn’t seen by anybody that wasn’t there and that wasn’t the result that eliminated the team from the tournament. Three years later, however, a 6-3 home defeat at Wembley Stadium by the then-current Olympic champions from Hungary should have proved to be the warning that the Football Association needed that the England team needed to adapt if it was going to stay anywhere near the top of the game. Top domestic coaches spoke out on the subject of the need to change. The FA ignored them, presuming the result to have been a one-off, and nothing changed.
So it was that, in front of a crowd of 92,000 at the Nepstadion in Budapest, that any lingering ideas that England was amongst the great international football nations died. There was no hint of anything to suggest that this was to be anything but an absolute hiding. Hungary were three-nil up at half-time and scored their seventh with nineteen minutes of the match still to play, taking their foot off the pedal a little in the closing stages of the match, whilst England’s only goal came mid-way through the second half from Ivor Broadis, with Hungary already six-nil up. The match marked a particularly miserable debut for memorably-named Fulham centre-forward Bedford Jezzard – who would at least make one further appearance for his country a year later, and was a dismal warm-up for the upcoming World Cup in Switzerland, at which Hungary ended as runners-up and England were beaten in the quarter-finals. Highlights of England’s Budapest humbling can be seen here.
Manchester United 2-7 Sheffield Wednesday – 1st February 1961: Eighteen year old goalkeeper Ronnie Briggs, it has to be said, didn’t have the most auspicious of starts to his Manchester United career. His debut for the club came at Leicester City’s Filbert Street on the twenty-first of January 1961 with a six-nil defeat in a First Division match, and ten days later he was back in goal as Matt Busby’s team crashed out of the FA Cup in a manner that it had seldom done before and certainly hasn’t done since. United had started their FA Cup campaign comfortably enough, with a three-nil win against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford, and whilst the Fourth Round draw away to Sheffield Wednesday wasn’t a good one – Wednesday finished the 1961 league season as runners-up behind the all-conquering double winning Tottenham Hotspur side of the era – going to Hillsborough and earning a replay certainly wasn’t a bad result.
Although not at the peak of their powers, Busby’s team for the replay did contain such names as Shay Brennan, Nobby Stiles, Bill Foulkes and Bobby Charlton and a crowd of over 65,000 people saw Keith Ellis score a hat-trick, and John Fantham and Alan Finney score twice each to give Wednesday a place in the next round of the competition. They were eventually beaten in the quarter-finals of the competition by Burnley, and Manchester United finished their league season in seventh place in the First Division table. Poor Ronnie Briggs, meanwhile, would make a total of eleven appearances in the Manchester United goal before being transferred to Swansea Town. He did, however, also make two appearances in goal for Northern Ireland as well.
Real Madrid 7-3 Eintracht Frankfurt – 18th May 1960: The beginning of the European Cup in the middle of the 1950s was, of course, the beginning of an era of domination by one club that the tournament hasn’t seen again since. Real Madrid’s team of that era was a solid base of Spanish players augmented with the grace of Alfredo Di Stefano and the wit of Ferenc Puskas, and they were too hot to handle for the entire rest of Europe. By the start of the 1960s, their reign was starting to come to an end but, having won the previous four competitions they did save the best until last against the West German champions Eintracht Frankfurt on a record-breaking day in May 1960.
This match did feature the biggest aggregate win in the final of the competition, and it was played in front of a huge crowd of 127,621 at Hampden Park in Glasgow, where England had played out a drab 1-1 draw just a few weeks earlier, with the managers blaming a bobbly pitch for the lack of invention on display. This was bunkum, of course, as was demonstrated by Real Madrid as they lifted their fifth consecutive European Cup after having fallen behind to an early Richard Kreß goal. Two goals in four minutes from Di Stefano gave them the lead, before a third from Puskas in first half stoppage-time almost put the result beyond doubt before half-time. Di Stefano went on to complete his hat-trick in the second half, but he was eclipsed by Puskas, who ended up scoring four times for Real. Their unbeaten run in the competition came to an end in the First Round of the next year’s competition when they were beaten over legs by… Barcelona. Highlights of the game are available here.
Portsmouth 7-4 Reading – 29th September 2007: As Portsmouth supporters prepare for the start of life in League Two next season, it seems scarcely believable that less than six years ago they were running up seven goals in a Premier League match. Benjani scored three goals that day in a match which entered into the record books as the highest aggregate score of any Premier League match since its inception in 1992, and the match also jointly holds the record for the highest number of different scorers in one Premier League match, with eight other players apart from Benjani – Hermann Hreidarsson, Nico Kranjcar, Ivar Ingimarsson and Sulley Muntari for Portsmouth, and Stephen Hunt, Dave Kitson, Shane Campbell and a Sol Campbell own goal for Reading – also finding their way onto the score-sheet. At his post match press conference, the Reading manager Steve Coppell, ever a little ray of sunshine, commented that, .” Thanks, Steve. Highlights are available here.
Austria 7-5 Switzerland – 26th June 1954: Perhaps there was something in the water in Europe in 1954. Starting three weeks after England’s mauling in Budapest, the 1954 World Cup finals in Switzerland – they were held there to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of FIFA – averaged almost five and a half goals per match, including twelve in a quarter-final match which saw the host team eliminated from the competition. Switzerland had already arguably shown their weakness in losing in the group stages to England, but they won their other match against Italy to get through to the last eight, whilst Austria had beaten Scotland and Czechoslovakia to earn their place in the quarter-finals of the competition.
In front of a crowd of 35,000 people in Lausanne, a first half was played out the likes of which will probably never be seen again in the World Cup finals, with Robert Korder and Theodor Wagner scoring twice for Austria and Josef Hugi and Robert Ballaman scoring twice for Switzerland. By the time the first forty-five minutes had been played out, Austria led by five goals to four. Wagner scored early in the second half to extend Austria’s lead and complete his hat-trick, before Hugi matched him and pulled a further goal back for Switzerland, and all of this with less than an hour of the match played. With fourteen minutes to play, Erich Probst finally put the result beyond the hosts’ reach. Austria were beaten by six goals to one in the semi-final by the eventual winners, West Germany. Highlights of this match can be seen here.
Charlton Athletic 7-6 Huddersfield Town – 21st December 1957: There is something mildly tragic about the fact that such a match was only seen by a crowd of 12,535 people and in an age prior to the widespread televising of football matches on the television, but those that did turn out at The Valley four days before Christmas in 1957 for a Second Division match between Charlton Athletic and Huddersfield Town. The two teams had met on the opening day of the season, when a hint of what might be to come was seen when Huddersfield came back from three goals down to earn a three-all draw. After ten minutes, Charlton lost their captain Derek Ufton to injury, and goals from Les Massie and Alex Bain gave Huddersfield a two-nil half-time lead, which they extended to a five -one lead with just over an hour of the match played.
All of this, however, was largely reckoning without Charlton’s Johnny Summers. Summers had scored Charlton’s first goal, two minutes into the second half, but with Huddersfield apparently cruising to a comfortable win, Summers scored four goals in seventeen minutes which, along with another from John Ryan, gave Charlton a six-five lead with nine minutes to play. Stan Howard levelled with four minutes to play before a second goal from Ryan with a minute left to play gave Charlton perhaps the most dramatic win in the entire history of the Football League. The two clubs met again in the FA Cup two weeks later at Leeds Road and drew two-all before Charlton won the replay by a single goal. Charlton finished the season in third place in the table, one point and one position from promotion, whilst Huddersfield, who were at the time managed by one Bill Shankly, finished the season in ninth place in the table. Sadly, Johnny Summers, Charlton’s five goal hero that day, died from cancer in 1962 at the age of just thirty-four years old. Huddersfield Town, meanwhile, remain the only professional English club to score six goals in a Football League match and still end up as the losingThis script is Copyright (C) 2013-2015 Tenable Network Security, Inc.

Article Comments 9
Dec 5, 2013, 8:11 AM by Eric M. Zeman @phonescooper
AT&T today announced new Mobile Share Value Plans. As part of the new plans, AT&T is separating the cost of service from the cost of the device. According to AT&T, customers who aren't subsidizing a device through their plan will need to pay only $25 to add that device to a Mobile Share Value Plan rather than $40. AT&T will automatically drop the monthly service charge down by $15 once a customer completes their contract, recognizing that the device has been paid off. Looking at the new Mobile Share Value Plans as an example, an on-contract smartphone costs $40 to add to the plan, but devices being paid off through AT&T Next, devices that are paid for in full price, devices that customers bring themselves are all eligible for the lower monthly charge of $25.

Started Oct 17, 2009 | Discussions thread
I think this camera may be a real winner, akin to how the 20D went down in history - I hope! Firmware version is 1.0.9 and this was the second batch Adorama sent out. I am really impressed with the focusing - perfect in near darkness, and all tack sharp unless I made a mistake. The color is perfect on my monitor, though I know this can vary from monitor to monitor.
Details: No flash, NR=STD, ISO 3200, handheld, +1 Contr, +1 Sat, +1 Sharp, center weighted average, Spot AF point (this is so great!!) shutter priority, lens 35mm 1.4L on both pics. I have a lot to learn about making movies though!!

Will a preliminary part of the 2015 International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) World Junior Championship be held in Sault Ste. Marie?
Canada plays host to the 10-team 2015 World Junior Championship, which will run from December 26, 2014 to January 5, 2015.
Preliminary round games will be played in Montreal and Toronto (at the Bell Centre and Air Canada Centre, respectively), with the medal round to be played in Toronto.
Sault Ste. Marie City Council and City staff are hopeful that the community may be the site of a training camp for several days for one of the 10 competing teams, and /or that one exhibition game could be held between two of the competing teams at the Essar Centre prior to the tournament.
A minimum of eight exhibition games will be held before the World Junior tournament gets underway December 26.
National teams from Canada, the U.S., Russia, Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia, Denmark and Switzerland will compete in the 2015 World Junior Championship.
Information provided to City Council states that Hockey Canada, along with the 2015 World Junior Host Organizing Committee, is currently accepting expressions of interest from Ontario and Quebec communities interested in holding a training camp and/or one exhibition game.
Tourism Sault Ste. Marie, the City’s Community Services Department and the Sault Major Hockey Association are spearheading the effort to bring a training camp or an exhibition game to the Sault.
Tourism Sault Ste. Marie Executive Director Ian McMillan told SooToday.com a letter of interest regarding the Sault hosting a training camp for one of the competing teams has been sent off to Hockey Canada, with a separate expression of interest in holding an exhibition game to be sent off to Hockey Canada in the near future.
It is not yet known when replies to both expressions of interest will be received.
McMillan told us it would be ideal if Team Canada could play an exhibition game here, but even if such a game involved two other countries, it would draw hockey fans to the Essar Centre and serve as a tribute to Sault Ste. Marie as a city that knows how to host a hockey event of that calibre.
Though competition for a training camp and an exhibition game will be heavy between many Ontario and Quebec communities, City staff indicated to Council that the Sault’s hosting of the 2013 TELUS Cup National Midget Championship (another Hockey Canada event) beefs up the Sault’s chances of success.
Meanwhile, Council has approved financial support for two sports events to be held this year in Sault Ste. Marie.
$5,000 in support will go toward the Atom AA Ontario Hockey Federation (OHF) Championship April 10 to 13, and another $2,400 for the Northern Ontario Cricket Championship, to be held for the first time ever in Sault Ste. Marie, May 3 at the Northern Community Centre. on Monday, but this will be tested by the symbolic weight of King’s holiday..

Cons:Important Book on Decision-Making in Nursing Published.
According to the foreword by Angela Barron McBride, PhD, RN, FAAN, Distinguished Professor and University Dean Emerita, Indiana University School of Nursing, “This second edition is a major stepping stone along the way to preparing new generations for the many decisions they will have to make in the practice of tomorrow.”.
Is 2014 going to be the year that you retire? If so, there will soon be an urgency to arrange a retirement income from your pension fund. There has been intense media coverage of late devoted to the lack of awareness or information surrounding annuities. The consequences of a bad decision can include a reduced standard of living for the rest of your life.
When Nick Ford, a Computer Network Manager, approached retirement, he took the route of obtaining financial advice to arrange an annuity; contacting the Telegraph Retirement Service, provided by Skipton Financial Services Limited (SFS). It meant Nick was able to secure 34pc higher retirement income, per year, for life – compared to what he was originally offered.
“I saw an advert for the service in the Telegraph and knew they were a trusted publication, so I decided to give them a call,” Nick explained. “I had different pension pots due to the way I had worked, and my primary objective was to maximise the income from these pensions.
“I had started to look into this myself, but was daunted by everything that was out there. I think you need to be careful who you choose to help you.”
Enhance your annuity
Where appropriate, SFS put clients in touch with UK-based annuity specialists Gateway Specialist Advice Services, who can search for an alternative retirement annuity/income option on their behalf. This is what happened in Nick’s case. Gateway is committed to doing what’s right for you and will ensure. In fact, not all providers even offer enhanced annuities.
Nick’s personal circumstances meant that he qualified for an enhanced annuity – one of the major reasons for his 34pc increase in income.
Another consideration is whether you want your pension to continue to be paid to your partner if you die before them. This is a feature Nick has arranged with Gateway’s help, so his wife Gloria would continue to be supported.
Nick added, “They are the best advisers I have dealt with so far. I value the personal service I received from them. You speak to one person who knows you and your situation from start to finish, and you don’t get handed off to various different people.”

It was the first season the Western Michigan men have earned the NSCAA Team Academic Award and the third for the women, including the last two seasons.
Two other MAC schools, Akron and Bowling Green, had both of their programs earn be recognized by the NSCAA. WMU, Akron and BGSU were the only men's programs on the list, while 11 of the 12 women's programs in the MAC came in above a 3.0 GPA.
The Bronco women's program featured a record six Academic All-MAC honorees in Kesley Baskins, Anina Cicerone, Caitlin Henderson, Nikolette Rivera, Stephanie Skowneski and Michelle Watson.
Baskins, who held a 3.97 GPA, was named Capitol One Third Team Academic All-District IV, while Cicerone, who held a 3.96 GPA, became the program's first ever COSIDA Academic All-American.
The men's team had three Academic All-MAC selections in Kai Mendes, Pat Schiffer and Derek Schrauben.

In fact (and you know I had to resort to this pun), it's a Saab story. Literally.
Spyker, a boutique Dutch automaker known chiefly for building the teak-and-gold-leaf carriage used by the queen of the Netherlands, is purchasing Saab from General Motors. The brand has been in play for months, and Spyker may not have the bucks to make it happen. Regardless, the move is only the latest unsettling news for a car that was "born from jets" in Sweden and crash-landed in American bankruptcy.
FOR THE RECORD:
Saab: Meghan Daum's column on Feb. 2 about Saab said that Kurt Vonnegut owned a Saab dealership in the 1970s. He owned the dealership in the 1950s. —
The thought of Saab's permanent demise causes a certain kind of person a certain kind of existential woe -- emotions similar to the ones you feel when, long after accepting that your favorite indie band is now popular with the masses, that band breaks up or stops playing except in the drummer's living room.
Saab drivers, as you no doubt know, are intellectuals..Release Date:

PEGASUS
By the age of 13, I had become accustomed to getting my ass kicked, but was getting less accustomed to feeling good about taking it. The habitual ass-kicking started at about 8 or 9, when my parents got divorced. It didn’t take long for the kids in the neighborhood to realize I was about the only one at that time without a Dad to “stick up” for me, if you will.
Don’t get me wrong, by the time I hit about 12, more kids were victims of divorce, but in 1979 when ours happened, they hadn’t become so chic just yet. Like I said, knowing I didn’t have a Dad around, combined with Mom always working to feed us, I became an easy victim. I was also very small for my age, which only made it more attractive of a proposition. Now I’m not going to say that I had nothing to do with future beatings I would take, but these early ones were purely the result of mean kids being mean. I look back on them fondly for two reasons: they ultimately made me tougher, and they helped me develop my sharp wit and smart-ass mouth (more ass-kick fodder) that I’m so very fond of to this day.
Anyway, onto the matter at hand, or at least the winged horse. Like I said, by 13 I had grown quite tired of the beatings, pink bellies, “Jap-slaps” and other assorted physical abuse a junior high boy of about 90 pounds could take. There was a particular pair of brothers who made my daily ¼ mile walk home from the bus stop a living hell. One was a tall skinny dickhead the same age as I was, and the other was his fat fucking shitbag of a brother, who was 2-years older than we were and had a head the size of the goddamn Death Star.
The beatings had become inevitable and I found I couldn’t outrun them. I would sit in the front seat of the bus and watch them lick their chops from the back. As the door opened, I was off and running, only to be caught by the 100-yard mark. Some days they’d toy with me and let me get closer to home and let my guard down before pouncing like a pair of priests on some soiled Underoos. Obviously, I really felt I had no options, aside from possibly killing them, which did enter many a sleepless night’s somewhat disturbing thoughts.
The logical conclusion I came to was that if I could convince them I was crazy, they wouldn’t fuck with me anymore. Now another part of my thirteen year old self I didn’t mention was an unnatural affinity for the game of Dungeons & Dragons. Bad choice of words I suppose, as I don’t think there’s such a thing as a “natural” affinity for Dungeons & Dragons. Nonetheless, I don’t know if it was the “escape from reality” of creating completely different personas, not unlike the internet of today for many a parent’s basement-dwelling shitwad, or just the fact that I was, for all practical purposes, a huge fucking geek.
Whatever the reason, I spent hours playing D&D, as well as graphing dungeons, maps and adventures I would oversee when I was lucky enough to be a Dungeon Master…oh, to be Dungeon Master! Anyhow, you’ll see where this fits in with my glorious plan.
The day had come and I could hardly wait to get through school and off the bus for the gauntlet I liked to call my walk home. I chose a Wednesday feeling that I definitely wanted to have school the next day so that word of my fractured mental health would have legs to spread through the halls by the end of the week, but not too much time to where it had ridden its course by the beginning of the next week. Sick how much fucking thought I put into this, huh?
Before I knew it, the bus was rumbling down the outer road on the way to the stop at the front of our subdivision. Instead of locking my eyes forward so that I could perfectly time the starting gun that was the door, I kept glancing back, almost taunting these inbred pieces of genetic shit. When the bus stopped I strolled off and made it obvious I had no intentions of running. Not only that, I almost had a strut about me.
They started hurling the normal insults, to which I would answer, “whatever fag” (classic 7th grade comeback), or “is that the best you can come up with?” Not at all happy with this newfound boldness I seemed to have, or the fact that other kids seemed to be laughing at their expense, the wheels of my plan began to turn.
Announcing that he was “GOING TO KICK MY ASS”, the younger brother began his attack. But instead of my normal sprint, I turned around to face him and looked right into his eyes. He immediately shoved me to the ground and mounted me, pinning my arms over my head (sounds like a Harlequin). I now stared right past him and up into the sky with eyes the size of dinner plates.
“Pegasus, Pegasus, my mighty steed. I conjure thee to come and help me!” I belted out with the seriousness and intensity of a strip-mall minister.
“Who are you talking to?” asked my attacker.
“My winged stallion is prepared to take your neck!” I answered matter of factly.
Now the rumblings in the crowd began.
“What the fuck is he talking about?”
“What a fucking nerd!”
Actually it was more like “what the shit is he damn talking about?” and “what a pussy-fuck nerd”, as these were other 12 – 14 year olds who were still in the beginning stages of their cussing experimentation. This usually translated into the very awkward sounding phrases of somebody obviously trying too hard to those of us who were lucky enough to already be well-versed in the art of fucks, shits and cocksuckers.
Things were going perfectly. The onlookers seemed to think I was a bit off-balance and my attacker didn’t know what to think. He let go of my arms adding, “You’re fucked up”, as he got up to let me go.
The sense of accomplishment and pride I felt inside could not be measured as I started to rise to my feet, anxious to see the looks on the faces around me…and then it all went south.
Big brother fucknutz was having none of this “Pegasus” shit and proceeded to knock me off my high, winged horse before I could get halfway up. The pain of his rather large forearm to the side of my head was only replaced by all of the air leaving my lungs as his fat ass came plopping down on me like I was the last donut.
He proceeded to pound me over and over for about probably 10-seconds, until at least the masses seamed to have a bit of sympathy and tackle him to stop the beating.
The “best laid plans of mice and men”, I suppose.
There is no moral to learn from this, except maybe, keep running fucker, you’re fucked anyway.
This is how it happened and this is the way it was.
I swear to you if I ever see these boys now, I will beat them within inches of their lives. I believe strongly in vendettas, but I haven’t been lucky enough to run into these two shitwads.
If there’s a lord in heaven, which counters my belief, these fuckfaces have been hit by a car by now, but I doubt it. Until then, I can only hope to see them in aisle 4 at the local Wal-Mart someday. Oh, sweet justice will be served!

The Protestant Cemetery (Italian: Cimitero protestante).
The presence of Mediterranean cypress, pomegranate, and other trees, and a grassy meadow suggests the more naturalistic landscape style of northern Europe, where cemeteries sometimes incorporate grass and other greenery. As the official name indicates, it is the final resting place of non-Catholics (not only Protestants or English people).
The earliest known burial is that of a University of Oxford student named Langton in 1738. The most famous graves are those of English poets John Keats (1795–1821) and Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822). Keats died in Rome of tuberculosis at the age of 25.."

The Top Ten
1Goldfinger - Shirley Bassey
The Best Theme Song of the perennial James Bond Series. A famous veteran who actually recorded a James Bond Theme herself said that no one can top Shirley when it comes to a Bond song. Bassey is the only vocalists who has recorded more than one. (Goldfinger, Diamonds Are Forever, and Moonraker)
The Best James Bond Theme of them all! Besides being such a unique song that has interested people of all generations for all these years, it's Shirley Bassey's powerful vocal ability that still brings the song to life! Others have attempted this song, but Bassey's renditions, both studio and LIVE, are still the best!

2Hey Jude - The Beatles
A landmark Beatles song, and since it is the best song by the best band it should be no. 1. Satisfaction, Like a rolling stone, Good Vibrations and Respect are all-time classics of the highest quality, but they still can't compare with this song.
My version of this list is The same of my top 10 Beatles songs with Pinball Wizard and Good Times Bad Times- which I'm not sure if it was in sixties but I was born in 2001 so cut slack. Hey Jude, Something and Across The Universe should top the list.
You got to be kidding me. How come this is not the number one?
[Newest]I love Paul McCartney best Martha good luck Beatles
3Like a Rolling Stone - Bob Dylan
Bob Dylan was and is a great poet and one of the best singer/songwriters to ever live. "Like a Rolling Stone" was on the top of the charts when it came out, and it should be at the top of this list, honestly. [In my opinion. ] Bob originally made the song that was over 10 minutes, and then the producer(s) cut it down into around 7 minutes. When you can write a song that ISN'T repetitive, over 10 minutes... That's when you know you're a great poet and song writer. Bob should be at the top of this list with no doubt.
YES! There is a list on this site that gives dylan some respect. This song changed the world not just music any music that came after this was affected by this.

Beginning August 3, more than 20 monumental sculptures will appear on Milner Plaza

Internationally collected and admired worldwide as a sculptor, painter, and teacher, Allan Houser (1914-1994) is back in the Santa Fe spotlight in a major way this summer on the 100th anniversary of his birth. Five monumental artworks by the famed Chiricahua Apache sculptor will be displayed in the exhibit Footprints: The Inspiration and Influence of Allan Houser at the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture (MIAC), accompanied by an assortment of life-size and monumental sculptures by notable artists who either studied with Houser at IAIA, worked with him at his studio, and/or were influenced by him.
The imposing exhibit, which will contain more than 20 monumental sculptures in all, will be prominently mounted outside MIAC on Milner Plaza, and will include works by such well-known Indian artists as Houser's sons, Bob Haozous (Chiricahua Apache) and Phillip Mangas Haozous (Chiricahua Apache), along with Doug Hyde (Nez Perce), Don Chunestudey (Cherokee), Tony Lee (Navajo), Estella Loretto (Jemez Pueblo), Oreland C. Joe (Southern Ute/Navajo), Craig Dan Goseyun (San Carlos Eastern White Mountain Apache), Larry Ahvakana (Inuit), Cliff Fragua (Jemez Pueblo), Rollie Grandbois (Turtle Mountain Chippewa), Robert Shorty (Navajo), and Bill Prokopioff (Aleut). The show opens on August 3, 2014, marking the 100th anniversary of Houser's birth on June 30, 1914.
The largest of the five Houser sculptures in the show is Homeward Bound (1989), a massive bronze scene measuring 87.5 inches high by 153 inches wide by 23 inches deep. It depicts a young Navajo woman herding three sheep home across a bridge to safety. Homeward Bound is part of a limited edition of six; the sculpture is also held in the collections of the University of Oklahoma and of Heifer International, a company that gifts live animals to impoverished communities around the world. The other four sculptures are the abstracted Affection and the figurative As Long as the Waters Flow, He Will Be Home Soon, and Ready to Dance. These join two other large Houser sculptures previously on loan to the museum from Allan Houser Inc., for a total of seven Houser pieces on display, all imbued with the harmony and beauty for which the artist is known.
Surrounding the Houser sculptures on Milner Plaza will be a gathering of other monumental sculptures in bronze, marble, limestone, and/or steel from artists influenced by Houser, including such pieces as Allan Houser (2001), a 700-pound, life-size sculpture of Houser as an older man by Phillip Mangas Haozous; Santa Fe Table (1989), a 700-pound steel table with raised cutouts of Santa Fe iconography like coyotes by Bob Haozous; and People of the Red Tail Hawk, a 700-pound bronze by Doug Hyde featuring a Nez Perce boy, Iroquois warrior, Blackfoot chief, Buffalo dancer, Hopi maiden, and Omaha man, along with a bear and a Northwest coastal raven, considered the bringer of fire.
While various other Houser shows are being mounted to commemorate his centenary, MIAC director Della Warrior (Otoe/Missouria) conceived this show with the aim of emphasizing Houser's legacy. "What we are trying to demonstrate is his legacy extends far beyond his own works because he influenced so many artists. We're concentrating on the monumental sculpture, but he influenced hundreds of artists, including painters, to develop their own artistic style and become themselves as artists. To look at this array of artists from tribes throughout the nation is a profound statement about his ability to influence, generate, and excite students," says Warrior.
Adds show curator Dorothy Grandbois (Turtle Mountain Chippewa), "Most of the artist participants are IAIA students that he taught and then some worked with him in his studio. I think it's the only show of Allan and his students in the same exhibit. These students studied with him and all became full-time working artists. It's a historic exhibit that speaks volumes about his legacy."
Preparator Andrew John Cecil is installing the monumental sculptures for the show, which will be on display for 10 months from August 3, 2014 until May 31, 2015.
On August 3 from 1 PM to 4 PM there will be an opening exhibit with participating artists Phillip Mangas Haozous, Bob Haozous, Don Chunestudey, Oreland C. Joe, Estella Loretto, Cliff Fragua, and Rollie Grandbois expected to attend, along with performances by Native dance groups.
Anticipates Warrior of the dramatic, all-outdoors exhibition, "It's going to be awesome to see all these sculptures all around Milner Plaza for 10 months!"

While there are certain foods those with a thyroid condition should consume, in this article I’m going to discuss certain thyroid-inhibiting foods you should try to avoid.
These thyroid-inhibiting foods are also known as goitrogens, and I’m going to discuss the negative impact they can have on your health, and list some of the common foods which you will want to minimize your consumption of, and in some cases, completely avoid. This is especially true if you have a hypothyroid condition, but even if you have hyperthyroidism you still want to minimize the consumption of these foods.
Here are some examples of goitrogens:
• Broccoli
• Cauliflower
• Kale
• Brussels Sprouts
• Mustard Greens
• Radishes
• Spinach
• Strawberries
• Peaches
• Soy-Based Foods
• Peanuts
You’ll notice that some of these goitrogenic foods are considered to be healthy foods, such as broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, etc. Because of this, it’s probably important to mention that those people who don’t have a thyroid condition shouldn’t have a problem eating these vegetables.
In other words, eating cruciferous vegetables will most likely not lead to the development of a thyroid condition. On the other hand, for someone who has a thyroid condition, especially hypothyroidism, consuming goitrogens can actually worsen your condition.
So does this mean that someone with a hypothyroid condition should completely avoid these goitrogenic foods? Well, for those who choose to manage their symptoms by taking synthetic or natural thyroid hormone, then eating these foods in moderation probably isn’t a big deal. So for example, having some broccoli or strawberries every now and then, or even a soy-based product isn’t too big of a deal. But it probably isn’t a good idea to eat these regularly, even if you are managing your symptoms by taking thyroid hormone.
On the other hand, when a patient of mine first begins a natural treatment protocol, I do recommend that they avoid these goitrogenic foods, at least for awhile. Assuming it is possible to cure their condition, then after restoring their thyroid health back to normal they can begin eating some of these foods in moderation again.
How Do Goitrogens Inhibit Thyroid Activity?
The way that goitrogens work is that they inhibit iodine metabolism. With regards to thyroid health, iodine is important in the formation of thyroid hormone. As a result, if iodine cannot be properly utilized by the thyroid gland, then the formation of thyroid hormone won’t take place. As you can imagine, this is not a good thing for someone with hypothyroidism, as they already have problems with the manufacturing of thyroid hormone even without consuming goitrogens.
Some Goitrogenic Foods Are Worse Than Others
While I definitely recommend that anyone with a thyroid condition minimize their.
On the other hand, I’m not a big fan of soy, as while the soy industry has done a great job of marketing soy as being healthy for us, a lot of research has proved otherwise. I mentioned above where someone who doesn’t have a thyroid disorder is unlikely to develop one by consuming goitrogens. Well, soy might be an exception to this, as eating soy frequently can potentially lead to numerous health problems.
Once again, for someone who is not following a natural treatment protocol and is relying on the prescription drugs to manage their symptoms, eating some soy-based foods every now and then is fine. On the other hand, since a person who has a hypothyroid condition should try to minimize the amount of goitrogens they eat, when they do choose to eat such foods it would be a better choice to eat the cruciferous vegetables, since they do offer greater health benefits.
Also, some goitrogenic foods are considered “mildly goitrogenic”. Some examples include spinach, strawberries, and peaches. So while anyone with a hypothyroid condition will want to minimize their consumption of these foods, eating them aren’t as bad for your thyroid gland as other goitrogenic foods that aren’t classified as being “mildly goitrogenic”, such as broccoli, cauliflower, and soy.
By the way, some sources do show that cooking these foods may destroy the goitrogenic activity. I’m not sure if this has been fully confirmed through research studies, and so while it might be okay for someone with hypothyroidism to eat cooked cruciferous vegetables and other goitrogenic foods regularly, I still would be cautious about consuming too much.
Should People With Hyperthyroidism Use Goitrogenic Foods As A Treatment Method?
Some sources suggest that people with hyperthyroidism should eat a good amount of goitrogenic foods. The rationale behind this is that since hyperthyroidism involves an excess of iodine production, and because goitrogens inhibit the production of thyroid hormone, then it would make sense to “load up” on these thyroid inhibiting foods. I personally disagree with this, as while someone with a hyperthyroid condition will be able to eat more goitrogens when compared with someone with hypothyroidism, this doesn’t mean they should intentionally eat a lot of goitrogenic foods.
The reason for this is because simply taking goitrogenic foods isn’t going to cure the hyperthyroid condition. While eating goitrogenic foods might do a decent job of managing the symptoms if they are consumed in sufficient quantities, my ultimate goal is to try to restore the health of the person’s thyroid gland back to it’s normal state, which in many cases can be accomplished through a natural thyroid treatment protocol. So while I won’t tell a patient of mine with hyperthyroidism to reduce his or her consumption of goitrogenic foods (at least not the healthier choices such as broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), I definitely won’t recommend that they eat more of them, as this simply isn’t necessary.
In summary, anyone with hypothyroidism definitely needs to be careful when it comes to the consumption of goitrogenic foods. And if you do decide to follow a natural thyroid treatment protocol, then it probably will be necessary for you to completely avoid these foods for a certain period of time. Also, someone with a hyperthyroid disorder should not intentionally consume an abundance of goitrogenic foods in order to inhibit thyroid activity, as for most people with hyperthyroidism, a natural thyroid treatment protocol can restore their health back to normal without having to consume large quantities of goitrogens.

There they'll take soil samples, look for invertebrates and count weeds. It's a routine they are well used to. For the past three years, such teams have been monitoring more than 70 farm sites dotted around Britain, all in a bid to assess the impact of GM crops on farmland biodiversity.
Activists have periodically pulled up the crops, and there have been relentless claims that the trials are environmentally risky and scientifically worthless. But for the researchers at least, the end is in sight. In six months, the weed counting will be over and the first results out. Then it will be ministers' turn on the rack.
At the height of GM fever in Britain back in 1999, the farm trials ...

Well, these days I was a bit melancholic during my afternoon walks, so nothing more to say here, if you don't mind...
About the photo: Pretty much snow in Berlin these days. Here, during an afternoon walk passing from one of its squares. It was the moment the street lights had just been turned on and together with the blue sky and the snowy background I thought it would create a nice effect. The inclusion of the benches supposedly would add to the sentimental effect. Tell me what you think...
I would like to dedicate this photo to sarsifa. She is always there in those blue times, even when she's many kilometres away...

All "Extreme" denotes is a higher clock. In older Intel processors, the Extreme denoted a higher cache size (2MB vs 512KB in the P4's), but not any more. About halfway down the page it has specs for the whole core 2 lineup. Any model number with a Q is quad-core, others are dual-core. Interestingly, there isn't a 2.8GHz chip in the lineup, so I guess Apple had their own model made. My guess is that it's dual-core with 4MB cache, since Apple reserves the quad-core chips for the Mac Pro lineup. Yeah, on it says 4MB cache, so it's dual-core. You should also note that iMacs have an 800MHz system bus, denoted on that page. Not sure how much real-world difference that makes, but it's slower than the standard Core 2 chips.

Manchego & Ham-Stuffed Chicken BreastsWhen you pick up a glass bottle, you are holding 5,000 years of history in your hand. Glass was used as a reliable packaging option by the ancient Egyptians, Romans and right through Renaissance Europe to the present day.
The reason glass has survived so many millennia, and big businesses still use it today, is that it has several unique benefits. First, it is 100% natural – made from the age-old combination of sand, soda ash and limestone. It is an inert material that does not react with the food and drink it carries, and is able to preserve taste and vitamins without any chemicals. Finally, when a glass bottle reaches the end of its life, it is 100% recyclable – it is melted down into what is known as cullet and used to produce more glass products. Even when it ends up outside the recycling stream, due to its natural composition and inability to decompose, it does not leach harmful materials into the environment. Glass only forms 2% of the 7.8m tonnes of carbon emissions the soft drinks industry emits.
All in all, a good, green bet for food and drink brands.
But just like all other industries that consume natural materials, we have the responsibility to make our products as environmentally sound as possible – even when they start at such an advanced point as glass.
The collection and conversion of cullet has been constantly developing over the years, to ensure as much glass as possible is distributed back into the production process. Cullet has a much lower melting temperature than its original constituents and therefore requires around 40% less energy to create the molten glass that forms the containers. In Europe in 2011, this meant the emission of more than 7m tonnes of CO2 was avoided, the equivalent of taking four million cars off the road.
To produce the same products with fewer inputs is a no brainer for business. But unfortunately within the recycling industry, as colours of glass must be separated, a lot of recycled glass ends up in asphalt production, rather than as new glass products. This is a huge challenge to the industry and one that must be tackled if glass is to live up to its potential as an environmentally friendly option.
Eliminating waste on the production line is also critical to the sustainability of the industry.
Recent innovations, such as high-tech cameras for detecting faults in products and virtual sampling facilities that allow the machines to check themselves for faults, have contributed to making the process as efficient as possible and minimising unnecessary rejections of finished products.
The process of making glass bottles lighter – thus reducing the energy required to produce and transport them – has been a very important innovation in the recent years. Current glass packaging is around 50% lighter than it used to be. Boundaries are still being pushed to create more sustainable glass bottles in this way – the lightest weight glass bottle available in the mineral water industry has just been released by Rawlings and Belu mineral water (trademarked Ethical Glass).
As the first customer, Belu will save 850,000 kg of glass per year (equivalent to 2.1m wine bottles) and reduce its carbon emissions by a further 11%.
An alternative approach to make the glass (literally) greener, is to utilise the abundance of green glass we have. As net importers of wine, the UK in particular has a lot of green glass available.
According to a study conducted by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap), switching from clear glass to green cuts packaging-related CO2 emissions by 20%. This is due to the higher recycled content in green glass bottles, which is as much as 72.4%, against an industry standard of 28.9%. The study also revealed that bottling gin, white wine and brandy in green glass had a negligible impact on consumers' perception of taste, and increasing the recycled content of the glass actually improved consumers' opinion of both retailers and the products.
Despite coming this far, glass manufacturers and buyers cannot consider their contribution to making the industry more sustainable complete. Investment in the infrastructure to collect, sort and distribute cullet to the manufacturers is the most obvious effort required to scale up the sustainability of the glass industry. Restaurants, for example, have no formal scheme to collect and recycle their glass, resulting in unnecessary amounts being thrown away. Putting a scheme in place to rectify this will however hinge on a co-ordinated approach between local government authorities to bring efficiencies to the system – often a real sticking point.
Continuing to increase the recyclability and recycled content of glass packaging, as ensuring the glass manufacturing process is as carbon efficient as possible, remain the priorities. The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the British soft drinks industry are currently developing a roadmap to help the sector reduce its environmental impact. This is exactly the kind of collaboration between government and business that the glass industry should welcome, to ensure that the future of glass is green.

David Balhuizen is the head of operations at ethical mineral water company Belu.?)My neighbor, Greg, is a big beer aficionado. He brews his own beer - and he does a pretty good job of it, too. We have quaffed many a beer over the past few years hanging out at each others house. Although our tastes vary a bit, we also have some ideas as to what both of us like. For over a year, Greg has been raving about a new brewpub over in the Iowa City suburb of Coralville - Backpocket Brewing - telling me he knew that I'd like the place. We've both been talking about heading over together at some point, but we haven't done it. However, on a recent Sunday trip to Iowa City, Cindy suggested that we head to Backpocket Brewing to give it a try. She knew that Greg and I had been talking about going to the place and he talked so adamantly about the beer and the pizza at the brewpub that she wanted to give it a try, as well.
The background story of Backpocket Brewery is sort of interesting. Well, to me, at least. It starts out in the picturesque Northeastern Iowa river community of McGregor. In 2007, McGregor natives Dave and Marci Strutt decided they wanted to build and develop the finest brewpub in the state of Iowa. Dave Strutt was working with the Weitz Company - a large Des Moines-based construction company - as Sr. Vice-President/General Counsel. Along with a Des Moines friend, James Simmons, the Strutts bought the somewhat famous "Diamond Jo" building in McGregor. Built in 1888 by "Diamond" Jo Reynolds, an entrepreneur who owned steamboats, mines, grain elevators and other properties in a number of states, it housed his offices for his steamboat operation that ran up and down the Upper Mississippi River. The Strutts and Simmons transformed the old building into a state of the art brewpub complete with a brewing operation that was built in Austria by the Salm company. At the time, there were only two other breweries in the Western Hemisphere that were using Salm equipment - one in Canada and the other in Brazil.
It so happened that James Simmons' son, Jake, was looking to get his start as a brewmaster. Jake Simmons had a degree in microbiology and was going for his PhD at a college in St. Louis. About three years into his program, he decided that he didn't really need his PhD, so he went to work in the private sector in biotech work. The money was good, but his first love was homebrewing beer. Simmons quit his job and worked as an intern for a couple years on the quality control team at Schlafly Brewery in St. Louis. He left there in 2007 and went to work for a brewery out in Maine. When the Strutts and James Simmons opened the Old Man River brewpub in January of 2008, Jake Simmons was named the brewmaster. Focusing on German-style beers, Jake Simmons wanted his beers to have a signature taste that wasn't overpowering.
Jake Simmons still had ties at the Schlafly brewery and that company was looking to outsource some of their beers to help increase Schlafly distribution in the Midwest and Southeast. In the summer of 2011, Schlafly signed an agreement with Simmons to produce some of their beers. The only problem was that the Old Man River brewery was running at capacity and couldn't produce any beers for Schlafly. Simmons knew he had to build a new brewery from scratch.
Simmons looked at the Iowa City/Coralville area, as for a city with a major college - the University of Iowa - it had a large beer drinking population, yet no active brewpub. With his father and the Strutts financing the venture, Simmons built a 15,000 brewery with a 25,000 barrel capacity complete with a tap room and a beer garden.
Backpocket Brewing opened just over a year ago. To help run the tap room, Simmons hired Bob Wagner, an Iowa native who had been running the Piece Brewpub in Chicago. The concept for Backpocket - pizza and beer - is similar to what Wagner was doing in Chicago.
The regular beers at Backpocket Brewery all have names of unique items that people have put in their backpockets over the years. Their Slingshot is a German dunkel beer that is dark in color, but has a light lager taste. The Wooden Nickel is a Scottish-peated ale with a German definition. The Pennywhistle is a wheat-based beer with the spiciness of cloves and cinnamon. The Jack Knife is a hoppy German-style of beer that is reminiscent of an India Pale Ale. And the Golden Coin is a lighter German pilsner. They also make seasonal beers at Backpocket including an Oktoberfest. All the beers at Backpocket follow recipes based on the German Beer Purity Law that has been in place since the 1500's.
Backpocket Brewery is located in the Iowa River Landing development at the end of East 9th Street in Coralville, in front of the Marriott hotel. (see map) There's a pay parking lot off to the side, but we went around the roundabout and parked on the street on the side of the brewery/tap room. It was a warm, yet, windy day and the umbrellas for the tables in the beer garden in front of the brewpub were all put away. Two young ladies didn't mind the wind as they enjoyed their beers in the warm Spring sunshine.
There weren't too many people in the tap room at Backpocket. As my wife always says, "Why would you want to be inside drinking beer on such a beautiful day?" It looked like many people shared her philosophy.
We took a seat in one of the booths that were along a low brick wall that separated the dining room area from the bar area. There are floor-to-ceiling tinted windows that let in a lot of natural light during the day.
The brewery was very visible with the large fermenting barrels in the back area of the tap room. Backpocket bottles their own beer and has a large bottle capping machine. A number of their beers are available at bars, restaurants and grocery stores in Eastern Iowa.
Our server, Alex, came over to great us. He asked if we'd been to Backpocket before and we told him, no, but we'd heard good things about the place. Right off the bat, he told us that they were out of their Slingshot Dunkel and the Jack Knife German pale ale. "We had a pretty good Friday night and Saturday," he explained.
I ended up ordering a Wooden Nickle while Cindy got an iced tea. "Iced tea," I asked incredulously. "I thought you wanted a beer."
She said, "I know. But they don't have a real pale ale on the beer menu. Besides, I'm a little tired and if we get a pizza and I have a beer I'll get sleepy." (Actually, they did have the Schlafly American Pale Ale on hand. I'm guessing they're brewing it for Schlafly's.)
The menu at Backpocket is pretty limited - pizza and salads. They had something about a burger that is grilled on their outdoor patio circular fire pit, but Alex sort of explained, "Uh, yeah, that's not even going on yet. We're gonna do that sometime, but we're not doing it today." The pizza is a Neapolitan-style 10" pizza that is baked in a special oven that is heated to 900 degrees (F). They have five or six signature pizzas including a margherita pizza and something called the "Meatza" - sausage, pepperoni and bacon. We decided to get a "build-your-own" pizza - sausage and pepperoni. It's $7 bucks for a plain cheese pizza and 50 cents for each ingredient. $8 bucks is pretty cheap for a pizza.
Because the oven is so hot, it certainly didn't take long for our pizza to make it to the table. The hand-tossed pizza had a thick and chewy edge-crust with slight charred marks. But the inner crust was thin, but not crisp.
I got to looking at the individual slices of pizza and I thought, "Wait a minute... Where are the toppings?" The sausage chunks were pretty small and there wasn't many of them. And there were only two - or possibly three - slices of pepperoni per slice. The pizza, itself, tasted very good. It certainly passed the "Does it taste good with a beer?" test that I use for every pizza. But we were sort of laughing over the paucity of any type of toppings. I said to Cindy, "Well, I see how they can get away with pizzas for $8 bucks. They don't put any toppings on them." It could have been an excellent pizza had they stepped up and put some more toppings on it.
We had no problem finishing the pizza and realized that we probably could have gotten two pizzas if we were really hungry. But a half-pizza each was fine with us for a somewhat late lunch that day.
Aside from the skimpy toppings on their pizza, I was impressed with the whole experience at Backpocket Brewery. We had good service from Alex, the pizza did taste good as did the Wooden Nickel beer that I had. Well, I guess I would have liked to have tried the Slingshot Dunkel, but I can do that on my next visit. Or I can pick some up at a store or try some at a bar that has it available in the Quad Cities. Backpocket Brewing is doing well and I think they'll be doing well for a long time.

Whereas the "Big Picture" focuses on the gist of essentials and avoids being overwhelmed by details, anti-Critical Thinking (CT) "Broad Stroke" mindsets come from problems with ones "Self-Greatness"assessment. Here, by not feeling worthy, powerful, or "good enough," one falsely believes what one thinks, feels, says, and does are not important. Such Selfhood Splintering prevents the desire to develop mental challenges and skills. Status quo conflicted thinking and its inconsistent work products are deemed not to greatly matter, for "what difference does it make?" In assessing a situation, out of its contradictory, disagreeable, or the incomplete aspects, they "pick and choose" things of interest. To not appear weak, if they keep that situational story intact, they alter specific details. Or, if the true story is ignored, the details introduced are designed to favor them. Other examples include: (1) knowing a piece of something (partly wrong?) on one part of one plane of existence and believing that is 'everything'; (2) having faith in what one already believes is right and all there is to know; and (3) arrogantly judging unfavorably those who, by knowing other things, do not agree with their judgments. Each stops their learning and progress. First, illustrating this CT "killer triad" are "Instant Psychologists" who display a "broad stroke" by immediately "Scrutinizing," from a glance, a person/thing/message and then jumping to conclusions. They wrongly believe that "glance" of the character behind ones face or appearance of a thing (e.g. a tough problem) tells them every important thing. Based on these emotional misinterpretations, judgments are made that a solution, candidate, or approach will/will not work. Worse yet is taking action on these "guesses." Those delusions lead to bad actions/reactions and to the detriment of all involved.
Second, Rules of Thumb--based on practice, experience, and common sense--are okay for any simple and roughly reasonable method of measurement. Despite a thin stroke difference separating them from accuracy and precision, that amount can and usually does spell failure if applied to tough problems. Third, "Broad Stroke" self-defeaters are: (a) those Black Americans acutely aware of the evil "stay-in-your-place" dictates of Euro-Americans and yet remain silent, non-assertive, and accepting of this psychological bondage by "Making Do"; (b) the many hating the philosophies, values, and practices of Europeans and yet trade in African treasures for the self-destructive European "Trinkets and Trivia"; (c) placers of barriers against the "different" Black People able to help the Black Community; (d) the truly needy who fail to pursue the knowledge (especially of our Ancient African Ancestors' philosophy), CT, job skills, practices (including manners) designed for self-help; and (e) the too many Black Americans exhibiting what some call the "Politics of Redemption"--feeling bound to prove to White people that they and what they do are up to White people's standards. Black People have absolutely nothing to prove to White People. But the reverse is true.
Fourth is the "Coin Collection" known to prevent CT. A CT "Broadstroke" is the Two-Sided Coin Misuse/Abuse, as occurs with the African Law of Opposites. One is believing one is separate from Nature/other people. Another is seeing only a part or all of one side of the coin. Like a coin, every issue has more than one side and it is essential for CT to know its "other side" to properly assess the full story or to open up ones full human potential. A Double-Edged Coin course of action/situation has positive/negative effects or two negative effects which, if not considered, cause failure/injury to oneself and/or to others. "Pay-Back" in the Same Coin is "not giving up something to get something." The Other Side of the Coin means the opposite standpoint is often ignored or ridiculed; or one often fails to show or seek out the disadvantages and, instead deal only with the advantages; or in seeking Truth, one sees only the hard and boring research and uses that as an excuse to avoid work; or unaware fear (loss of power) keeps one doing what gives no lasting benefits. A Two-Faced Coin is a hypocrite (pretending by playing a part) saying something but meaning another. To Not Keep Ones Word implies one is destructively self-absorbed; cares nothing for the feelings of those involved; and prevents one from trusting oneself. CT does the work to avoid these great Broad Stroke abusers of Assessments. Yet, before judging and to ensure it is right, CT pursues Certainty!.Return

Raising the
African Brigade:
Early Black Recruitment in Civil War
North Carolina
by Dr. Richard Reid
(By Special Permission of the NC Division of
Archives & History)
[Reprinted from North Carolina Historical Review, 70 (1993), pp. 266-301]
Part I
(pp. 266-272)
Recruiting for the African Brigade is progressing lively and enthusiastically," wrote Corporal Z. T. Haines, of the Forty-fourth Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia, in late May 1863. "Quite a recruiting fever has seized the freedmen of Newbern. ...Four thousand colored soldiers are counted upon in this department." 1 At almost the same time another soldier, William P. Derby of the Twenty-seventh Massachusetts Volunteers, recorded the excitement within the city's black population. "One can hardly forget the enthusiasm amongst the negroes of this place, placards being posted around the city, calling for four thousand men for 'Wild's colored Brigade.' Street processions of the most motley character were the order of the day." 2
What the two soldiers were describing, the plan to raise four infantry regiments from among North Carolina's African-American population, was one of the first authorized attempts by the Federal government to enlist ex-slaves in the defense of the Union. By the end of the war black recruitment would become widely accepted and North Carolina would provide just over 5,000 of the 179,000 black troops raised. 3 In the spring of 1863, however, the policy was new and controversial. Not surprisingly, it would be implemented in different regions with varying degrees of success. The differences in the ways in which African Americans were recruited and their responses to the Union policy depended greatly upon local conditions, the interplay of widely divergent personalities, and the recent and regional experiences of the black population. In North Carolina the initial attempt to recruit blacks would be strongly influenced by Massachusetts abolitionist zeal and paternalistic altruism, combined with a careful selection of those white officers who would lead the black units. The architects of the project were among the nation's most sympathetic supporters of black service and were drawn from the state with the strongest abolition credentials. Of course, the success of the brigade and any further enlistment would depend most of all upon the willingness of North Carolina blacks to risk all in an uncertain conflict where a blue uniform did not always signify a friend. Nevertheless, the white organizers hoped to establish a model with the brigade in North Carolina that could demonstrate elsewhere how best to serve both Union and black interests. As a result, the recruitment of the African Brigade, and its first months of service, can be used as an effective case study to delineate the upper limits of white altruism and the Federal government's willingness to treat ex-slaves in a fashion similar to white soldiers. The abbreviated career of the brigade also reflects the constantly altering conditions, goals, and priorities facing the organizers and soldiers in the black units. Such a study offers a corrective to current scholarly portrayals of black recruitment.
The most recent study of black troops has described the recruitment of blacks as "one of the most difficult and disagreeable duties of the white officers assigned to the black regiments." All sorts of obstacles were placed in the recruiters' way, and little in the way of assistance or incentives was offered to ease their job. Overall, "too many officers cared too little how they raised black recruits." 4 As a result, the first contact that many African Americans had with recruiters was one of intimidation and constraint. While that was not true in North Carolina, it had been true elsewhere. When General David Hunter began to raise black regiments in South Carolina in May 1862, his conscription of all able-bodied black men ages eighteen to forty-five and other heavy-handed actions terrified the ex-slaves and convinced them that such efforts preceded a return to bondage. 5 Although conditions improved under General Rufus Saxton, Jr., later drafts and impressments were almost as draconian as the first. The trial and execution of Sergeant William Walker for mutiny in early 1864 highlighted not only the Third South Carolina Colored Infantry's sense of betrayal over the unequal-pay issue and its onerous fatigue duties but also the number of incompetent regimental officers in it who faced dismissal or military charges. 6 In Louisiana, conflicting groups of "planters, Northern lessees, contrabands, and free blacks, all claiming to be loyal to the Union, as well as officials of both War and Treasury departments" prevented the formulation of any orderly and rational policy of black enlistment. 7 Moreover, they ensured that the interests of the black slaves would receive a very low priority. General Benjamin Butler's refusal in July 1862 to let Brigadier General John Phelps openly encourage slaves to join Union forces and to enroll them in black regiments was largely a result of Butler's initial reluctance to disrupt the social status quo. Butler's subsequent enlistment of New Orleans's free black militia was rooted in that group's perceived social status as well as the rapidity of changing attitudes and events. 8 Conditions in North Carolina, a few people hoped, offered a chance of black recruitment by carefully chosen men who would bypass those problems.
John Albion Andrew, the abolitionist governor of Massachusetts, advocated recruiting blacks into the Union army and in 1863 proposed that African-American troops be raised in North Carolina. Engraving by Alexander H. Ritchie from Dictionary of American Portraits (New York: Dover Publications, 1967), 16.
The decision to raise a brigade of black troops in North Carolina was a by-product of several factors. The Federal occupation of coastal areas of the state, which occurred in 1862, was necessary before significant numbers of potential black recruits became available. Even then, however, until white attitudes concerning the appropriateness of black service changed and until African Americans had convinced the North of their willingness and ability to support the Union, few people championed black enlistment. One group that did so ardently and whose support for the African Brigade was crucial to its success was led by the governor of Massachusetts, John A. Andrew. Andrew, an abolitionist, had long been an advocate of black recruitment at all ranks including commissioned officers, initially among Northern free blacks. Encouraging him and supporting his goals were abolitionists such as Wendell Phillips, Francis W. Bird, George L. Stearns, and Edward W. Kinsley. As the war progressed, the governor expanded his arguments to include Southern slaves. 9 By the end of January 1863, he had succeeded in getting authorization to raise a black regiment in Massachusetts, the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers, and Stearns began to develop a network of black recruiting officers throughout the North. 10 The response to the call for black volunteers was so good that a second black regiment, the Fifty-fifth, was soon added.
Andrew's achievement led him to propose to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, on April 1, 1863, that "some able, brave, tried, and believing man" be sent to North Carolina to raise black troops. 11 Andrew had cause to believe that conditions and the time were favorable. Not only did he have information that there were between twenty-five hundred and five thousand potential recruits within Union lines, but he was also aware, from published and unpublished accounts by soldiers in the thirteen Massachusetts regiments making up part of the occupying forces, of the enthusiasm and aid for the Union cause exhibited by the ex-slaves. 12 Colonel Frank Lee of the Forty-fourth Massachusetts Regiment had informed Robert Gould Shaw, commander of the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers, and others that "a brigade of coloured men could be easily raised in North Carolina." 13 His opinion carried greater weight because one of his men, Private Henry A. Clapp, was compiling a census of the freed black population in Federal-occupied North Carolina for the Union commander. 14 The census was completed for New Bern by March and indicated that there were at least eighty-five hundred black refugees in the town and in three outlying camps. 15
Moreover, by the early months of 1863 the idea of using former slaves as soldiers was slowly becoming more acceptable throughout much of the North. Equally important, Andrew believed that one of his state's black regiments could serve a vital role in North Carolina. Attracting escaped slaves to join a whites-only Northern army, he argued, would be very difficult. On the other hand, "it would be comparatively easy to gain large numbers to join an army in part already composed of black troops. I suggest that if you sent some colored troops down there the result would shortly be a general attraction of the blacks to our Army unless the business of dealing with those people should be badly managed." 16 He reminded Stanton that his act of raising "a colored regiment in Massachusetts was begun upon talking with you about North Carolina and the difficulty of attracting negroes to join white troops." He proposed that Stanton send the Fifty-fifth to North Carolina to form "the nest egg of a brigade." 17 The governor had originally planned on sending the Fifty-fourth to New Bern, and as late as April 8 Robert Shaw was preparing his regiment to go to North Carolina. 18 Ultimately, however, Shaw's regiment was sent to South Carolina, where there was greater opportunity for it to demonstrate its military value. Shaw had told Andrew that there was more hope for action there under Hunter than in North Carolina under Major General John G. Foster. "The latter," wrote Shaw, "as likely as not, would make us do all the digging in the department." 19
Major General John Gray Foster commanded the Union forces in eastern North Carolina. He initially opposed black recruitment but reconsidered after the transfer of ten thousand of his troops to South Carolina created a need for additional men. Portrait from The National Cyclopedia of American Biography, 10:134.
Shaw's concerns underlined the fact that Andrew's enthusiasm was absolutely critical because Union officials in the state were far less sanguine about the prospect of raising black soldiers there. Edward Stanly, who had been appointed provisional governor in May 1862, was very hostile to any attempt to alter the status quo. He believed that the conflict was "a war of restoration and not of abolition and destruction." 20 The governor was convinced that many slaveholders were sincere unionists and that their property should be safeguarded. In January 1863, when former slaves who were employed as stewards in the navy or as servants for Union officers returned to Edenton to release their families, Stanly and the slave owners were outraged. He demanded that the blacks and the soldiers who accompanied them be punished for their "insolent" conduct. 21 Until his resignation in protest of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, Stanly would oppose the use of black troops. Even Major General John G. Foster, who had replaced General Ambrose E. Burnside as Union commander in eastern North Carolina in July 1862, was more interested in raising white troops in the state than enlisting African Americans. Despite the number of contrabands around New Bern, he believed that "not more than one Regiment, if even that could be raised in this Department by voluntary enlistment, and forced enlistment would of course alienate the negroes, the very object the Governor of Massachusetts wishes to avoid." He not only distrusted their "lack of discipline" but also believed that they would not enlist while they could work as civilians for the government. 22
Foster's concern resulted partly from the shortage of Federal troops left in his department following General Burnside's departure for Virginia with two full divisions. 23 The shortage of troops did, however, open the door to limited black military service, which in turn began the slow transformation of white attitudes toward the black male. Some Northern soldiers serving in the South were struck by the enthusiasm and emotional outpouring of Southern slaves to the Union occupation. 24 The general Northern response, on the other hand, was at the very best ambivalent. While some men such as Corporal Haines might refer to "our friends, the contrabands," one officer in Plymouth responded to calls for "protection" from blacks by giving them "a dozen stripes" with a rope. 25 William F. Draper wrote from New Bern to his father, who he believed would be celebrating the emancipation of the slaves in the West Indies. Draper then voiced his own views on abolition. "I hope ere many years to be able to celebrate the emancipation of the slaves in the U.S. I wish they would be colonized though." 26 Another Massachusetts soldier, Thomas J. Jennings, scoffed at such abolitionist attitudes. "You who are at home," he wrote a friend, "are as ignorant of the position and qualification of the Negroes, as they are of education." 27 In July 1862, when a New York soldier freed a slave who had sought freedom in Plymouth only to be recaptured by his owner, five other Northern soldiers seized the slave and arrested the would-be liberator. 28

I’ve been spending a lot of time at the Beverly Hills library. I go there almost every day, laptop in hand, impelled by the irrational idea that this is the only place in
the world where I can finish my new book. I also have an office with a great view and a house that’s empty and quiet all day where any normal person should be able to sit and work just fine, and yet, I have to get up and drive 15 minutes every morning to sit among dozens of strangers — some more strange than others — to find my focus.
If you ask my husband, he’ll tell you this is an improvement over the ritual I had to follow for my last novel: With that one, the only place I could write was in my car. That was uncomfortable for me and terribly embarrassing to my children, nothing like this library with its polished wood tables and designer lights, Kelly’s Fudge Factory and rows of hardcover books on sale for $1 each. It makes me wonder where I’ll end up with the next novel — if, indeed, there is a next novel.
I don’t know if all the talk about the impending demise of books and bookstores as we know them is true — if in 10 years, every book ever written will in fact be available online, as Google would like, and if even Barnes & Noble, the 800-pound gorilla of publishing, will indeed have succumbed to the Kindle. I don’t know if this library will still be standing in 10 years, or if it will be squeezed into digital archives instead. I think technology is a good thing: I remember when I and every other writer I knew insisted we would never switch from the typewriter to the PC; nowadays, I’m thinking of adopting my MacBook as my fourth child. And I don’t worry much about the future of storytelling either: People used to do that by drawing on cave walls. The manner of delivery changes, but not the task itself.
Still, I do wonder every day, as I walk through the lobby and up the steps to the “quiet area,” where else in this city one could find a group of regulars as diverse and eclectic as what we have right here. There is the usual contingent of homeless people with books and magazines in their hands, and the throngs of noisy kids who flock in around 3 o’clock. There is the glamour babe American woman in the leopard-print sweater who sits in the same armchair every time, looking like Catherine Deneuve on the set of some intellectual French film, and the young Asian couple who walk everywhere together, hand in hand and smiling like they’ve just been crowned homecoming king and queen. There is the blue-eyed Iranian girl on the second floor who stays immersed in her books for hours at a time, the red-haired librarian who wears gloves all day and moves around as if she is in perpetual hurry to save some priceless manuscript from being destroyed by callous readers, the elderly European woman who yells when she thinks she’s whispering, because she’s hard of hearing and so is her companion — and they get offended if anyone asks them to keep it down — How could you possibly hear us? We’re practically murmuring.
I wonder where all these other people would go if the library closed down, if all the books vanished into Kindle and newspapers were available only online, if the librarian put her gloves away and the kids lost their afternoon hangout. I used to be one of those kids, years ago in Iran, when I spent every recess and lunch hour in our school library. The boys would take over the yard to play soccer, and the girls all sat in the classrooms or in the stairway and talked about what they had watched on television — all the American sitcoms and soaps, “Bonanza” and “Days of Our Lives” and “The Wild Wild West” — the previous night. I couldn’t go outside, and I couldn’t participate in the girls’ conversations because I wasn’t allowed to watch TV on school nights, so I went into the library, where I was often alone — not even a librarian — and where no one cared what I read. I loved the books, yes, and loved the reading, but this was also the one place in the world where being alone did not mean you were weird.
I don’t know why any of these other patrons come to the library every day, but I have a feeling it isn’t just the free books and online access, and it certainly isn’t the tap water sold in plastic bottles as Kelly’s Water. I think we all come here to take refuge from one thing or another, from loneliness or the weather, from an unhappy family life or too many siblings at home, a long, empty day and nothing to fill the hours with, or 500 pages full of words that may or may not make sense, may or may not have a life outside of my MacBook, may or may not constitute a book.
So much has changed in the world since my middle-school days in Tehran. I believe most of it has been for the better, and that what lies ahead will be an improvement still. Then again, so much of what drives and defines the human psyche, of our needs and anxieties, has remained constant. I hope we can find a way — at least as far as books and newspapers and that unique and extraordinary solace some of us draw from places that house them — to tend to the psyche as we pursue change.

DANVILLE - The Danville Lady Little Johns got a basket with four seconds remaining in double overtime Thursday night to advance to the finals of the Yell County Tournament with a thrilling 45-44 victory over Dardanelle.
With 9.9 seconds remaining in the second overtime, Dardanelle's Shawna Hilton missed two free throws with her team up 44-43. Danville's Caitlin Ramey grabbed the rebound, raced down the sideline and then cut through the lane for a layup for the winning basket.
The win puts the Lady Little Johns' seniors in the final of the tournament for the first time in their career.
The game was a defensive battle early as both defenses controlled the game. Danville opened with a zone defense, while Dardanelle used a man-to-man with both being effective.
"I was pretty pleased with the way we played defense the whole game, but we couldn't get our offense going early," Danville coach Chris Watson said. "Shawna Hilton did a great job for them; she's a tough player. We need to do a better job of clicking on offense."
The first quarter was tight as Callie Woodard got Danville on the scoreboard first with a three-pointer only to be answered a minute later by Dardanelle's Katie Millard.
That was the first of two ties in the quarter. The score was tied again at 5-all, but Danville scored the last four points of the quarter to take a 9-5 lead into the second.
The Lady Lizards (6-8) would come out and dominate the second quarter, scoring 11 straight points and held the Lady Little Johns with a field goal for the entire quarter. Danville's only two points came on a pair of free throws by Woodard with 1:16 left in the half to cut the lead to 16-11.
In the third quarter, Dardanelle's lead toggled between four and seven points as Danville was unable to make a big move, but did manage to score the last three points to cut the lead to 22-18 heading into the final quarter.
The Lady Little Johns (10-2) got their offense on track in the final quarter, almost matching their output of the first three quarters.
Danville scored the first six points of the fourth quarter to retake the lead for the first time since the second quarter. Danville would lead most of the fourth until Dardanelle's Kylia Melder hit a trey with 1:09 left to give the Lady Lizards the lead back at 35-34. With 54 seconds remaining in regulation, Ramey hit on 1-of-2 free throws to tie the game and it would go into overtime tied at 35.
Both teams could manage just two points in the first overtime to send it to the second.
Danville got the first basket in the second OT to get the lead, but Hilton answered with a three-pointer on the other end to give the Lady Lizards the one-point edge. The lead would change hands four more times. With 45 seconds left Hilton hit a jumper in the lane to give her team a 44-43 edge, but Ramey's heroics with the final seconds ticking away gave the Lady Little Johns the victory.
Danville will play Ola in the final Saturday at 7:30 p.m.
The Dardanelle boys and Fourche Valley played in the late boys semifinals game on Thursday.
Junior girls
Danville 33, WYC 32
Samantha Rial sunk 1-of-2 free throws with 3.1 seconds left in the game to break a 32-all tie and help advance her team to Saturday's 5 p.m. final.
Rial led Danville with nine points with Jackie Dennis and Jessica Harris close behind with eight points each.
Western Yell County was led by Whitley Richardson with 12 points. Megan York and Krista Reagon followed with eight points apiece.
Danville will play Dardanelle in Saturday's final at 5 p.m.
Junior boys
Danville 41, WYC 25
Danville's Leroy Ruiz and Trent Davis scored 12 points each to lead the Junior Little Johns to Saturday's final against Daradnelle at 6:15 p.m.
Justin Palmertree added eight points for Danville.
Western Yell County was led by Cody West with nine points. Issac Inman and Curtis Bland were next with four points each.The title was promoted by the last poet laureate, Ted Hughes. His widow, Carol, attended yesterday's awards ceremony in London.
Blake was presented with the title for two years, and with a cheque for £10,000, by the Princess Royal. The judges were children, a librarian, a publisher, a critic and a bookseller.
Blake, who has published more than 100 books, formed a unique partnership with Dahl in 1975.
Peter Dickinson, author of The Changes Trilogy, and Anne Fine, whose book Madame Doubtfire inspired the Hollywood movie Mrs Doubtfire, were also on the shortlist.
James Naughtie, chairman of the judges, said: 'Quentin Blake's work doesn't simply introduce children to the world of adults, but draws adults into the world of children. The three authors who are being recognised today are literary giants.' Blake said that writing funny books for children was a serious trade. 'Children's books can be a celebration of what it is like to be a human being.'," the band said in the statement. ."?Seniors find little care in provincial aging strategy
Ontario's $1.1 billion Aging at Home plan has left out thousands of seniors who are sick and frail, but not sick and frail enough.

90-year-old Sou Ping Tsoi sits in her home with caregiver maggie Wu. Suffering from dementia, she only gets three hours a week home care.
A 90-year-old Scarborough woman with dementia is told she does not qualify for home care.
A daughter in Stouffville begs to keep a few home care hours for her 86-year-old father who is paralyzed by a stroke.
In Aurora, a woman who cares for her chronically ill husband, was refused home care after she broke her back.
These are some of the faces of Ontario’s Aging at Home strategy, a four-year program that began in 2008 with great promise.
A Toronto Star investigation has found the $1.1 billion strategy is failing many seniors by not providing the care they need to continue living at home. Most of the money has been diverted to a provincial plan that provides home care for seniors discharged from hospital beds and to provide care for very sick seniors so that they do not go to hospital emergency rooms.
Today, almost 5,000 seniors are stuck in Ontario hospitals though they no longer need hospital care. The cost of a day’s hospital care can be as high as nine times the cost of a day’s home care.
The problem: Thousands of other aging seniors who do not receive home care are ending up in hospital or on waiting lists for scarce nursing home beds, two expensive prospects that cash-strapped Ontario cannot afford.
The solution: The province has to redistribute some money to community care access centres and community agencies that want to care for seniors who have stayed out of hospital are trying to live at home.
The Star found numerous stories of seniors denied access to home care or just given a few paltry hours. They are forced to pay out-of-pocket for private care, rely on family for caregiver support or struggle on their own.
Sou Ping Tsoi, 90, lives with her family in the Pharmacy Ave. and Steeles Ave. area of Scarborough. She has dementia but family members are determined that she will stay at home.
Her daughter, Angelina, called her local Community Care Access Centre, one of 14 provincially funded agencies whose job it is to coordinate home care services like personal support, nursing, physiotherapy, and occupational and speech therapy. They serve 600,000 Ontario residents annually, more than half of them seniors.
“Somebody came to the house. They had a computer program to see if my mother was high urgency,” Angelina recalls. She asked for three hours of home care a day.
The CCAC worker replied: “We can’t do anything. We have a long waiting list.”
Provincial health minister Deb Matthews defended her government’s actions in an interview with the Star, saying they have boosted funding to home care and as a result, she said, 50 per cent more people are being helped. She did acknowledge gaps.
“There is always more we can do, there is no question about that. When it comes to home care there is, I think, a high demand and a growing demand. Probably no government could ever satisfy the demands for service.”
Over the next week, the Star is presenting stories of seniors in need.
Ontario’s population is aging. Waiting lists at provincially funded and regulated nursing homes are lengthy, with few new homes being built. Private retirement homes do provide options but a recent Star investigation revealed problems in care and with lack of oversight by the province.
Experts believe the best way to support the majority of seniors is in their homes and that led to the McGuinty government’s launch of its “Aging at Home Strategy” which vowed to transform community health care services “so that seniors can live healthy, independent lives in their own homes.”
Here’s how it was supposed to work: Seniors needing government-paid help, their family members or health-care providers would contact a Community Care Access Centre, which assesses the need and dispatches people to do a variety of tasks, from helping a senior bathe to preparing food to providing nursing care.
But soon after it was announced, the province began pushing the home care funding to a plan called ER/ALC. The goal was and is to cut wait times in emergency rooms and to rid hospital of patients referred to as Alternative Level of Care patients. Almost one in five patients in Ontario hospitals don’t need to be there and they cost taxpayers $450 a day, compared to as little as $50 a day for home care. A nursing home bed is $130 a day.
Advocates for more home care to support seniors who want to continue living at home recognize that the ER/ALC initiative is important. But increasingly, the ER/ALC plan is hijacking the Aging at Home plan. In the first year, an estimated 20 per cent of funding went to ER/ALC. By last year (the third year), all of it was focused on ER/ALC.
Last December, in a hard hitting report by Ontario’s Auditor General, the province was slammed for only using $45 million of the $1.1 billion promised to deliver care through Community Care Access Centres to seniors living at home. That report focused on the first two years of the four year plan. Figures for the three years now completed show only a slight improvement (in total $94.5 million of the $1.1 billion Aging at Home money has gone to the Access Centres).
As a result, people like Sou Ping Tsoi and Edith Quait in Aurora get little or no care. Read their stories and others over the next week in the Star.
The demand for home care is so heavy that workers are swamped, says Margaret Mottershead, chief executive officer of the Ontario Association of Community Care Access Centres.
“I don’t think there’s enough money going to home care,” Mottershead said.
In a prebudget submission, her association is asking the Ontario government to commit to at least $92 million annually to keep up with home care demands.
Asking such large organizations to operate without stability — with last minute funding injected from time to time — is like “forcing a plane to land on a postage stamp,” said the association’s Feb. 1 submission to a legislative committee.
If the government continues its random funding approach, CCACs will be forced to cut services and “clients will bear the impact,” of service cuts, the submission said.
The four year program is entering its final year (the $1.1 billion is divided over the four years).
University of Toronto professor Paul Williams says the trend away from preventative home care is incredibly short-sighted.
“In spending more money to get people out of the hospital, you will now have a lot less resources to keep people out in the first place,” Williams said.
With the focus on keeping the elderly out of hospital beds, some families say hospital staff is too quick to promote home care. Fragile and sick seniors are sent home with promises of intensive care from CCAC nurses, personal support workers and physiotherapists.
The Star found that some of those promises – like weekly visits from physiotherapists – barely materialized. After a few months, the CCAC’s cut hours of care to the point where some families feared they would collapse from the stress.
After Susan Bosak’s father, Ted, suffered a massive stroke, she brought him home from hospital after being told he was eligible for at least 21 hours of care each week.
Paralyzed down the right side of his body, it wasn’t long before the Central CCAC case manager decided to cut his hours, leaving Bosak begging for care.
She saw managers under pressure to cut hours and grew to loathe their visits to review the care.
“You truly feel like you are being interrogated,” Bosak said, “like their whole goal is to find as many hours as possible to cut. So your goal then becomes, how do I answer these questions so they don’t get cut?”
Cathy Szabo, chief executive officer of the Central Community Care Access Centre said funding limits mean they are forced to make tough decisions.
The expectations of seniors, Szabo said, will have to change.
?”
For each high-needs senior the Central CCAC serves, another 20 with low or moderate needs are declined, referred instead to community support service organizations.
Ontario has 750 non-profit community support agencies that deliver meals, provide drivers for doctor’s appointments or send personal support workers into the home. They charge clients fees, based on their income.
But the community groups are struggling too, said Susan Thorning, head of the Ontario Community Support Association.
Of Ontario’s $43.5 billion in health care spending last year, only 1 per cent, or $540 million, was spent on community support groups, she said.
“We are just a rounding error in the health budget. It’s hard to get a lot of attention when you’re that small,” she said.
Despite the intense focus on keeping the very sick seniors at home, the province has only had limited success.
There are currently 4,558 patients, mostly seniors, in Ontario hospitals, taking up 16 per cent of all beds, even though they no longer require hospital care, according to the Ontario Hospital Association. That number has barely budged in the last three years.
OHA president Tom Closson says the numbers are “staggering.” What’s even more worrisome, he says, is the trend. While the situation has improved in some parts of the province, it has worsened in others and province-wide, the numbers are not getting any better.
In Windsor this week a crisis was declared by health officials because hospitals are overcrowded.
“In a way, all the work we have been doing for the last three years has just allowed us to tread water, but hasn’t allowed us to put a real dent in this growing problem,” he says.
“It’s not good for the patients and it’s costing a lot of money,” he adds.
Health Minister Matthews said the focus on hospitals is a “top priority” because that is where the needs are so urgent.
As for judging the success of the Aging at Home Strategy, the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences was to do a thorough assessment but the plans were quietly nixed last year.

HLNtv.com will answer some of the most-asked questions in a series of seven articles that will publish every day this week called Arias Trial FAQs, or frequently asked questions.
It is very difficult to say what could delay the Jodi Arias trial at this stage, because anything could happen.
The first jury couldn’t reach a unanimous decision about whether to sentence the convicted murderer to death or life in prison. So Arias is now facing a retrial for the penalty phase of her trial, and a new jury will be selected to decide what her sentence will be.
The new penalty phase of the Arias trial is scheduled to begin July 18. Judge Sherry Stephens also scheduled a status hearing on June 20 to check in with the attorneys about their preparations for the new phase of the trial.
At the June 20 hearing, either side could ask for more time to prepare their case for the retrial, and it will be up to the judge to decide if the attorneys should be given more time to prepare.
Another possible delay could occur if Stephens releases defense attorneys Kirk Nurmi and Jennifer Willmott from the case.
HLN legal experts say this is unlikely to happen, because Stephens has already denied the defense team's multiple requests to quit the case.
If for some reason Stephens does allow Nurmi and Willmott off the case, new attorneys may need more time to prepare for the retrial of the penalty phase, since they'll have to get caught up on the case and the previous phases of the trial, too. This could potentially push the start date of the retrial later than July 18.
If new defense attorneys are not given an adequate amount of time to prepare for the case, it could help Arias' appeal of ineffective counsel in regards to her sentence.
However, Stephens, who may want to avoid another delay, might not let Arias’ current attorneys, Nurmi and Willmott, off the hook., Arizona, right now.
Join the conversation...Outerwall (NASDAQ: OUTR ) has had a crazy two months. Lowered third quarter guidance sent the stock down 22% in two days, only for it to rally all the way back to 52-week highs when activist investment firm Jana Capital Partners entered the fray with a 13.5% stake. Jana Capital believes that there is still plenty of value to be found at Outerwall, but they would like to trim the fat and create a leaner company. Outerwall's board has said that they "Welcome the opinion of its shareholders," and therefore they may sell or discontinue a part of the business, as Jana Capital desires. They have five segments to choose from:
1. Coinstar
2. Redbox
3. Redbox Instant by Verizon
4. Rubi Coffee
5. EcoAtm
Coinstar for free?
Coinstar Kiosks have undergone some significant changes recently. Now, the consumer has three options for exchanging their coins, and two of them do not have a fee. First there is the classic exchange of Coins for Cash with about a 10% fee. The new fee free additions are Coins for Gift Cards and Coins for Money in your Paypal account. The addition of both the gift card and PayPal options are very smart moves. Personally the fee always deterred me, so providing alternatives has certainly swayed this Fool to be pro-Coinstar.
The will to survive
Redbox is an ingenious business. It now has over 43,600 Kiosks that provide instant gratification for New Release Movies. New Release is a critical aspect of this business because it really does hold a competitive advantage over Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) by having the newest movie content. Another plus for Redbox is that it has experienced 12.6% growth with Blu-Ray rentals, which has an edge over streaming services because of higher picture and sound quality.
This year 86% of Outerwall's revenue was from the Redbox business. Redbox's iconic kiosk video rental business has defied the market's thesis of being a doomed enterprise for several years now. That is, until Outerwall missed expectations in the second quarter and lowered guidance for the third quarter because of too many promotions and a shorter average rental time per DVD. Both are big concerns for the business, but with Q3 results hot off the press I think Outerwall may have been overly cautious.
The promotions issue appears to have been remedied now that free Red Box Instant trial subscriptions have slowed, and therefore four free kiosk rentals are not being given out so easily. It actually paid off with an increase in traffic leading to a solid finish for the quarter.
David and Goliath vs. Goliath and Goliath
Billions of dollars are spent by Netflix and Amazon to obtain streaming rights for massive libraries. This simply cannot be overcome by Netflix providing a similar, but poorer, service. The group effort of Redbox Instant by Verizon has fallen well short of being viewed as a threat in the streaming marketplace.
The best part about the subscription isn't even having instant streaming, but receiving four movies for use at one of their kiosks. A more strategic approach would have been to focus on the strength of the Redbox kiosks: having the newest DVD content. Translate this focus to the streaming service and they have a niche service. Why compete with Netflix and Amazon in a game they are not willing to lose. A new plan needs to be made to produce a competitive product. Even an on-demand format that can be competitively priced works. Until then, this service will be a drain upon both Outerwall and Verizon.
New ventures: Rubi coffee and EcoATM
Innovation is the driving force that will keep Outerwall a quality investment for years to come. Both Rubi coffee and EcoATM are new Kiosk products released this year, and both have a lot of potential. Rubi self-serve coffee kiosks feature Seattle's Best coffee, a Starbucks brand, and provide an instant solution to customers searching for Starbucks coffee. There are currently 280 Rubi Kiosks across the United States, with plans for expansion.
On July 1, Outerwall purchased EcoATM for $350 million. Currently, there are 800 EcoATMs which provide an automated self-serve kiosk system to purchase used mobile phones, tablets and MP3 players for cash. Customers can recycle old cell phones in exchange for cash, which is great for customers and is environmentally friendly. These two businesses are merely getting started. It is still too early to even contemplate selling or discontinuing them because the ideas are good, and both have the potential to really drive revenue growth.
Targeted weight loss
Jana Capital Partners has publicly stated that they are interested in selling or discontinuing certain businesses and I agree fully. Management needs to focus on what fits their business plan, "To deliver new and innovative consumer products in compact, automated formats."
I believe that Redbox Instant by Verizon does not fit their business plan, and therefore should be sold. The product is far too inferior, and it is simply not worth the money to try to compete with two companies willing to invest billions in themselves. If Outerwall can trim the fat and stay lean while focusing on the segments that work, it will continue to grow to new heights.
Will Redbox overcome Amazon?.Wireless Authors: Liz McMillan, Pat Romanski, Elizabeth White, Carmen Gonzalez, Tim Hinds

Findings also highlight cost as primary barrier to transition to all-flash environments:
41 per cent of respondents say performance is the most important characteristic when evaluating SSDs, with reliability and endurance rounding out the top three.
40 per cent of respondents would choose MLC if they were the storage purchase decision maker for their data centre, compared to 30 per cent for single-level cell (SLC).
Only seven per cent of respondents would select triple-level cell (TLC) NAND Flash for their enterprise environment, if it were available.

Took a second trip to the light house. It's worth the price to climb to the top. The view is fantastic. It's got a lot of history and great storyboards and things to look at describing what life was like at the light house. It's also worth walking the grounds and heading to the shore in front of the light...

Uncharted 2.
Now between the other two I'd say Modern Warfare will have a slight advantage, but be sure to get Uncharted 2.

@Dezner: No need to keep making fun of him for trading his old games in. I just traded in a bunch of my old games last Tuesday, and I got a pretty good value, considering (25% powertrade boost on the lot helped, of course). No point keeping games we aren't playing anymore, right? Or in my case, games I impulse-bought and will definitely never play because I have too many as it is, so I'm weeding out the collection. I'm getting a lot better at avoiding stupid impulse purchases, so it's all good.

@Adam: Some Gamestop's used to carry them, and most will still take them as trades, but for piddly amounts. Your best shot would be to find a MovieStop (same company, of course), as I think since it deals solely in movies, the trade values are a bit better. Thing is, it's a pretty new chain, with only 46 locations in the US as of July, so I don't know if there's one near you or not.

Makes: 4 servings
Prep: 15 mins
Cook: 45 mins
- 7 small yellow-fleshed potatoes, such as yukon gold
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 2 ounces monterey jack cheese, shredded
- 3 tablespoons reduced-fat plain yogurt
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped pickled jalapeno chile
- Salt and pepper
- Olive.
- Slice 6 potatoes in half. Scoop out half of the flesh from each piece and add to the broccoli. Peel and finely chop the remaining potato and add to the mixture. Add the cheese, 2 tablespoons yogurt and the jalapeno; mash coarsely and season with salt and pepper.
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees . Arrange the potato halves cut side down on a baking sheet and lightly coat them with cooking spray; invert and season with salt and pepper. Divide the stuffing among the potato halves. Lightly coat with cooking spray and sprinkle with chili powder. Bake until golden, about 20 minutes. Garnish with the remaining 1 tablespoon yogurt and more chili powder.
Tip
- Potatoes are a super source of vitamin C.
Tip
- Broccoli adds heft to the stuffing, so these snacks are plenty filling.
Tip
- The jalapeno offers a savory-spicy punch that bumps up the flavor (so you can use less cheese).On the outside, the 14-year-old Gemäldegalerie in Berlin is not a pretty sight, but inside it is a perfectly planned, high-tech space for the old masters collection it houses. (Courtesy of Staatliche Museen zu Berlin)
BERLIN—A cultural foundation in Berlin has stirred up a storm with its plans to move the Gemäldegalerie’s entire collection of old masters paintings, one of Europe’s greatest, with half of it going into storage. A donated collection of 20th-century art will replace the 3,000 heritage works, a decision that is angering art historians and art lovers around the world.
The emptied-out Gemäldegalerie, in the Kulturforum district of Berlin, is slated to host Heiner Pietzsch’s private collection of 20th-century art, which he donated to Berlin under the condition that it would always be on public view.
Pietzsch’s collection, valued at $190 million, according to The Guardian, features “classic modern” works, including paintings by Mark Rothko, René Magritte, Joan Miró, Jackson Pollock, Max Ernst, and Salvador Dalí.
Using the specially designed museum for 20th-century modern works ‘would be like using a Rolls Royce as a delivery van for veggies.’
The museum currently displays a cultural timeline of high art dating from medieval times (A.D. 1200) up to the early 19th century: masterpieces by Caravaggio and Canaletto, Giotto and Botticelli, but also Lucas Cranach, Rogier van der Weyden, and Rembrandt, to name a few.
The biggest bone of contention is that only a portion the old masters paintings and sculptures will be displayed, and there is no assurance of a new appropriate venue to house them in the future.
The decision has met with rising protests from art historians and the public, both inside Germany and abroad.
An open letter to the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation by the Association of Art Historians, with 4,500 signatures, reads: “These plans … rob one of the world’s finest and, despite its wartime losses, most comprehensive collections of Old Master paintings of its unique capacity … to present more than 500 years of European painting history in encyclopedic scope in works of the very highest quality.”
Another ongoing petition letter, initiated by Jeffrey Hamburger, professor of German art and culture, Harvard University, has been signed by 11,185 members of the art world. Hamburger believes the art works have become pawns in a political chess game.
Artist James Gurney, famous for his New York Times bestseller “Dinotopia,” and an Art Renewal Center living master, reported the case on his blog GurneyJourney, one of the most read art blogs worldwide. He thinks having half the collection in storage would be a tragic loss.
“Art museums have an important responsibility to keep a broad range of historical artwork available on view for the benefit of scholars, art students, and the public,” he told The Epoch Times.
In response to the opposition, Hermann Parzinger, president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, said to German newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau that he was surprised by the rising criticism. He said at first that the foundation would only consider the plan if it were temporary—for five or six years.
If the plan is carried out, half of the Gemäldegalerie inventory is supposed to be displayed at the Bode Museum on Berlin’s Museumsinsel (museum island), while the other half, plus half of the Bode Museum’s sculpture collection, will have to be kept in storage.
Critics say the move should only be started once an adequate new museum is found or built.
“It must be a key for a key. One wouldn’t move into a tent if told that his new house wouldn’t be started, if ever, until after 2018,” said art historian Eberhard König in a statement.
Lengthy Timeline
Later in the same interview, Parzinger admits the timespan for a new building is at least seven to nine years. The earliest date for an official architectural announcement would be 2016, followed by at least four to five years of construction.
This is considered by some to be a gross understatement. It could very well be indefinite, considering Berlin’s mountain of debt, and the stop-and-go construction chaos that surrounded the rebuilding of the old Stadtschloss castle. It was destroyed in the 1950′s, being declared as a symbol of “Prussian militarism” by the GDR regime in East Germany by the socialists.
Art restorers are also deeply concerned about moving and storing the sensitive old paintings, according to a Berliner Morgenpost report.
“For this immense castling of the most precious and most sensitive works of art, a complex plan has to be established,” the restorers’ union said in the report.
A Culture Fight
The Gemäldegalerie, which only opened 14 years ago, is considered an architectural masterpiece with highly developed technology designed to create a perfect climate for the old paintings.
As Niklas Maaks of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung puts it, using the specially designed museum for 20th-century modern works “would be like using a Rolls Royce as a delivery van for veggies.”
Defending the controversial plan, Parzinger told the Franfurter Rundschau he is “not impressed … by standardized letters that can be signed with a mouse-click and then sent on.”
Meanwhile, Bernd Neumann, state minister of Culture and Media, is calling for a new master plan to restructure all of Berlin’s art museums. The original master plan from the 1990s was to relocate the old masters paintings to the Museumsinsel, but it was too small.
Politicians are getting on board too, with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) promising to listen to the public and push forward the location issues.
The most prominent director of the old masters collection of paintings, Wilhelm von Bode, had wanted to combine the collections of sculptures and paintings into one building in 1904, with the opening of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum on the Museumsinsel, which has been renamed the Bode Museum.Traditionalists have always promoted plans for the old masters to be exhibited all together. But such plans were neglected due to the immense space needed to combine and present the collections from East and West Berlin, and the money needed was instead already going toward the new building, the Gemäldegalerie.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS; A Pulitzer Winner Who Can Go Home Again
By JANE GROSS, Special to the New York Times
Published: May 4, 1988
POINT REYES STATION, Calif., April 28— David Mitchell sat at his rolltop desk, an old Royal typewriter to his left and a Macintosh computer to his right, and thumbed through the latest issue of The Point Reyes Light, the weekly newspaper at which he won a Pulitzer Prize nine years ago.
In those days, the burning issue for Mr. Mitchell's newspaper was Synanon, a neighboring drug treatment center, and former members who charged in the prize-winning articles that the organization had used violence and threats. These days the issue is the swelling population of Mexicans who work as dairy ranch hands, most of them illegal aliens who are becoming active citizens in this tiny town between the green hills and the Pacific surf.
The issues and vistas are dear to Mr. Mitchell, dearer than he knew in 1981 when he sold The Light and headed 40 miles south to the big stories of San Francisco and its afternoon daily, The Examiner. A Return From the City
After two and a half unhappy years, Mr. Mitchell returned here and repurchased The Light. ''At a big paper, you never have the feeling that you're vital to its functioning, that it matters if you show up or don't show up,'' he said. ''But now I'm not wondering all the time what it's like, whether I should have gone and done that.''
The Light is so small, he said, that the bookkeeper bundles the papers and the two reporters deliver them. ''We're so small that if someone is sick on a key day, it puts the paper into a tailspin,'' he said.
Like the value of the gold Pulitzer medal in Mr. Mitchell's safe, Mr. Mitchell's fortunes have risen and fallen since he won the award in 1979. First there were heady times, when network television crews came calling in rented helicopters. Mr. Mitchell and his former wife, Cathy, signed a book contract and CBS produced a drama about them. The Bad Times
Then the Mitchells' marriage collapsed. Neither had enough money to buy out the other's share in the newspaper, which in its best year, 1980, earned a net profit of $17,000.
The Mitchells chose to quit Point Reyes Station. Mr. Mitchell accepted a job as a reporter at The Examiner. Mrs. Mitchell taught at the University of North Carolina. The couple sold The Light for $100,000. Of the purchase price, the Mitchells received only $5,000 in cash, holding notes on the balance that went unpaid over the next few years.
Meanwhile, Mr. Mitchell struggled with the transition from big fish to little fish. He was increasingly unhappy at The Examiner except for a few assignments in Central America and Southeast Asia. He disliked having to pitch stories to editors; once, he had made such decisions in the blink of an eye.
Almost never did he think he had made a real difference. ''Here, I can honestly say that the most significant reporting on west Marin County is being done by The Point Reyes Light,'' Mr. Mitchell said from his office, in a building that was once the town's creamery. Financial Obstacles
From a financial standpoint, coming home was not easy. Mr. Mitchell knew The Light was in disarray because the interim owners had defaulted and had sold much of the paper's darkroom and production equipment.
With several thousand dollars from his employment at The Examiner, Mr. Mitchell took up where he had left off, cushioned by the salary of his second wife, Cynthia, who manages computer systems for the City of San Francisco. Mr. Mitchell does not draw a salary from The Light, which has a circulation of 3,400 and earned a net profit of $6,217.27 last year.
Managing and improving the paper under such financial constraints is clearly a stimulant to Mr. Mitchell. First he renovated The Light's offices, borrowing money against his 1980 Volkswagen Rabbit convertible to buy Sheetrock and enlisting his neighbors' carpentry skills.
Then, last year, there was a timely bonanza: his half-share of a $100,000 settlement from Synanon, which followed a slander suit against the Mitchells and their countersuit for harassment. With that money, Mr. Mitchell bought computers that allow him to set type on late articles right up until the Wednesday-night deadline. Changing the Paper
Mr. Mitchell also modernized the content of The Light. His most controversial addition is a column by Dr. Eleanor Hamilton, Point Reyes's 78-year-old equivalent of Dr. Ruth, who writes about cohabitation, impotence and the like. He also added a Spanish-language column by Alicia Hernandez, 13 years old, who describes the life of a youngster recently arrived from Mexico.
The wave of Mexican immigration has been The Light's most significant story. Initially Mr. Mitchell feared it would ''stir up racism or some kind of xenophobia'' in the community, and he approached the influx of immigrants tangentially.
Under the headline ''The Coast's Ethnic Heritage,'' The Light charted five waves of immigration in the area, beginning with the Irish in the 19th century and followed by Swiss-speaking Italians, Yugoslavs and Portuguese. ''When you present it as something that's always gone on, that contributes to making the community the interesting place that it is, then it's not as threatening,'' Mr. Mitchell said.
Odd bits of evidence suggest that Mr. Mitchell knew from the first that his move to San Francisco was ill advised. He never sold his shingle house, on a hillside where horses graze and lupines and poppies grow. And his license plate has always read LIGHT.
When Mr. Mitchell resumed his column, ''Sparsely, Sage and Timely,'' he began this way, ''As I was saying before being so abruptly interrupted a couple of years ago, newspapering in west Marin has always been an unpredictable business.'' He went on to write of his unsettling experiences at The Examiner.
''As I saw myself succumbing,'' Mr. Mitchell continued, ''I took a breath and broke free. Now I'm back in the publisher's chair. Its upholstery is worn, but it feels so comfortable I'm planning to stay put.''

Roy is coming off an All Star season and a fat contract. Expectations are high for him, and they should be. He is going to continue to be the crux of our team, and our defense in particular. Roy locking down the paint and being a consistent threat on offense is what will make this machine work.
Paul George is coming off a second season where he started to get some attention. The Slam Dunk Contest and his huge 30 point game in Dallas, added to the tough defense he has earned a reputation for has all given Paul a name nationally. I think the expectations for this season are higher among Pacers fans than among the general NBA fan, but it's out there.
I think Roy continues the strong play we saw last year, and probably has a slight bump in stats based on increased minutes. Hopefully some more consistency and strength will be evident, but Roy is likely to stop improving so drastically and simply settle into his prime.
Paul should make a good jump based on his work, his focus, and his coaching. The stats will likely come and go still, as he's not going to be the likely focus of many gameplans. Our team's strength lies in the balance and the options we have, so we'll continue to see 10 point games followed by 20 point games. I think his average will go up and his defense hopefully remains rock solid, and maybe even improves in the few areas he struggled.
So from an improvement standpoint, Paul is likely to have the better season.
From a raw impact on the team, game, and NBA, Roy will still have the better season. If Paul even challenges Roy on the grander scale, the Pacers could beat Miami in the playoffs.The Leonard Bernstein Letters

Excerpt: The Leonard Bernstein Letters
Leonard Bernstein to Aaron Copland
40 Charlton Street, New York, NY
[?June 1942]
Dear Aaron Copland, Earth-Scorcher, Location-Adorner,
Charming, charming to get your letter. I know I've been remiss, as they say in elegant diction, but so have you, and I've been moving, for a change. Look! This is my fourth address this year, and a few more are coming up soon. I can hardly keep track of myself. I find myself getting off the subway at 23rd instead of Houston, which is now my locale (and not a bad one, either, if you like that sort of thing) ... Oh yes, I forgot: I'm conducting the [Copland] Outdoor Overture with the Goldman Band June 19 in Prospect Park and June 20th in Central Park. It's good fun seeing the old notes again; though I'm completely nonplussed by all the fancy instruments, their incomprehensible arrangement on the page, and especially on the stage. And I must memorize the damn thing, since your lovely big manuscript score won't fit on the bandstand. All in all quite a job. Goldman, in fact, had asked me to be his assistant this summer, and the pulled a long face, saying that the budget would not allow an assistant. Sounds like a typical Bernstein, doesn't it?
To make sure that you'll keep reading this, I'll start a new paragraph. It must be a strain.
Who(m) do you think called me up the other day from his house in Westport? [Conductor Fritz Reiner, then music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. –ed.] And he wants to do my Symphony [No. 1, Jeremiah] in Pittsburgh next fall, and he loves it, and he wants me to conduct a program anyway, and maybe to do the Symph myself! Lovely lovely news. But he is most anxious for a fourth movement, insists it's all too sad and defeatist. Same criticism my father had; which raises Pop in my estimation no end. I really haven't the time or energy for a fourth movement. I seem to have had my little say as far as that piece is concerned, and I want to get on with something else. And parts have to be made. Real young composer tsurus [Yiddish for "difficulty"] ... But my real function, I find, is to be the middle-man between all the pairs of antagonists and antipathetic little cliques here. They're all my friends, and hence none of them is really my friend. I go around justifying [Jean] Berger to [William] Schuman, and Schuman to [Paul] Bowles, and [Virgil] Thomson to Schuman and Bowles to [David] Diamond, and I'm always having dinner with all of them but none of the ever has dinner with any other one of them. Good Lord, I'm lucid and articulate tonight! Must be the invigorating air (of the Outdoor Overture, I mean, not, certainly, of Charlton Street).
It just looks as though I'll never see you. Though, b'God, if that Simon job comes through (and there's a competition factor, with old Szirmay [composer Albert Sirmay]) I'll take the dough and fly to Mexico to see you. Nothing can stop me, once there is dough. Really, Aaron, I don't understand how and why I get along at all with you away so long. And here's what I mean:
The Frau-sessions [with Bernstein's psychoanalyst Marketa Morris] [Paul.
David Diamond is going to study the piano with me! And don't let him kid you into that "outdone me" stuff; the soldier (what a boy!) would rather have come with me, but DD had done all the work, and the soldier was afraid of a scene. As it turned out, he came to my room the next night, full of love and amusement.
One final experience — and then we close, with love to Victor [photographer Victor Kraft, with whom Copland had started a romantic relationship in the 1940s and with whom Copland was intermittently involved for decades to come]. Last night I resolved to stay home for a change and cook my own dinner and study. Which I did; but just as I had begun to work, there was a blackout. I went up on the roof to see it all (I have a marvelous roof) and found a young soldier there, in the blackout, who, it turns out, lives with the housekeeper downstairs. Sure enough, he knew me, had attended my concerts, worshipped me; and there was fun. Until the lights went on; and he turned out to be so fat that I could hardly stand it; and now I'm in a Bernsteinian pickle, with an adoring fatman and no wish to see him and life in a high school is hard. Moral: if you need sex, don't go searching everywhere — look in your own back yard. Which does not necessarily apply to you! All kinds of love, and write soon.

Leonard Bernstein: Talk given at the "Night of Stars" Memorial to President Kennedy at Madison Square Garden
New York, NY
25 November 1963 [three days after President Kennedy's assassination] followed from this death, we must somehow gather strength for the increase of man, strength to go on striving for those goals he cherished. In mourning him, we must be worth become the mission of every artist, of every Jew, and of every man of good will: to insist, unflaggingly, at the risk of becoming a repetitive bore, but to insist on the achievement of a world in which the mind will have triumphed over violence.
We musicians, like everyone else, are numb with sorry.PASTA WITH BROAD BEAN AND HERB PESTO
First of all I would like to say Hi Melanie! And now when I have done that, I’d like to suggest her and you to make this pasta with broad bean and herb pesto because I think it will make you happy. It made me happy but then it is not that difficult to make me happy when it comes to food, I am not a fussy person, well a bit when it is me cooking but not when someone else has cooked me something. But this I cooked and it made me happy. In spring we have a very typical broad bean dish, or fave as they are called in Italian, here in Tuscany, you eat fresh ones with pecorino cheese and bread but I wanted to go on step beyond that but still keep the main ingredients so I made a ‘pesto’ with broad beans, pecorino cheese, sage and mint instead.
If you cannot find fresh broad beans, use frozen ones or try some other type of fresh, green beans. And if you can’t find pecorino cheese, use parmesan instead
PASTA WITH BROAD BEAN AND HERB PESTO
4 servings
400 gr pasta
1-1,2 kg/2,2-2,6 lb fresh broad beans, pods and all
5-6 leaves fresh sage
8-10 leaves fresh mint
6-8 tblsp pecorino cheese, freshly grated
salt
6-8 tblsp extra-virgin olive oil
– Put on the pasta water and cook the pasta during the other procedures of this recipe.
– De-pod the broad beans and boil them in lightly salted water for 4-5 minutes. Drain the water and then press out the actual bean from the skin.
– Chop the herbs coarsely and put them in a mortar together with 2/3 of the broad beans (save the rest for later), add cheese, olive oil and a pinch of salt before you start the pestling. You can also let it do a quick run in a blender but I prefer the rougher texture you get when you use a mortar.
– Add the remaining broad beans and stir, if needed you can add more olive oil or a little of the cooking liquid, the pesto should have a slightly runny consistency.
– Mix the broad bean pesto with the freshly cooked pasta and serve.

Are broad beans the same as fava? I love them! Have wanted to try a green vegetable pasta and this one looks lovely and so delcious! This really is a great spring meal! Happy Easter, Ilva!
Those are gorgeous favas! I’ve been buying them when I see them – which hasn’t been often…. Maybe more will be coming. I want to make this!

That sounds great! I made a pea and parsley pesto with Parmesan for my kids yesterday and they gobbled it up. Love the idea of using broad beans and herbs …
Thanks for the post, delicious. I’m brushing up on my Italian cooking, studying Italian too on Babbel.com (). It’s been rewarding to learn the cooking and language in tandem.
You are SOOOOO funny. I think of you every day, not just because I read your posts but because you are such a special person in the world. Saw our dear friend this last weekend. My goodness I wish we could share more meals together. And yes, I will cook this delicious happy dish.
Just wanted to tell you that your site still gives a warning… the big red screen warns you/me to stay away.. Not what I want to
Not lond now till I am in Tuscany, eating the local food
Yes they are and they are fantastic, so happy you like them too!
I’m surprised you don’t find them more often, do you want me to send you seeds?
ja de är så gooda!
thanks Ahn!
thank you!
Sarah-that sounds like a wonderful combination, must try it!
thanks!
I DO agree! when are you coming over? Big hug to you my dear!
thanks Karen, am investigating it!
yes and we will hopefully meet!
I LOVE broad beans but it’s always so frustrating that you get out so little from a large amount to begin with. But after all, it’s worth it. I think I’m gonna try growing them this year!
My grandma used to buy broad beans and we’d always help her take them out their hull. This looks really great.Roen Salvage Co. of Sturgeon Bay was awarded a $1.7 million contract for Green Bay harbor dredging.

I have a DVR with Time warner & hooked up my DVD recorder with an RF modulator for my older tv & I assumed it worked because I can watch cable with the DVD recorder on. My problem is recording, I tried 2x today & my DVD-R was blank, no audio or video. Does anyone know the problem, or any suggestions?
Thanks!
Thanks!Underwater Cycling
Adventures In Exercise: Aqua Studio Underwater Cycling
Written by Carlye Wisel
There is no greater pleasure on earth than getting lattice ass indentations from sitting at a poolside plastic picnic table while dunking popcorn into a plastic cup of nacho cheese with wet, drippy, post-pool hands that are drying off both in the sun and on top of your soft pretzel’s enormous salt crystals. I love pools. I love the whole experience. I am one with water.
But I hate exercise. I detest physical exertion, sweating, racerback tanks, public grunting, and walls of mirrors that seem to galvanize exactly what I try to hide. Since the days of arm floaties, I’ve been on a quest to discover any physical activity/exercise class that could pass as a mix of recess and fifth grade P.E. class. Continuously, I sign myself up for the most…exotic classes I can find, which brings me to the early early morning I spent at Tribeca’s Aqua Studio, home of the no-seriously-it-exists activity of underwater cycling.
I rolled into the bougie-cute all-black-everything locker room at the studio like a geriatric G, wearing a Nike one-piece, not knowing what to expect. Every review I read called the pedaling class awkward, the splashing distracting and even deemed the entire process to reach new heights of weird. In New York, that is no small feat.
So was it as weird as foretold? Absolutely – but more important to keep in mind is that it is not SoulCycle. I repeat, because this seems to be the general aquatic spinner’s hiccup on his/her way to bathtub biker status: this is not SoulCycle. There are no motivational phrases splashed across walls or neon sweatpants. You’ll be focused on trying not to hit another bike during the arm swings portion rather than chugging water in unison alongside a crew of mind-blowingly lean “woo!” girls.
You might even go so far as to call the Aqua Studio class boring (there are no Rihanna remixes) but you know what, that would kind of be like calling a massage boring.
Frankly, it is a special experience. While you don’t get that that Lululemon-cloaked, Type-A, borderline-psychotic, bright-red-face-drenched-in-sweat workout that New Yorkers aim for, that’s also the point.
Your body is calmly reaping the benefits – increased blood flow, low joint impact, improved cardiovascular endurance and oddly, cellulite burning – of underwater exercise:
Don’t be fooled, though. Underwater cycling is hard. But just like college and dating and throwing a brunch party, it’s also only as difficult as you make it. Your tiny jelly-clad feet could pedal gently through the water resistance, or you could grit your teeth and quietly, calmly hill-climb like Sir Lance-a-lot Armstrong without breaking a noticeable sweat.
My inner thighs were inoperable for a straight 24 hours, I didn’t mind it at all.
It may take a couple classes for your body to figure out how to do it all properly, but it’s worth trying twice because you’ll spend the entire first class doing two things: questioning if it’s working, and praying to the urethral gods that you’re not wetting yourself.
As the proprietor of what could be referred to as a fussy vagina, I spent an extended half hour terrified that I was going to pee my suit. Terrified to the point that I started wondering if my bladder had fallen too low, wishing I’d paid better attention to vaginal mesh lawyers-for-hire commercials. It’s a curious experience for sure, but then again, most of the great ones are.
Lingering questions answered below.
How shitty will I look after? Wet hair is nearly inevitable from the arm portion of the exercise. Buy a swim cap or top-bun it and be careful.
What do I need to know? The studio is women-only, save for a duo of male instructors. Get there 10-15 minutes before your class, and whatever you do, don’t use the peppermint shower soap in your hoo-ha, unless you’re into that sort of Gold Bond-y burning thing.
What in God’s name do I wear? (Almost) anything goes. A one-piece bathing suit, sports bra and shorts or athletic-looking bikini works, but shorts are recommended due to thigh-seat friction. Required shoe rentals are available for $2.
Worth it? Yes, because worst case scenario, you just spent an hour at an athletic amusement park and didn’t waste an extra $20 trying to win an XL stuffed Garfield toy.

During my few years in the Southern Appalachians few things gave me as much pleasure as an afternoon out cruising the parkway. I have had the good fortune to live in Waynesville and Banner Elk, North Carolina; both towns that lie within 10 miles of the parkway. I used it as a gateway to dozens of trailheads, a means of relaxation after a long day, and one of the most scenic routes to a grocery store anyone can take in North America. Every time I drove it I would remind myself that this was not a road to take for granted and when the time finally came to move back north I knew the Blue Ridge Parkway would be one of the things I would miss the most. Well, it's been almost a year now since I've had to look at one of those little brown signs and try to figure out if I wanted to go north or south (this was very confusing near Waynesville as the parkway actually travels east-west) and as my way of coping with my "BRP Withdrawl" I've put this little interactive scrapbook together. Some of these photos are more mundane than others but I think, as a whole, they capture all the things I loved most about it...the mountain farmlands of southern Virginia, the rugged overlooks of the High Country, and the top-of-the-world driving experince south of Asheville.

As a 28nm silicon chip, the Kaveri APU packs 2.41 billion transistors. The biggest change in terms of architecture for Kaveri is its use of AMD's x86 Steamroller architecture, a multi-threaded architecture focusing on enhancing the Instruction Per Cycle (IPC) rate by up to 20 percent.
Being the first APU to feature AMD's heterogeneous system architecture (HSA), a system of shared memory and heterogeneous queuing that allows both the CPU and GPU to create and dispatch work independently and efficiently, Kaveri is touted by AMD as having up to 12 compute cores.
However, this refers to four CPU cores and eight AMD Graphics Core Next (GCN) compute units linked via HSA. This suggests that the integrated graphics processing hardware will assist with compute tasks, though whether this proves true remains to be seen.
Nevertheless, AMD promises that Kaveri will deliver "vastly superior performance" over its competition, with no prizes for guessing that refers to Intel's Haswell CPU launched last autumn.
The flagship Kaveri APU is named A10-7850K and is designed to battle separate CPU and GPU system configurations. This replaces AMD's previous Richland APU, named the A10-6800K.
The A10-7850K will be clocked at 3.7GHz, hitting 4GHz in turbo mode. AMD's slides claim 87 percent performance improvement over Intel's Core i5 4670K CPU in gaming performance using the 3D Mark benchmarking tool, 63 percent improvement over the same Intel chip in compute power and 24 percent improvement in system performance.
Kaveri will ship on 14 January. We'll have a more detailed look at the chip before then, so be sure to check back. µAntique Jewelry Information

Production of cellulase by Aspergillus niger under submerged and solid state fermentation using coir waste as a substrate
Soma Mrudula*; Rangasamy Murugammal
Department of Microbiology, M.G.R. College, Dr. M.G.R. Nagar, Hosur, T.N - 635 109, India
ABSTRACT
Aspergillus niger was used for cellulase production in submerged (SmF) and solid state fermentation (SSF). The maximum production of cellulase was obtained after 72 h of incubation in SSF and 96 h in Smf. The CMCase and FPase activities recorded in SSF were 8.89 and 3.56 U per g of dry mycelial bran (DBM), respectively. Where as in Smf the CMase & FPase activities were found to be 3.29 and 2.3 U per ml culture broth, respectively. The productivity of extracellular cellulase in SSF was 14.6 fold higher than in SmF. The physical and nutritional parameters of fermentation like pH, temperature, substrate, carbon and nitrogen sources were optimized. The optimal conditions for maximum biosynthesis of cellulase by A. niger were shown to be at pH 6, temperature 30 ºC. The additives like lactose, peptone and coir waste as substrate increased the productivity both in SmF and SSF. The moisture ratio of 1:2 (w/v) was observed for optimum production of cellulase in SSF.
Key words: Aspergillus niger, coir waste, cellulase, submerged fermentation, solid-state fermentation.
INTRODUCTION
Complete cellulose hydrolysis to glucose demands the action of exoglucanases, endoglucanases and β-glucosidases. Exoglucanases (1,4-β-D-glucancellobiohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.91) are usually active on crystalline cellulose and cleave disaccharide units either from non-reducing or reducing end. Endoglucanases (1,4-β-D-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.4) are more active against the amorphous regions of cellulose and they can also hydrolyze substituted celluloses, such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) internally. β-Glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) cleave cellobiose and other soluble oligosaccharides to glucose (10). These enzymes find potential applications in the production of food, animal feed, textile, fuel, chemical, pharmaceutical industries and in waste management (9, 40).
The production of cellulase has been reported from a wide variety of bacteria (22) and fungi (4, 34). However, filamentous fungi are preferred for commercial enzyme production, because the level of the enzymes produced by these cultures is higher than those obtained from yeast and bacteria (8). Almost all fungi of genus Aspergillus synthesize cellulase, therefore this genus has the potential to dominate the enzyme industry. Aspergillus and Trichoderma spp. are well known efficient production of cellulases (33).
Industrially important enzymes have traditionally been obtained from submerged fermentation (SmF) because of the ease of handling and greater control of environmental factors such as temperature and pH. However, solid state fermentation (SSF) technique can improve the yield and reduces the cost of enzyme production (16, 21). Filamentous fungi are the most commonly used microorganisms in SSF because they are able to grow on solid materials with low water contents (30). There are several reports describing use of agro industrial residues for the production of cellulose such as wheat straw, wheat bran and rice straw as substrates (11, 35, 2, 19). The other advantages of SSF include superior productivity, simple technique; low capital investment, low energy requirement and less water output (42, 38), better product recovery and lack of foam build up and reported to be most appropriate process for developing countries (39).
The cellulase production by filamentous fungi in SmF and SSF has been studied extensively (15, 1, 38). However, there is no report on comparison of the cellulase production by SmF and SSF conditions. From this point of view, the organism was isolated and demonstrated for their improved efficiency in SmF and SSF for the production of cellulase using agro-industrial waste as raw material. The influence of various parameters was evaluated under two different fermentation conditions. In the present study, we describe the comparison of cellulase production by Aspergillus niger in SmF and SSF systems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microorganism
The fungus was isolated from coir retting ground area of Karimangalam, Dharmapuri Dist, Tamil Nadu, India. The isolate was grown on CMC agar medium and screened according to Wood and Bhat (41). The culture was identified based on colony morphology and microscopic examination (Devenathan et al. 2007). The isolated fungal colony was subcultured and maintained on Czapek-Dox-agar slants and stored at 4 ºC in a refrigerator, until needed.
Pre-treatment of substrates
The procured cellulosic substrates such as rice husk, rice bran, coir waste, wheat bran and saw dust were ground to fine powder and the substrates were individually treated with 1% (w/v) NaOH solution in the ratio of 1:10 (substrate: solution) for 1h and was brought to neutral pH by washing thoroughly with distilled water and dried at room temperature. The treated substrates were autoclaved at 121ºC for 1 h (18).
Preparation of inoculum
The inoculum was prepared by growing the organism in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask with 100 ml of Czapek-Dox broth containing g/l of sucrose, 30; sodium nitrate, 3; K2HPO4, 1; MgSO4, 0.5; KCl, 0.5; FeSO4, trace; agar, 15. The medium was inoculated from the Czapek-Dox agar slants and incubated at 30 ºC for 3 days in a shaker (200 rpm) before it was used for the fermentation process.
Submerged fermentation (SmF)
Submerged fermentation was carried out in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of fermentation medium. The composition of the medium contained the following g/l of distilled water. L-Glutamic acid, 0.3; NH4NO2, 1.4; K2HPO4, 2.0; CaCl2, 2.0; MgSO4, 0.3; protease peptone, 7.5; FeSO4, 5.0; MnSO4, 1.6; ZnSO4, 1.4; tween 80, 20 % (v/v) ; coir waste, 30. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 121ºC for 15 min. Each flask was inoculated with 1ml of the above said inoculum. The cultures were incubated on a rotary shaker (120 rpm) at 30ºC for 72 h.
Solid state fermentation (SSF)
Solid state fermentation was carried out in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks that contained 10 g of coir waste and 15 ml of distilled water (moistening agent). The flasks were sterilized at 121ºC for 15 min and cooled to room temperature. About 1ml of inoculum was added, mixed well and incubated at 30ºC in a humidified incubator for 96 h. The flasks were periodically mixed by gentle shaking.
Enzyme extraction
At the end of the fermentation the culture broth from submerged fermentation was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was used as a source of extracellular enzyme. In solid state fermentation (SSF) the enzyme was extracted from the coir waste by mixing homogenously the entire waste with (1:10 w/v) distilled water and agitated on a rotary shaker (120 rpm) at 30 ºC with a contact time of 1h. Dampened cheese cloth was used to filter the extract and pooled extracts were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15min and the clear supernatant was used as a source of extracellular enzyme.
Enzyme assay
Cellulase [(filter paperase (FPase) and carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase)] activities were assayed according to the method described by Ghose (17).One unit of enzyme activity (CMCase and FPase) is defined as the amount of enzyme which releases 1 µmole of reducing sugars per min with glucose as standard, under the assay condition described above. The values of enzymatic activity were expressed as U/ml for SmF and U/g of dry mycelial bran (DMB) for SSF.
Optimization of process parameters in SmF and SSF
Evaluation of optimized culture conditions in SSF and SmF using Aspergillus niger: The protocol adopted for the standardization of fermentation parameters was to evaluate the effect of an individual parameter. The parameters optimized were: substrates (rice husk, rice bran, coir waste, wheat bran, saw dust), temperature (20 to 40 ºC), pH (4.5 to 8), fermentation period [(24 to 192 h in SmF) and (24 to 120 h in SSF)].
Effect of supplements (carbon & nitrogen sources)
Smf: Various carbon and nitrogen sources at concentration of 5% w/v were supplemented as individual components to the fermentation medium containing coir waste as substrate. The medium was inoculated and incubated at 30 ºC for 3 days in an orbital shaker incubator (120 rpm). The broth was centrifuged and the enzyme assay was carried out. Care was taken to see that monosaccharides and disaccharides were prepared as 10 X solution and sterilized separately by autoclaving at 10 lbs for 10 min. and required concentration was added to the medium before inoculation.
SSF: Various carbon and nitrogen sources at concentration of 4% w/v were supplemented as individual components to the flasks that contain 10 g of coir waste and moistened with 15 ml of distilled water (moistening agent). The flasks were sterilized and cooled to room temperature. About 1 ml of inoculum was added, mixed well and incubated at 30ºC in a humidifying incubator for 4 days. At the end of fermentation the contents from each flask were extracted with distilled water and the supernatant was used for enzyme assay.
The effect of moisture content in SSF was studied by varying the ratio of coir waste to distilled water (2.5 to 12.5).
The optimum conditions for enhanced cellulase production were verified by performing the experiments using the selected parameters at their respective optimum conditions.
Comparative evaluation of SmF and SSF systems for enzyme production
The enzyme yield produced in SmF was compared with the yield obtained in SSF using coir waste as substrate according to Solis Pereira et al (36).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Isolation and screening of cellulolytic organism
The soil sample collected from coir retting zone area was serially diluted in saline and was spread on to the carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) agar plates. The plates were incubated at 30ºC for 3-5 days. Cellulase producing fungal colonies were selected after flooding the plates with congo red (0.1% w/v), followed by destaining with NaCl (0.1 M). The colony that showed largest halo forming zone was selected for the present study.
Identification of fungal isolates
Colony morphology: The selected strain was subcultured on CMC agar medium. Initially the colonies were white and changed to black, as culture matured. When immature the colonies were covered with white fluffy aerial mycelia, while mature colonies showed salt and pepper effect which was covered with black spores and reverse of the colony was buff colored.
Microscopic examination of the isolates
The matured colonies were subjected to lacto phenol cotton blue staining and microscopic examination was made. From the microscopic observation it was clear that the colony showed the hyaline septate hyphae. The conidial head was large and appeared black to brownish black. The conidiophores were hyaline or brownish near the vesicle. Each vesicle appeared globose in shape and cover with brownish sterigmata on the entire surface in two series. Based on the colony morphology and microscopic observation the strain was confirmed as Aspergillus niger (12).
Optimization of fermentation parameters in SmF and SSF
Substrates: Among the 5 substrates screened, coir waste gave the maximum cellulase production when fermented with Aspergillus niger under SmF and SSF (Table 1). Considerable amount of enzyme production was observed on wheat bran and rice bran. Comparatively less enzyme production was observed with the rest of the substrates in both SmF and SSF. Since coir waste showed maximum production of cellulase, it was selected for further optimization studies for SmF and SSF systems. In a study conducted by Ojumu et al (29) on Aspergillus flavus reported that the saw dust, corncobs and bagasse were found to be the best substrates for the production of cellulase. Oberoi et al (28) reported kinnow pulp as the best substrate for the production of cellulase in SSF. Sugarcane bagasse, tea production waste, coconut coir pith, rice husk, wheat bran, rice bran etc., have been employed for production of cellulase using a variety of microorganisms such as Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Botrytis, Neurospora etc., (31).
Temperature
Incubation temperature plays an important role in the metabolic activities of a microorganism. In the present study the optimum temperature for maximum enzyme production was recorded at 30ºC under SmF and SSF (Table 1). About 83 % of cellulase production was observed at 35ºC. Whereas more than 50 % of cellulase was produced when grown at 20, 25 and 40ºC in SmF. 55 and 68% of cellulase production was recorded when the organism was grown at 40 and 20ºC, respectively in SSF. The results of SmF process in the present study confirm the findings of Devanathan et al (12) and Kathiresan and Manivannan (23) for Aspergillus sp. Asquieri and Park (6) found that the optimum temperature for production of CMCase from thermostable Aspergillus sp. was 37ºC, whereas the maximum cellulase production was observed at 40ºC for Aspergillus terreus QTC 828 (3). In general the temperature maintained in SSF system is in the range of 25 to 35ºC and depends on the growth kinetics of the microorganism employed rather than on the enzyme produced (25). Ali et al. (3) reported maximum yield of cellulase from Aspergillus niger Z10 strain and A. terreus at 40ºC, respectively in SSF.
pH
Among physical parameters, pH of the growth medium plays an important role by inducing morphological changes in microbes and in enzyme secretion. The pH change observed during the growth of microbes also affects product stability in the medium (20). Optimum pH for maximum production of cellulase was 6.0 when grown in SmF and SSF (Table 1). Similar observation was made for cellulase production by A. terreus QTC 828 in SmF by Ali et al (3) and Trichoderma reesei in SSF by Doppelbauer et al (13), whereas pH 7 was reported by Krishna (24) for the production of bacterial cellulases by using banana wastes in SSF.
Fermentation period
Table 1 shows the effect of fermentation period on the production of the cellulase in SmF and SSF. In the present study cellulase activity increased steadily and reached maximum at 96 h of incubation when grown in SmF. These results are in agreement with the reports made by Devanathan et al (12) and Acharya et al (1). However, further increase in the incubation time reduced the enzyme production. It might be due to the depletion of macro and micronutrients in the fermentation medium with the lapse in time, which stressed the fungal physiology resulting in the inactivation of secreting machinery of the enzymes (27). Incubation time necessary for optimal production was observed at 72 h in SSF. Short incubation period for enzyme production offers the potential for inexpensive production of enzyme (37). Muniswaran and Charyulu (26) have also reported similar trend in cellulase production using Trichoderma viride.
Moisture content
Moisture content is a critical factor in SSF processes because this variable has influence on growth, biosynthesis and secretion of enzyme. In the present study the maximum enzyme production was obtained at coir waste to distilled water ratio of 1:2. (Fig.1). Any further increase and decrease in the ratio resulted in decreased enzyme activity. Similar observation was made by Anto et al (5) for production of α-amylase by Bacillus cereus, whereas Babu and Satyanaryana (7) reported maximum α-amylase enzyme production by thermophilic Bacillus coagulans at a high level of substrate moisture ratio of 1: 2.5. According to Lonsane et al (25), lower moisture content causes reduction in solubility of nutrients of the substrate, low degree of swelling and high water tension. On the other hand, higher moisture levels can cause a reduction in enzyme yield due to steric hindrance of the growth of the producer strain by reduction in porosity (interparticle spaces) of the solid matrix, thus interfering oxygen transfer.
Inoculum size
In the present study there is a significant increase in cellulase production with an increase in inoculum concentration from 5 to 15 % and found to be maximum at 15%. Higher or lower inoculum size resulted in a significant decrease in enzyme production (Fig.2). Similar findings have been reported for the production of bacterial cellulases by solid state bioprocessing of banana wastes (24). In contrast 10% of inoculum was reported to be optimum for the production of cellulase by Aspergillus niger under SSF (15).
Carbon sources
Cellulase production was found to be dependent upon the nature of the carbon source used in the culture media. To evaluate the carbohydrates to cause induction or repression of cellulase, the organism was grown on monosaccharide and disaccharides. In general, enhanced production of enzyme was observed with all the tested sugars when compared to the control. Among the carbon sources examined, lactose was found to be the best inducer in SmF and SSF (Table 2). This study substantiates the work of Kathiresan and Manivannan (23) and Devanathan (12) who demonstrated lactose as best inducer of Aspergillus sp. Nochure et al (27) identified fructose as the best inducer of cellulase in Clostridium thermocellum. In another study dextrin was found to enhance the production of cellulase by Trichoderma sp. in SSF (32). Increase in enzyme production with additional carbon sources have been demonstrated by both the SmF and SSF systems as a result of good growth (36).
Nitrogen sources
The effect of supplementation of nitrogen sources in SmF and SSF system on the enzyme production is shown in Table 2. All the nitrogen sources enhanced cellulase production when compared to control. Among them peptone supported maximum enzyme production followed by beef extract, groundnut oilcake, yeast extract and casein. These results are in agreement with the reports of Kathiresan and Manivannan (23) and Devanathan et al. (12) for production of cellulase by Penicillium fellutanum and Aspergillus niger, respectively in SmF. Enari et al. (14) reported that good cellulase production can be obtained with peptone as the organic nitrogen source in SSF.
Enzyme yields
Under the optimum conditions, the strain produced 2.04 units of cellulase per ml of culture broth (Fig. 3) in SmF and 29.11units of cellulase per gram of dry mycelial bran in SSF.
Comparative evaluation of SmF and SSF system for enzyme titres
The method adopted for comparison of submerged and solid state fermentation is the same as reported by Solis-Pereira et al. (36) for pectinase production from Aspergillus niger by dividing the yield obtained from SSF in U/g DMB with the yield from SmF in U/ml culture broth. With this method, cellulase production by A. niger in SSF and SmF using coir waste as substrate, were compared in terms of their extracellular enzyme production in U/g DMB and U/ml, respectively (Fig. 3). When comparison made between SmF and SSF, production of total cellulase by SSF was 14.6 fold higher than that of SmF.
In conclusion the result of the present study clearly indicates the potential of Aspergillus niger can be successfully cultivated under SSF conditions for the production of cellulase using coir waste as substrate. The coir waste is abundantly available in India as it is one of the major producers of coconut. Having considered the means of reducing disposal problem, therefore it can be effectively utilized by a potential strain like Aspergillus niger for production of cellulase which is commercially important.

That is what the pop off valve is intended to prevent.... Esp with IC end caps made of plastic, or weak IC to T-body hoses.... The pressure spike on a stage II IA box with a stock k26 is in the 50psi range, more on a modified turbo/more boost..... Vacuum, glen is instant in the manifold when the throttle shuts, so instant in fact, that the vaccuum for the pop off valve is located just inside (downstream) of the throttle plate. That is how it functions in most Mechanical pop-off valves..... In theory and practice, the boost is measured at the intake manifold, it really makes no sense to measure it anywhere else, unless you want to know how fast the turbo is spinning, but the why question begs... I think where the confusion may lay is in the operation of the wastegate, let's address that first in racing and production terms, it might help...... A race car builder could care less about where fart air is discharged: To air or closed loop. So, when you here the air farts under boost conditions, that's becuz, the builder of the motor vented the WASTEGATE discharge to air instead of exhaust, some turbulence theory concerning exhaust might apply (tho gains are prolly minimal). A wastegate diaphram has two pressures exerted on it when closed, effective spring pressure from the top (spring rate = spring pressure + Boost/WGfreq valve air) and manifold boost from the bottom. Manifold boost (the large banjo bolt from the manifold to the WG) fights the spring pressure on top, and if the MANIFOLD pressure exceeds the rate of the spring pressure, the wastegate opens, bypassing exhaust from the turbine (hot) side of the turbo TO either air ( racing-farts) or downstream of the turbo in the exhaust (production-SBD's?). This slows the spin of the turbo, reducing boost, until the MANIFOLD pressure is again less than the SPRING PRESSURE and the wastegate closes again, all exhaust now back to turbine..... The computer can control/effect the wastegate three ways 1) in a urq style it retards timing, grounds out fuel pump if Manifold pressure exceeds a preset level, 2) 86-91 10vturbos --- the computer can do 1, as well as, add or subtract Turbo pressure air to the top of the wastegate via the WG freq valve, increasing or decreasing the effective spring pressure on the top of the WG.... 3) you can control effective MANIFOLD pressure to the wastegate by regulating the air going to it.... I digress quickly...... However, both the wastegate and the Pop off valve can be "spent" to atmosphere... So, yes, you can hear gaseous excretions on throttle and off throttle in any turbo car, but they are two distinct and separate functions, more specifically the same functions under two different conditions, closed and open throttle. At closed throttle the Pop off or bypass valve bleeds off excess air pressure between the throttle flap and the cold side turbo blade, letting the turbo free spin for less lag on next throttle open (boost). The Wastegate (and computer) measure air upstream of the t-body (in the manifold) and bleeds exhaust gasses away from the turbine to slow the turbo, regulating the amount of boost in the manifold during any pressured throttle condition (0.0 vacuum thru max boost for any given computer input).... > >That begs another question: is a pop-off valve typically installed at the >intake manifold side of the throttle-plate? NO, no function there, that is the wastegate by definition..... > Also, how are high pressure >spikes upstream of the throttle-plate addressed? Pop off valve > Those that would >'blowed-up' the IC-to-throttle-body hose or the IC? A second pop-off valve >located upstream of the TB? That is the definition of a pop off valve, glen..... > > HTH all confused....... There is plenty more to the specifics of all the WG operating functions, but this is long enough Fart nerding Scott PDQSHIP@aol.com 87 5ktqRS2 X 2Consumer electronics manufacturer Weston has announced that it will start selling cell phones in the Indian market starting in the North and East of the country, regions where it already has a strong presence – with subsequent rollouts planned for remaining parts of India later on. Weston said that its new products would largely be aimed at the semi urban and rural markets.
To begin with, Weston will be launching seven handsets, costing between Rs. 1,600 and Rs. 3,500. These phones will come with a one-year warranty. Weston said that its 250 services centers across India will provide after-sales service for the cell phones.
Sunil Vachani, chairman and managing director, Weston Group, said that the new devices will offer various features – including dual-SIM card slots, 5.8-cm TFT display, double flash cards, FM radio, double batteries, etc. The affordable cell phones will also support high quality video and audio, and be Java-enabled, he added.
Users can also expect video conferencing capability and in-built answering machines, Weston said, adding that the devices will support Bluetooth networks for connectivity.
The company plans to obtain R&D and design capability for the handsets from China and then manufacture the phones itself in an upcoming production unit in Sela Que, Dehradun, Uttranchal. The new manufacturing facility, which will be operational next year, will have a capacity to churn out up to 5 lakh GSM and CDMA cell phones per month, Vachani said. Till then, Weston plans to procure the devices from original equipment manufacturers in China – with its own quality control.
Speaking about the firm’s future growth plans, Pankaj Sharma, business head at Weston, said that the company hopes to sell one lakh cell phones per month across India and register a turnover of Rs. 250 crore by the end of the first year. The cell phone business hopes to grow 15% to 20% every year and eventually reach a turnover of Rs. 1,000 crore by 2015, Sharma added.Types of Engineers and What They do
Difference Between Comprehensive and Collision Auto Insurance Coverage
.
Car Paint Job Prices
Car painting jobs are specialized tasks that require extreme care and precision. Ensure that your car is in safe hands and you get a reasonable deal with regard to painting prices. Some people believe in doing their own jobs and getting the whole painting job done on their own. If you too are planning to follow suit, then know that this job needs to be executed very carefully. Car painting is not the same as painting walls and it’s extremely subtle work. Unless you are an expert or you have a professional to help you out, painting your automobile on your own is highly not recommended. Blotchy paint jobs can be traumatizing to say the least and difficult to live with. If you want your car to fetch value through resale or restore back its lost glory, it’s best to call in professionals. In the following lines, I provide you with a summary of the various factors which influence car prices, besides providing you with a rough cost range for the paint job, which you should expect. An average price cannot be quoted as the overall cost varies according to the specifications of the job.
What is Full Coverage Auto Insurance
In simple words, full auto insurance coverage is defined as a policy which covers first party or third party injury to the body or damage to the automobile. Generally, it covers physical damage to the automobile if it has been leased at the time of the accident, death or physical injury to the body of the people involved in the accident, and also property damages caused by the insured person’s car to someone’s property.
The term full insurance coverage is simply an insurance marketing strategy. The word ‘full’ dissents in the actual auto insurance perspective. The alternatives of auto insurance predominately depends upon the requirements specified at the time of investment. The requirements of a particular automobile insurance investor might vary from another person. The addition of the word ‘full aspect of the said insurance coverage, which. It; discuss the terms, conditions, limitations and types of coverage with the insurance provider. If you are searching for insurance quotes, the simplest way is to phone a car insurance agent who will provide you with the same.
Information about Auto Insurance for Students
At times, immature actions by students result into petty accidents and car damages, which are expensive to repair. Therefore, the need for auto insurance for students. It is a kind of policy that is specially tailored to meet the demands of the student community.
Student Auto Insurance
After the insurance policy is purchased by vehicle owners, their cars are ‘covered’ by the policy. It means that in case of an accident or mishap, the insurance pays compensation to the policy owners. Every policy owner has to pay a specific amount annually to the company, which is known as a premium. The policy also has a certain date of maturity, after which the car does not come under the insurance coverage, and a particular sum of money is returned to the policy owner.
The auto insurance rates for students are always high, due to the fact that legally recognized driving experience of students is very less. There are several other factors that are considered while deciding the rates of insurance premiums. The specifications of the car, the score of the student in the driving lessons, criminal record and record for violations of traffic rules are some of common points that are inspected by the company.
This type of insurance is also often clubbed with a health or liability insurance. Thus, if the student commits a traffic rule violation or faces a severe accident, most of the expenses are taken care of by the insurance company. There might be cases when the injured person in the car crash sues the student for damages and personal injury. The health and liability insurance, in such cases also prove to be of help, as the auto accident settlement also gets paid by the insurance company. Thus, it can be concluded that an auto insurance is a necessity for any student.
How to get a Cheap Auto Insurance for Students
Here’s what you can do.
In case you are availing auto insurance as a college student, then make it point to have good grades on your final year school certificates. There are many companies who would offer you a discount on the basis of your merit.
The second step that you can follow is that, never break any traffic rules, especially during your high school days. A record for rule and law violation will fetch you a very high rate of premium.
If it is feasible, then consider purchasing a car with high mileage and lower horse power. You might also add security features to the car. Such cars that have a higher security and lower horse power will fetch you with a low rate premium insurance policy.
In order to have very good auto insurance quotes, you may also consider taking good driving and safety lessons. Insurance companies offer lesser premiums to customers who have scored well in such classes.
It is high time that we accept that the world is full of uncertainties and one person’s life is full of unpredicted events. Hence, it is better to be wise before than weep later. It is very important to follow traffic rules, have a proper driving license, etc. One must never drive after consuming alcohol. It important to respect and follow such rules.Reports have emerged of a female IBM sales executive in Australia who was allegedly victim to sexual harassment and bullying for two years.
Susan Spiteri claims a member of staff would “rub himself against my backside”, touch her, grope her, put his hand up her dress and ask her to expose her breasts to win sales.
In an interview with ABC, Spiteri says that the culture of fear in the office meant no one was prepared to intervene. She told ABC that, although colleagues were supportive of her ordeal, everyone was too scared to try to put a stop to it. Spiteri says she cried nearly ever day at her desk.
She’s looking for $1.1 million in compensation from IBM.
IBM has said that it will “vigorously defend” itself in court, and that it “does not tolerate harrassment of any type.” The alleged bully resigned from IBM when confronted with the allegations. But IBM then assigned him as a customer to Spiteri.
Spiteri’s lawyer says since the case went public, others who went through similar ordeals approached the law firm – and there are a couple more cases bubbling under the surface.Environment Updates
While NOAA says ‘No’ Aussie predictors say ‘Yes’
Surfersvillage Global Surf News, 25 February, 2014 - The Jakarta Globe reported that Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology is calling for a 75 percent chance that an El Niño event will occur in late 2014. “Warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean is likely in the coming months,” the Australian weather bureau said in its ENSO update. “Recent observations add weight to the model outlooks. The tropical Pacific Ocean subsurface has warmed substantially in recent weeks.”
However, according to NOAA, nearly all model forecasts indicate the persistence of ENSO-neutral through the Northern Hemisphere spring 2014. But afterwards, an increasing number of models suggest the possible onset of El Niño. This information is tempered with the disclaimer that the spring is also historically associated with lower forecast skill, so the chance of El Niño developing after the spring is not much different from ENSO-neutral conditions.
If one follows the prediction models, strong surface westerly winds in the western Pacific and the slight eastward shift of above-average temperatures in the subsurface western Pacific potentially portend warming in the coming months..With Newsstand you can:

AFTERIMAGE: ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE CINEMATIC
Arnolfini, Bristol, England.
AFTERIMAGE: ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE CINEMATIC is an two-day intervention at the Arnolfini, threading together responses to the multiplicity of issues that impact on the production, distribution and critical reflection of the moving image in an era of mass and intimate media.
Inspirational internationally acclaimed artists, curators and agencies such as: Artangel, David A Bailey, Mike Dibb, Antony Gross, Gil Leung, Gary Stewart, Mark Waugh and the Black Diaspora Moving Cube will be working with be discussing and reflecting on the historical and contemporary impact of cinema as both an industry and scene of cultural production.
These reflections will explore the significance of the moving image within the frame of an increasingly global visual arts ecology, artists engagement with processes of production in cinema, and observations on the curatorial and dialogical negotiations between cinema, gallery and digital platforms, that challenge and configure innovative ways to make the staging of vision memorable.
There will also be a special launch presentation of Omer Fast: In Memory, published by The Green Box which examines the mechanisms of personal experience, memory and history.

The Black Jacobins: Negritude In A Post Global 21st Century International Symposium.
Bridgetown, Barbados and Fort-De-France, Martinique.
A major Caribbean symposium that links the past with the present and will present a series of historical works as well as existing contemporary works based on the legacies of two major 20th century figures:
the Trinidadian writer and intellectual C.L.R. James and the Martinique poet and intellectual Aime Cesaire.
In his seminal book The Black Jacobins (1938), C.L.R. James (1901-1989) examines the Haitian (Sainte-Domingue) Revolution of 1791-1803. He analyses revolutionary potential and progress according to economic and class distinctions, rather than racial distinctions. The book is also focused on Toussaint L’ Ouverture as the revolutionary spearhead and organizational leader. Thus, The Black Jacobins discusses Caribbean revolt within the context of colonial slavery and furthermore establishes the first black diasporic anti colonial figure hero.
Aime Cesaire (1913–2008) formulated – together with Leopold Senghor and Leon Gontian Damas – the concept and movement of Negritude, the “affirmation that one is black and proud of it”. Cesaire’s thoughts about restoring the cultural identity of black Africans were first fully expressed in Cahier d’un retour au pays natal (Return To My Native Land, 1939), a mixture of poetry and poetic prose that celebrates the ancestral homelands of Africa and the Caribbean. Negritude has been seen as a major intellectual force that has influenced countless liberational leaders to artistic movements from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Power Movements.
This symposium is not about re-appraising these two Caribbean lives but about the re-examining their ideas within a visual art performative 21st century Caribbean diaspora context. Both these writers were using their art (in the form of the discourse of literature) as a political weapon. Today, Black Jacobins: Negritude In A Post Global 21st Century refers to the historical movement of diaspora artists from the past to the present rising above the singular narrative or notion of ‘Caribbean art’ to produce works that have a unique signature in style and content. The symposium has two major strands: Historical Iconographies (Barbados) and Contemporary Dialogues (Martinique)
Historical Iconographies explores the period spanning World War II, the movement for Federation within the West Indies, and the move towards Independence as a period of evolving ideologies of self-definition and determination. The work and ideas of both C.L.R. James and Aime Cesaire are evident in or parallel those of several artists (their contemporaries) within the Caribbean and from the diaspora. Perhaps most direct is the meeting and collaboration in 1941 between Cesaire and Cuban artist Wifredo Lam. Cesaire’s exploration and affirmation of Afro-Caribbean culture, which influenced and paralleled Lam’s own, reinforced and expanded his visual-poetic expressions of Afro-Caribbean culture and identity.
This occurred in the context of fertile collaboration with surrealists Andre Breton, and Andre Masson; and their encounter with Hector Hyppolite in Haiti. Pioneering art movements led by artists such as Karl Broodhagen (Guyana, Barbados), Edna Manley (UK, Jamaica), and Carlos Enriquez and Amelia Pelaez (both from Cuba) combine art deco and African imagery to project a newly emerging aesthetic that could speak to national and regional identity. Outside of the region, the innovative performer and choreographer Katherine Dunham introduced ideas of negritude into black modern dance during the 1940s after visiting the Caribbean with Zora Neale Hurston. Jacob Lawrence in 1938 produced a series of 41 paintings entitled Toussaint L’Ouverture. And the image of the black angel as performed by Feral Benga in Jean Cocteau’s film Blood Of A Poet (1930) embraced the iconic moving image work with surrealist ideas (which was at the heart of negritude).
Contemporary Dialogues explores existing moving image and other art works that emerged following the achievement of political independence within much of the West Indies, the revolution in Cuba and the attendant waves of migration north. The 1980s short documentary interview between the Jamaican intellectual Stuart Hall and C.L.R. James, the moving image works by Haitian film director Raul Peck (Man Of The Shore) and by Martinique artist Euzhan Palcy established the centrality of James and Cesaire for successive creators in the region and wider diaspora. Edouard Duval Carrie (Haiti), Jose Bedia (Cuba), Tony Capellan (Dominican Republic), Nick Whittle (UK, Barbados) and Stanley Greaves (Guyana) explore themes of politics, migration and transculturation that convey the challenges and the insights that displacement and exile bring. The place of popular artists such as Amos Ferguson (Bahamas), Francis Griffith (Barbados), Everald Brown and Leonard Daley (Jamaica), and Philip Moore (Guyana) within the evolving national identity also needs greater articulation and contextualizing. Other artists in this context include Lubania Himid, Marc Latime, Isaac Julien and Martina Attille, Joscelyn Gardner, Sonia Boyce, Steve McQueen, Alfredo Jaar, Peter Doig and Luc Tuymans.

David A. Bailey: artist, curator and exhibition organiser; Director, International Curators Forum – London / Bahamas

“How are we to write the histories of non-western societies in relation to modernity? Modernity is, as we know, an extremely slippery signifier, and appears here with as many quote marks as I can muster: and ‘the modern’ in its many derivatives – early modern, late modern, post-modern, modernity, modernism – has long been effectively appropriated to the story of the west, monopolizing for western civilization the privilege of living to the full the potentialities of the present ‘from the inside’.
It is therefore difficult to imagine this story in any way other than as a binary polarity: modernity and its ‘others’. Only two narrative alternatives then seem possible. Either the story is told from within the perspective of modernity itself: in which case it is difficult to prevent it becoming a triumphalist narrative in which the ‘others’ are permanently marginalized.
Or one reorients the story within its margins, seeking by this move to reverse and disrupt the normalised order of things by bringing into visibility all that cannot be seen from, or is structurally obscured by, the usual vantage point.”
Modernity and Its Others: Three ‘Moments’ In The Post-war History of the Black Diaspora Arts by Stuart Hall.
In his groundbreaking essay Stuart Hall re-visits modernity through three historical art movements from the perspective of the Diaspora. It is our intention to use this discourse as the theme of Three Moments, the Caribbean pavilion at the Liverpool Biennial, where these moments are symbolised by the three Caribbean islands states: the Bahamas, Martinique and Barbados.The featured artists – Ewan Atkinson, Ras Ishi Butcher and Ras Akyem-i Ramsey from Barbados, Christian Bertin and David Damoison from Martinique and John Beadle, Blue Curry, Lavar Munroe, Lynn Parotti and Heino Schmid from the Bahamas – were selected on their ability to make work that responds to contemporary and historical global themes.
For the first time artists from the Caribbean region are collectively making new work that responds to the city of Liverpool while maintaining a distinctive stance on what Stuart Hall might call a 21st-century Caribbean modernist aesthetic.
Three Moments is selected and curated by Dominique Brebion (Martinique), Alissandra Cummins (Barbados), Holly Parotti (Bahamas) and Allison Thompson (Barbados) in collaboration with the ICF.

Maccabi GB School sports round-up
Follow Danny on Twitter
Maccabi GB’s started it School Sports Tournaments schedule, with Sinai School, JFS and Yavne College all started with impressive wins.
The Primary Years 3 and 4 Football Tournament took place at Mill Hill Power League with 10 schools bringing 20 teams to play. In total 200 young people were engaged in the event.
The tournament saw teams split into groups and play each other in a league format with the top two teams in each group qualifying for the quarter-final stages. Each match was exciting and full of goals, with the last eight stage producing some good defensive displays, more conducive to the Italian national team, to ensure teams made it into the semi-finals.
Both semis were close games with Mathilda Marks Kennedy School winning an enthralling game against Wolfson Hillel, whilst Sinai School needed a penalty shootout to finally overcome Rosh Pinah.
The final was an exciting spectacle with both sides playing end-to-end football. Sinai took an early lead, but MMK came back strong and equalised midway through the game. With extra-time looming, Sinai managed to work a great play and finished it off to secure a deserved victory.
The afternoon concluded with the medals presentation and the trophy was awarded to the winning Sinai team.
With the final whistle blowing on the first tournament, the second one got underway 24 hours later, this time for girls in Years 7-11. Six secondary schools attended, with 22 teams and 200 girls playing from Immanuel College, King Solomon High School, JFS, JCoss, Hasmonean High School and Yavne College.
Each age group played in a separate tournament, with each team facing off against each other once in a league basis. The team who finished the top of their respective leagues won the tournament. All the girls enjoyed their afternoon of sport and there were some fantastic individual performances from some of the young players.
JFS had a great afternoon winning the tournaments in Years 8, Years 9 and Years 10/11. Yavne College won the Year 7 tournament. The afternoon finished off with a sporting medals presentation to the winning teams.
Maccabi GB's Sports Department Manager Matt Travers spoke about the numbers engaged over the week's two events. He said: "This week Maccabi GB has engaged over 400 young people in sports tournaments. It is so beneficial for the these players to be able to play sports against other Jewish schools and Jewish people as well as meet and make friends with like-minded young people from all over London.
"This is the start of a busy tournament schedule for MGB and we hope all the other events continue in the same quality and spirit as this week."CHEVS Parts » Car Parts » Apparel & Gifts » Gifts » Dog Leash With "Chevy" Bowtie Logo Repeated On A 4 Foot By 1" Strap Share | Product Description Item # BDDOGLC Weighs 1.000lbs. and Trucks.; exceptions may apply.

About The Resort at The Mountain

That response by McCrory didn’t say much. It did add some new things though. I didn’t know that McCrory was with his family. I do see the bird being inappropriate in that setting, honestly. If an employee of mine gave the bird to someone in my place of business on top of saying something inappropriate to them, you can bet your ass he’d be standing in the unemployment line. I mean, it wouldn’t have to be a governor. You can’t run a business with employees like that. So, if that happened as McCrory said it did and if his family was sitting there with him when that happened, I’m concerned that you, Gary, thought it would be appropriate and that the cook shouldn’t have been disciplined and even discharged.
I know you want to make McCrory out be a whiner and complainer and thin skinned here with your post. But, even though I can be called biased, I disagree with you that this was a “slight too small” (especially considering his family was there) and I also disagree McCrory’s response in the letter you linked was “silly, petty and self-pitying”.
But, innuendo and rhetoric and spin is what people in your position do. I understand your purpose here and I know your objective in posting what you posted in the way you did it. I think you’ve lowered yourself a little, Gary. This presentation by you was not your finest.
I expect that one of these days, the store’s surveillance video of the incident will emerge; showing no ‘obscene gesture’ by the cook, but a shouting McCrory – both in contrast to the Governor’s version of events.
The governor needs to hire a good Democrat to advise him. Then he could avoid a lot of these gnats and get into some real corruption. He could get the SBI to investigate some Democrat organizations. He could even give contracts to some incompetent people who donated to his campaign. Wouldn’t help much, he doesn’t own the media like the Democrats.$13.99

This is a more technical and challenging course than Carroll Marty. Many holes have two tees and two pins so you can mix it up if you want to. Most of the front 9 is heavily wooded, but if you can hit the line, it's pretty rewarding. Miss, and it's hard to recover. On the back 9, it opens up a lot, but still fairly technical. Only the last few holes are what I would call "open".
A lot of times, this course is a few weeks behind on getting mowed, and watch out for the stinging nettles on hole #5 on the right!!! If you get in them, they burn!
Carroll Marty is more fun, but this is more technical. With both courses being only a few miles apart, Ames has a couple of great courses that offer a good mix and challenge. You have to play them both!Flyers rally to defeat Kings

There’s no doubt that making a political film was meant to be in Casino Jack director George Hickenlooper’s future. (The film stars Kevin Spacey as disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, reviewed here by The Independent.) After all, politics run in his blood. Literally. What no one knew at the time of the film’s world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), is that it would immediately become Hickenlooper’s past, and the project will forever be associated with his untimely death at age 47. The Independent spoke with him at the Toronto International Film Festival.
Hickenlooper’s mother was an anti-war activist. She dragged him to many demonstrations as a young child and on one occasion, chained herself to the gates of General Dynamics, a manufacturer of the Napalm used in both Vietnam and Cambodia. Hickenlooper recalled being with his mother as she organized a blockade at the entrance of the San Francisco Bay to prevent the USS Enterprise, an enormous aircraft carrier, from leaving the bay. “Here we were, this armada of boats, literally underneath the Golden Gate Bridge…and all these sailors, lined up on the deck of the aircraft carrier, flashing peace signs because they agreed with us. It was a very powerful moment.”
These experiences set off the political junkie in Hickenlooper, and probably much to his mother’s chagrin, he became heavily involved with the Republican party while at Yale. An active member of the re-election campaign for President Reagan in 1984 and the conservative movement in general, Hickenlooper explained how he believed in the concept of individualism in America. “That’s what the US Constitution is about. It’s what the Declaration of Independence is about. It’s about separating ourselves from injustice in the Old World of persecution and coming to the New World and conquering the West. That sense of individualism and freedom is… a quality, despite its negative sides, that the rest of the world admires.”
Then, at least in Hickenlooper’s eyes, the conservative movement lost its sense of social obligation and civic stewardship. “[The movement] evolved into a culture of avarice, like, ‘what can I get for myself?’” he said. That’s when he grew disillusioned and where Hickenlooper felt his own story parallels that of Jack Abramoff, the subject of Casino Jack. “Not that I’m like Jack Abramoff,” he quickly interjected to avoid the criminal overtones. “What I want to say is that I identify with his journey: where he began as a strong idealist, a strong anti-communist, a belief in that individual spirit that went back to Reagan.”
Casino Jack sweeps viewers into the fast-paced world of “super lobbyist” Jack Abramoff (Spacey) and his sleazy, over-confident partner-in-crime Mike Scanlon (Barry Pepper). This is a world where politicians like Tom DeLay can be easily bought, lobbyists employ shady tactics, side-deals are made with Indian tribes, greed is intoxicating, and money as well as power rule the day. Sort of like the real world. In fact, exactly like the real world given that this is all based on a true story. The undoing of them all, however, is Abramoff’s last scheme, casino cruise ships, which get him into bed with an investor (Jon Lovitz) with ties to the mob.
Hickenlooper marveled at the fact that Abramoff, too, worked on the 1984 Reagan campaign. “He helped Reagan in Massachusetts, which was huge at that time,” he said. But then Abramoff got lost in his mission and, observed Hickenlooper, became a metaphor for the culture of greed over service, and all that contributed to the financial collapse the fall of 2008.
“I felt it was a story I could relate to,” said Hickenlooper. So he proceeded to find a writer and producer to develop what he thought was a fresh look at Washington. “Washington had never experienced anyone like Jack Abramoff before –That’s the way I wanted to look at it,” he said.
There is a particularly colorful scene in the movie where Abramoff goes before the Senate Hearing Committee and, to put things simply, speaks his mind. That scene came out of a conversation that Hickenlooper had with Abramoff during one of his visits to prison. “It was a very stark prison,” he recalled, “It was definitely not a minimum security prison.” No white collar criminals riding around in golf carts with their nine irons there.
According to Abramoff, when he went before the Senate Hearing Committee, he sat in a room filled with hypocrites. He went before McCain who accepted money from lobbyists like himself. He sat in front of Senators, who he helped get re-elected by holding events for them. And to each of their accusations he was instructed by his lawyer to plead the fifth. In the movie, he gets a chance to live out his fantasy instead.
At the time of this interview Abramoff had not yet seen the finished film, only parts, but Hickenlooper said the attention was a bit unsettling for him. In fact, when Hickenlooper first met with Abramoff, he tried to lobby Hickenlooper out of making the movie. “He said: ‘Your script is not very good, the story is not very commercial…” Still, Hickenlooper persisted and said that Abramoff, “sees [the film] as humanizing, making him feel a little less like the Satanic figure the media portrayed him to be.”
Abramoff struck Hickenlooper as being an incredibly charismatic person, “I felt like he could do stand-up comedy. He does impersonations.” This discovery significantly changed the script, much to the producers’ dismay. “I kept writing more scenes into the script and tossing older scenes out… I think I was able to sort of capture Jack’s heart and soul.”
But the film is not heavy-handed, rather it’s a fast-paced comedy embedded with elements of satire with the slightest hint of drama. The drama mostly comes in when everything spirals downward for Abramoff and his associates—all “good” things must come to an end. “It wasn’t like [we were] painting comedic brush strokes into the narrative so I could lure an audience,” he said. “It came out of an organic place because his story was that outrageous. Jack Abramoff is that outrageous and that colorful.” Indeed, a man who can pray in one breath and bribe a senator in the next, as portrayed in the film, does seem quite outrageous.
Hickenlooper admits that he was very inspired by Network and its masterful balance of similar tones. “It’s not done anymore and I’ll tell you why it’s not done,” said Hickenlooper. “It’s because the marketplace has become so crowded and it’s so difficult to get attention in the marketplace that movies aren’t generally as brave as they used to be because they’re harder to sell.”
“It’s either got to be a pure satire or pure drama or pure thriller. And as a result the marketplace has really restricted the breadth and scope of movies—in my view. I like movies that push the envelope in that sense. And some people aren’t used to that. Because a lot of film reviewers or critics or consumer guide reviewers or whoever they are—they are used to what the cookie cutter is. They’re used to what the marketplace has been dictating for the last decade.”
For Hickenlooper, it was also important that Casino Jackwould have an outside perspective on actual events: “I’ve always considered myself an outsider and my views have always been a little on the fringe—whether on the left or the right.” Having a Canadian producer, writer, and funding, as Casino Jack did, also helps when telling a story about Washington.
But does particular funding assure independence? With a major star such as Kevin Spacey, can a film be considered a true indie?
Hickenlooper began to say that there’s no such thing anymore—“it’s either an Ironman 2, or the rest.” But then he introduced an interesting notion, that the defining characteristic of independent film is being independent of distribution. “Films that purely play at films festivals and have no other economic apparatus or financial apparatus to support them in the marketplace—those are truly independent films.”
Having had a Canadian distributor in E1 and having signed a US distributor during TIFF, Casino Jack does not quite qualify for ‘independent film’ status in that context, yet it is not a large-budget film (shy of $10 million) and was not financed by a major studio. But whether it’s a studio film or an independent one, said Hickenlooper, “There is really never enough money or enough time.”
Perhaps Casino Jack can be considered truly ‘independent’ in terms of thought and politics? Hickenlooper no longer considered himself a Republican or a Democrat (though he supported President Obama and his cousin John Hickenlooper was just elected Governor of Colorado as a Democrat). Lest it be overstating the obvious: Hickenlooper defined himself as an independent.
“Jack received, in my view, a very harsh sentence because he technically didn’t really break the law. Lobbyists continue to do what he did. In my view, he was thrown under the bus by the Republicans because he was drawing too much attention to himself as a lobbyist. He was making too much money. He was too flamboyant. And he was drawing to much attention to K Street and that made a lot of lobbyists uncomfortable. So they found a way to throw him under the bus, which is what they did.”
His story is more relevant than ever nowadays, especially with the recent Supreme Court decision that allows for unlimited funds to be shuffled into political campaigns, even if they come from corporations. “If China wants to spend enough money now they can elect a president,” said Hickenlooper.
Still, despite any political views or strong opinions, Hickenlooper said that he is “not here to proselytize or preach political views in this movie.” He wants to entertain people. As simple as that. If audiences find out a bit more about lobbyists in Washington, even better. For all of Hickenlooper’s political convictions and passions, entertainment comes first.
Casino Jack opens December 17th and stars Kevin Spacey, Kelly Preston, Maury Chaykin (in a rather memorable appearance), Rachelle Lefevre, Barry Pepper, and Jon Lovitz.
Post-script:
To say that there is a cloud of shock over everyone who knew George Hickenlooper would be a gross understatement. One of the last things he had said to me was: “I have a feeling we’re going to be good friends for a long longtime.” The irony of life.
I hadn’t known George for very long, but he certainly left an impression. In fact, it was he who had suggested I do this interview and I regret that he never got to read it.
Somewhere in between the foggy glasses of Vodka (no olives) during our friendly conversations, I saw a deeply imperfect man, but also one whose great qualities overshadowed that. I was struck by his curiosity and thirst for life. His desire to be better. And just as things were starting to come full circle for him, he was taken. Life’s but a moment and you never know how long it will linger, but at least I know that George Hickenlooper lived his fully. Goodbye. I found you “very cool” too.
-KB
Both Hickenlooper and Brodsky in her fawning encomium turn a blind eye to (or deliberately ignore/obfuscate) the incredible contradictions inherent in virtually every single one of Hickenlooper’s utterances. The biggest one comes early on when Hickenlooper pontificates that his ideological standpoint grows out of Reagan’s personification of “the concept of individualism in America. “That’s what the US Constitution is about. It’s what the Declaration of Independence is about. It’s about separating ourselves from injustice in the Old World of persecution and coming to the New World and conquering the West.”
In the same breath, Hickenlooper praises and upholds European settlers for escaping “persecution” in the Old World AND persecuting, colonizing and subjugating, or in his word “conquering,” the native inhabitants of the New World! Thus is crime turned into a virtue, and likewise, morally reprehensible crooks like Abrahamoff turned into winsome, misunderstood characters caught up in a tragedy not of their making.
I could go on, but I have to go get under the covers and try not to have nightmares about the revisionism going on all around us. And it is no credit to the Independent to let this kind of horse manure pass for a serious review of a patent whitewashing of history.

1965 Pete Mikkelsen New York Yankees Game-Used Road Jersey
Starting Bid - $200.00, Sold For - $822.50
Offered is a New York Yankees road flannel jersey worn by pitcher Pete Mikkelsen in 1965. The gray road jersey is lettered “New York” across the front and features the number “22” on the reverse. All letters and numerals are appliquéd in navy felt. A “MacGregor 46” label is situated in the collar. Located on the interior right front tail are an additional MacGregor label, reading “Set 1 1965,” and an adjacent laundry tag. The year, “65,” is written in black marker on the left front tail. The jersey has undergone a number change on the reverse and the outline of the original number (“51”) is still discernible under close inspection. Pitcher Pete Mikkelsen wore number “51” in 1965 and the number change indicates that this jersey was later sent down for use by one of the Yankees minor league farm clubs (a common practice at the time). Aside from the number change on the reverse and the removal of a small uniform number tag in the collar, the jersey is original as issued, with no other alterations. Moderate wear is displayed throughout. Mikkelson's 4-9 won-loss record did not exactly tear up the league in 1965, but his 3.28 ERA was certainly very respectable. This garment originates from the famed Barry Halper Collection. One of Barry’s goals was, whenever possible, to have every jersey in his collection signed by the respective player. With that in mind, he had pitcher Allie Reynolds sign this jersey in blue marker (grading “8”) in the collar. He did so because Reynolds wore number “22” with the Yankees during his career and Barry was obviously not aware of the number change (which is very difficult to see without looking specifically for it). Graded A8 by MEARS (base grade of 10, with 2 points deducted for the number change). From the Barry Halper Collection. LOAs from Dave Bushing & Troy Kinunen/MEARS and James Spence/JSA. Reserve $200. Estimate $400/$600. SOLD FOR $822.50

A lot has been written attributing the endless wars in Africa to meddling by former colonial powers who are alleged to bent on getting Africa's resources on the cheap. But, I tend to differ with that assessment. Africa's problems stem from immaturity of understanding what politics is all about. It is political instability that will undo and retard Africa's development.
The first thing the Chinese did in 1949 when Chairman Mao's forces took over was to create political institutions to cater for one unitary state out of all the diverse populations in that country. Yes, the communist political ideology was paramount to build that unitary state. After building that unitary state, the Chinese have embraced capitalism and perfected it to such an extent that they have now become the second biggest economy in the world after the USA. All this was achieved by building stable political institutions.
It has been said several times that people do not eat democracy. The cradle of democracy, Greece, is in turmoil. Even the head of the IMF was convinced to say that the problems in that country are not due to lack of democracy but to the culture of unstable political institutions which do not address the system of accountability. In short she said, Greeks must learn to pay their taxes, not to avoid them. The same goes for many African countries.
Here in Africa, it is instability of political systems attributed to corruption where a few corner the market and thrive at the expense of the majority. In such a situation, the only redress open to the oppressed by such a system is to take up arms against those in power. If political institutions are developed in such a manner that there is an even playing field and there is accountability, there will be stability in Africa. The same goes for newly democratic countries such as South Africa, to give just one example. Many people may not understand what happened in that country in 1949 when the Boers took over from the British or English-speaking government of South Africa.
Whether we like or not, the Boers went on to create their political and economic institutions. The first thing they did was to make their language, Afrikaans, an official language at par with English. Even if one failed in English language, one would still proceed to an Afrikaans university to become a doctor, engineer or whatever. Yes, their undoing was to introduce the policy of separate development or Apartheid. If they had built a unitary state for all the people of South Africa, there would have been no animosity against them as part of the population.
South Africa's democracy did not come about in 1994 due to any protracted war at all but through the world's abhorrent of apartheid. The new rulers of South Africa have to build new political institutions to replace what they inherited if they are to build a politically stable country. This is what Zimbabwe is doing with the introduction of the new constitution. Zimbabwe will emerge stronger and resolute if it is given time to build its political systems to give stability to the country which is a prerequisite to developing a modern state in which every citizen will be able to play a part.
Therefore, Zimbabwe has to avoid political instability but this can only be buttressed by setting up state institutions that are not marred by corruption which is allowing a few to horde the resources of the country. Many think corruption is just a bribe. These bribes take place everywhere, even in developed democratic countries. What corruption that retards the development of the country means is where politically connected people corner the market to themselves and their relatives including their cronies or supporters. This is what happened in North African countries.
They defended their corrupt activities with the force of arms and those arms came from the Western countries. The colonial administrations were set up to give themselves advantages denied the majority of the people. The institutions of state were set up to service this cabal of selfish and racist people. If the new institutions of state were to follow the same concept of colonial administrations to serve the well connected cabal of people, then there will never be any political stability.
In the new dispensation, the environment must be created where anyone can use their potential to achieve success and must be protected by the institutions of state set up to serve the interests of the people not just the few. In this context, the education system is a case in point. This is a known universal pathway to success. The low pass rate in the 2012 O Level examinations must be viewed as a denial of children to aspire to a better life.
Whether this is due to apathy by poorly paid teachers or to lack of financial resources allocated by Government, it is still an unacceptable situation. In developed countries, the average pass rate at O Level is above 60 percent with Asian countries achieving about 80 percent.
The system must not deny children any hope of improving their lives.
What then is an African dream? It is to live in a country with stable political and state institutions which defend the rights of an individual to pursue happiness in peace knowing that no institution whether political or state can take way that right but to reinforce the spirit to succeed in life.
The people of Africa are yearning for political leadership that will bring stability and economic development rather than perennial wars that never seem to end.Quake Live coming to Steam “soon”

What a glorious headline to wake up to: "Anti-Chauncey Group Files Lawsuit."
In the '60s-'70s (forgive the memory lapse of this 88-year-old for preciseness of the past) a small group of students, faculty, merchants and housewives were forced to go to court to stop a similar takeover attempt by not unlike Marc Moen, but the alarm, anger and impotence I still have about the rich and powerful imposing their will on the rest of us is just as seething and strong as then.
City Council and staff: Do the thinking and action you were elected to do. Protect the thousands of voters who put you there to work in OUR interest; not the rich who think their money and power can buy special consideration for their own personal gain.
Press-Citizen staff: Do your job. Look up in your files the stories you wrote (which helped topple the money/property/personal gain of the "Marc Moen of that day," Frieda Heiromymous) in favor of the vast majority of hard-working modest consumer taxpayers who did not want "urban renewal" to take away the quaint, appealing, fair-priced shops which we cherish that is still our downtown.
Let that "deja-vu" prevail rather than the high-towered, glass encased monoliths Marc Moen (and his ilk) would impose on the rest of us.

Iowa CityProtect umpires and fair comment
Page Tools
Coaches must not attack umpires, but should be able to talk about umpiring.
ANOTHER round of football has left supporters of half the clubs unhappy. Some will also be unhappy with the umpires. Almost everyone has an opinion on umpiring; it's part of the game's culture. Coaches certainly have their opinions - often written all over their faces - but the AFL has drawn the line on criticism of umpires. The latest coach to defy the ban, St Kilda coach Grant Thomas, is facing a hefty penalty on a charge of conduct unbecoming. AFL chief Andrew Demetriou's hardline stand confirms that the leeway that coaches were promised at the start of the season has gone. The Age is on record as deploring the peculiar culture of disrespect, even contempt, that umpires have had to endure. Abusive dissent from players should not be tolerated. Thomas also crossed the line from fair criticism to ridicule with remarks that were basically umpire bashing. No one should forget how difficult umpiring has become, or overlook the problems of recruiting and retaining umpires.
There are, however, disquieting aspects to the AFL's stance, which another coaching dissident, Collingwood's Mick Malthouse, has touched on. The authoritarian "zero tolerance" policy sits uncomfortably with the Australian values of individual freedom and egalitarianism that many like to think are embodied in our unique game. The freedom of speech Malthouse espouses is not only a point of principle but ensures the proper and sensible application of rules in our lives, whether as footballers or citizens. Anyone who makes unjustified statements that expose a person to ridicule or contempt is subject to defamation law, so the freedom is not absolute. Coaches must ensure criticism is not just a post-match venting of emotion. (If they can't manage this, they should wait until they calm down.) But it ought to be possible to distinguish between personal attacks and sensible debates on umpiring - whether this involves issues of interpretation or consistency.
Mr Demetriou says "there are forums ... in which you can convey your criticisms", but clearly not all coaches are satisfied with these forums, which also exclude football's biggest constituency, the fans. Why, at times when umpiring is the public talking point, should the media conference be unable to discuss it? We have no sympathy for anyone who indulges in the old-school contempt for umpires, but an autocratically enforced "no comment" is neither healthy nor an intelligent form of "spin". The AFL should grant its clubs' leaders, who share custodianship of football, a reasonable measure of responsibility for commenting honestly on the game.Show me more about:

He boarded IndyGo’s Green Line express bus, paying $7.
“It’s a marvelous service,” said Wescott, 53, who arrived early from Raleigh, N.C., for the American Legion’s national convention that begins Friday. Offering a more comfortable and quicker ride than a regular IndyGo bus, it saved him from shelling out $40 for a cab.Fear not, Murray tells us. The express bus line will be back soon enough if proponents of a $1.3 billion mass transit gain approval for their lofty plans.
Advocates pushing that plan say a more robust transit system, which they hope to put before voters next year, should include fast and inexpensive public transit to Indianapolis International Airport.
The Central Indiana Transit Task Force struck out in the General Assembly this year but will return early next year to press its case for authorizing a referendum. Voters in Marion and Hamilton counties then would decide whether to boost income taxes by three-tenths of 1 percent to pay for it.
If the plan were to win voters’ approval, the 10-year program would double IndyGo bus service and would add train service from Noblesville to Downtown Indianapolis.Don't even think you're going to get voters to approve an income tax to pay for mass transit. And $1.3 billion won't come close to covering the cost of their mass transit plan. That's a mere down payment.An apartheid-era South African security police commander says ex-President FW de Klerk knew of gross human rights violations during his term of office.

Background
Economic performance strengthened in 2011. While production in maturing oil fields declined, non-oil growth accelerated, buoyed by strong activity in the construction, telecommunications and transport sectors. The scaling up of public investment provided a further boost to activity through improvements to the road system, which facilitated transport of goods between the port and the capital city. Inflation declined to below the Central African Economic and Monerary Community (CEMAC) convergence criteria of 3 percent as supply bottlenecks eased and school tuition fees were eliminated.
The external position remained strong, with the sustained large fiscal surplus raising official foreign assets. At end 2011, net external debt turned negative, with assets exceeding debt by about 30 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Despite high oil prices, the current account registered only a small surplus reflecting high imports associated with the scaling up of public investment and strong profit remittances by oil companies. The terms of trade improved, but the real effective exchange rate moved sideways, ending the year broadly unchanged.
The overall fiscal cash balance registered a double-digit surplus, despite the significant scaling up of investment. Revenue was supported by high oil prices and improvements in non-oil revenue collection, while additional fiscal space was provided through rationalization of current expenditure. However, these efforts were insufficient to offset the higher capital spending, and as a result, the 2011 basic non-oil primary deficit (BNOPD) widened by over ten percentage points of non-oil GDP.
In March 2012, a munitions depot exploded in Brazzaville causing widespread destruction and loss of life. Reconstruction efforts are underway, and a very large supplemental budget was approved in April. Despite the high import content, the additional spending is expected to boost growth, while the low level of economic diversification and limited domestic capacity for a supply response will push inflation higher. The overall fiscal cash balance is expected to remain in surplus, but the BNOPD would deteriorate significantly, to over 70 percent of non-oil GDP. Higher imports would reduce the current account surplus to near balance.
Beyond 2012, the outlook is favorable. Public investment is laying a foundation of basic infrastructure and the government has started to implement their action plan to improve the business climate. Non-oil growth is expected to remain robust as economic diversification moves forward, with new investments beginning over the medium term in mining and agroindustry.
As production in mature oil fields continues to taper off, the current account will remain in slight surplus before turning sharply negative in 2015–17 reflecting imported investment goods related to a huge mine expected to come on stream in late 2017. External risks appear manageable, as inward spillovers from a worsening of the situation in Europe are relatively limited due to weak trade and financial linkages. The risk of a large negative shock to the oil price is partially attenuated by ample regional reserve holdings and sizable fiscal buffers held offshore. Domestic risks surround uncertainties regarding the ability of public investment and structural reform to raise future growth and deliver poverty reduction. Maintaining reform momentum for strong policy implementation will help mitigate these risks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for achieving macroeconomic stability. Despite robust growth, poverty nevertheless remains widespread and unemployment is high. Directors urged the authorities to use the favorable environment to pursue ambitious reforms in order to broaden the economic base and make growth more inclusive.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy appropriately focuses on scaling up investment, while saving a portion of oil revenue. They recognized the pressing capital expenditure needs, especially in response to the devastating arms depot explosion in Brazzaville, but underscored the importance of project prioritization to ensure that the level of investment is consistent with absorptive and implementation capacity. Directors emphasized that improving public financial management is critical to enhancing expenditure quality. They welcomed efforts to strengthen accountability through adoption of a results-based management framework and expenditure control measures. Directors also called for efforts to contain non-priority current spending and increase non-oil revenue collection. They saw merit in a simple fiscal rule to help anchor spending and savings objectives.
Directors welcomed the new National Development Plan. They noted that unlocking the country’s sizable economic potential requires coordinated efforts to improve the business climate, develop the financial sector, and address the labor skills mismatch and high youth unemployment. Directors emphasized the importance of creating a stable business environment governed by the rule of law and adequate investor protection. They urged a cautious approach to the use of special economic zones given the risks these entail in creating a dual tax system. Directors also encouraged the authorities to conduct a skills assessment to inform labor policies and to work with the private sector regarding training needs.
Directors noted that Congo’s membership in CEMAC and the region’s common fixed exchange rate regime has anchored macroeconomic stability. They urged the authorities to comply with all CEMAC obligations, including the repatriation and reserve pooling requirements. In addition, Directors encouraged timely compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and stronger efforts to improve national accounts and balance-of-payments data.

Issues Congress has been unable, or unwilling, to handle are stacking up. | AP Photo
“Ultimately, we thought we’d be doing it during September or the lame duck,” said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), whose Oversight and Government Reform Committee is charged with the nation’s postal system.
But instead of reforming the Postal Service — which Democrats and Republicans agree they must do — Congress will most likely just pass a one-year patch.Continue Reading
“They don’t have the votes to pass it,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said of Issa’s postal reform bill, which is opposed by unions. “And it’s Issa’s fault.” Issa maintains that he’s working on a long-term bill with the Senate.
The Senate isn’t much better. The chamber has yet to pass a single appropriations bill — a failure that has stalled items lawmakers hoped would ride alongside the spending legislation.
Tactically, leaders in both chambers don’t have many options. The House has only 19 days in session before the November election. Republican leaders have told members who have legislative priorities that the floor schedule is largely set.
That’s why people are eyeing the lame duck. There’s even some thought that Congress could jam through a five-year farm bill then — though nothing’s been settled on that front.
The story of how online gambling might be tackled this Congress underscores the complex negotiations to get things done.
Opponents to the bill — including professional sports associations and casino mogul Sheldon Adelson — have softened their opposition, according to sources involved in the negotiations.
While Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and retiring Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) have been moving toward an agreement to legalize online gaming — many states have pre-empted them and moved on their own. But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is still opposed, making an immediate agreement elusive. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who is facing a tough race in November against Las Vegas Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley, has been tasked with finding Republican votes for the bill. He has been unable to so far, according to sources involved in the negotiations.
Onlookers know that the ground is softening — and the hurry of the lame duck could be the perfect opportunity.
“I think there’s a lot of reason to believe why there should be a bill done sooner than later,” Poker Players Alliance head John Pappas said. “Even those in Congress who are opposed to Internet gaming recognize to do nothing would only worsen the problem.”
John Bresnahan contributed to this report.

This is truly frightening. Especially after all the hidden agenda the Democrats sneaked into Obamacare under cover of darkness before anyone could read it. In the haste to pass all the upcoming lame-duck legislation, I fear that no one will be able to pay attention to all the onerous details that may be again sneaked in--especially if Obama is defeated and the Democrats try to cram through a bunch of things as a "scorched-earth" campaign on the American people.
Can we not just outsource Congress to China, and get things done for less?
Hill braces for lame-duck frenzy
Well we already have a lame-duck Administration Occupying the White House until January 20th, 2013............so what's new.
And members of Congress wonder why their favorability numbers are near single digits. They are cowards that also shirk their work and duties in favor of political theater. Issa is a good example; instead of solving our postal system's problems (which were largely created by irrational Republican legislation in the first place under Bush/Cheney), Issa and his Republican dominated committee has squandered a year and a half on Republican show hearings, politicized stunts and theater of the absurd. Our lawmakers plan to pass bills -- a whole bunch of them -- but after their day of accountability at the ballot boxes. They plan to hide them by burying them inside other bills. They plan to rush through them like a last-minute checklist before leaving for yet another long vacation, hoping to escape our notice. What happened to Boehner's pledge that every bill will be read, every bill will be singularly introduced and openly debated? The overloaded sloppy rush of bills Congress is piling up for passage in the lame duck session is one reason the resulting laws will be bad and lead those affected by the new scatterbrained laws asking: "What were these idiots thinking when they passed this?"
Roameo: "And members of Congress wonder why their favorability numbers are near single digits. They are cowards that also shirk their work and duties in favor of political theater. Issa is a good example"..........................And if Issa is a good example, then Reid must also be one, as well. Somehow you fail to mention the Senate. Maybe it's because you're a screaming leftist unwilling to present the truth. Most of us on the right are already asking your final question over the ACA, which happened under democrat watch.
The GOP should use this time to plan for post election business!!! The house will remain GOP and the senate will be over taken by the GOP and we will have a new president in 104 days!!! There is no time to loose, so get busy:)
Here is the epitome of the problem. Harry Reid has stalled the needed work of the American people.
Fortunately, Harry will be Minority Leader (maybe) come January, unable to stonewall legislation anymore.
This is another reason why it was such a Godsend that the Republican party took over the House in 2010. With a lame-duck Democratic-controlled House and Senate, along with a lame-duck Democratic president, there is no telling what damage they could have done to the country.
But we now have a House where at least the Republicans read the bills before they vote on them and we will have to rely on them to stop the Democrats from ramming through any more unpopular bills like Obamacare.
All we have to worry about now is a lame-duck presidentissuing more of his illegal, unconstitutional "royal" proclamations circumventing the other branches of government.
President Romney's first action as President in January should be to repeal every presidental order that Obama has issued. His second should be to order the executive branch to follow the law, despite what Obama has told them.
Dont be to sure my friend, remember the Light Bulb BillSh!t?
The republican house has done what it set out to do. Nothing. Wait, they did pass again the 'In God We Trust' national motto. Though, I believe the founders had a better national motto.
American corporations, not small business, and the wealthy have had a great two years. Wall street, coal, and China remain very indebted to the republicans for their fine lack of work. Though, China is a little peeved that Keystone has not yet been rammed through. China upped the stakes by buying 100% ownership of another Canadian tar sands company. Though, the USA really can't boast, the republicans helped to enable the sale of Chesapeake Energy to China. China and Chesapeake Energy have told the republicans to remove the EPA and its protection of fresh clean water.
Yes, the republicans and those following the Chicago economic model are running on plan where they have theorized that America may recover after a decade or two miraculously without manufacturing.
The Obama administration has done what it set out to do ... stage a near collapse of the American economy.
The Obama administration has done what it set out to do ... stage a near collapse of the American economy.
Presumably he set out to destroy the economy in order to induce a mass uprising the proletariate, who would overthrow the government and install an islamo-commie-facist-sharia-dicatorship.
Fortunately, a lot of Americans have AR-15s with high-capacity magazines, so these blessed patriots will certainly stop the 1st Armored Division's tanks when the troops start rolling down the streets of San Antonio, kicking in doors to confiscate guns and forceably convert baptists to islam.
Or something like that...
Obama up 6 points? leading in swing states except one? they should call it the dead duck session. off the cliff we go. sequester and an end to the tax cuts. a correction that will happen with the housing market stabilizing and a new normal occuring in the jobs front. Repub house but by 10 fewer and a repub senate but by only 1 and obama re elected becausse of Romney's negatives(people are not voting for him their voting against the Pres). gridlock as far as the eye can see
Guaranteed: after Obama is re-elected, during the lame duck session, he will issue a blanket executive order giving amnesty to basicallly all 11 million illegal aliens in the country. The amnesty will specifally include mara salvatrucha gang-bangers, as did Bush 43 original amnesty, as long as they promise to behave and end their gang affiliation.
When Bush the jerk 43 did that, I withdrew my registration from the republican party, and have been registered as "decline to state" in California. I may renew my registration one of these days, and I will vote for Romney. But in a state where the Mexican flag flies over the capital dome, my vote doesn't count..
More likely something like this:
Once again, the Administration, committed to it's Keynsian beliefs will call on higher taxes on the wealthy (those making more than $100,000 a year, after passing the "fairness bill" that in no way altered the trajectory of deficits and national debt. However, wanting to appeal to our Chinese Bond holders, it was felt that growth and Taxes were synonymous.
The continued need to stimulate the economy, will require FAR more massive Government spending., to this end we should engage in MASSIVE expansion of entitlements. This of course to be funded, by increased taxes on our Corporations, who like the leaches they are need to continue to pay for the roads they use and the educational system that can't teach how to read, write and basic arithmetic.
As far as moral standards go, well as long as you are NOT Christian, and are part of a "victim group", THERE ARE NONE.
We after all expect NOTHING from you other than reproduction and consumption of Government services.
Or something like that.

It's a little sad, but definitely true.
My wobbly legs would have embarrassed even a seasick sailor and my arms had all the strength of noodles. My eyes were filled with dirt and my sneakers drenched with water.
I showed up for a tour of duty as a groundskeeper assistant for the Staten Island Yankees and Jane Rogers, the team's president/general manager, handed me a blue team T-shirt and hustled me out on the field in time to help remove the gigantic 180-foot by 180-foot tarp from the infield.
"The job is not about mowing the lawn," Rogers said when I reported to work Friday night not expecting much more than watching a terrific fireworks display following the New York-Penn League game against the Hudson Valley Renegades. "It's about maintaining a safe and pristine playing field for the players. You need skills to be able to maintain that field.
"It's the stage that allows us to put the show on."
PART ONE: A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AN USHER
It took 25 employees to pull off the orchestrated maneuverings of first-year head groundskeeper Bill Butler and his assistant, Luis Mejia of the Bronx, two hours prior to the first pitch.
I was included in that group, along with marketing folks, sales executives, and ticket reps. And with the 200-pound tarp rising and falling in 25 mile-per-hour Fourth of July winds in St. George and once nearly engulfing me, I thought of the ancient high-sea books Robinson Crusoe and Treasure Island that I once enjoyed reading so much.
I was a sportswriter on a collision course with a shipwreck.
When I had survived the ordeal and caught my breath, I staggered over to Butler, a Boston native who has won five Baseball Field of the Year awards during 24 seasons in the business, as he worked feverishly smoothing the infield dirt near first base.
It didn't take long to catch the drift that Butler and Mejia are highly esteemed at the ballpark, as much for their work ethic as for their professional pride in the ballpark.
Butler's story, in particular, sounded much like the rags-to-riches tale of so many successful people. He was embarking on a career in computers when his company in Boston suddenly folded, so the 20-year-old headed to Florida in 1990 and saw a Help Wanted sign while attending a spring-training game at the Kansas City Royals' complex.
"I got a job in the warehouse unloading trucks and they gave me a vending job during games. I was hawking Pepsi in the stands, hustling all over the place, and at the end of spring training George Toma, probably the most famous groundskeeper in the world, and GM Herk Robinson grabbed me and said they liked the way I hustled.
"They asked me if I'd like to work on the grounds crew. I thought it was going to be temporary so I found a computer job, but I loved it and I worked my way up from being bottom man in the crew to an assistant. The following year when they came back to spring training, they pulled me off the Triple-A field and said they wanted me on the major-league field."
He landed his first head groundskeeper gig with the Spokane (Wash.) Indians, a team owned by Hall of Famer George Brett and his brothers. He worked in Kansas City as an assistant when the Royals switched to a natural grass field, and has since run the show at Double-A Bowie (Md.) and Trenton (N.J.), as well as successful stints at Single-A Lakewood (N.J.) and Myrtle Beach (S.C.) and a two-year stretch as Director of Field Operations for the Mets from 2004-05.
It's not unusual for Butler to arrive at work at 7 a.m. and not leave until 11 p.m.
He sounded regretful that a back injury forced him to miss the start of the current season –- the first time in his long career that he was placed on the disabled list and forced to the sidelines.
Butler said that the key to the maintenance of the breath-taking 7,171-seat St. George stadium is that the field is built on sand to allow for maximum drainage. He said the rains from earlier Friday would have threatened to postpone the Fourth of July game if not for the excellent drainage system.
Instead, the field was in perfect shape when the Yankees and Renegades took the field at 7 p.m.
I offered bit roles in hosing the infield and putting the baselines down, but my debut as a groundskeeper assistant didn't amount to much more than that. I must admit I was pleased to hear that other than dragging the infield in the bottom of the fourth inning, the crew normally doesn't have a lot to do during the game other than keep a sharp eye for any problems.
Imagine if there had been a rain delay and the tarp had to be rolled out again?
They probably could have found me hiding in the press box.
NEXT: The concession stand.Leasehold vs freehold: why how you own your home matters
If you own a house then the chances are you own the freehold, meaning that you own the property and land it is on lock, stock and barrel.
However, if you own a flat chances are that you own it on a leasehold basis, (this is likely to be the case even if you have a share in the building's freehold.
We explain the pros and cons of both types of ownership.
Ownership: A freehold gives you more control than a leasehold
Leasehold means that you have the right to occupy a property a property for a set period of time (the length of the lease), but do not own the building itself.
The advantage of owning property freehold, or having a share in the freehold of a property is that you are either totally in control, or have a say of what happens with the building, and in the latter case any repairs or service charges.
Leasehold
More than 2m people own a property on a leasehold basis, where they own the right to occupy, but not the building itself.
But thanks to changes made over the past decade, they have the right to get together with their neighbours and buy the landlord out, so owning the property together and exercising real control over their lives.
If you 'buy' a leasehold flat, you don't actually own the property. All you own is the right to live there for a specified period of time - however much time remains on the lease. Many leases are granted on a 99-year term while some run for 999 years. Most banks and building societies are happy to lend on property that has at least 75 years unexpired on the lease.
Share of freehold
In recent years the option to become a share of freehold owner has become much easier. This allows you to own your flat outright. Essentially it works by the owners of leasehold flats buying the freehold off the freeholder and then all owning a share of it.
Your property will still be owned leasehold but the new freehold organisation can grant new leases of long length, say 999 years, with a peppercorn ground rent.
This is preferable for technical reasons to owning a flat freehold, which causes problems with insurance companies and mortgage lenders.
Once you have a share of freehold flat you will then have a share in the common areas of the building - roof, walls, stairs and hallway - and be partly responsible with the other commonholders for the upkeep of those areas.
Previously, most flats were owned on a leasehold basis. This meant they were held on long leases that run for 99 years. After that their ownership reverts to the landlord of the building the flat is in, who pays no compensation to the tenant.
Leaseholders can also be prey to landlords who may demand exorbitant management fees, charge for building insurance at vastly inflated rates and threaten to evict anyone who refuses to pay up. Landlords can also stop leaseholders selling their flats.
Buying a property's freehold is a legal process and will require solicitors. The best way to find out more is to visit Government-funded Lease which gives free advice.
What happens in share of freehold
Under the new rules, upkeep of all the common areas of a building is the responsibility of the shared freeholders.
The idea is that an association is set up to manage the communal areas of the building. Flat owners who do not want to get involved in the extra work this may involve can appoint a managing agent.
Share of freehold can work out cheaper as owners will not be prey to the over-charging endemic in the leasehold sector. They will be able to negotiate their own service fees with cleaners, find the best-value buildings insurance and get a better price for building repairs than landlords often do.
The price of a share of freehold flat could well be higher than a leasehold one, but any difference is likely to be small unless a leasehold flat has a short lease remaining. This would come from the fact that leaseholds dwindle over the years and so the nearer they get to the end, the less they are worth.

Caliber .50 Sniper Rifle (CFSR)
The M107 semi-automatic Long Range Sniper Rifle (LRSR) is a direct-line-of-sight weapon system that employs greater destructive force than other US sniper rifles against light materiel and personnel targets at longer ranges. The weapon fires .50 caliber Browning Machine Gun (BMG or 12.7x99mm NATO) ammunition and is capable of delivering precise, rapid fire on targets out to 2,000 meters, greatly exceeding the terminal effect capability of the accessory rail. Accessories include hard and soft cases, detachable folding bipod, detachable sling, extra 10-round magazines, cleaning/maintenance equipment, and manuals.
The 3-lug bolt of the M107 locks rigidly into the barrel extension, to accommodate the widest variety of factory ammunition loads. The adjustable bipod may be detached by removing a single quick-release pin. The M107 is set up to mount a variety of telescopic sights and with good ammunition this combination usually produces minute of Angle (MOA) accuracy. The M107 may be disassembled for cleaning without tools.
The .50 caliber Barrett Model 82 series, including the M107,.
US Army snipers deliver precision fire against enemy targets that are outside a rifleman's limitations of range, size, location, mobility and visibility. In the US Army it was intended to be used to defeat materiel targets located at distances beyond the range of the standard M24 7.62mm Sniper Weapon System. In the hands of a trained sniper, the M107 can surgically take out strategic targets while minimizing collateral damage. It is capable of hitting personnel targets as far away as 1500 meters and materiel targets out to 2,000 meters.
Compared to the M24 7.62mm Sniper Weapon System, the M107 has more powerful optics and fires a variety of .50 caliber munitions. This provides sniper teams greater capability to identify and defeat multiple targets at increased ranges. The M107 enables Army snipers to accurately engage personnel and material targets out to a distance of 1,500 to 2,000 meters respectively. The weapon is designed to effectively engage and defeat materiel targets at extended ranges including parked aircraft, command, control and communications, computers, intelligence sites, radar sites, ammunition, petroleum, oil and lubricant sites and various lightly armored targets. In a counter-sniper role, the system offers longer standoff ranges and increased terminal effects against snipers using smaller caliber weapons.
The M107 is derived from the commercial M82 rifle series (the M82A3 specifically) manufactured by Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Inc. of Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Barrett subsequently offered the specific configuration commercially for sale as the M107, and offered a commercial "Close Quarters" (M107CQ) variant with a shorter, 20 inch barrel. The functional commonalities between the M107 and the commercial M82 eventually led Barrett to fold it in with the M82 product line commercially, with all configurations of the base weapon being part of Barrett's commercial M82A1 family (the M82A1A, A1M, and A3 commercial nomenclature also having been dropped). In 2011, Barrett introduced a lightweight variant of their semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle, which also featured a Barrett-designed quick-attach sound suppressor, which it offered commercially as the M107A1.SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Negotiating with the IRS has never been easy, but lately it's gotten even harder. As the agency increasingly focuses on collection, tax practitioners say, options that allow taxpayers to write off or substantially pare their tax bill have become a harder row to hoe.
That makes those sales pitches promising you'll pay "pennies on the dollar" of your tax bill questionable at best. But taxpayers with a legitimate hardship, and who can prove their willingness to work with tax collectors, still have a legitimate shot at winning some reprieve under the IRS "offer in compromise" program or by agreeing to an installment payment plan.
Because of tax-law changes that went into effect last year, some taxpayers who might have legitimately claimed a break under the offer-in-compromise program in the past likely won't be able to anymore, tax experts said.
The main reason: A 20% up-front payment of the lump sum settlement you promise to pay. That may be a substantial barrier to applying for the program for taxpayers who are struggling to pay anything at all. Plus, the deposit is nonrefundable if your offer is rejected by the IRS.
Also, some tax practitioners note that it's simply harder to get IRS approval these days.
Over the past 10 years, about 90% of his offer-in-compromise applications on behalf of clients were approved by the IRS, said David Levine, an enrolled agent with D.M.L. Consulting in Reno, Nev. But his approval rate has declined to about 70% in recent months, he said. Enrolled agents are tax preparers who are authorized to represent taxpayers to the IRS.
"I wouldn't make an offer if I didn't think it would be approved. Now, I'm down in the 70% bracket and I'm using the same diligence," he said.
Some note that plenty of taxpayers misunderstand the offer-in-compromise program, thanks in part to advertisements promising to wipe out tax bills.
"People need to know that an offer in compromise is not a magic key to make their taxes go away, if they have the assets or the ability to work to pay" their bill, said Jayme Gallenson, an enrolled agent with H&R Block in Corte Madera, Calif.
"I've had doctors walk in with millions of dollars of assets in real estate who want an offer in compromise because they're having a bad year. I have to explain to them, 'No way,'" Gallenson said.
Still, some low-income taxpayers who meet certain income limits can apply to waive the 20% down payment plus the $150 application fee. Often, that taxpayer is facing severe economic hardship, perhaps because a medical condition makes it impossible to work, Gallenson said.
Easier installment plans
Luckily for taxpayers not in that situation, the requirements for the IRS' installment program are a bit easier to meet these days.
"The IRS would at one time not accept an installment agreement unless over the life of that agreement the taxpayer was going to be fully paid" on a tax bill, said Frank Degen, an enrolled agent in Long Island, N.Y.
"When they changed some of the legislation, they now accept partial-payment installment agreements, the notion being that if the taxpayer is down on their luck and can afford to pay $100 a month, it's better to get the $100 a month than to get nothing."
If you owe less than $25,000 and can pay the full amount over time, the IRS routinely accepts such installment agreements, Gallenson said.
If you're asking to pay less than the full amount you owe, then the IRS may request information about the current state of your finances, he said, via a Form 433A. "Usually, if you're going to pay less than the amount, they're going to ask for financial disclosures of your personal situation," Gallenson said.
The IRS will also want to see that form if you request an installment agreement on a tax bill of more than $25,000, he said.
Of course, installment payments aren't exactly free. "Interest and penalties always keep going. The penalties stop at 25% of the tax liability, but interest always keeps running and the interest can be quite substantial. There's no free ride," Degen said.
Professional help a plus
Taxpayers with a large tax bill that they cannot pay may want to consider hiring a professional tax preparer.
"For the average taxpayer, trying to get through to the IRS sometimes can be a daunting task," Gallenson said. Professionals have access to "practitioner hotlines where we can get through almost immediately to someone who can bring up the taxpayer's account and with whom we can discuss the opportunities," he said.
"We know the shortcuts and we know how to use them. There are many times clients have been very frustrated, [but then] they sit down at my desk, I make a call and get it resolved while they're sitting there," he said.
No matter what your ability to pay is, it's important to file on time, as the failure-to-file penalty is 4.5% per month, while the failure-to-pay penalty is 0.5% per month. That is, if you don't file, you'll pay 5% per month, plus interest. If you file, but fail to pay, you'll pay 0.5% per month, plus interest.
Also, tax practitioners say that if you can't pay, the best thing is to notify the IRS right away. If you owe less than $10,000 and start making payments right away, there's a good chance the IRS will accept your installment agreement terms.You are using an outdated browser.

Here is a collection of user reviews for the medication Cordarone sorted by most helpful.
I had 10 or more side effects. Caused by blood pressure toodrop and I wold fall. I waked like a drunk from one side to the other. After a pace maker conditioned stayed same. After one month in rehab still on this drug. I QUIT the drug and went to another older drug and it has been 3 months and I am nearly back to my old self before this drug. As far as I am concerned it should be taken off market it has too many side effects and some life threatening.
I have sun sensitivity, 46% reduced lung function, hypothyroidism, thinning hair,blurred vision and still get some fibrillation. I am very unhappy with the terrible side effects. My health is much worse using it.

Terribel reaction to the sun so have had to stop taking it. However seems to have got rid of the fibrillations
I was on Amio for about a year when I went in for a lung test. The drug was working wonders and I hadn't had any episodes of VT in that time. However my lung test (PFT) showed that my lungs weren't working properly which was a side effect from this drug. I was deeply disappointed since I had already tried all the other anti-arrtyhmic drugs out on the market. I had to stop taking it immediately and 30 days later I had an episode of VT which caused my ICD to fire.
My mother passed away in January 2011 after many years of being on amiodarone.Death certificate stated she had interstitial pneumonitis and respiratory. As you may know this drug causes respiratory failure and I believe it contributed to her death as she was never diagnosed or had any respiratory problems. Pulmonary fibrosis doesn't just creep up on you. Does anyone have any patient information pages from Wyeth prior to 2005 indicating this warning. This is a drug that should be used as a last resort and if you are taking it you should be monitored and have pulmonary functions, thyroid, and liver among other body systems. Thanks, Lynne

I was having a procedure called Atrial Ablation, when the doctor nickef my heart, had to be rushed to the OR for Surgery. In hospital for 5 days heart did not go back into normal sinus rythum, put me on this drug. 4 Years later still on drug, having problems with shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, weight gain, stomack protrusion. Have had 4 Cat Scans in 4 years having another today to check for Amirohfdione Toxicty. Effecting my way of life even lost job. Been to four Pulmanologist they have sent me back to heart doctor. Also having Echo on Heart next week. Very frustrating.
Taking 400 mg to begin treatment for A-fib. After about 3 weeks, I have experienced new problems. Bruise very easily, strong blood in urine, baloated stomach, possible swelling of kidney, Thyroid factor of 1.1 (bottom normal is 4.5), trouble with balance when walking, poor sleep, lots of yawning, swelling of feet and shins. I had seemed to be doing good and all of a sudden all hell broke loose. Primary concern was blood in my urine, but can't at this time verify that this medication is the cause...but it is highly suspected by me. I'll call doc tomorrow to report my findings. I am told that taking Warfarin (Coumidin) along with this drug may have caused some of the problems. This was not an issue that was expressed in the literature. I won't be taking any more.... unless it can be proven to me that these problems as listed above are not associated with the "Amio". I hope I don't die tonight from internal bleeding in my kidneys. I will have to admit, that being a 'party' weekend, I did not slow down on booze. I don't drink usually, so this weekend was an exception that may have contributed to the blood in my urine..which is bad.

Save yourself. Save the planet. Don't even think of unleashing yet another overly Zen or yoga-rific bit of bland on the world.
Seriously, if we see one more green design anchored by potted grass or aromatherapy candles we're going to hop into a gas guzzler and drive cross-country while tossing fast-food hamburger wrappers on the highway. But if you're really keen on launching green or want to woo investors, stop in at Brooklyn Bowl first for the right kind of inspiration. A 23,000-square-foot LEED-certified space, it's a gonzo fun blend of bar-restaurant-concert space and bowling alley.
Owned by longtime NYC nightlife entrepreneurs Pete Shapiro and Charley Ryan, the converted warehouse--now loaded with reclaimed wood and a drinks menu that celebrates truly local tap-only from-the-borough brews--delivers a solid lesson in what a green business should be. This isn't green that bowls you down and makes you feel bad about yourself. This is green done because the owners believe in it. Brooklyn Bowl is "the child of" The Wetlands, Shapiro's former concert space that, name and all, felt quite a bit crunchier than his Williamsburg-based business space.
Stop in for drinks, food, a show or--yes--some bowling, and you're guaranteed to get ideas to set your own eco-business apart. And should you bring potential investors along (and you should bring them along), they'll get LEED-certified envy over the business Brooklyn Bowl does every night. Discuss your plans while chowing on fried chicken served up by the Blue Ribbon-run kitchen (beware, it's addictive) and by the time you've finished pouring your first pitcher of Brooklyn Bowl Pale Ale, they'll want in on your newly altered eco-vision. The place is balls-to-the-wall good stuff.

Published 4:00 am, Wednesday, June 7, 2006
Caption
PEIRCE07_003_RAD.JPG SHOWN: Yellowing leaves on lemon trees to illustrate a question: "What's happening to the lemon trees?" The answer is lack of water, due to either drought or root rot from too much water. Photo shot in San Francisco, CA. on WEDNESDAY, May 31, 2006. (Katy Raddatz/The Chronicle) Photo taken on 5/31/06, in SAN FRANCISCO, CA. **Photo: Katy Raddatz
Q: My Meyer lemon at home -- planted in the ground -- looks as if it is dying. Its leaves are turning yellow and withering. I suspect root rot from too much water, but I don't know. The same appears to be happening to one in a planter on a nearby rooftop that I see from my office window.
A: As interesting as it is to contemplate a leaf-yellowing flu that is afflicting lemon trees, or perhaps a space alien that is sucking their sap, the answer is more likely to lie with watering practices. When a citrus tree can't get enough water from the soil, it develops yellow leaves with some wilting. Paradoxically, both overwatering and underwatering can cause these symptoms.
An overwatered tree often develops root damage from decay, so it can't bring in enough water. Our record six-week rain could have created this unhappy condition, especially if you have clay soil. If the damage isn't too severe, the tree is likely to recover if allowed to dry out for a while. You can purchase a water meter and use it to probe the soil a few inches down. Don't water until that soil is still moist but on the dry side, then water deeply.
Citrus trees in the ground will need water on the order of every two weeks in the dry season, but it depends on the type of soil and the weather. Also, be careful when you irrigate that you don't let the trunk stand in water, which can encourage disease.
The roof-garden citrus tree, in a container, is more likely to be suffering from dry soil. The smaller volume of soil in a container dries out faster than the open ground. If this is the problem, a containerized citrus tree should perk up within 24 hours after a thorough watering. Long, warm, windy spring days dry the soil fast, so you have to pay special attention to plants in containers.
Now, if the leaves of your tree are yellow between the veins while the veins themselves are still green, your problem is iron deficiency. This is caused by planting in soil that isn't acidic enough, so the plant can't absorb iron. Solve this problem by using a chelated iron fertilizer. Follow instructions on the label.
Q: This is my second year with an infestation of surreal grasshopper (scudder's bush katydids). They are happy to stay in my backyard and eat rose leaves and photinia shrubs. I need to kill them as opposed to spraying them off with water. I have been manually eliminating them and using insecticidal soap. Do you have any other suggestions? Possibly a repellant?
A: I picture a bucolic scene in which the charming, leaf-imitating katydids sing to you at night while gently munching a few rose leaves, but I'm sure it is in fact a scene of alarming devastation. The good news is that katydids have only one life cycle each year, so it should be possible to get ahead of their multiplication rate. Starting with ideas for repellants, consider buying hot pepper spray or making garlic oil spray. Here's the recipe: Add 3 ounces of minced garlic cloves to 1 ounce of mineral oil. Let stand for 24 hours or longer. Strain out garlic. Then add 1 teaspoon of fish emulsion and 1 tablespoon of castile soap to 16 ounces of water. Slowly mix the fish emulsion solution with the garlic oil and store in a glass container with a tight lid. To use, mix 2 tablespoons of the garlic oil mixture with 2 cups of water and spray.
Another substance that may serve to repel (and possibly kill) the insects is neem oil, but it may be most effective on the younger stages of the insect. If you try these treatments, experiment with only a part of your garden, say one rose plant, so you can see if it works.
In any case, I recommend that you take action later in the year to reduce the number of eggs that live through the winter. It is probable that the species you have lays its eggs between layers of leaves, creating a small, slightly raised and discolored blister. If you defoliate your roses in winter, as many do to encourage dormancy and reduce the occurrence of diseases, you will be removing katydid eggs as well. Be sure to rake up all the fallen leaves as they could be harboring katydid eggs.
In the spring, look for the young nymphs to start hatching and act quickly to repel or kill the pests while they are small. One possibility is to spray them with a half-cup of molasses in a quart of water, which kills grasshoppers and might kill katydids, too. Or, if by chance you could borrow some chickens for a few weeks as the insects are hatching, they would probably clean up your yard nicely while offering fresh eggs in return.Symetra Life Insurance Company today announced that total sales of its Symetra Edge Pro ® Fixed Indexed Annuity have ® Index and the S&P GSCI ® Excess Return Index — and offers a fixed account option and guaranteed minimum value feature.

BookmarksPlease give M A Grant, author of Blood Moon, a warm welcome to the virtual offices this morning!
It’s a pleasure to be here at Manga Maniac Café sharing the Top 5 Places a Werewolf Would Never Take His Date.
I should preface this list by stating that I didn’t come up with it. Connor Sinclair, the broody and sarcastic hero of Blood Moon did. He made me promise to share it exactly as he emailed it. That’s kind of our deal when I talk about him or his brothers. With deepest apologies, here it is…
You know, when you emailed all of us to see who wanted to help with this post, I thought you were insane. Flynn’s a happily married loser who doesn’t know jack about wooing a woman and I’m pretty sure Owen thinks a date is just the day on the calendar. Clearly, you need an expert and I’m your man.
So, all you sweet things, congratulations on dating a werewolf. Having a relationship with one of us isn’t easy, but if you’re going to work that hard, you’d better believe that we should be working just as hard at keeping the relationship alive. If your man decides to take you to one of these places on a “date,” kick his furry ass to the proverbial woods and don’t look back.
1. The mall – Do you know why we don’t like it when you’re drowning yourself in perfume? It’s because our sense of smell rocks and if we’re with you it’s probably because we want to eat you (yeah, up to you to decide in what way). A mixture of overwhelming scents irritate us and give us headaches, which is never good for the end of date entertainment. Really, what else does a mall offer? There are perfume stores, Orange Julius eateries, and teenage boys who seem to believe that Axe body spray commercials are real. If your wolf wants to impress you, he’ll take you to a private boutique and avoid the commercial rush of your local galleria.
2. Petting zoo – Cute furry animals who trust you utterly and want to cuddle as you scratch their little heads. You may find it as adorable as your local animal shelter’s adoption event, but we walk in and see nothing but a walking buffet. An odiferous, obese, unable-to-run-away-and-escape buffet. The only time a petting zoo is safe for us to visit is if there’s a camel or llama present. Those freaking things figure out what we are within seconds and tend to herd the smaller animals to safety. So…animals safe from our predatory instincts, but you don’t get to pet them. Not really worth the five dollars and ice cream cone of rabbit food, huh?
3. Camping anywhere – Bugs. Rocks. Sticks poking you in the back. No showers. And idiots who smell like patchouli and like to hug trees. This makes the top of my list, although my biologist brother would probably argue that camping is a perfect getaway trip. With that in mind, I’ll just add my coup de grace: mosquitos biting you in sensitive places. Enough said.
4. Disneyland – Children, screaming children everywhere. The scent of hot grease and peppy music and people invading your bubble every second. I don’t care how much I love Indiana Jones and the Pirates of the Caribbean rides, that much sensory overload is impossible to handle. If your man disagrees, you’re welcome to trust him. Just know that the creepy wolf shadow you see out of the corner of your eye on the Haunted Mansion ride isn’t a special effect. And I hope you’ve got some Pupperonis in your purse so you can coax him back into your Doom Buggy before he eats the annoying kid in front of you.
5. Vegan restaurant – Why are you dating a werewolf?!? I’m higher than an apex predator. I’m a finely tuned hunting machine who craves meat. There is no way on God’s green earth to hunt tofu. What would you do? Splat some down on the kitchen counter and poke it? “Oh, look, it’s jiggling away…Better catch it before it’s too late!” No. Just…no. If you’re vegan, don’t date a werewolf. If he says he’s going to go vegan just for you, he’s a liar and you’re kissing his bacony mouth every night before bed. Save yourself the heartache and move on.

OMG!! This is hysterical and SO Connor. Vegan restaurant?? Yeah, not happening. And the comment about Axe body spray and teenage boys. Yup, I’ve got one of those and the scent of Axe permeated our house far too much. Luckily he is getting over that obsession.
Great article, Connor. So glad you happened by. Thank MA for me too, for getting your message out to the people.
Loved this, Connor! I’m not a fan of camping or Axe spray either and I can forgo the Disney trip so maybe MA will consider sharing you for a bit.
Thanks for visiting Kari and Carol! I’ll be sure to pass along your messages to the boy…although I may temper it so his ego doesn’t blot out the sun.

And, that, folks, is what led to this unexpected Twitter exchange between Lindsay Lohan and Mara Wilson, who played Robin Williams' youngest daughter in Mrs. Doubtfire (which you've probably watched a dozen times this week).
Ill think about it! ???? RT "@MaraWritesStuff: Please let me ghostwrite your memoirs, @lindsaylohan."— Lindsay Lohan (@lindsaylohan) August 15, 2014
To be fair, Wilson probably understands Lohan's life more than most. She's also written an essay on 7 Reasons Why Child Stars Go Crazy. That has to be a good start.
Though Lohan said her sex life won't be mentioned in her autobiography, it surely won't be short on salacious details. Is Matilda the person to tackle it all? As unsettling as it seems, she just might be. Lock her down, LiLo!

NEW YORK ( ETF Expert) -- In "Why Russia ETFs Are Receiving So Much Love," I discussed several reasons for the recent investment success. They included: (1) non-OPEC oil and gas exposure during Middle East rebellions, (2) large weighting in iron/steel for Japan's rebuilding, and (3) substantial GDP contribution by Russia to global growth.
Yet Russia isn't the only BRIC component that's been traveling a comeback trail. Shortly after the Libyan uprising in late February, I pointed out that emerging markets had been "hanging in" better than developed world markets. And that was before Japan's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis. (See "Emerging Regions Are Recovering More Ground Than Developed Regions" )
Now, the researchers at Bespoke are confirming a familiar pattern in equities. Specifically, emerging market stocks tend to "peak" before developed country stocks; then, emergers "bottom out" before developed country stock assets; then, emerging equities "recover" before developed world equities.Here are the month-over-month returns for popular BRIC component ETFs versus popular developed country ETFs:Have you secured an internship and are interested in the Toppel Internship Program?

Chrysler said its new plan would cut 1,000 more white-collar posts and reduce the use of outside contract employees by 37 percent. It will also eliminate overtime for all employees.
The cuts, the first under Chrysler's new private equity owners, come on top of a reduction announced in February of 13,000 jobs, including 11,000 production workers, or about 16 percent of its total labor force.
Chrysler, the No. 3 US automaker, said it was taking the actions in response to industrywide volume reductions and slower sales that call for "plant adjustments."
The company said it was also halting production of four Chrysler models while adding two new vehicles and two new hybrid autos to its lineup.
Chrysler will have around 59,000 employees when the two rounds of cuts are completed, spokesman Dave Elshoff said.
The actions mark a new reorganization under Chrysler LLC's new owners headed by Cerberus Capital Management, which bought the US automaker from Germany's DaimlerChrysler in August.
The announcement also comes days after a landmark contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union was ratified by a very narrow margin following rank-and-file dissent over lack of job security guarantees.
George Magliano, an analyst with Global Insight said the timing of the announcement shows "the UAW knew it was coming and agreed to it."
The actions come in addition to the reorganization announced in February aimed at restoring profitability to Chrysler through a three-year "Recovery and Transformation Plan."
"The market situation has changed dramatically in the eight months" since the earlier plan was announced, said Bob Nardelli, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive.
Chrysler will be cutting shifts at several US and Canadian plants as part of the streamlining. But it said it remains committed to its pledge to the UAW to spend more than US$15 billion on products, plants and engineering during the life of the latest contract through 2011.Activation of LYN kinase is associated with resistance to imatinib (Gleevec) in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), according to new research..

Five judges at the UK’s highest court backed an earlier ruling which found the 2011 regulations upon which the schemes were based were invalid.
The case was brought by graduate Cait Reilly, who also claimed that being instructed to work for free at a Poundland store, breached her human rights.
But the UK’s highest court rejected claims the schemes were "exploitative" and constituted "forced labour".
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith had hoped to get last February’s Court of Appeal decision overturned.
The schemes, which involved jobseekers allowance claimants working for free or risking cuts to their benefits, have been labelled as “slave labour” by critics while supporters argued they were an effective way of getting people back into work.
Earlier this year three Court of Appeal justices agreed the 2011 "work for your benefits" regulations did not give the unemployed enough information, especially about the sanctions for refusing jobs under the schemes.
Their ruling was a victory for Ms Reilly, 24, from Birmingham, and 40-year-old unemployed HGV driver Jamieson Wilson, from Nottingham, whose jobseeker’s allowance was withdrawn for six months after he refused to do unpaid work cleaning furniture.
The pair’s lawyers said the ruling meant all applicants who had been stripped of their jobseeker's allowance after objecting to the schemes could reclaim the allowance.
The Government took the case to the Supreme Court, while fast-tracking retrospective legislation, the Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act, through Parliament.
Public Interest Lawyers (PIL) said the Government hoped to retrospectively "make lawful what the appeal court declared unlawful" in order to avoid a multimillion-pound bill in payouts to individuals who had been unlawfully sanctioned.
But despite failing to overturn the earlier judgement, Mr Duncan Smith also claimed victory over the Supreme Court’s ruling that the back-to-work schemes were not “forced labour”.
He said: ."
Ms Reilly’s solicitor Tessa Gregory, from Public Interest Lawyers, expressed "delight" at the court's ruling in relation to the legality of the 2011 regulations.
The Supreme Court judges upheld that the regulations were "invalid" as they did not contain a sufficiently detailed "prescribed description" of the schemes.
They also ruled that the Secretary of State had failed to provide sufficient information about the schemes to Ms Reilly and Mr Wilson.
But on the issue of "forced labour" the justices dismissed an appeal by Ms Reilly and Mr Wilson.
Ms Reilly said: "I am really pleased with today's judgment, which I hope will.”>Crescent City California News, Sports, & Weather | The Triplicate
As a former supervisor who was very involved in the matter of Tolowa Dunes State Park, Lake Earl flooding and the closing of Kellogg Beach to traditional uses, I take exception to Peter Douglas’ rantings at Del Norte County’s government decisions (“‘Rogue behavior’ cited: Coastal chief blames damage on the county,” March 4).
We are rural America with rural ways that are far from the confines
of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. We are a free and open
people trying to make a living and enjoy our lives in this wonderful
place.
It is becoming more difficult doing things that we have been free to
do for generations only to be more stifled by government agencies that
control about 80 percent of our community. We elect local people in the
county, city and harbor district to do our business. Agencies such as
the Coastal Commission are appointed by the governor. Their executive
director is hired. These people have too much power and consistently
overrule our elected body decisions at the local level.
I would like to challenge state parks to share with our community
how Tolowa Dunes State Park was really formed. I would like to share my
view that it was formed illegally at a hearing in Eureka, where the
agenda item referred to a discussion on the Tolowa Dunes project. A
vote on the formation of a state park was not on that agenda. Three
people from Del Norte County were at that meeting, none of them county
officials.
After that meeting all references to the Tolowa Dunes project seemed
to disappear and Tolowa Dunes State Park was a reality. I would also
like to ask Steve Horowitz, a top state park official, what happened at
an important meeting that I attended with many grange folks and others
at the Fort Dick Grange.
My recollection was a reaction by many there to state parks wanting
to close Kellogg Beach to many of the traditional uses and accesses.
Folks were not happy with Horowitz’s responses and he turned to me to
see if the county might mind bringing in a neutral facilitator to see
if some agreement might be reached. I told Steve that I would ask
Jeannine Galatioto, our CAO for funding. She approved this request and
I contacted Horowitz’s office. I really felt that this might be a way
to help resolve some of the issues and was looking forward to take part
in further discussions with state parks and our Del Norte County folks.
Guess what? Less than a week later releases came out in The
Triplicate that certain restrictions were being proposed for Kellogg
Beach and a scoping session, “not a public hearing,” was to be held
that Friday afternoon at the Elk Valley Rancheria conference center. I
felt like I was stabbed in the back as the county representative to
this process and that the citizens of Del Norte County were deceived
again on these types of matters.
How long are we as rural Americans going to put up with this
take-it-or-leave-it attitude by these figureheads that think they know
what’s best for us? May I also thank supervisors Hemmingsen, McNamer,
Finigan and Sullivan for representing us well in these matters.

I knocked, and waited. After a time I knocked again. I was about to leave, when the door was opened by a small, broad, barefoot lady.
"Do you tell fortunes?" I asked.
"Yes, come on in," she smiled. "Sorry I took so long, I was brushing my teeth when you knocked."
"You can wait in here, I'll be back in a minute," she said, showing me into a room through a purple door. The room held a curious assortment of decoration: an oriental rug, a Japanese figure lamp, a serapecovered chair, and flower prints surrounded a green modern couch half circling a round, low table on which an alligator and a black jaguar crouched.
Mrs. Star returned presently, having put on shoes and a black unbuttoned sweater over her snug dress. You'll have to pardon the way the room looks," she said, "we had a kind of brawl here last night. A party." She walked out, motioning me to follow her into a smaller room across the hall.
We sat on another modern green couch; she took my hand and gazed intently into my palm. Mrs. Star looked about fifty-five. Her combed-backed black hair, large brown eyes and short breadth indicated gypsy relatives. She began.
"You going to have a long life; it's going to take a long time, but you going to make the top in whatever your business will be. Now I don't want you to have any hard feelings at anything I tell you, okay?"
"Oh. Okay. Sure, of course," I said.
"Okay. You a born leader, understan? See, we all born without any clothes on, so the difference is up here," she tapped her forehead, and her eyes were very deep and gentle. "See, you got the ability to make yourself better than other people you know; but it's going to be hard job. People are going to try to give you a bad name, understan; see, it takes whole lifetime to build up a good reputation, but only five minutes to give a bad name. Now, you got a girl you think you love very, very much, right?"
"Oh. Yes, sure," I said.
"Right; now you very serious about this girl, but she's not the right girl for you, understan? You going to meet a girl in three, four months, and you going to know right away she's the right girl for you."
"Well," I interrupted hesitantly, "should I just drop this other girl?"
"No, it's okay if you see the girl, pass time with her, understan, but don't get serious about her."
"But I am rather serious about her," I said.
"Well, don't get hard feelings about what I tell you, cause I tell you like your mother would, but you can't stay serious about this girl, understan? Now this other girl you going to meet will be the girl you marry after you travel some."The 37LH7000 sits just off the top of LG's LCD range, right behind its Freesat models. But in typical style, that doesn't mean it is expensive. We've found it selling for under £800, which is strikingly little for what it offers.
It's comfortably one of the the prettiest TVs, with its subtle red highlights, see-through bottom edge and high-gloss, ultra-minimal finish.
Its exterior is distinguished by a prodigious suite of connections, including a whopping four HDMIs, a PC jack, and a USB port able to handle JPEGs, MP3s and DivX HD video. It even sports Bluetooth for wireless compatibility with suitable phones and headphones.
Pictures benefit from LG's 100Hz TruMotion, which interpolates new frames of image data to improve motion sharpness and smoothness.
Setup reveals a prodigious suite of picture controls. There's a huge colour management system, noise reduction aplenty, multiple black level boosters and tonnes more. The 37LH7000 is so flexible it's been approved by the Imaging Science Foundation, meaning you could pay one of its engineers to visit you and perfect your picture settings.
If all this flexibility sounds scary, fear not. For the 37LH7000 thoughtfully provides a Picture Wizard utility comprising various test signals and onscreen instructions on how to use them.
Performance
Thankfully, the 37LH7000's pictures don't prove an anticlimax. In fact, they're frequently quite spectacular. Colours, for instance, are exceptionally vivid, making vibrant sources look truly eye-catching. But colours are also naturally toned and subtly blended.
The 37LH7000's 100Hz engine works nicely too, making motion look strikingly fluid and sharp. And so long as you only set TruMotion to Low, you get the motion benefits without suffering many of the flickering, shimmering processing artefacts witnessed using higher TruMotion settings.
Black levels are arguably LG's best. There's still a slightly blue tinge to really dark scenes, but this is much less noticeable than usual.
If the TV has a flaw, it's that HD images don't look as crisp as we know they can. For us, this problem is largely compensated for by the set's impressive motion handling, but it's still a pity it can't quite do full justice to HD material.
Sonically the 37LH7000 is rather run-of-the-mill. There's plenty of sparkle at the treble end of the audio register, which helps a detailed soundmix sound busy and involving. The mid-range sounds reasonably open, too. The problem is there's not enough bass around to effectively balance the trebles, resulting in a rather harsh, hissy tone at times.

Unless you have a high-risk pregnancy there's no reason why holidays are out of the question, but bear in mind the restrictions your condition imposes on your travels when you go abroad.
Boots UK pharmacist Angela Chalmers has shared with us the things you need to know about travelling while pregnant. These top tips will help to ensure that you get the most of your holiday before the upcoming arrival of your little one.
"Travelling when pregnant is generally safe as long as you prepare and take reasonable precautions. But this all depends on your current health status and where you are travelling to - definitely check the NHS choices website for advice before you go," Angela says.
"Each airline will have its own policy on when you can and can't fly so consult with them before booking. Most airlines require a letter from your midwife or doctor to say you are safe to travel and free from complications if more than 28 weeks pregnant."
Before you set off
First of all inform your doctor of your plans and holiday destination, and listen carefully to his advice.
As well as packing beach towels and sunscreen, there are several essential items that you must take with you.
Angela recommends: "Carry your maternity notes with you as your midwife always reminds you not to leave home without your notes! This will prove at what stage in your pregnancy you are if they question whether you are safe to fly."
"If travelling in Europe remember to get E111 cards as this entitles you to essential medical care for free. Without this card you could be charged for seeing a doctor."
Also find out about nearby hospitals and access to medical care where you are staying.
Angela says: "This is wise regardless of your trimester. You want to know where you need to go without delay to get the best maternity care possible."
Choose your destination with care
You can journey to faraway climes for the first few months, but it's ill-advised to do so fromthe seventh month onwards.
Try not to go anywhere where you'll be over-exposed to the sun, as most mums-to-be suffer in the heat.
"Pregnant women will be more likely to have swelling and water retention. Keep well hydrated and avoid extreme heat where possible," Angela explains.
"Follow the same safe sun rules as everyone else - avoid the strong midday sun between 11am and 3pm, wear adequate SPF and reapply liberally and often."
In terms of what kind of activities can you do and which should you avoid, Angela advises against doing anything too high-energy.
"Extreme sports and water sports can be dangerous so should naturally be avoided. A gentle walk or swim is safe," she says.
If you're travelling to exotic destinations, protect yourself from mosquitoes by wearing long sleeves, covering up legs and using mosquito repellent.
"Ask your pharmacist about suitable insect repellents to use in pregnancy as this varies by brand," Angela advises.
Stick to the same pregnancy diet rules as dictated by your doctor, but also be wary of raw produce - peel your fruit and vegetables, always make sure meat is well cooked and only drink water from a sealed bottle.
Angela says: "Take precautions to avoid food poisoning and avoid the usual no-go food suspects."
As well as all this, it's sensible to go somewhere you don't need vaccinations for.
"Avoidance is best but sometimes cannot be helped. You must speak to your doctor about the risk/benefits of vaccination in pregnancy, to help you come to an informed decision," Angela explains.
Travel in comfort
It's essential you travel in comfort, so as not to be at risk of miscarriage or premature birth.
When travelling by car, plane or train, Angela recommends getting up regularly.
"Every 30 minutes stretch your legs. That's sensible to help keep healthy circulation and help to avoid blood clots."

HMV's administrators are set to close 66 of the firm's stores across the UK putting up to 1,000 jobs at risk, it has been announced.
The flagship HMV store at 150 Oxford Street, the biggest music shop in the world, is closing down today.
HMV has confirmed that it will be removing all Lostprophets products on sale in store and online after former frontman Ian Watkins pleaded guilty to a string of child sex offences.
One of Britain's most recognisable high street brands has been saved after Hilco announced it has bought HMV - saving 2,500 jobs and maintaining 141 stores across the country.
Digital music services such as Spotify, Deezer and We7 streamed at least 3.7 billion songs last year, a figure equivalent to single sales for the past 60 years.
Collapsed retailer HMV is to close a further 37 stores, putting 464 jobs at risk.Politics A Democratic Senate?

I had to chuckle when Stern said "A new, new day. Sounds like you have one of those every few months." That statement seems the slightest bit meta, since The Good Wife manages to tout game changing events on a semi-regular basis.
Louis Canning's arrival as the successor to Stern's firm, during "Wrongful Termination," would have had more impact had it not been revealed in the previews, but every time Canning is around there are surefire antics to be had. This time was no different. I honestly didn't care that much about the trial itself, that of a large corporation guilty of trying to induce employees to voluntarily leave in order to fleece the pension fund, because I was more interested in the fluctuations that the death of Jonas Stern caused in the attitudes and thinking of those affected.
Ironically enough, his passing delivered more than a few comical moments, such as the mounds of potato salad containers at Stern's wake. I suppose potato salad is the go-to comfort food for people in mourning. It's funny, because it's true.That canary-eating look between Will and Diane as they lamented Stern's passing then confessed their shared ill-timed opportunistic thoughts had me in stitches. It's been interesting to see the dynamic between Will and Diane change from combative to that of genuine ease and comfort, ever since plotting to evict Bond from the firm. I rather enjoy the cozier countenance the two share over a glass of brandy or whatever their libation of choice may be.
Will appeared to undergo a large metamorphosis, going from stammering "I need some help here" as he tried to figure out what Tammy wanted from him (what guy hasn't been there?) to asking Tammy not to take the job in London upon reflecting on Stern's lack of any real legacy. I don't care much for Tammy. Maybe it's Elisabeth Reaser in the part, I don't know, but she just doesn't feel like a good fit for Will.
Nevertheless, it would seem Will has made the leap from just messing around to wanting a fully formed relationship with her. Or perhaps he's just afraid of being alone.
Despite Alicia's statement to Tammy that things were over between she and Will a long, long time ago, her body language tells a different story. The leering glance as Will approached Tammy in his office. The sparkle-eyed chuckle as she told Tammy Will likes to think he's still a kid, but he's not. She's still very much on the hook where Will is concerned…she just can't do anything about it. Yet.
The news about Peter and Kalinda's one-night affair is about to reach the breaking point. I still am fuzzy on how Petra found out about Peter's dalliance with a co-worker, but she's all ready to blow it wide open. Kudos to Eli for stamping out her inflammatory interview with Alicia, and in glorious form too.
Between that and his opening blowup with the DCC Chairman, I'm getting rather used to seeing Eli lose his cool. It certainly makes me laugh.
With Childs' minion and his talking-lion telephone breathing down his neck, Cary is walking a difficult tightrope. Will his allegiance to his job outweigh his allegiance to Kalinda? I think he's more inclined to tell Childs where to go. That scene of Cary pleading to Kalinda that she should have opened up to Alicia about the affair told me all I needed to know.
Whether it's from a romantic or brotherly standpoint, it makes no difference: Cary loves Kalinda. I think he'll defend her with his dying breath.
Would Alicia really leave Lockhart and Gardner? She has to be at least considering it. Canning's offer is at least the second she's received in a matter of weeks; that has to make her curious what it would be like to move on, especially at a much higher salary. Her contemplation in her office before Eli interrupted leads me to believe she isn't ruling anything out.
That's a new, new day I hope we never see come.

"Alicia staying with Peter is a no-brainer" If Alicia DOES stay with Peter, after his many betrayals and all the heartache he has given her, I'd say that she would really have to have NO BRAIN! Just how stupid is she? I mean really, what is she, a doormat? She should have shown the rotten bum the door a year and a half ago. She was too weak to kick him out, so she did what the "family values" people think she should do: She stood by him -- just like she had done all those years when he was cheating on her. And where did it get her? More sorrow and heartache. Enough is enough. DITCH the bum already!
Alicia staying with Peter is a no-brainer otherwise she becomes the Good Divorcee/Separatee/Adulteress - pick a name . . . lol
John, Wait for the end !!!!
I'm not surprised at all that you would call it a wake, because Kevin Conway looks a lot more like Irish leprechaun Liam O'Shaughnessy than Jewish lawyer Jonas Stern. I always thought that was a bizarre casting choice. Could they really not find anyone who looked convincingly Jewish in New York? And I hate the way Americans tend to pronounce it "Shiv-a" instead of "Sheev-a like it's supposed to be. When it's done properly, the men aren't supposed to shave and the women aren't supposed to wear make-up. It looks like that painted blonde that Diane was offering her condolences to didn't get the memo.... And it's just incredible to see how many people are still obsessing about Will's "dark side" which they are just sure must be there somewhere! What about PETER'S dark side? Yet another example of it is just about to hit the fan, and realistically it should cost Alicia the one female friend she's made in the last year and a half. If Alicia doesn't take this latest revelation that Peter is rotten bum and kick him out the door of the apartment she's paying for, then I'd say she deserves all the heartache that awaits her.
I think you are right about so many things on this greatest of shows. Every week we love Cary more and more. The scene with Kalinda was excellent and telling. And how he kept a straight face while talking to Childs via that lion was amazing. Every cast member on this show deserves EMMY recognition. For the first time in years we are saddened when this show ends each week. We just want it to keep going and going.
1. Alicia will not leave Peter. 2. Will will be tried for embezzelment and fraud. 3. She will leave Lockhart and Gardiner. 4. Kalinda will finally talk to Alicia and make up. 5. The story line will continue to be the GOOD WIFE.
I think it was obvious that Alicia was jealous of Tammy and Will in this episode. She was also clearly happy when Tammy confronted her about her relationship with Will. She is trying to ignore her feelings for Will because it is the right thing to do. But I think she will be honest with him once the Peter/Kalinda secret explodes. I also think she will leave Lockhart/Gardner and pursue a new path, even if it is for a short time, especially if she does get involved personally with Will. The creators hinted of "major changes" so I really don't think the end of this season/beginning of next is going to remain status quo in terms of her marriage or her career. In regards to Will's shady past, who knows? On one hand, it may deter Alicia, on the other hand, it is nothing she hasn't dealt with before.
epi 2.15 thats yesterdays news, Alicia has started to see the light about Will and his playing around and the way he handles business, just wait till they drop the bombshell about his embezzelling and fraud from another firm he work with. My money is on her going with Louis Canning firm and getting away from the undertable corrupted ways at Lockhart-Gardiner, Also she will still be with Peter, he has done nothing wrong since the beggining of the show and she knows it. Her body language says so!!
I should disagree with @Heather. Alicia body language doesn't say she has forgotten about Will (remember epi 2.15), on the contrary. However what's the point of Will moving on with Tammy ... Alicia is going to learn later or sooner about Kalinda, she has offers to work elsewhere. To stay at Lockhart & Gardner she needs some proper incentives. Didn't like the end (I understand it was written that way, but as a Team Will fan, grrrr didn't like it ... I don't see what Tammy has).
I think Alicia should take the Louis Canning offer and get out of the Lockhart-Gardiner firm it has been a complete down for her to ever move on. The firm doesn't have any working capital and she is being used as a mopup goffer for all their crap. I also think her body language said it all the yesteryears are gone and forgotten, she is seeing through the smoke screens and corrupt ways good old Will has brought forth. This show needs a good change of pace, it is getting tired of the same old every week and the ratings are reflecting this.This item sold!

In this article, R. Scott Thompson introduces you to the concepts behind Quartz 2D, and explains how to make the transition from QuickDraw.
QuickDraw has been a vital part of the Macintosh operating system since its release in 1984. QuickDraw is not only the basis for the easy-to-use interface that redefined the way people work with computers, but over the years it has also offered a wealth of functionality that application developers use to surprise and delight customers.
As the demands on QuickDraw increased, the architecture has grown and evolved. From its modest beginnings, supporting eight basic colors on computers with black-and-white screens, QuickDraw has grown to support 256 colors and then both 16- and 32-bit color graphics. QuickDraw has also complemented hallmark technologies of the Macintosh platform--technologies like QuickTime and ColorSync. QuickDraw has been a valuable asset to the Macintosh operating system for decades.
As quickly as it has changed, however, QuickDraw has not evolved rapidly enough to incorporate many of the features found in more modern graphics libraries. To extend the graphics reach of Mac OS X, Apple has adopted a new strategy for handling 2D graphics: the Core Graphics system.
Quartz 2D is a key component of the Core Graphics architecture of Mac OS X, and is the modern technology in the system whose functionality most closely matches that of QuickDraw. It implements a drawing model very similar to the one found in the Portable Document Format (PDF) from Adobe Systems, and allows an application to issue drawing commands to an extensive range of graphics devices.
Quartz 2D, however, is not the PDF analog to Display PostScript. While the API designers at Apple have used PDF as a guiding hand in implementing Quartz 2D, the actual Quartz API extends the basic drawing model with additional features like integrated color management and support for transparency and compositing when working with devices that support those kinds of features.
Quartz 2D is just one aspect of the entire Core Graphics system. Another popular facet of Core Graphics, for example, is the Quartz Extreme window compositor. The Quartz Extreme window compositor combines the features of Quartz 2D and other graphics libraries on the system, with the power of advanced graphics hardware, to provide an industry-leading compositing window system that offers a tantalizing glimpse into the future potential of Quartz 2D and other parts of the Core Graphics system.
Because QuickDraw does not share the same growth potential found in Quartz 2D, Apple encourages application developers to begin using Quartz 2D in its place. This is a boon to both Apple and application developers as the rich feature set in Quartz has the potential to provide innovation and performance improvements for the foreseeable future.
Along with its rich feature set, Quartz 2D has a similarly rich field of concepts and abstractions that make up its drawing model. Many of those have no clear counterpart in QuickDraw. This presents a learning curve to QuickDraw programmers that want to use Quartz 2D in their applications.
Unfortunately, there is also a bit of an "unlearning" curve for some developers, as many of the tips and tricks that make sense in the QuickDraw environment are either inefficient or have better alternatives under Quartz 2D. This article introduces some of the models and abstractions that make up Quartz 2D. It draws analogs to similar models in QuickDraw, where they exist, with the goal of providing the QuickDraw programmer with a gentle, but practical introduction to the concepts behind the Quartz 2D API.
Pick up any documentation on QuickDraw, and you're not likely to get far into it before you're presented with a discussion of the QuickDraw coordinate system and how it relates to the pixels on the output device. Pixels play a prominent, fundamental role in the QuickDraw drawing model. Indeed, much of the lore an engineer needs to coax the maximum performance out of QuickDraw centers around the efficient storage and shuffling of pixel-based data.
This leads to a bit of culture shock for many QuickDraw programmers early in their exploration of Quartz 2D, because the treatment of pixels in the Quartz 2D API seems almost an afterthought. Some of the drawing commands that an application issues to Quartz 2D find their way onto devices with pixel buffers very similar to QuickDraw's PixMap.
However, Quartz extends the reach of those same commands to include output media that are not raster-oriented. For example, an application can use the same Quartz 2D drawing commands to render an image to a bitmap display that it uses to incorporate that image into an OpenGL context, place it into a PDF file, or send it to a PostScript printer.
How are Quartz 2D drawings built, then? Well, instead of using pixels, a Quartz 2D application works by covering different areas with virtual paint. An application will use drawing commands to identify an area of the current coordinate system and then explain how it wants Quartz to paint that area. Successive layers of paint are built up, one on top of the other, until the entire drawing is complete.
The power of the drawing model comes from a rich set of primitives for identifying areas of the destination where paint should be applied, and a powerful box of virtual paints to color with. As the application is painting, however, it needs to have some link to the destination device, and this is where the Core Graphics Context (represented by the type CGContextRef) comes into play. A Core Graphics Context shares a lot of similarities to the QuickDraw GrafPort, so an exploration involving comparison and contrast may be in order.
CGContextRef
GrafPort
The central drawing environment in the QuickDraw API is the Color Graphics Port. An application works with a graphics port through the CGrafPort structure. A graphics port consists of a finite pixel buffer and the information needed to establish a coordinate system on that buffer. It also stores a number of parameters that affect the drawing commands that are issued to the port. This includes things such as drawing colors, pen patterns, the current clipping region, and similar state information. Through that coordinate system, an application has access the individual pixels of the buffer. This leads to the following characteristics of the QuickDraw coordinate system:
CGrafPort
Like the QuickDraw Graphics Port, a Quartz graphics context defines a coordinate system for drawing and maintains a number of important drawing parameters like the drawing color information, clipping information, and other such things. Unlike its QuickDraw counterpart, however, the Quartz graphics context supports drawing to devices that don't have pixels.
Instead, the coordinate system for a Core Graphics context is set up to allow an application the maximum flexibility in specifying areas that it wants to paint. This frees the application from many considerations about how those areas map onto the output device. This level of abstraction grants a certain freedom to the Quartz coordinate system that the QuickDraw coordinate system doesn't enjoy. Compare these features of the Quartz coordinate system with the QuickDraw features above.
The drawing plane defined by the coordinate system of the CGContext is called user space. One of the challenges to understanding the Quartz 2D imaging model is grasping how drawing commands that are issued in user space will be translated into images on the output device.
CGContext
When working with QuickDraw coordinates, it is clear that the points (1, 0) and (2, 0) are one pixel apart, since the units of the QuickDraw coordinate axes are pixels. What then are the units of the Core Graphics coordinate axes? For Quartz 2D to maintain its device independence, these units must also be device-independent. For this reason, the unit defined for the coordinate axes in Quartz 2D is the point that is defined to be exactly 1/72 of an inch (or to put it another way, there are 72 points per inch).
Most developers familiar with modern computer systems will recognize the point from its popular usage in specifying the size of text. For example, 64-point text is larger than 18-point text. In fact, the definition of the point unit has a long-standing relationship to typesetting from the time it was done using lead slugs on Gutenberg-style printing presses. A traditional typographic point is slightly more than 1/72 of an inch, but in the imaging model shared by Quartz 2D and PDF, a point is defined to be exactly 1/72 of an inch.
When a CGContext first connects to a device, a convention of Quartz is that it positions the origin of the coordinate system in the lower left-hand corner of the device and scales the coordinate system so that one unit in user space system is equivalent to one point on the destination device. By way of an example, that means that if the destination is a page in a 300-dpi laser printer, where one dot on the printer is 1/300th of an inch, and a program draws a line that is 72 points long in user space, that same drawing will be represented on the printer as 300 dots. It is possible to change the Quartz context's coordinate system so that one inch of user space no longer equals one inch on the output device, but when the context is first created, the convention is that Quartz sets it up so that 72 points in user space equals one inches worth of device pixels.
There are exceptions to every rule, and with Quartz as we know it today, CGContexts created on pixel buffers (like the pixel buffer of a window, or a bitmap context for offscreen drawing) are exceptions to the 72-points-equals-one-inch rule. One day Quartz may be able to determine the dot pitch of your monitor and set up its context so that one inch on the monitor matches 72 units of user space. Currently, however, when Quartz creates a graphics context that is attached to a pixel context, the context is set up so that one unit of user space corresponds to one pixel in the output pixel map.
CGContexts
This is an important point to know. What it means is that when Quartz sets up a context for a bitmap destination the units of user space correspond to the units of QuickDraw's coordinate system where one unit in user space represents one pixel on the output device. This relationship can be very handy when moving QuickDraw drawing code to Quartz.
In fact, the HIView system takes advantage of this fact to present HIViews with a coordinate system that very closely matches that of QuickDraw. But a bit of care is prudent because the Quartz coordinate system, unlike the QuickDraw coordinate system, can change in such a way that this relationship no longer holds. The details of transforming the Quartz coordinate system will have to wait for another time. For the moment, however, with the coordinate system in hand, however, let's look a bit more closely about how you use those coordinates to tell Quartz where to paint..')
"Thoroughly enjoyable!"
Hilarious! Well written and very well performed by the author.
Yes!
I absolutely love Tina Fey. This book is a joy.
"Hilarious and Poignant"
I would definitely listen to this again. First and foremost, because I laughed... a lot. Secondly, because Fey's writing is both extremely funny and insightful. The final reason is a bit negative. I would listen to it again because I had to since there were many times her voice trailed off into mumbling (for the effect of humor) and was not understandable - at least to me.
There were too many to recount, though I loved her stories about her father... especially his two most used words - inexcusable and defective (with a bulls**t thrown in there as well).
The SNL skit of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as Palin and Clinton (respectively).
Extremely enjoyable. I love that her politics (which this is not a political book but her thoughts do come through pretty loud and clear) are informed by personal experiences rather than an ideology handed down to her from her family of origin.
"If you like Tina Fey you will enjoy this book"
I'm a big fan of 30 Rock so I really enjoyed hearing a bit more about Tina Fey's life and career. I don't listen to autobiographies often but since I enjoy her sense of humour I thought it was worth a try. I was not disappointed. The book is witty and well written. I enjoyed it thoroughly and broke into laughter more than once.
"This is for women only. Interesting read."
Best was it was funny. I purchased because I love comedy. Least was it was more about women's rights to work alongside men in showbusiness. Not what I thought it would be about.
"Perfect"
Yes, her delivery was priceless!
Everything, she was very engaging.
It was nice to hear how she tranitioned through life and I appreciated how frank and honest she was. Very refreshing.
I recommended the book to many people in print, but the audible book was pure entertainment!
"Made me laugh"
Yes, she does a very good job. She makes you feel like you are getting to know her.
"Good one Tina Fey"
This was a really good book. Having it read by Tina makes it that much more enjoyable. It did get a little long at some points. Overall, a great book.
"A Real Joy"
Smart. Rapid. Entertaining.
Her impersonation of Paul Lynde will make milk shoot out of your nose.
Describing her Dad.
Watch 30 Rock. Please.
Best biographical journey by a comedian of 2011.
"THIS SUCKS"
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS LIBERAL DIATRIBE
YEP THIS BOOK SUCKED

PLEASE SAVE A CREDIT
"Tina Fey at her AWESOMENESS!!!"
What I loved best about Bossypants was that Tina Fey, herself, narrated the book. It was like commuting to work with Tina in the car with me.
I enjoyed the hilarious, candid way Tina shared her life with her audience. She reminded me of myself and my friends during our awkward stages of growing up and in later years. We joked about some of the exact things Tina Fey does!
Tina Fey as herself, of course!
Oh my gosh, it made me laugh out loud, every DAY. I would save it for the commute into work as it made the time FLY by. I imagine I was the only commuter on that packed highway laughing and smiling on her way to work.
Tina Fey, please WRITE."Growing with NextGen"
Michael Huerta, Washington, DC
March 8, 2012
37th Annual FAA Aviation Forecast Conference
Thank you, Julie. You and your staff have put together a great conference here with AAAE.
Earlier today you heard from the Secretary about how important aviation is for our economy. And in the panels this morning you heard about how this year’s forecast for growth is shaping up for the next 20 years. And, you heard about how we need to work together to ensure a smooth and integrated global air transportation system as we move to NextGen.
The forecast we released today looks at the number of planes and the number of people who will fly on U.S. carriers in the future – from 2012 to 2032. What we want is a picture of air travel which is free of constraints. We want to know what we the FAA should strive to meet and accommodate.
As we move forward, there will be starts and stops. We do expect a slight pause in growth this year, but over the long run, we expect aviation will continue to experience steady, moderate growth. This is despite the fact that we are operating in a climate of economic uncertainty and rising oil prices.
Last year 731 million people flew on U.S. air carriers. That number is expected to increase by 500 million over the next 20 years, for a total of 1.2 billion passengers. That increase is like adding the entire population of the European Union.
The forecast also predicts that U.S. carrier traffic will continue to increase and nearly double in the next 20 years. Imagine a carrier the size of Jet Blue coming into the system every 10 months. That is the demand we are forecasting.
In general aviation we expect the demand for products and services will continue to grow, particularly in new business jets and light sport aircraft.
Again, let me say that this forecast is a projection into the future free of constraints. It tells us what the demand would be if we had no impediments to growth. It’s helpful for us to know what kind of growth is predicted, so that we can plan to accommodate it.
Growth in operations at our large airports is expected to outpace the growth at our small and non-hub airports.
As air carriers continue to consolidate their networks, this is going to increase the traffic at airports that are already quite busy.
For example, we see growth at our 30 busiest airports increasing by about 50 percent over the next 20 years.
As we look ahead, we see that we need to modernize the system to prepare for this growth and to foster it.
The way we are going to handle the increasing demands on our system is to use advances in technology and of course, embrace NextGen.
NextGen is a better way of doing business – for the FAA, the airlines, airports and the traveling public. It will make our system safer; it will make it more efficient and more predictable. It’s vital to keeping the economic engine of aviation at full throttle—expanding on the 10 million jobs and 1.3 trillion dollars that civil aviation currently contributes to the U.S. economy.
First let me say that we have very good news for carrying out our plans with NextGen and other areas because the FAA has a new four-year authorization, which authorizes critical programs through FY 2015. We want to thank everyone for their hard work on that.
After 23 short term extensions, we are pleased to have the stability that will boost safety, create jobs and facilitate the implementation of NextGen.
There is also good news for NextGen in the President’s 2013 budget. It proposes $1 billion for NextGen. This is an increase of almost $100 million, or 11 percent over what we received in 2012.
Many airlines are ready to use NextGen procedures and functionality. And we want to give them the procedures they need to fly these more direct and much more efficient routes.
The budget reflects a shift of a number of full-time positions from air traffic acquisition programs that we've finished up. We're leveraging the expertise of those employees into the NextGen program.
We will beef up Performance Based Navigation activities in the Air Traffic Organization and also the certification and oversight of NextGen systems and procedures in our safety organization. With these resources, we will expedite the development and deployment of NextGen that’s already underway.
I’d like to talk a little about Performance Based Navigation, because it is an excellent way to deliver benefits to users right away. We are continuing to expand our work in this area, and the president’s proposed budget includes a $20 million increase that will help the work we already have underway.
Across the country, there are 21 different areas, or Metroplexes that surround big cities, and we know in each of these that we need to improve airspace.
This year we have kicked off the design and implementation phase of new airspace modernization efforts in Houston, Atlanta and Charlotte. We are underway with this work in the Washington, D.C. area as well as north Texas. Later this year, we will be kicking off our efforts in southern and northern California.
Improving the airspace around these metropolitan areas is a collaborative effort among all parties. And because of this collaboration, we expect to modernize the airspace much more quickly than we would otherwise. It usually takes between five and 10 years to develop and implement the advanced navigation procedures we are talking about.
But under the Metroplex initiative, we expect to finish the work in three years. We are creating satellite-based procedures that will transform our national airspace system nationwide. These new flight tracks will relieve bottlenecks, improve safety and efficiency, and foster the flow of commerce.
At Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, we estimate that airlines flying into Atlanta will fly about 1.2 million fewer miles per year, based on the improved flight paths. Those paths, combined with other, fuel-saving descents, translate into a projected fuel savings of about 2.9 million gallons per year. It also means 30,000 fewer metric tons of carbon emissions released into the air. This is the total savings for all aircraft and airlines using Atlanta’s hub airport. As the busiest airport in the world, what helps Atlanta has ripple effects that help the entire country.
There’s another good development I want to share with you in Atlanta. Last fall, we were able to add a departure route out of Hartsfield-Jackson thanks to the precision of GPS. We are getting better use of the airspace and increasing the departures we can handle. Atlanta can clear up to 10 additional planes per hour thanks to NextGen.
This greater throughput reduces the amount of time aircraft wait to takeoff and it reduces delays. Because all these jets spend less time on the ground with engines idling, waiting to take off, this lowers fuel burn and decreases environmental impact.
All across the country we are getting these savings because of very precise Performance Based Navigation procedures, which will reduce the number of miles aircraft must fly by allowing them to take more direct routes. Southwest Airlines estimates that it saves $25 in fuel for every mile it saves because of a shorter flight track.
And we are creating environmentally friendly Optimized Profile Descents (OPDs), which allow aircraft to make managed descents at reduced engine power, thus saving fuel. and reduce emissions and noise.
At Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport we have implemented four of these Optimized Profile Descents in the last year. And the total cost saving by two air carriers there is estimated at $6.4 million per year. These are real benefits that are happening right now.
This conference is about aviation on a global level—and, as has already been discussed, we expect international markets to grow faster than U.S. domestic markets. I do want to add that we anticipate benefits from NextGen procedures on international flights as well.
In this case the benefit is coming from Automatic Dependent Surveillance –Broadcast technology used over the Pacific Ocean.
Pilots will have greater awareness of the location of other aircraft on those long flights over the Pacific where there is no radar.
This means they have a better opportunity to change altitudes to avoid turbulence. Also, they can ask to change to an altitude where their jet engines will burn fuel more efficiently.
It’s harder for pilots to change to higher altitudes now because of the large separation standards over the ocean. Aircraft have to keep significant distance from each other because no one can pinpoint in real-time the exact coordinates.
But by using ADS-B IN, pilots will know the location and speed of equipped aircraft nearby and can safely climb to altitudes where they burn less fuel.
And by carrying less fuel, the FAA estimates an airline operating between the United States and the South Pacific could earn $200,000 in additional payload revenue per aircraft each year.
There are many benefits that will accrue to all of us from NextGen. System-wide, we estimate that NextGen will reduce delays in the air and on the ground in the next decade by 38 percent, versus if we did nothing today. This reduction in delays translates into $24 billion in cumulative benefits for air carriers, the flying public and the FAA.
We also estimate that we will save a total of 1.4 billion gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions by 14 million metric tons system wide.
Harmonizing the various modernization efforts going on across the globe will be necessary to ensure that we have one worldwide, seamless airspace that can handle the growth ahead.
We are interdependent. The FAA cannot implement NextGen in a vacuum. And here in the United States, all of the changes we make mean nothing if operators are not equipped and trained to take advantage of them.
That is why this is a collaborative effort. It really does take all the partners coming to the table to determine the best way to move forward.
NextGen will only be successful if we work closely with the aviation community. We’ve established a broad-based panel – the NextGen Advisory Committee—to provide guidance and recommendations. Combined with other industry partnerships, we will forge consensus on how to equip for NextGen and how to measure our successes.
I think the one thing we can agree on is that it’s more costly not to do NextGen. If we delay investment, the long term cost to our nation – to our passengers and our environment – will far exceed the cost of going forward together at this time.
We know that the benefits are there. It’s a matter of setting priorities and realizing them. I know that all of this can seem hard to attain. There is so much we have to accomplish, and we are working in under fiscal constraints.
But I am reminded of a quote by Eddie Rickenbacker, the early leader of Eastern Airlines and a World War I flying ace. In his autobiography he wrote, “The very existence of aviation is proof that man, given the will, has the capacity to accomplish deeds that seem impossible.”
So, I will leave you with that thought. We are creating today a new template for how we manage air traffic here in the United States and around the world. You’ve seen and discussed the forecast numbers. Our system is growing and we need to become more efficient to handle that growth. It’s an exciting time for all of us in aviation and I thank you all for your support and hard work in bringing the benefits of NextGen to all of us.Brilliant golden amber color.

I've been running Fedora Core 5 for just over a month now. In general it's worked well, but I will admit I had some problems. The most annoying of which were almost certainly hardware issues with my laptop. Read more to find out about the good, the bad, and the ugly.
Encrypted home directories work really well. I quite honestly can say that I almost never notice the encryption overhead. However, there is no distribution support in the boot scripts for getting the required keys for encrypted home or (particularly useful) / directories. It works using the kludge I've mentioned previously, but support in the initrd or rc scripts would be a great addition. As would support in the installer.
Firefox 1.5 has worked quite well, and the upgrade from the 1.0 in FC4 was painless. However, an update a few weeks into FC5 left my firefox totally unusable. I recovered my .mozilla directory from backups, but even then it was having issues. I finally retrograded to the original firefox and then re-recovered from backups and it's been fine since. I was surprised how smoothly the conversion to 1.5 was.
ATI Binary drivers: My laptop uses an ATI video chipset which was getting somewhat poor performance using the stock drivers, even in my fairly modest use of 2D desktops. Switching between virtual desktops took annoyingly long, probably at least 400ms. Not earth-shattering, but annoying. The original kernel that was released was not able to use the ATI binary-only drivers, which really helped 3D performance, but also helped 2D quite a bit. Or at least they did for a while, after running for a day or two it seemed to slow back down for me. An updated kernel was released after a couple of weeks that was able to use the binary drivers.
A word about the hangs. I was having regular hangs. I went as long as 6 days without a hang, but sometimes the machine would just lock up, maybe after a day, maybe taking 3 or more days. On Monday it started hanging after just a couple of minutes use. I swapped to a similar laptop and it's been just fine since then. This coupled with Kevin and Ed Hill who have basically the same laptop and have had no hanging issues, plus problems I had under Ubuntu and FC4 make me think this was a hardware problem. Worse, the motherboard in this laptop has recently been replaced without resolving this problem.
Suspend and hibernate have been working really well for me. On Evelyn's laptop the suspend was sometimes hanging and refusing to come back, even if we specified “pci=noacpi acpi_sleep=s3_bios” on the kernel boot line. We switched that box to always hibernate, and it's been fine. On my laptop, both work fine.
Desktop search with Beagle looks really nice, but there are pretty significant problems with it. I had some e-mail archives that Beagle would hang when trying to index them. The configuration interface for adding and removing directories to scan seemed to do absolutely nothing. No combination of settings seemed to get it to avoid these mailboxes that would cause it to hang.
It does come with a Firefox plugin that will let Beagle index your web browsing, and I would have been quite happy to just have it index that. I already have reasonable tools for dealing with my (extensive) e-mail archives, but there was nothing I could do to get it to avoid indexing the file-system. So, I had to turn it all off. There have been a few updates since then, so maybe it's working now. Once Beagle is stable, it'll be a great tool.
Audio on the other hand, has been pretty spotty. I haven't really investigated this very far because I'm pretty disappointed with the audio architecture (if you can call it that) under Linux as it is. I've given up on audio under Linux and just use a portable music player and visual bell instead.
Audio may be better if I were running Gnome, but I'm running KDE. So, I have at least 3 different audio “standards” that may be getting used: arts, esd, and ALSA. These seem to be pretty much mutually-exclusive, so if esd gets started things using arts will break. And if Firefox decides it wants the audio device, everything else is screwed up. Sometimes my audio works until someone mentions my name on IRC, for example…
I have this memory of the distant past of having audio working under Linux reliably. It may have been a dream though. :-) So, my audio output device is now portable ogg player that I connect via USB and copy music to and charge. Works great.
Removable media is working fairly nicely. There's this window that comes up in X when I plug in my ogg player or camera USB memory card. I didn't really have much use for that box, until I realized that I could set it up to run a script when I plugged in a USB removable drive, and that script would run under my X session.
I built a small script that would detect the vendor and model of the device, and then run an action based on that information. The first one I implemented was an enhancement of my script that copied music over to my player. I used “kdialog” in that script to bring up a dialog asking if I want to copy new music over, or just charge. For the copying, I use kdialog from the script to display a progress bar as it's copying. Very nice. The only down side is that it can't unmount the file-system because something is holding onto it until after the script finishes… It's very handy though.
Networking was a bit problematic though. I had installed wifiroamd, which is now in Fedora Extras thanks for Ed Hill, but I still had a “/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0” config file around which was causing Fedora to be trying to initialize the networking at the same time that wifiroamd was. It was extremely flaky until I realized that was what was happening and removed the ifcfg-eth0 file. Since then, my wireless networking has just worked, no tweaking needed.
The extras package repository has been fantastic. Probably the biggest disadvantage of Fedora up until recently has been that it just doesn't have as many packages available from the standard repositories. It's more likely to have packages available from third-parties, but those can be problematic unless you rebuild from the SRPM. With Fedora Extras now, we're getting a pretty rich set of packages available that are built for the distro. Still not as good as Debian, but getting much closer. The only couple of packages I needed to install “aftermarket” when I set up my laptop are now in the Extras repository.
In summary, I'm pretty happy with Fedora Core 5. My laptop has been flaky, but the software has been working pretty well. The install went very smoothly, even though I complicated it with filesystem encryption, and I was back up and running on the new software quickly and without much pain. There are some rough edges, but none of them have been interfering with my getting work done, so I'm happy.comments powered by DisqusLate summer is the last time most people want to deal with heavy mixers. Fortunately, the abundance of local produce and a little imagination make it possible to create light, refreshing drinks ideal for three digit temperature afternoons. Here are a few suggestions to keep summer cocktails breezy.
• Lose the ubiquitous sweet and sour mixer for the summer. Make your own lighter version by combining the juice of lemons, limes and a little orange juice, combined with simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water, well merged).
• Squeeze and juice fresh fruit for sweet-tangy refreshment in your cocktails. Consider summer strawberries, pureed and then strained to remove the pulp. Apply the same treatment to local peaches, berries and even watermelon, for a lovely change of pace. Combine with light rum or vodka and garnish with fresh mint.
• Muddle fresh ginger, mint, rosemary or fresh basil to add zip to a cocktail of gin or vodka and soda water or tonic mixer.
• Other produce popular for cocktails includes cucumber, tomato water and rhubarb and plum syrups made from fresh fruit.
A refreshing take on cocktails is one way to make even Oklahoma’s scorching summers a little more tolerable.Courtney Love was released from New York’s Bellevue Hospital on Monday night, after a weekend stay, only to be admitted to a private medical facility, her criminal attorney, Michael Rosenstein, told Reuters. He said he knew neither the clinic’s type nor the condition for which she was being treated. The singer’s publicist, Jill Fritzo, told the New York Daily News and MTV news that Love was at an ”undisclosed location.”
Love’s civil attorney, Robert Ring, told a Santa Monica court on Tuesday that Love had been placed in an East Coast ”institution,” and that a legal guardian had been appointed for her, Reuters reports. (He’s representing her in a lawsuit filed against her by a previous law firm that claims she still owes legal fees.)
On Friday, Love’s 40th birthday and the day she was served with a bench warrant for her failure to appear at her Los Angeles arraignment on an assault charge, Love was taken from her New York apartment to Bellevue, where she was treated for what Rosenstein said in a statement was a ”gynecological medical condition” and ”not a suicide attempt, not drug-related, not drug-overdose-related.” According to the New York Times, emergency service workers said that the 911 call from Love’s apartment indicated that she had either miscarried or had had an abortion the previous day. However, both the Daily News and MTV cite sources close to Love as saying that medical tests conducted at Bellevue proved she hadn’t been pregnant.
Rosenstein said Love had missed Friday’s court date, in which she was to answer a charge that she attacked a woman with a bottle and a flashlight in April, because of confusion over her many pending cases in Los Angeles and New York, some of which include court dates that do not require her presence. He said she was eager to return to California and defend herself against the charge. Still, even with her hospitalization on Monday, last week’s bench warrant remains in effect, but neither the Los Angeles police nor the New York police has moved to enforce it and take her into custody.The next generation of doctors has started work at Watford, Hemel Hempstead and St Albans hospitals.
The 55 new junior doctors, known as foundation year ones – or F1s – began shadowing more senior doctors, surgeons and consultants across a range of specialties last week.
These include working in Acute Admissions Unit (AAU), general surgery, oncology (cancer) and urology (the branch of medicine that focuses on diseases of the male and female urinary tract and male reproductive organs). They begin working under supervision but more independently later this week..
Dr Mike Van Der Watt is the Trust’s medical director and has overall responsibility for all doctors across West Herts hospitals, including the new F1s.
He said: “I’m delighted that these doctors are starting their careers in west Hertfordshire. Our three hospitals are an excellent place to put years of training into practice and learn new skills.
“The role of our senior doctors and consultants in mentoring and training them over the year is invaluable. They can both learn from each other.
“I know the senior staff will teach them all they need to know to become excellent doctors and progress in their careers.
“The F1 year is tough but I hope that they enjoy their time with us, and even choose to make a career in west Hertfordshire. Many of our senior consultants and surgeons started at our hospitals.”
F1 doctor Jess Ball is based in the breast surgery team. She said: “The preparation and shadowing week have been quite full on with a mixture of clinical and lecture based work. The shadowing has been really useful and I think I would be very lost if there had been no opportunity to do it.
“It is quite hard learning all the new systems as well as coming to terms with being a doctor!”
Dr Chris Hodgkinson is based in the vascular surgery team.,.Get the Best Priced Ford F100 Oil Pump

Summary
This is a good looking pack that has turned out to be durable, comfortable, roomy and a smart purchase. The best pack in its class I have used. I am thrilled with it so far after several months and several dozen miles of hikes and trail time.
Pros
- Comfortable
- Ample space
- Good looks
- Durable
- Affordable!
Cons
- A little too heavy at 3.6 lbs
After several months and many miles, this 35L pack is proving to be durable, comfortable, good looking and roomy. It could be a little lighter for a 35L pack (mine is 3.6 lbs empty), but it isn't a deal breaker considering the pros vs. cons.
Mine was on sale at Cabela's for 55% off and after searching and waiting, waiting and searching for this type of pack, I was not passing it up. It is olive drab and black with light blue accents and is very sharp looking.
I've enjoyed using this pack and so far have done several day hikes and have used it as a truck bag. The shortest distance I have gone with it was 11 miles at about 27 pounds in 12 degrees and snow on a mountain day hike. I barely realized I had it on. It pretty much moved with me, did not hinder me in any way and has been just the perfect size for the adventures I purchased it for.
It has two pockets in the lid (main pocket and mesh pocket) with a key keeper, which have all been useful. There are several compression straps on the pack which have all worked well and have allowed me to cinch gear down securely. The water bottle pockets held my stainless steel water bottle with no problems.
The main compartment seemed bigger than I thought it would be. My gear packed well inside, stayed in place and I even had room to spare. Once packed, it was fairly easily accessible. There is ample room and areas for mounting gear on the outside of the pack as well.
My uses so far with this bag have been day hikes and somewhat of a "get home bag" for my truck so far, but I would not hesitate to take this pack on an overnight or longer. When my family and I do our summer vacation this year, this Terra 35 will be my first choice to throw my stuff into.
The material is a 420D polyester ripstop and has held up well. I am thoroughly thrilled with my purchase so far and I have gotten several compliments on this pack while out and about. If you come across this pack, take a look at it. If you can get a killer sale deal on it, don't hesitate. Buy one and you will not regret it.
Amazing comfort!!!! You can pack so much into it.

Who makes these throws?<<Few people planning a trip abroad ever think about what would happen if they have an accident and are injured when overseas. Yet, each year, thousands of people suffer some form of injury or illness when away from home, so knowing how to cope and what to do is certainly worthwhile. Injuries abroad can be caused by an array of accidents, varying from simple slips and trips, to road accidents. Furthermore, each year thousands of tourists fall ill due to food poisoning. However, if it wasn’t your fault, you may be able to seek financial redress in the form of compensation.
The first thing to do if you are injured or become ill when abroad is seek medical attention. Even if you don’t think you are that badly hurt, or are sure your illness will clear up on its own, it is better to be safe than sorry. You usually have to pay for a visit to the doctor or hospital, but your travel insurance should cover any medical bills. In addition, if you are injured due to somebody else’s fault, you can claim back any costs.
Just because you have had an accident, doesn’t mean nobody is to blame. Of course, if you fall over on the beach or trip because you weren’t looking where you were going, you cannot hold anybody else accountable. However, in many cases, fault may lie with somebody else. For instance, if you booked your holiday through a travel company and you have an accident in the hotel, perhaps due to a loose carpet or poorly maintained pavement in the hotel grounds, you can make a claim against your travel company or the hotel itself. In addition, if you fall ill after eating in the hotel restaurant, you can also claim against them as you had paid in good faith to stay in a safe environment.
Perhaps the most common accident experienced by holidaymakers abroad happens on the road. Traffic accidents can be costly, often losing your hire car deposit, and they can result in serious injuries. The symptoms of some injuries, such as whiplash, can take days or weeks to manifest themselves, and yet can result in months of pain and discomfort. It is therefore important to ensure you have all the relevant details of the other driver to ensure that if you have been injured, you won’t suffer any unjust financial losses.
The difficulty in making any claim after suffering an injury on holiday or when travelling abroad is that legal systems can vary between countries. By far the easiest redress is to make a claim against the travel company through which you booked your trip. However, they may not always be liable, so you may have to deal with an overseas insurance company. Fortunately, there are plenty of personal injury solicitors who specialise in making claims overseas and most of these will work on a no win, no fee basis.
If you suffer a personal injury or illness when abroad and it wasn’t your fault, it is important to seek help as soon as you get back. In some countries, there is a time limit governing when you can make a claim, so you should speak to a personal injury solicitor quickly. You should also make sure you have kept any receipts for medical expenses and any medical reports from doctors that treated you. If you take all this information to a personal injury solicitor and explain what happened, they will quickly be able to tell you whether you have a case and the damages you may be entitled to.Batchelder School

BatcheFrench police storm bank, arrest hostage-taker
Paris, June 20, emerged from the bank with one hostage prompting him to shelter inside, they said. Police then stormed the bank and arrested him, freeing the last two of an initial four hostages he had taken.
The man, known by police to have a record of psychological problems, had earlier released two female hostages after receiving food and water in the early afternoon.
The other two hostages freed during the assault were in good health, the police sources said.
Aged 25-30 years old, the man took the hostages, who included, Prosecutor Michel Valet told reporters.
It was the latest drama to hit the Toulouse region after a young al Qaeda-inspired gunman shot dead three soldiers, a rabbi and three Jewish children in March.
The hostage-taker had asked for the elite RAID commando unit to come to the scene - the same squad which shot dead 23-year-old gunman Mohammed Merah in March after a long standoff at his home, which was just meters from the site of Wednesday's siege.
'By choosing to carry this out where the Merah affair took place, it shows that this makes sense for him and has a particular symbolism,' said Christophe Caupenne, a former commando at the RAID. .-ReutersAmerican Tennis Rallies for Military Families With ThanksUSA

"I am honored to become a spokesperson for ThanksUSA," said Ms. Raymond. "These scholarships open up limitless opportunities to the spouses and children of our troops. I encourage everyone to give back to our future heroes."
The Bryan brothers also produced a public service announcement for ThanksUSA that is being featured on the Tennis Channel and on TV stations in major markets.
The new nationwide "Tennis Thanks The Troops" campaign launched this month in honor of Military Appreciation Month. The United States Professional Tennis Association (USPTA) is leading the effort with ThanksUSA, with support from the United States Tennis Association Mid-Atlantic (MAS) through their tournaments.
"We are proud to be a part of a program that allows our members the chance to give back to those who are serving our country and their families through the invaluable opportunity of education," said USPTA CEO Tim Heckler.
"United States Tennis Association Mid-Atlantic strongly supports the efforts of ThanksUSA in providing the gift of education to our military families," said Rod Dulany, MAS executive director. "Through ThanksUSA, the MAS Clubs are giving back to the troops that support us. I hope everyone joins us in this worthwhile project."
Tennis facilities are holding ThanksUSA tournaments, sports clinics, auctions and other fundraising events, with a special focus on Memorial Day, to raise money in support of the ThanksUSA mission to provide need-based scholarships for the children and spouses of active-duty men and women across all the U.S. Armed Forces, the National Guard and Reserves.
"Our goal is to give the gift of education to those who sacrifice so much for every American – our military families," said Bob Okun, chairman and CEO of ThanksUSA. "Tennis enthusiasts are raising their racquets to show how much they appreciate the men and women in uniform who protect our freedoms."

On a balmy day last June, some 150 of Electronic Data Systems Corp.'s (EDS) top executives gathered at the company's Plano (Tex.) campus for its thrice-annual senior leadership meeting. One by one, the heads of its businesses presented grim financial outlooks, say people who were there. EDS looked likely to fall short of its earnings targets for the upcoming third and fourth quarters, in part because of slackening tech spending by corporations. That wasn't what CEO Richard H. "Dick" Brown wanted to hear. Brushing aside the pessimism, he pushed managers to stretch for their targets, as they had in previous quarters. "He said we weren't trying hard enough. We were told there was gold in the hills and to go find it," says a former high-ranking executive.
Now, Brown -- and EDS -- has paid a heavy price for his outsize optimism. Three months after that June meeting, EDS shocked Wall Street by warning that earnings would fall 80% short of projections. That day, Sept. 18, EDS shares fell 53%, to $17.20. Since then, a string of nasty surprises has further sapped investor confidence. Among the concerns: a Securities & Exchange Commission investigation that is focused on events leading up to the earnings miss, as well as on an undisclosed losing bet EDS made on its own stock price that cost the company $225 million. The trail of bad news led to Brown, and on Mar. 20, EDS's board replaced him with former CBS Corp. CEO Michael H. Jordan.
These are grim days in Plano. EDS denies any wrongdoing and will not comment on the SEC probe. Yet barring any findings of malfeasance by the SEC, EDS may still end up as a long-term winner in the $140 billion computer-outsourcing industry. It still has billions worth of multiyear contracts from corporations that have farmed out various technology jobs, such as running computer networks. That's enough recurring revenue to see the company through its current crisis, analysts say. Indeed, investors have driven up EDS shares 12%, to $17.63, since Brown's Mar. 20 ouster. "Dick Brown had lost investors' confidence," says Humberto Andrade, an analyst at Technology Business Research. "It was time to move on." EDS would not comment for this story. Brown, who leaves with a $32 million severance package, could not be reached for comment.
The new CEO faces a daunting job in reestablishing EDS as a dependable powerhouse of tech. While Brown made many necessary changes after he was hired in December, 1998, he failed to address key trends in the rapidly changing tech landscape, say analysts. The company has been slow to address the threat from offshore rivals such as India's Wipro Ltd. (WIT), which offers many EDS-style services at much lower cost. And EDS is an also-ran in the fast-growing market for business-process outsourcing (BPO). Rather than just taking over a customer's existing computer operation, BPO specialists revamp the entire job, whether it's procurement or human resources. Jordan, who is 66, must also hurry to allay concerns about EDS's future by forming a succession plan.
Investors can only hope that Jordan performs better than Brown did. An inside look at the missteps at EDS shows not only how Brown's unbridled optimism led to troubles, but how his reluctance to confront those problems compounded the woes. After four years on the job, he leaves EDS a weaker and more vulnerable company.
Founded by H. Ross Perot in 1962, EDS had long been famous for its technical competence, steady growth, and Perot's conservative culture, symbolized by crisp white shirts and military-issue haircuts. But by 1998, Brown's gung-ho style seemed just the ticket to revive a company that had grown bureaucratic and inefficient. "The EDS you see one year from now will be very different from the company you know now," Brown declared to securities analysts in April, 1999. Investors drove EDS's stock from about 35 before he was hired to a high of 75 in February, 2000.
Eager for growth, Brown pushed executives to win marquee "megadeals." These were multibillion-dollar contracts in which corporations or government agencies handed over a broader swath of computing jobs. While EDS and its rivals had to make bigger up-front investments in equipment and labor, megadeals ensured a steady stream of dependable new revenues. Brown's efforts seemed to work. EDS inked $24.9 billion in new signings in 1999, up 111% from 1998.
Yet Brown took megarisks to land some of those megadeals. In the fall of 2000, he signed on to overhaul the U.S. Navy's computer systems (page 62), even though former Chief Financial Officer James E. Daley warned that EDS wouldn't make a profit on the deal after inflation was taken into account, say two former senior executives familiar with the deliberations. EDS's winning bid, which beat out offers from IBM and others, carried a thin 4% margin. That's well below the 7% margin typical of EDS's megadeals, says UBS Warburg analyst Adam Frisch. The contract ran into a raft of problems that held up payment. By the end of 2002, the deal had drained $1.9 billion in cash from EDS's coffers. Daley would not comment.
Other big bets turned ugly, too. In June, 1999, Brown signed a $12.4 billion partnership with WorldCom Inc. that required EDS to resell more than $400 million of the telco's services each year to other customers. Even before WorldCom collapsed into Chapter 11 in July, 2002, EDS was struggling to find customers, say two former execs involved with the deal. EDS has renegotiated the contact but has been forced to take $118 million in reserves and write-downs.
The key question for regulators is whether Brown and EDS management should have disclosed bad news sooner. Even as tech spending plummeted, EDS appeared to thrive. In 2001, when Brown earned $55 million in cash, stock, and options, EDS rang up record sales of $21.5 billion. The following February, Brown promised that EDS would grow core revenues by 13% to 16% in 2002, with higher year-over-year margins.
The downdraft, though, was becoming clearer. When EDS closed the books on its first quarter of 2002, core revenues had grown only 8%. Second-quarter results also came in at 8% growth. EDS only met earnings estimates by curtailing bonuses and landing a $200 million prepayment by an unidentified customer, analysts say. Long after rivals IBM (IBM) and Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) had warned of slumps in 2002, Brown remained upbeat, saying frequently: "We're the fastest horse on a muddy track."
By the time of EDS's June leadership summit, the slump was clear to many attendees. Yet execs made little effort to rein in Brown's expectations out of fear of being publicly humiliated, according to former senior executives who were there. Says one: "You'd be singled out as a quitter." Adds another former executive: "Delivering bad news was not a good thing. So you postponed it as long as you could." EDS has said there was no attempt to disregard dissenting opinions.
As investor confidence waned, Brown went on a six-city road show. The purpose of the trip, EDS has said, was to respond to concerns about client bankruptcies and questions about accounting. But Brown faced plenty of questions about market conditions. The CEO insisted that EDS's backlog of signed contracts and pipeline of potential deals would allow the company to meet quarterly expectations, say institutional investors who attended presentations. Brown later said in a conference call that he did not learn about EDS's disappointing earnings until September, 2002, only days before communicating the news.
The stunner came on Sept. 18, when EDS announced that it would earn no more than $74 million in its third quarter -- 80% less than the consensus estimate. A host of unforeseen problems "hit us with a force that was unexpected," Brown said in a conference call with analysts. EDS shares plunged 53%, to $17.20, the next day. A few days later, after a Wall Street analyst revealed that EDS had borrowed $225 million to unwind recent derivatives contracts, shares tumbled 29% more, to $11.68.
All that bad news hurt EDS's business, particularly with its megadeal customers. Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), for example, backed out of an expected $8 billion deal. By the end of 2002, total signings had plunged 25%.
Some analysts wonder if Jordan and former EDS Vice-Chairman Jeffrey M. Heller, now president and chief operating officer, are going to try to sell the company. At 66 and 63 years old respectively, they're not likely to be in for the long haul. And Jordan is best known for taking over troubled Westinghouse Electric Corp. 10 years ago and dressing up its industrial divisions for sale while merging with CBS.
Finding a buyer for EDS could be tough. Analysts say IBM is well-positioned as is, and that Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) is still digesting Compaq Computer (CPQ). Even if those companies go shopping, the EDS Dick Brown built isn't looking like anyone's prize. By Andrew Park in DallasLocal Buzz

Even in a non-traditional learning setting, Mr. Ellefson is a non-traditional student given his band has recorded albums with titles such as “Killing Is My Business … And Business Is Good!”
The curious mix of rock and religion has been part of Mr. Ellefson’s life since childhood. Growing up in Minnesota, his family drove from their farm to Our Savior’s Lutheran Church each Sunday. Mr. Ellefson, now 47, was confirmed there at age 16.
A few years later, in the summer of 1983, Mr. Mr. Ellefson by the time he was 25. He entered a 12-step recovery program and was reintroduced to his faith. And he embraced it.
Mr. Ellefson moved to Arizona, married and had children. He joined Shepherd of the Desert Lutheran Church, a Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod congregation in Scottsdale.
“I came from a good family, not a broken home,” said Mr. Ellefson, 47. “That became a model for me, and I saw church at the center of it.”
Shepherd of the Desert pastor Jon Bjorgaard asked Mr. Ellefson to start a contemporary worship service. Mr. Ellefson began to write songs using lyrics from the Old Testament.
“For a Christmas service, I remixed some classics, not quite in a Megadeth fashion, but in a pretty heavy rock fashion,” Mr. Ellefson said.
He started a new music ministry at the church and called it MEGA Life. It became so popular that Shepherd of the Desert bought a new space for the ministry.
Last year, Mr. Bjorgaard asked Mr. Ellefson and MEGA Life director Jeremy DaPena to enroll in Concordia’s Specific Ministry Program.
“Most people want to become a rock star,” Mr. Bjorgaard said. “David’s a rock star who wants to become a pastor.”
After two years at Concordia, Mr. Ellefson will be eligible for ordination.- $

The Chris Greene Quartet is:
Chris Greene - saxophones
Damian Espinosa - piano, keyboards
Marc Piane - bass
Tyrone Blair - drums, percussion
Thirty-something-year-old Chicago-based saxophonist, composer and bandleader Chris Greene is no overnight sensation. He has paid his dues on the Chicago club scene since the early 90's, playing in bands like The Trippin' Billies and Kevin O'Donnell's Quality Six, and freelanced on the city's rich jazz scene. He studied at Indiana University, home of one of the country's strongest Jazz Studies Programs, and formed his first band, Chris Greene and New Perspective, in 1994. That band performed regularly, and released two albums of what Greene calls "electric jazz/funk/hip-hop/fusion" music, "On The Verge" (1998) and "jazz" (2004). In 2005 he formed his current unit, The Chris Greene Quartet (or "CGQ"), a band that has maintained a stable roster since its inception.
CGQ features Greene on tenor and soprano saxophone, Damian Espinosa on primarily acoustic piano (but also occasionally on electric keyboard), Marc Piane on acoustic bass and drummer Tyrone Blair. The CGQ has forged a unique sonic identity through the immediate personal chemistry these four remarkable musicians discovered when they first played together, and through subsequent steady work. In many ways, as Greene designed the band to be,.
The new cd, "Merge", follows in the footsteps of the CGQ. Greene's influences, from Sonny Rollins to Maceo Parker, electric Miles to Prince, are clearly evident, as well is the fact that he has become his own man. Although it is definitely Greene's band and conception, Espinosa, Piane and Blair are by no means mere sidemen; the blueprint for the band allows â in fact, demands â equal contributions from all chairs. While all of the guys have deep roots in the history of jazz, they also do not deny that they grew up with the sounds of pop, rock, funk, r&b, hip-hop and the blues in their ears. A Jazz at the Philharmonic blowing session this ain't.
The CGQ continues to be one of the busiest working bands in Chicago, performing regularly at places like M Lounge, Pete Miller's, Andy's Jazz Club, Red Kiva, and most recently at that holy grail of Windy City jazz joints, The Jazz Showcase. They are steadily earning a reputation as one of Chicago's most exciting ensembles. Greene is becoming known as one of the city's finest rising instrumentalists. Catch them locally while you can!
------------------------------------------
"I like to define the music of the Chris Greene Quartet as acoustic organic rhythmic guerilla jazz. The Quartet draws its collective excursions and intensity from the current sounds of rock, funk, fusion and soul. Moreover, we're able to achieve this lofty goal due to a healthy dose of respect jazz's more traditional elements - swing, blues, interaction, and the 'Spanish tinge.'" - Chris Greene

The Brooklyn District Attorney's office launched an investigation into the management practices of Wyckoff, which employs about 1800 staff members and serves thousands of people annually, including low-income and uninsured patients, according to the hospital's website.
The current investigation was sparked by reports that the former head of the hospital used his expense account to pay for a first class plane ticket and a vacation to London, as well as a holiday party at the Lamb's Club.
That, combined with a state task force recommendation this November that the hospital should merge with two others, has sparked fears of imminent closure.
"Having Wyckoff Hospital close would be disastrous for our community," said Theo Oshiro, Director of Health Advocacy and Support Services of the Bushwick nonprofit organization Make the Road New York. "The hospitals are completely concentrated in Manhattan and often we have chronically uninsured people having to travel there for care."
Oshiro said his clients had voiced no noteworthy criticisms about the hospital, other than the typical complaints about long waits in the emergency room.
Wyckoff Hospital would not comment on whether the center will be merged or closed soon, and the State Department of Health did not return requests for information. A spokesperson for Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes would not confirm or deny the investigation, which was reported in the Times last week.
Make the Road already rallied this summer with other local groups against the closure of the hospital, which they said would leave patients without critical options for care.
"I don’t know what I’d do without it," said patient Prestina Gonzalez, 27, as she walked out of Wyckoff with her young son Monday. .
Advocates said they support an investigation into questions about whether the hospital's recently-dismissed executive director Rajiv Garg used his expense account as his personal piggy bank.
The Commission on the Public's Health System Director Judy Wessler said she supported the investigation, and hoped the board of trustees' decision to remove Garg would shield the institution from harm.
"If there are serious wrongdoings, there will be repercussions," said Wessler. "If that guy is really bad he needed to be removed," she added. "Still, it's a troubling time."
She said if the hospital was forced to take a merger, it would leave a huge gap in care for local residents.
"The communities are already underserved, there are not enough doctors or community based primary healthcare, and there are serious health statistics," she said. "If you're going to make any changes there you have to make sure that residents of those communities have access to community based primary care services. That is not the case right now."
But James Cameron, Chief Operating Officer of Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council and President of Buena Vida Continuing Care nursing home, said he has confidence that the investigation will not further jeopardize the hospital's presence.
"The CEO was put aside, they have a new CEO. They'll straighten it out," he said about the hospital's current adminitration.
"The care they provide for residents of our nursing home is excellent," he said. "As a service to the community, it's absolutely essential to keep it going."Lycos Board Member Quits to Protest Deal
By SAUL HANSELL
Published: March 9, 1999
Pressing his campaign to block the proposed deal between Lycos Inc. and USA Networks Inc., David S. Wetherell, who controls the largest block of Lycos stock, has resigned from the Lycos board. Mr. Wetherell is the chairman of CMGI Inc., a technology investment fund that owns 18.5 percent of Lycos.
Last month, Lycos, the Internet search service, agreed to a complex transaction in which it would gain control of the Home Shopping Network and Ticketmaster units of USA Networks, the media and electronic-commerce company, which is based in New York. It would also acquire Ticketmaster Online Citysearch, a public company mostly owned by USA. In return, USA would gain control of 61.5 percent of Lycos's shares.
Mr. Wetherell voted in favor of the proposal when it came before the Lycos board. But he started to voice doubts as Lycos shares fell sharply; they have now lost more than a third of their value since the deal was announced.
In a statement, Mr. Wetherell said yesterday: ''After further consideration, it is my opinion that the terms of the USA/Lycos transaction are inadequate for Lycos shareholders. As such, I am resigning from the Lycos board in order to be free to explore the best options available to Lycos shareholders, including the possibility of Lycos remaining independent.''
William White, the president of CMGI's Internet unit, declined to say whether Mr. Wetherell had proposed any alternative transactions.
''The goal is to get the maximum return for Lycos shareholders including CMGI,'' Mr. White said in an interview last evening. ''There is no specific proposal we can talk about.'' He said that CMGI did not object to a combination of Lycos with Home Shopping Network and Ticketmaster, but its position was that Lycos shareholders should own a larger share of the combined company.
Mr. Wetherell met with Barry Diller, the chairman of USA, shortly after the deal was announced. And he has had frequent conversations with Robert J. Davis, the chief executive of Lycos, Mr. White said.
Investment bankers said Mr. Wetherell's opposition was a blow to the proposal but hardly a fatal one. Many shareholders who did not like the deal have already sold their holdings to lock in their profits, they said, and thus much of the stock is already in the hands of investors who want to own the combined company. Lycos shareholders are to vote on the deal in three or four months.
Executives of Lycos and USA did not respond to phone messages left at their offices last night.
CMGI has roots in the direct mail and software industries and has evolved into one of the savviest investors in Internet companies.CHECK OUT SHMOOP'S FREE STUDY TOOLS: Essay Lab | Math Shack | Videos

I’ve previously posted about my work on scanning a bridge cable and designing an LED attachment clip for the Bay Lights project. Well, last week we put up a test strand of LEDs, using Makerbotted clips! The idea is to test the clips for strength and resistance to weathering, before moving ahead with the full scale installation!
It’s been really interesting designing this, using the Makerbot has allowed multiple iterations of the design really quickly. As you can see in the following picture, the clip protects the main LED data cable from stress, and anchors the LED nodes firmly on the cable.
By using silver plastic, the clips are basically invisible once installed.Nokia 5230 Nuron is a touch screen Symbian based device and will be one of the first Smartphones with completely free mapping technology).

His interest in infrasonic waves first came about in his lab during the 1960s, when he and his lab assistants experienced pain in the ear drums and shaking lab equipment, but no audible sound was picked up on his microphones. He concluded it was infrasound and soon got to work preparing tests in the labs. One of his experiments was an infrasonic whistle. and can help provide early warning of tornadoes.
A number of American universities have active research programs in infrasound, including the University of Mississippi, Southern Methodist University, the University of California at San Diego, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the University of Hawaii at Manoa..

I have a website in both English and French and with potentially more languages tomorrow.
Today, the "French" label is used to refer to a language that the people who speak it call "Français". I'm expecting language names to be expressed in the language and script that the people who read and write that language use. I wouldn't expect someone who speaks only Russian to know that "Russian" is the call sign for their language… Rather, I'm expecting "Russian" to be written using the Cyrillic alphabet and reading what the Russians call their language.
So my question is: "where can I modify the language names"? Is it in some configuration file or hardcoded in a source file? Whatever the case, can someone please tell me which file it is?
Thank you.Business Leaders Lack Knowledge About K-12, Superintendents Say
Most school superintendents in the United States say businesses are positively influencing their districts, but it's usually in a fragmented, "checkbook philanthropy" way, rather than a transformative, systemic approach, concludes a study and a white paper released this month by Harvard Business School, The Boston Consulting Group, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
Last fall, Harvard Business School and the Boston Consulting Group surveyed superintendents from the 10,000 largest districts in the United States, and 1,118 the lead researcher on the project, said in a phone interview.
Missed Opportunity Mr. Rivkin.
Still, 95 percent of superintendents say that businesses are involved in their schools, according to the survey. By a nearly 3-to-1 margin, business efforts to donate money and goods and to support individual students outnumbered deeper engagement in curriculum design, teacher development, and district-level management assistance, the researchers found.
Ninety percent of superintendents who responded to the nationally representative survey believe that business' engagement leads to a positive impact on education—although only 10 percent say the impact of that involvement has been evaluated. Mr..
Business Leaders' 'Playbook':
• Laying the policy foundations for innovation, by, for example, becoming involved in supporting the implementation of the Common Core State Standards;
• Partnering with educators to scale up proven innovations, such as ExxonMobil's work with the National Math and Science Initiative, or IBM's work with the Pathways in Technology Early College High School in Brooklyn; and,
• Supporting educators to reinvent a local education ecosystem, as is happening in Cincinnati, where business leaders joined nonprofits and educators in the StriveTogether partnership to build.

Back to Monitoring Times home pageOn the campaign trail, now-Seattle Mayor Ed Murray hearkened back to the days when neighborhoods played a strong role in city planning. Less than a month before the election, he told a meeting of the Seattle Neighborhood Coalition, “I want to empower the neighborhoods in a way they haven’t been since before (former Mayor) Greg Nickels.”
Murray promised a neighborhood summit within 100 days of taking office. Saturday he will deliver on that promise.
But plans for the half-day summit have left many neighborhood activists labeling the session “Neighborhoods 101” and saying it will avoid discussion of the issues making them most cranky — growth, development and what they say is the city’s lack of responsiveness to their concerns.
The agenda calls for a talk on the civic health of the city and another on the District Council system. The summit is open to the public and will offer tables staffed by 20 city departments, including the library and the animal shelter. Murray is scheduled to give a five-minute welcome, but says he’ll stay for the final 30 minutes is set aside for participants to network.
“This was billed as the re-empowerment of neighborhoods. Instead, you can get your pet license,” said Capitol Hill activist Bill Bradburd. “They’re trying to keep this a kumbaya moment. They don’t want angry citizens.”
Murray said he’s trying to reach out to people not traditionally involved in their neighborhoods and to broaden the diversity of activists. And he said he’s trying to find a balance between empowerment and a lack of civility that sometimes characterizes discussions about how the city should grow.
“We’re trying to find the place that allows neighborhoods to influence the future character of their neighborhood without giving them veto power over the final decisions,” Murray said.
Summit planners say they reached out to PTA groups, mom groups, block watches, senior organizations, the city’s boards and commissions, and enlisted help from the Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs.
Four hundred people have RSVP’d for the summit, and the venue was switched from a room at Seattle Center that held 200 people to the center’s Exhibition Hall, which can hold at least 1,000.
Some neighborhood leaders support the attempt to involve new people. Chas Redmond, past chair of the City Neighborhood Council, said it’s been almost 30 years since the city created the District Council system, which divides Seattle into geographic districts with volunteer representatives elected by their neighborhoods.
The summit, he said, offers a time for “cleaning out the lint and redefinition. I expect a huge crowd. A lot of folks are super excited.”
He suggested that upcoming hearings on revisions to the city’s Comprehensive Plan would be a more appropriate forum for airing grievances about density and growth.
Kiku Hayashi, a past president of the Squire Park Community Council, said she’ll attend Saturday’s summit with “low expectations” and out of sympathy for the city staffers who are organizing the event and planning to sit at department information tables.
But when asked about issues roiling her neighborhood, she pointed to a fight with Swedish Hospital over its proposal to expand its Cherry Hill campus into the adjacent residential blocks.
“You think you’re going to get a hearing from the city, and you end up having to fight them. It’s exhausting,” she said.
John Fox, head of the Seattle Displacement Coalition, which monitors the loss of existing housing, much of it older and more affordable than the new units that replace it, cites city growth targets for 2024 under the state Growth Management Act.
Many neighborhoods are already two or three times over those targets, he said, citing Department of Planning and Development figures.
Those statistics show that, including construction that is already permitted but not yet built, the Pike/Pine corridor is at 347 percent of its 2024 growth target, Ballard at 317 percent and Green Lake at 256 percent.
Fox used the “Neighborhoods 101” label to characterize the summit and said, “There’s little opportunity to air community grievances of any kind, least of all around land use, development and growth — issues that are a source of deep discontent around the city.”
Patrick Tompkins, another Capitol Hill activist, said the “summit” title carries connotations of meaningful dialogue.
“Unfortunately, this is turning out to be a dog-and-pony show with the appearance of engagement with neighbors, after which the city can go back to business as usual,” he said.
Tompkins got involved in his neighborhood when former Mayor Mike McGinn proposed allowing ground-floor retail businesses in low-rise residential neighborhoods.
That proposal was defeated after an uproar from neighbors, but Tompkins said other adjustments to the zoning code are resulting in four- and five-story buildings in neighborhoods zoned for just three floors.
On his block, he said, that’s meant the demolition of an old apartment building and the doubling of rents in another that’s forced out many longtime residents, including some who are elderly and disabled.
He and Fox have joined with other neighborhood groups to form the Coalition for an Affordable and Livable Seattle. The group, which also includes Livable Ballard and West Seattle activists, wants the city to address displacement, gentrification, the lack of developer impact fees, the loss of tree canopy and green space and the lack of city services to support the permitted growth.
At the summit, they plan to gather signatures on a petition to present to the city’s elected leaders.
Donna Hartmann-Miller, a Maple Leaf Community Council member, said Murray was elected on a pledge to stop a 12-year “maligning” of the neighborhoods.
Her own example of an unresponsive city is an attempt to get a crosswalk in place for the 2013 October opening of a new park at Northeast 85th Street and Roosevelt Way. By covering a reservoir, the neighborhood park grew from 5 acres to 20.
She said residents were told they couldn’t even get in line for a crosswalk until the new park opened and the number of pedestrians crossing busy Roosevelt Way Northeast could be documented.
“Parks said it was an SDOT (Seattle Department of Transportation) issue. That’s how they put you off. Can they not talk to each other?” she asked.
She understands the summit is reaching out to less-involved residents and educating them on city process. She said she supports that goal, as a first step.
But more experienced activists, she said, already know the city process and they know the information that’s going to be presented at the summit.

Main Street is always spreading holiday cheer with beautiful garland and lights, the park is fantastic at night and children can hear Santa riding on the fire truck throughout town. Another tradition this town has is the beautiful, glowing cross which is lit for the duration of the holiday season and during Easter as well.
The Sno-Drifters snowmobile club has been maintaining the cross for many years. The club is also responsible for putting up the light strands, keeping them lit by replacing bulbs and taking the strands down during the summer months. The members of our club volunteer many hours to keep the cross lit for our town. We would like to continue this tradition; however, the cost of light bulbs and basic strand maintenance is quite expensive.
As a member of the Sno-Drifters myself, I would like to ask the community of Grangeville for donations to help with these costs. In the past, the club has been providing replacement materials with funds we receive through memberships. Your donation would be greatly appreciated and would be applied toward upgrading the cross to newer and better materials and also purchasing light bulbs.
An account has been set up at Sterling Bank under Sno-Drifters Cross Donation. The club would like to express their gratitude in advance for your support! If you have any questions, or would like to join our club, you may contact Phyllis Pottala at 983-0600, or me at 816-8188.
From the Sno-Drifters to you, Happy Holidays!

Leaf mulchers are tools that shred leaves, twigs and other organic matter into very tiny pieces. The result is a mixture which you can use to help your garden plants thrive and flourish.
Mulch is very good for your soil. When it blankets the soil, it helps it retain moisture which is especially great when the weather becomes too warm or too cold. Mulch on top of your soil protects it from the elements and helps prevent soil erosion. Plus, it also helps prevent weeds from taking root.
Although you can buy mulch from your local garden supply shop, you can also easily create it on your own using the things that you would normally throw out. Creating mulch is effortless with a leaf mulcher. All you have to do is feed the machine and it will shred the the leaves, twigs and other organic matter that you fed into it, giving you a thick and rich mixture of mulch. And you also get to recycle, which is great for the environment.
There are several types of leaf mulchers that you can choose from to meet your specific needs. When deciding what type of leaf mulcher to buy, the main thing you consider is the size and type of garden that you have.
If you have a small to moderate sized yard or garden, a stand alone type of leaf mulcher will do. Gathering all the fallen leaves and twigs from your garden will still give you a good exercise but not break your back. But if you have a large yard or garden, manually gathering up all you raw material might take forever. A leaf vacuum and mulcher combo can help you save time.
The size of your yard will also determine whether you want to get a electric powered leaf mulcher or a gas powered one. The electric powered mulchers are cleaner and run quieter. However, you are limited in the distance that you can cover. With gas powered mulchers, you can cover bigger distances.
The kind of yard or garden that you have will also dictate whether it’s a good idea to get a leaf mulcher only or a combo power tool. There are lawn mowers that have mulching capabilities and this is great if your raw material is mostly grass cuttings from your lawn. Then there are leaf blowers / vacuum / mulcher combinations, too, which is great if you primarily use fallen leaves as your raw material.
The leaf mulcher is a very handy and hardy tool. Use it properly and maintain it well so you get to use it for a longer period of time. -Date: 5:00pm - 6:00pm EST November 15, 2012

It is nobody’s case that foreign visits are not essential in a globalised economy. Negotiations and consultations are an intrinsic part of bilateral, multilateral and international ecosystems. But sundry inconsequential visits are a problem. The ministry of finance and the cabinet secretariat have put limits on the number and duration of visits. Since visits abroad entail spending precious foreign exchange, secretaries have been directed to be strict in sanctioning them and to use our permanent missions abroad to represent the country instead. Sadly, these directions are rarely heeded.
The urge to go on foreign trips is endemic. Proposals for deputation abroad are immaculately crafted and processed with such speed that it could easily give a lie to the putative snail-pace of the Indian bureaucracy. It admits no restraint, no shame, no twinge of conscience — indeed, the tenacity is admirable. The urge to go abroad is rather natural, flowing from an immutable human impulse — obsessive hedonistic individualism.
Let’s accept reality. The standards of financial propriety enjoined on public servants — to exercise the same vigilance with public money as a person of ordinary prudence would with his own — are rarely met. It is disturbing when proponents of a junket suggest that the extant orders be rewritten so that no questions are asked about their trips. I have even known an officer to travel abroad 60-odd times in three years, against the prescribed 12 (four per annum), spending about two-thirds of his time, excluding travel time, abroad.
There are wheels within wheels in foreign junkets. For instance, when economising measures were taken for domestic travel (officers who were earlier eligible for executive class travel now had to travel economy), the measures for international travel were only symbolic. Those eligible to travel first class (secretaries and above) were downgraded to business class, while those eligible to travel business (joint and additional secretaries) and economy class remained unaffected. The one good economising measure was that the tickets had to be bought at the lowest fare in the class. This brought an end to the free companion ticket facility. I myself insisted on the lowest fare rule and was staggered by the stout resistance and fusillade of bad logic trotted out against it.
The impulse to travel using government money when sponsorship from international agencies is available has assumed alarming proportions. All because officials are allowed to travel business class. It matters little that such acts mean the wanton depletion of taxpayer money. So, officials should live by the following rules: Thou shalt not covet foreign visits except those that are most necessary, …continued »

Last week I was at Sams alone (being alone anytime, anywhere is unusual for the summertime), and remembered I needed a couple of cloves of garlic for a recipe. I was short on time and didn’t want another trip to the grocery store with kids in tow, so I ended up with a package of about 1,000 cloves of garlic from Sams. Hmmmm, that’s a lot of garlic.
I made Slow Cooker Garlic Chicken with 40 cloves, and that didn’t even make a DENT in my supply. The 960 cloves of raw garlic were seriously smelling up my refrigerator, so I roasted all of it and stuck it in the freezer. Be on the lookout for many more recipes using roasted garlic in the near future! By the way, do you have a good recipe using roasted garlic? Tweet or Facebook me! I need some help!!
Roasted Garlic Bruschetta
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
freshly ground black pepper
2 whole green onions, sliced
9 basil leaves chopped
1 pound tomatoes, cut up
1 whole baguette sliced
goat cheese
roasted garlic (recipe follows)
Mix the oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices, and add tomatoes. Allow to marinate 2-3 hours or longer.
Slice baguette, drizzle with olive oil. Broil for 2-3 minutes, until the slices start to brown. Turn them and broil for 2-3 more minutes. Spread each slice with roasted garlic and top with tomatoes. Garnish with goat cheese.

The code on the left side of the barrel near the receiver is O X ( which I understand to mean July of 1929 ) followed by either the top 2/3rds of the number 2, or the top 2/3rds of a ? symbol.

Part of the story will be the tale of the Rogue Racing Project foursome that found themselves wet up to their chests, plundering like Vikings through the stickers, bushwhacking and bleeding their way north toward Elkinsville Cemetery. Gary Lunsford's story was so detail packed that I hated to edit it down to a paragraph or two for the magazine. So, with permission, here in it's original form is the response I got back from Gary when I asked about their little mistake. Thank you Gary and Rogue Racing Project for sharing your adventure.
By Gary Lunsford:
I had been plotting and scheming for weeks. I had been studying every map. I had friends that lived near the course doing recon rides for me. I bought a new Garmin 705 to track my racing and training this year. We even stayed the night before the race at my recon guy’s house and got debriefed on the situation with 3-D fly by mapping on large computer screens in his “laboratory”!
We KNEW exactly which way we were going to ride and for sure get all the checkpoints. We elected to go straight to Elkinsville first. It turned out that the eventual race winners, Messer and Gallagher had the same exact plan. So when they passed us on
Combs Road, we knew the race was on!
All of this doesn’t mean squat when you combine two simple factors. 1) taking the Garmin on its first trip in which you are trying to follow a preloaded off-road route and you haven’t figured out all the bells and whistles yet, and 2) you KNOW you are in second place and you have your head down hammering to keep the leaders in sight.
With those two facts, our two teams, came out of Combs road and around the gate only to be greeted by a large horse that had jumped out if its corral and was in the road. Just a distraction. We hit the afterburners in search of the DRT boys. With them not in sight at this point and with a full head of steam, we screamed past the right turn for Elkinsville.
My new GPS was beeping frantically, but I couldn’t understand its strange new language (yet). Not a single one of the four of us even gave a thought to the intersection. And that was where all the chaos began….
About another mile down the road, there appeared to be standing water in our way. The obvious result of all the recent rains and flooding. Kirk was the first one to “put in” and we all followed, Looking in the shallow water for Messer and Gallagher’s tire tracks in the muddy bottom. Before we knew it, we were axle deep, but still peddling. Up ahead, we could see that the road emerged from the murky depths. Obviously, this was just a little water puddle to cross in the race, because Sub9 productions wanted to make it interesting. We got back on the gas. All of a sudden, more water. This time we could see the other side…..but it was deeper this time. Hmmm, no tire tracks again. The leaders must have been walking their bikes here! We rode through this water too. This time, I looked down and realized my water bottles were under water. Did I mention that it was really cold river water?
The dry land on the other side this time was a high spot created for an abandoned bridge over the creek. They had bolted a guardrail across it to alert vehicles it was unsafe to cross. Once on top of it, we could now see that to venture on, meant back into the water again! This time the road, or what we assumed to be the road curved around a bend, out of sight. The answer was simple enough to our crew and we immediately headed across the water and up onto the ridge on the inside of the bend. Simple enough we would just traverse the ridge until the road appeared again.
Now keep in mind that all four of us were convinced we were following the road to Elkinsville and we were going the right way. After about a half a mile of walking on the side of a steep hill, we could see that the water only grew wider and deeper.
Plan B was now needed. The funny part here is that no one said, “lets go back”. The part we had all wrong was that we were standing on a hillside facing north, with endless water to our west and thoroughly convinced that we were still south and east of Elkinsville. We needed to forge ahead.
I forgot to mention my little issues I encountered along the way. The first two bike submarining excursions had left the leg warmers I had on soaked and falling down and had gotten shredded in the chainrings. I too them off at the abandoned bridge and hung them on the guardrail to dry! (note to all that read this, if you find these Bellweather brand black legwarmers, please return them) The other little problem I incurred was that somewhere in the murky depths, my SPD cleat literally fell off my right shoe! No more clipping in. Crank Brothers pedals slide all over the place on carbon soled race shoes.
As we made our way north, we encountered several creeks that were feeding the newly installed lake that we NOW know as
Blue Creek Road. So with everyone of these, we would simply change heading and go upstream until we could cross in waist deep or less water. Every time we crossed now, I was carrying my bike up out of the water. After the last leg of the underwater riding, where literally, my headtube was creating the wake, I realized I was seriously screwing up a seriously expensive bike! My bike, a factory team issue Cannondale CFR 29er, with all the cool custom parts was not meant for this! When I rode up onto the bridge, I unlocked the suspension and compressed it. Water shot out of the vent holes in the boot like a lawn sprinkler! All I could picture in my head, was Tom Cruise in the movie “Risky Business” standing in the waiting room of the Porsche dealership when the service manager walked in and asked “who’s the U-Boat commander?”
At this point it starts all becoming a blur. After several reviews of the maps and no longer trusting my GPS (mistake! I just didn’t know how to set a waypoint, yet) we decided to get up on a ridge and check cell phone receptions and pull up phone GPS functions.
We finally get signals and with our cornucopia intelligent minds, we determine that we are in fact, off course. We conclude that we need are NOT making good time anymore and need to seek out some form of road to get back on course. We determined that the closest road was to our Northeast. The only issue was that there was no trail going that way. No problem, we will just make our own. Having been a career Boy Scout and having had survival and orienteering training as a ski patroller, this all seemed logical and simple.
While most of this trekking was on foot and pushing bikes through so much briars and underbrush that today I look like I lost a kickboxing match with Edward Scissorhands, we followed the plan. The whole time as I am pushing and dodging branches and thorn bushes, I am trying to get a handle on the GPS controls, frantically pushing buttons, changing screens, etc.
At one point we come across an old Toyota FJ40 4x4, abandoned years ago and now an obvious frustration release for lost hunters with high powered weapons. Even in the middle of BF nowhere, someone had stole the wheels off it! Funny! I had the feeling that my GPS was still functioning and tracking our every move, I just couldn’t “speak the language”. In hindsight, if you look at our GPS download, and zoom all the way in at mile 10.6, you can actually see the FJ40 sitting in the woods! It was at that point that I figured out how to see and set a waypoint on the Garmin and pull up the compass screen with the directional arrow to the waypoint. NOW we had a tool that we could use, as we were no had any faith in the maps. We found what appeared to be a jeep trail from years ago, long since forgotten and unused. But it was a sorta trail and it looked like the only way that FJ got down in there. So we started up the ridge following it. Some sections were kinda rideable. I was the only one on an MTB. I was the only one who didn’t get a flat in this race, but I was the slowest of the team on the roads. Did I mention my Carbon Lefty was full of water? I could see the Stan’s plugging thorn holes one after another! I bet I have 50 holes in my tires. At one point we stopped and Matt and I use the small role of medical tape in my pack to try and cover the open wounds on our heels from the miles of hiking in wet cycling shoes over steep terrain. It helps a little.
My GPS finally says that we are only 1.6 miles away from the Elkinsville cemetery and we are headed in the general right direction. With that and then finally figuring out the mapping on it, we see that we need to head off the old trail and down the valley and follow another creek out to what looks to be a road. After another mile of hiking and bleeding, we hit GRAVEL!!!! Stierwalt drops to the ground and kisses the grey terra firma! We paused only long enough for him to remount and we were off! We had found the road at its very end, so there was only one way to go.
As we gained speed and felt relief, I get noticing that the GPS arrow was continually point off to my right and we were getting farther away from the cemetery. Our road tee’ed into another more traveled gravel road. It was obvious that we go right. Now all of a sudden things looked familiar to me. I saw this road on the Gravel Grovel race back in November. I knew where I was, kinda. We came up on the Nebo Ridge parking lot and found the map board. All of the pieces came together. About that time, two guys roll off the Nebo trail. They are just out for a ride and proclaim “Death Marchers? You guys are off course” With a bit of advice from them and our directional suspicions confirmed we headed up over a huge gravel road hill to Elkinsville. But before we pulled out, I had Matt use the medical tape and along with some zipties he had, we fastened my foot to the pedal.
When we began the climb, I remembered….this was the tough hill that had so many people walking it at the Gravel Grovel race. I was strapped in! I had no choice but to ride it out! I made it up on a cross bike last time, so an MTB with a granny gear shouldn’t be an issue. It was still a bitch!
At the bottom on the other side we pass Combs road where we had been 3 hours earlier! Up ahead we see two other teams turn out from the road we missed.
What can ya say? That one little mistake only took a little more than 3 hours, 12 miles of tail blazing and swimming, several flat tires, hundreds of cuts and scrapes, four wet frozen asses, and four sunk bikes to correct.
We did finish what we started. And somehow we didn’t finish last! We just took the scenic route.

Much credit must be given to my team mates, Matt Steirwalt, Kirk Grynwald and Tim Brown. We worked together like a well oiled machine....with no steering wheel!LOL Thanks guys, I will remember this race for a long time!

We all rode hard and had a top 10 in our sights. Amazingly, this little mishap didn't tarnish our ability to have a good time. No bickering, no arguing, no blaming - What a fantastic bunch of teammates! Thank you all!
Great tale! thanks for sharing

When emergencies arise, it is a welcome relief to have the available cash at hand to handle them quickly and efficiently so that life can return to normal. However, for many people who have no savings set aside or who live from payday to payday, unexpected emergencies and situations can cause incredible stress. Not only does attention have to be given to the emergency, but also there is the extra stress of figuring out a way to come up with the money to deal with it.
Millions of Americans turn to easily obtainable payday loans for a quick means of cash to handle emergencies. However, residents of Vermont cannot obtain payday advances because they are prohibited in the state. Therefore, other sources of quick cash are needed to meet emergency situations in between paychecks for citizens of Vermont.
Payday Loans Defined
Payday loans, also known as payday advances, are short-term loans that use paychecks as collateral for small amounts of cash that are normally under $1,000. Payday cash advances are mainly used for emergency situations, but can also provide extra cash for getaways or special events.
Because payday loans are quickly repaid in a short amount of time, usually on your next scheduled payday, they are fast and easy to obtain. Payday advances require very little information, and only ask for your ID, bank account information and a verifiable source of income. Such loans are normally approved in less than 24 hours. Credit checks are also not normally done making payday loans available to practically anyone 18 years of age or older regardless of credit status.
Vermont Payday Loan Laws and Restrictions
Vermont has worked very hard to not only prohibit payday loans from being taken out in the state, but to also tie up loopholes that allow payday loan companies and online payday loan lenders to operate from outside states.
Under the Small Loan Act of Vermont only approved and licensed lenders can operate in the state and they must abide by very strict guidelines. For example, the cap on the annual interest rate for small loans is set at 18 %, which is usually described as too low for payday loan lenders. These acts prevent most companies dealing in payday loans from operating in Vermont.
Vermont laws make payday loans very difficult, if not completely impossible. Therefore, residents who are short on cash and require funds to handle unexpected situations will need to look for alternative methods to obtain the money they need. The following are some suggestions for acquiring money for emergencies and pressing situations.
The first place to look is with your current employer. Many companies will allow you to work overtime or will float you a cash advance to be repaid on your next paycheck or to be deducted from several subsequent paychecks. W-2s can also be adjusted to claim more dependents, which will lower the amount of taxes taken out of your paychecks.
Emergency assistance programs are another means of obtaining cash and other assistance for emergencies. You can visit your local Department of Human Resources to inquire about available programs, or turn to local churches and other organizations that provide assistance to those in need.
You might also visit your bank or credit union and request a small loan or long-term loan. A consolidation loan to lump various bills into one loan payment could be another option to discuss with your bank.
If you simply need extra cash for non-emergency situations, you can take on a side job, borrow money from friends or family, take out a title loan, or sell or pawn items. Rapid cash can also be obtained via credit card cash advances, although the interest is very high.

The original Rubik’s Cube took the world by storm in the 1980’s. But the world has dramatically changed since then. The once amazing cube puzzle is now boring compared to modern toys and technology.
Enter Dane Christianson. Using CAD and 3D printing, he created a Rubik’s Cube inspired puzzle for the 21st century. The cube has an extra layer on each side to form more of an ‘X’ shape, hence the name ‘X-Cube.’
With just a small addition, countless new possibilities are now possible.Greg Dent

After the first day of school when I was walking all four of my kids back home I was looking forward to chatting, looking in their folders, eating the snack I had prepared. It was going to be an after school wonderland.
Five minutes later when my oldest was in severe whiney, grumpy mood. My second oldest was screaming over and over, “I’m booooooooored!” My third was hollering at the top of her lungs, “OUTSIDE!” And my baby was sitting on the floor hollering for me to pick her up. Don’t forget when my husband was asking me different business questions. Wait, wait don’t forget the whipping up dinner and taking children to dance.
During this, I looked around and fully expected Ashton Kutcher’s skinny self to pop around the corner and scream, “YOU’VE BEEN PUNK’D!”
This can’t be for real right? You aren’t expected to deal with homework, after school grumpies, talking people to and fro, preparing dinner, and calm down babies during their grumpy time…ALL AT ONCE.
I started cracking up like a crazy woman.
How in the crapola do you all do it?
You are all saints, impressive multitaskers, unbelievably talented. I bow down to each of you. And ask of you….TEACH ME.Frequently Asked Questions

Beckham caught three touchdown passes and came within one reception of tying the team's single-game record. The Giants took advantage of an overturned touchdown at the end of the half to defeat Washington 24-13 Sunday.
Beckham and Eli Manning combined 12 times for 143 yards, with touchdown passes covering 10, 35 and 6 yards. He has a team-high nine touchdowns and his 972 yards receiving are a team record for a rookie, beating Jeremy Shockey's 894.
"I don't want to get his head too big right now, but he has a lot of skill," said Manning, who targeted Beckham 15 times. "You hope he keeps working and grinding and doing the little things to correct. There is still room for improvement."
That's scary. After missing the first four games of the season, Beckham has 71 catches, including 61 in his last seven games.
"As I said earlier in the year, there's no reason for this team not to have the best offense," Beckham said. "The way we've played the last couple of games gives us a better feel for how we're going to play. For me, it's making the most of my opportunities."
The win was the second straight for the Giants (5-9) after seven consecutive losses that eliminated them from playoff contention for the third straight season.
The Redskins (3-11) for a 17-7 lead, diving over the pylon, Redskins receiver Santana Moss so much that he stormed after the officials and was ejected.
Triplette said Moss was ejected for inappropriate language directed first at him and then at field judge Alex Kemp.
Instead of a 10-point lead, the Redskins led 10-7 with the go-ahead points a 9-yard pass from Griffin to Chris Thompson midway through the second quarter.
New York, however, controlled most of the second half.
Moss was called for two 15-yard penalties.
"This guy fuels the entire team, fuels the entire stadium," Giants defensive captain Antrel Rolle said of Beckham. "He's an exciting guy to watch. He's a hell of a player. He goes out there and makes plays and plays beyond the X's and O's." was sacked seven times. There were moments late in the game when the oft-injured quarterback had trouble getting up.
"It's not been a fun year," Griffin said. "We've had a lot of turmoil, a lot of things going on. At the end of the day, you suit up and when your number's called, be ready to play."
McCoy led the Redskins to a field goal before leaving after aggravating a neck injury on the opening series.
Manning got New York on the scoreboard late in the first quarter with a 10-yarder to Beckham.
Game notes
This was the 100th NFL game at MetLife Stadium, the home of the Jets and Giants, which opened in 2010. ... Giants backup CB Chandler Fenner recovered the onside kick to start the second half. ... LB Perry Riley led Washington with 10 tackles. Fellow LB Ryan Kerrigan had Washington's only sack, his 12 1/2 of the season. ... Giants have 22 sacks in the last three games, with Jason Pierre-Paul and Johnathan Hankins each getting 2½ Sunday.Capital Comment Blog
John Wall’s Endless Summer
The Wizards’ point guard continues to light up summer charity games, this time against LeBron James
The latest news on the NBA lockout is bleak. At this point we may be closer to an agreement on a Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao super fight than we are to the start of the 2011 NBA season. Maybe if that fight is made we could see David Stern vs. Dwyane Wade on the undercard. The commissioner is literally pointing fingers, players are literally refusing to sit down to talk, and fans are figuratively beside themselves with concern for a season that is supposed to tip off in less than a month
Fortunately for us, the sport lives on while the league argues over the future of the salary cap. Many of the league’s stars took a break from the process to take part in charity game hosted by Chris Paul of the New Orleans Hornets. One player taking part was our own superstar, John Wall. Like many of the other off-season pick up games, this one was wide open, with ridiculous scoring totals. What set it apart was the ridiculous number of highlight reel plays, especially from Wall. Let’s break it down.
0:03 Three full seconds until somebody did the Dougie. The disappointment on Stephen Curry’s face is apparent.
0:10 The first shot of our man Wall comes on a reverse alley-oop from the game’s host. An auspicious start.
0:11 Wall comes right back with a ridiculous bounce pass off of the gym wall. Normally that kind of stuff isn’t allowed, but this is a charity game. Also, if you’re name is Wall it’s only natural that you be given some poetic license. You know, “Wall, off the wall, back to Wall. Dagger!” At least that’s how Steve Buckhantz would have called it.
0:15 Curry agrees.
0:19 That 360-baseline slam may not be part of Wall’s NBA repetoire, but it damn well should be.
0:22 That behind-the-back move definitely looks familiar. And suddenly I’m nostalgic for the old league.
0:26 Wall usually dunks with his left hand. Except for when his head is at rim level, apparently.
0:28 Back to lefty. It’s like watching Roy Jones Jr. in his prime.
0:32 A jump shot! Always good to see him work in a few of those.
0:34 to 0:37 Run-of-the-mill awesome dunks. Pretty nice.
0:39 Unnnnh. What just happened?
0:42 Dwyane Wade? No, go back. I’m going to need to watch that behind the back right-handed dunk on a loop for an hour or so.
0:56 Ah, there’s Wall. He’s the one returning the favor to Paul. I think they’re on to something with this multiple-point-guard offense.
1:03 Paul needs a boost from his future Heat teammates in order to out-jump Wall.
1:08 Right back to the DC flavor with Kevin Durant. He’s spent the offseason working on his extensive collection of business tattoos. The PG County-native recently added shoulder-to-shoulder tribute to his home state.
1:13 Everybody is doin’ the Dirk.
1:17 Wall leaves one off for Durant. Perhaps Wall will be welcoming him back to town a few years down the road.
1:33 Nice dunks from Rudy Gay. Too bad he’s from Baltimore.
1:41 It’s perfectly understandable if you just let out a reflexive boo. In fact, I’d be disappointed if you didn’t.
In the end, Wall put on a show, and a team of superstars led by LeBron James and Dwyane Wade lost decisively. If that doesn’t fulfill your NBA fix then I’m not sure what will.

A great place to teach a teen about life...
I have a student in this school and it shares the values we promote in our home. There is great diversity as well as patriotism and strong moral values. There are many male role model teachers for kids w/o present dads.
They do not tolerate bullying, crime, or anti social behavior.
The principal is active in the school programs and available to the students in the courtyard on a daily basis.
It is very competitive with private schools, but offers many more subjects and after school sports and events.
I like this school because the teachers do care about you and they don't leave a child behind. If you show up to class they will help you pass high school. The counsleors at the school really care and try everything in their power to help you as a student.
Ok school if your child is in general classes, however the AICE program really prepares the students for college. Don't expect great SAT/ACT scores from AICE kids(Not bad most had around 1200 SAT) the program covers different subject matter. It is once the child enters into college that these children really shine. (11th grade AICE is the most difficult year for student and parent)
Hi Parent who writes in on Nov. 1, 2010. The issues you're having with MHS are results of the district and state mandates. Due to lack of funding and the class size mandate, our principal had no other option but to shave funding. That's the issue with the class size amendment: 25 students to a core curriculum class but open ended in the electives. That means 75 students in PE courses and 52 kids in art, and music. Did you vote? Write your representative and vote for funding - or you'll be complaining about a lot more than broken ID machines, and over crowded electives. MHS is a great school in a cash-strapped school system.
Son is a new freshman this year... Although the school year has just completed its first 9 weeks, I am not impressed. I had high hopes for the high school as I have heard a lot of good things about it. I would say it is just average.
They have cut a lot of the electives for the kids. At first, my child had one elective class with 52 students in it. During open house, one teacher admitted that he had never taught this type of class before and all the materials he was going to use was what he found online.
The badge machine hasn't been fixed since the beginning of school. If a child happen to lose their badge, they have to carry a schedule around which is fine but a couple of the teachers ask to see the schedule every day and if you don't have it, they kick you out of class and then mark you as a skip.
I found out they had freshman parent night but no notice was sent home or were we told via phone notification.Smart Gilas vs Duhok Photos

This time it seems EA is heating things up with developer Turn 10 by denying them access to the Porsche license for their upcoming racing game Forza 4. EA owns the licensing for the Porsche brand (when used in a video game) and can in turn sub-license the brand to whomever they want. In the past this has been the case for Turn 10 and the Forza title, however with the new Forza, EA is not following the same trend.
Turn 10 have the rights to use the Ferrarri brand on PC and XBox exclusively. They have also allowed EA to use the Ferrarri brand within many of their games, because of this Turn 10 had more to comment on the denial from EA and former collaborations -

Seismologists have developed a technique that reveals the subterranean sloshing of magma in practically real time, providing clues that could help predict eruptions.
To track magma moving beneath a volcano primed to erupt, geologists typically have to rely on indirect measures, such as shock waves from rock that's fractured as magma shifts the overlying volcano . These small earthquakes reveal that magma is on the move, but without much precision. So a team of seismologists led by Phillip Dawson of the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California, developed a new technique that quickly locates moving magma on a map of the volcano's insides.
The team used a network of 10 broadband seismometers that can detect very low frequency vibrations. Standard seismometers are only sensitive to faster events such as rock fracturing. But the broadband sensors can detect the slow signals created by flowing magma. These signals reach each sensor at a slightly different time, and a computer uses these time differences to calculate the magma's location and direction of movement. The calculations take just a few minutes, allowing scientists to track the magma in near real time. After a brief pause in eruption activity at Kilauea in March, Dawson's team tracked the renewed magma movement, which revealed a maze of conduits, much more complex than expected. The results were published online 5 November in Geophysical Research Letters.
The team is also working on networks on Stromboli in Italy and Popocatépetl in Mexico, and they say similar networks could be deployed at other hazardous volcanoes, such as Mount St. Helens, to improve predictions of eruptions. But there is likely to be debate about how useful it will be for monitoring other volcanoes, says volcanologist Jackie Caplan-Auerbach of the USGS Alaska Volcano Observatory. "This is a huge step forward in terms of understanding the structure of volcanoes, but I think it's premature to suggest it's the next step for crisis management," she says. "I just don't know if that's what we need to tell whether a volcano is going to blow its top."

On Fournier: really like his size, as for his past with the broken leg and never being drafted, you can always take the glass half full approach: at 15 broke his leg, overcame that, then it re -broke, overcame that, continued playing high level junior hockey, at 21 Captained a Memorial Cup winning team, then attended the Montreal Canadiens development camp as an undrafted player and was signed to a 3 year contract.
I don’t know about you but this guy sounds like a FIGHTER to me….
I agree with you. He has shown that he refuses to give up, and he deserves a lot of praise for what he has accomplished.
You sold me ED.. Didnt Serge Savard break his leg a couple times?
yes he did. we should keep in mind that Serge was one of the great defencemen of his generation, so he might have been able to overcome those serious injuries more easily than your average prospect.
@Ed, so you think it would have to be Beaulieu in order for St.Louis to trade Stewart to us. Well, if that is the case, I wouldn’t do it. BTW, I love Stewart and he is exactly what this team needs but I think Beaulieu is going to be a stud Dman. A top 4 guy. A power play guy. He has some tough and nasty to his game. He has it all. Reports out of development camp say he has put on muscle and him and Tinordi look to good to be at the camp. I think trading him would haunt us for many years.
Yes. I expect Beaulieu to be an excellent player.
He does not YET have it “all”, however.
Because he struggles in his defensive zone coverage and decision making, and that’s a huge problem when you have NHL forwards barreling in on you.
I am hearing that if the habs want Stewart, the starting point starts with Gallagher and a 1st along with Corbin, this is just the starting point all part of the negotiations.
I support Carey Price
“Habs Insider”
Who is Corbin?
I wouldnt give up Gallagher..
i heard chicago is gonna trade us kane and toews for desharnais.
It`s Desharnais and Gionta.
who is corbin???
GET BIGGER, GET TOUGHER, GET EVEN.
this is Corbin.
he’s a nobody, give em 3 corbin’s if they want em
GET BIGGER, GET TOUGHER, GET EVEN.
Not to dispute 1992’s creditability but Corbin doesn’t nor has ever belonged to the Habs.
Friggin’ kids!
no one would ever question 1992’s credibility.
No problem my friend, this is what my sources tell me, they were right on the Parros deal
I support Carey Price
“Habs Insider”
yeah collberg and gallagher is toooo much, would have to find a different answer
GET BIGGER, GET TOUGHER, GET EVEN.
Was he reoffered. His 1 year Bulldogs contract must be up.
Not yet, yes and pretty sure they will look elsewhere too.
NO!
How about Collberg, a first, and Dietz?
Well thats the problem they really like Gallagher, so we may have to trade one our defencemen instead of Gally
I support Carey Price
“Habs Insider”
too much, ellis, thomas, and desharnais
GET BIGGER, GET TOUGHER, GET EVEN.
St.Louis would jump all over this deal. Or they should. Collberg is a pure sniper with star potential. Dietz is a top D prospect and our 1st round pick might be a very high one if we start the year with the soft lineup we have right now.
They might need to throw in another player then.
You mean the lineup that finished 2nd in the conference last year?
__________________________________________________________________________
“To you from failing hands we throw the torch, be yours to hold it high!”
So I guess we at HIO hate Crisp because he’s 6 3 225 lbs and can fight plus score. Parros sucks to. McCarron was a terrible pick because he’s too big mean and can fight . Did I miss anything? I forgot.. trade Thrower because he’s tough mean and can fight to . MB sucks cause he didn’t draft enough small European’s who don’t like rough play and disappear come playoff time. Pat yourselves on the back…for being the greatest arm chair never played big league anything GM’s .
too*
This is not an argument or anythin. I just read a review of the camp yesterday. Sounded like Thrower regressed badly. Just saying.
And I’m a Crisp-a-holic so I am glad we got him.
Count me in the Crisp Camp, I love the guy and anyone who doesn’t can kiss my arse!
Thrower seems to have a lot of issues though, his offence is not happening AT ALL and his overall play has gone down as well.
I wonder if he’s been getting into the drugs or booze, that’ll do that to a guy.
Saw Thrower play this year in Edmonton, he looked fine, I was super excited the Habs got him because of his mean streak, disappointed to hear he has regressed….yes, I was wondering about “substances” with him too, so hope I am wrong.
Bite your tongue man! I’m in the hockey field and I raise my game when I get into the booze.
Just to be clear.. I not a hockey GM. But I play one on HIO.
Why would a rebuilding team trade a 1st round draft pick in Nathan Beaulieu for Stewart. Not old but an older player who is near FA years. Beaulieu is a RFA for the next 5-6 years. Pair that with a contract to Eller, PK…I like Stewart but something ain’t right here. Habs have no defensive depth right now. Prospects or AHL. A defensive prospect would have to come back!
This is gonna be a long season boys and girls. Call it a transition year, call it a probe yourself year. Price is on a short leash, Eller and PK contracts to be signed, Briere is a short term fill.
I like every player on the Habs. Just one problem. They’re not playoff players. Too soft and injury prone. For regular season when they are healthy at times very exciting to watch. Skill and speed. Playoffs they become schoolyard kids and get beat around. with the present group. They wouldn’t make it out of the 1st round. This time around may not make it to the playoffs. Remember 82-Games this time.
I’m talking about the team today 06 July 2013. Maybe before the 1st game in October MB may have a very good team in place. If he stays put don’t expect the Habs to be a playoff team. A lot of injured and injury prone players returning.
Jagr really wants to play with Montreal, and sounds like it will happen. I would also be shocked if Habs got Stewart. SHOCKED
I support Carey Price
“Habs Insider”
Where did u hear the Stewat rumour please?
Stewart and Jagr.. and I am gonna drive to MTL and buy MB a new suit myself.. if that happens. First his jacket was to short and I dont think his pant legs fell ‘oxford’ style.
I mean HABS #1 Trinifan shouldnt have a better suit than Habs #1 honcho should he? And I do .. believe me.
Just saying.
I mean as P.K said “MB is one good looking Man!” Even that girl on TSN690 AM show said MB cant do anything wrong as far as her ‘female’ friends are concerned. All he needs is a new suit.
The rumour basically is because, Alex Pietrangolo is looking for upwards of 7-8 million a year, In many believe in the oranization that Stewart wants 5-6 million for 5 years. They can’t St Louis keeping both these guys at these prices.
I support Carey Price
“Habs Insider”
But then we would have to give Stewart 5-6 million. That aint gonna happen.
why not give him 5 million? he has earned it.
Thanks Ed. I still this young kid is full of it and were going for it.
The question was where did you hear it..what actual person
the guys name is Mike Antonovich
I support Carey Price
“Habs Insider”
And who does he work or even blog for that he gets this info and gives a kid the inside track.
Antonovitch is a scout for the Blues.
Stewart would be a Godsend.
His offense has declined a lot, and that should mean that we won’t have to fork over an excessive amount of players/prospects/picks.
Put him and Galchenyuk on a line with Briere, now THAT would be something else…..
WHich means he is not on Bergivin’s radar.
he had 18 goals and 18 assists for 36 points in 48 games this past season.
he rebounded from a bad season in 2011, in which he scored 15 goals.
my bad
desharnais, morgan ellis, patrick holland, and raphael diaz for stewart, and if they want more??? find more, he is a beast, can fly, and is exactly what we need. then sign him for 6 years at 5 mill per year. will not regret it.
and if they want to throw in perron?? sure.
GET BIGGER, GET TOUGHER, GET EVEN.
your dog is ok I hope? I see he/she had a leg amputated.
I am a huge animal lover.
LOL, good dog, belongs to jerry cantrell, from my favorite band alice in chains, but i think that dog is dead now. thanks
GET BIGGER, GET TOUGHER, GET EVEN.
Only good thing about Jagr would be his strong puck control along the boards and being able to dish out a nice pass to our smaller forwards and his possible chemistry with Pleks. But he is 42,had a miserable playoffs and i just don’t care much for him.
If he does sign it will be a very strange season cheering for a habs team with Briere and Jagr. Just the thought would have made me ill in the past,and maybe a little now.
Hey Buzz. Saw Jagr play with Dallas this year. I would consider him a PP specialist at this stage. A great part of the Dallas PP was for him to QB from the half boards. 5 on 5 he was not a factor in the game I saw.
OK I’m out on Jagr!
OK! Im in on Jagr.
so there’s a player I want. It’s Chris Stewart of the Blues.
he is an RFA. Just completed a 1 yr deal for 3 million.
he has scored 100 goals, 102 assists in his first 319 NHL games.
last year 18 goals and 18 assists in 48 games.
he’s 6’2, 230 and will be 26 in October.
he’s looking to cash in 4 or 5 years and probably 5 million per; like a Pacioretty deal.
would you give up Beaulieu and a 1st, or Beaulieu and a 2nd??
I know it sounds like a lot, but how many power forwards like Stewart are out there, and how badly do we need a guy like that?
Same here, Ed.
Fransakois was tracking Stewart and also Oshie yesterday.
Even attempted some Amazing Kreskin-style telepathic control techniques. If that trade happens, a major piece will have been added and I’m getting my own tv show.
Oshie is signed til 2017.
Louis Leblanc and a 2nd
Andy, are you serious? That’s not enough.
Add either Bournival or Holland
Habfan17
He had more points this past half season then he did in the last full season (36 this year compared to 30 previous).
So question is who do you get, the on pace for 60-70 points, or the total 30 points. If only 30, would you give more than Louis and a 2nd?
the previous 2 seasons were 28 goals in 62 games, and 28 goals in 77. I think he proved this year that the 2011 season was an off season for him, and he jumped right back on to the 28 goal pace.
I don’t know if scoring 18 goals in a half season means that he proved he has jumped back to his old offensive touch, takes a full season to get a better idea. I’m just not sure about trading a 1st rounder and a prospect, for an unsigned RFA.
Coming from someone who would love Stewart, the 3 prospects I wouldn’t trade are Tinordi, Beaulieu and Colberg.
However, I still would love him. A 1st rounder and any other prospect I would be OK with.
I like Beaulieu. It’s not an easy player to give up. But he’s the one guy I would trade; Tinordi is out of the question, not even on the table.
After hearing the reports from the development camp, I would not include Beaulieu either. Perhaps Leblanc, Bournival and Ellis!
Habfan17
Bournival and Ellis are still long shot prospects. No one even knows if they will make the NHL.
Leblanc’s value has never been lower.
It’s not enough what you’re offering, in my opinion.
@ Ed, you are probably right. I would have said Pleks and Holland, but the Blues signed Roy, so they have no need for Pleks now.
If they needed defense, I would say Gorges. Maybe they would want Moen in a package if they feel they are a few pieces short of a real cup run.
Habfan17
Only one untouchable for me is Tinordi. I like Bournival a lot and will have sleepless nites.. but I would trade him.
if they deal tinordi, it’s 1 step forward, 1 step back. makes no sense.
we need to keep whatever power we have and add more power.
if they deal tinordi, we need a new GM.
so short answer. we agree.
TODAY
“If need be, we have valuable pieces & if we have to move players it won’t be an issue finding a home” – Doug Armstrong
Ya, today would have been perfect. But Bergevin might have been busy today, so I’m hoping for Monday.
By today, I meant he made the statement today just to be clear
ha! ha! and hear I thought you were excited to make the deal.
Good luck with your trading scenario. They can’t seem to understand that it doesn’t matter how many $5 or $10 players they throw out there. It takes a $50 to get a $50 player.
I don’t like to see Nate go but if one was too put Ellis in his place along with another prospect and the 2nd round pick that might fly. Stewart would be a huge add to the club.
Ellis is a good player, but he’s no different than 100 other guys just like him in the AHL.
I’m quite certain it would take Beaulieu. Who is a 1st round pick and extremely likely to play 10- 15 seasons in the NHL
The other prospect could be off a little more significance but from the forward crop.
Good evening all.
Maritime Ron has posted Jagr’s stats below — not too impressive. Moreover, anyone who watched him in the playoffs could see how and big slow he is now. But he can pass, has serious hockey brains, and can play keep-away like Meadowlark Lemon. So two questions:
1) Even if he’s no longer good enough for playoff hockey, would we welcome his help in a regular season while our prospects continue to incubate?
2) How much do we read into reports about his enthusiasm for playing in Montreal? Gullible me loves to hear that (vs the Vinny scenario).
1 – He would have to log a minimum of 16 mins per game to really assist, but I am not sure he still can (plus I do not think he can keep up with our style of speed). Would rather see us give that spot to a younger player and develop them if he is our only choice.
2 – I have heard he wanted to play in Montreal for a couple years, but always seems to sign with another team (first Philly, then Dallas). Any player who signs a contract with Montreal wants to play here.
HOCKEYYYYYY INSIDERRRRRRR is reporting that the Jagr deal is basically imminent, which means that it’s not gonna happen.
Hey Grandad!
Only a hint of capslock, and great control on the width.
I’m proud of you! One step at a time.
That is his username……..
He’s an 18 year old kid right?
Fournier is 6’3, 215bs. That’s not flimsy at all, sounds like a good prospect, I hope he does well at camp.
CH = Les Glorieux!!!
It was good enough camp to get him the 3 year contract they signed him to today.
For the Jagr fans, just some cold hard facts to consider:
– He turns 42 in February.
– He scored ZERO goals in 20 playoff games playing almost 18 minutes a game.
He had 3 assists and was Minus 2 in the 6 game Finals.
– He had the the 4th worst Plus/Minus of 12 regular Bruins forwards in the playoffs at Minus-1. The Bruins leader was Nathan Horton at +20 and 7 Bruins forwards were at +3 or better.
– We need to develop our youngsters. Who does he steal development minutes from be it even strength or PP?
Man I’m out! Sounds terrible. Scary actually. I am out period.
Brennan Klak – I get the sense that there will be some trade activity in the coming weeks. Lots of teams are in cap trouble.
So a Diax or Boullion can be traded for a $ 3 ml defensemen OR
a Moen can be traded for a $3 ml forward OR a DD or Bourque traded for a $ 5 ml forward.
Bergevin has gone on record as saying this would most likely be his route to improve the team over spending crazy money for a UFA.
Would not be upset if we traded Moen or DD, hate to see Boullion go but could live with it.
I still think Bourque is good for his cap hit, he can skate and play in the dirty part of the ice. As for Diaz, would like to see him play a full season and stay healthy before deciding to move him or not.
In trading there has to be some desire from the other team… something totally ignored here at times
I don’t have favorites and all Hab players are OK in my book, until they are gone
“hate to see Boullion go but could live with it.”
Same.
Read few latest comments… Have Habs signed Jagr? I always had a soft spot for him becuase of his hair. I wonder if Habs have to pony up for his hair products? Do they for Carey’s?
I read with interest what Ed said about Fournier’s leg injury being the reason he was not not drafted. (Leg broken twice, lack of explosiveness since.)
Those who have seen him, did you notice this? He puts up a LOT of points for a guy who is slow. He must have a good hockey sense and nice hands to go along with size and toughness. Good for the Habs to sign him.
————————————-
Listen to the Smart Dog. He knows his poop!
Did I say he was slow?
I said he lacked the explosiveness to get to the next level.
That’s why he was not drafted.
That’s why he was invited to more than 1 NHL camp already and he went home unsigned.
He is strong at the net, at over 220 lbs, and he can play the game – he knows how to score.
I try and give an accurate account of the situation
No, you didn’t say he was slow. Sorry to misquote.
————————————-
Listen to the Smart Dog. He knows his poop!
np.
He stands in front of the net, hard to move. Does that translate to success against men, we will soon see. Tons of will and character.
he also played with Drouin and Mackinnon on the power play, with Frk as one of the point men.
good signing
Not sure about Jagr, he’s still got skill and shot but his speed is mostly gone. It would be a good for forward depth though.
Is the Philly deal still being rumored?
Jagr had the equivalent of a 35 goal, 70 pt regular season last year.
He led the Stars for power play goals (one of our biggest weaknesses).
Count me in the sign him camp.
I’ll say this about Jagr. Dallas signed him for one year and ended up with a boat load of picks/prospects at the deadline in return…
__________________________________________________________________________
“To you from failing hands we throw the torch, be yours to hold it high!”
I really do not understand why Montreal would want to sign Jagr. If we are trying to build our team through youth and don’t feel that we are able to contend yet, what is the point. He only has one year left in him (if that). We should focus on bringing someone in or promoting a longer term player who can help lead our team in the future. Trading for Bobby Ryan would have been nice.
Goes back to what MB said about being unable to build your team through Free Agency. We won’t likely be signing/trading/overpaying for marquee young players, we’ll be drafting and developing those marquee players. Jagr would be brought in for leadership and to ease the development of our young players, not as a player brought in to push for the playoffs.
We didn’t have the available assets to make a deal for Ryan. We don’t have similar prospects or players to what Ottawa gave up (Silfverberg, Noesen). We may want to consider making a move for a younger, yet-to-break-out Ryan (Silfverberg) by moving some aging assets.
I agree, and I think in one or two years, Ottawa will regret what they did.
Habfan17
Agreed, picking up a young player who has not hit his potential would be ideal. I have not heard what Jagr is like in the dressing room, does he offer leadership to his younger teammates?
From what I hear, he’s a great leader. Apparently, he was instrumental in bringing out the French Canadian superstar in Claude Grioux.
Well if we do sign him, hopefully he can help our younger players as well. I find sometimes we assume that veteran players are good leaders in the room, because of the fact they are older and have been in the league awhile.
> I really do not understand why Montreal would want to sign Jagr.
Read the two posts above yours.
————————————-
Listen to the Smart Dog. He knows his poop!
Andy – MB is not trying to rebuild this year maybe not next year. MB is waiting to see what he can pick from the kids development. Than the real Rebuilding will start.
MB is trying this year to put a team in place that can compete.
Can’t help but feel the Jagr signing is 4 years too late. A full season will be taxing. He will need nights off to make sure he’s got something in the tank come the playoffs.
But yeah… Jagr, Briere, Subban and Markov on the PP with Chucky or Eller … That’s a clinic.
Habs won’t get Jagr. Eklund says the Habs have the edge, which is the kiss of death.
Jagr and Pleks play so damn well together that this would be a birthday gift to Tomas, and I would be okay with that. Pleks has been much maligned, especially here on HIO. During the Habs magic run to the ECF a few years back, Pleks was a two-way machine; for me he was the unsung hero of that run.
But Eklund is always right! Hahahaha
Now, the reports (from more legit sources than Eklund) is that the Habs are not going to get him.
Absolutely love these signings!
I would like to qualify this post by presenting just a few NHLers that were never drafted.
Most know that David Clarkson and Marty St.Louis were never drafted, yet there have been several others over the years.
Starting with our Habs, Francis Bouillon, Rene Bourque, and DD
were never drafted.
Torey Krug that played some nice D for Boston in the playoffs was never drafted.
Tyler Bozak was never drafted.
Goalies such as Niklas Backstrom, Antti Niemi, and Vezina winner Sergei Bobrovsky were never drafted.
Other recent notables are Canucks Dman Jason Garrison, Ville Leino, John Madden, Rich Peverley….
—–
Being nowhere near the draft junior experts that post on these threads, I had the opportunity to see 5 Moosehead games live this year at the Metro Center – more out of curiosity about MacKinnon and Drouin, that both looked bored sometimes as it was men against boys.
Another fella that jumped out was Marty Frk a 2nd Round pick of Detroit.
Then there was this co-Captain named Stephan Fournier that was fearless and ALWAYS stuck up and protected his guys and had no trouble hanging out in the crease.
He has a lot of great things going for him and perhaps it was his skating at a younger age that discouraged older scouts.
The past Habs regimes never sign this youngster…
I asked around about the things that don’t show up in a stats sheet, and this young guy is all about character and maturity way beyond his years.
While one never knows, don’t be surprised to see this guy wearing the CH in about 2-3 years.
Some naysayers may say, “Yea, right, like 29 other teams got it wrong.”
The answer becomes, stuff happens sometimes – see above.
Fournier broke his leg as a 15 year old. There was a large pin inserted during surgery to help the bone heal. I was at a game at Jacques Lemaire arena in Lasalle, Quebec, when the pin loosened and the leg was busted again in the same place.
He has since lacked explosiveness.
If he can get past this, and skate at NHL speed, then, yes, I believe he could make it.
But this is the reason he was never drafted, nor was he signed as a non-drafted free agent up to now.
Hi Ed
That’s enough to scare a lot of teams….but guys recover such as our own Galchenyuk that should have been #1 if teams were not afraid. He was a steal at # 3.
Galchenyuk had a knee injury, and full recovered his speed immediately. It has been several years since Fournier’s injury.
Perhaps we can agree and hope that Fournier pans out and the cost was nothing including a draft choice.
as I said, if he can develop into an NHL skater than he can make it.
Agree totally with you. Some players develop late and this could be the case with Fournier. Big guy, can score and not afraid to mix it up.
Watch the movie “Invincible” (based on a true story) with Mark Wahlberg. Remember anything can happen if your given the chance and grab the gold ring.
Mr. Biter
No Guts No Glory
Thumbs up Mr. B.
I love then too, especially Fournier. I have heard that his skating is not great, as Timmins says, you can teach skating, but not character, heart, or hockey sense. Both Robitaille and Brett Hull were late draft picks due to concerns about their skating. I am not saying Fournier is in the same category as them, only that like them, he can over come the skating. Someone else pointed out a severely broken leg and a pin. Did not Serge Savard break his leg not once but twice and very badly. Back then, medical treatment was no where near what it is today.

If memory serves me well, you have called Fournier for a long time.

Roy to Blues- 1 Year
That’s funny. There were posters poo poo others for suggesting a DD to St. Louis trade. Now the Blues sign Roy.
Roy is much more experienced than Desharnais Mark. I think the league needs to see Desharnais produce for at least 1 more season.
Roy is also a much better skater than Desharnais and he can be used in different situations.
Desharnais’ terrible power play performance last season was not helpful, since he doesn’t have the quickness to kill penalties.
I’d take my chances with David, at least I can expect him to be on the ice. Roy has only had one healthy season in the last four, experience doesn’t help if its in the press box most of the season. He too hasn’t done anything notable on the PP in years.
4 million
Lifelong Habs Fan
Now up to 44 players under contract or qualified;
– 6 goaltenders
– 14 defensemen
– 24 forwards
Does not include the 3 Juniors nor Andrighetto.
So if you include the 3, that leaves them 3.
Unless some are on the maximum reserve list.
How many is that now, with the new CBA? Still 90?
The 90 list is for total players owned by the club.
50 is the operating players under contract list.
The 3 Juniors don’t count unless they turn pro. Called the sliding rule. And the only way they can turn pro is to make the Habs.
During his years with the Oilers, he averaged over 20 goals/season.
And an effective player.
Then came L.A. and injuries.
If he’s healthy, he’d be a great pick up. Only 31-32 years old?
Jagr I’m not so sure.
Was his lack of performance in the playoffs because he’s too old?
Or was it because they didn’t play him right?
He’d be decent on the 4th line.
Penner was, bar none, the worst ‘name’ player I saw in a playoff game this season by a fair margin. You could have blurred out the name on the back of his jersey and told me it was Mike Blunden and I would have believed you. (With all due respect to Mr. Blunden.)
No touchy.
He didn’t play much, that’s for sure.
Johhny, didn’t see any LA playoff games (3am starts here!).
But Penner must have stunk big-time if he was worse even than the entire Pittsburgh forwards contingent! Dogroll-on-the-dead-fish-City!
I am undecided on Jagr, but he does not have the strength or speed to play on a 4th line. Heck, I don’t think he has the speed to play top 6. Now that I think about it I am decided, no on Jagr.
Lifelong Habs Fan
Jagr is not a 4th line player. If we sign him it’s for the 3rd line or he has no value for the Habs.
Mr. Biter
No Guts No Glory
It was cool watching that happen, Andy!
I’m with you Andy… I think!
I like what Bergevin is doing. You only have so much cap space to work with. If I could change something with what’s available, I’d trade Desharnais for some picks and sign Derek Roy.
Most of the trade proposals here are questionable at best.
But I like that one. Roy wasn’t too effective last year, missing most of it,
but he’s a heck of a player, as well as being bigger and stronger.
That trade I would go for.
It’s a sad day when you’re acquiring Derek Roy because he’s “bigger and stronger.”
It’s a sad day when someone comments without having read the entire statement. “He’s a heck of a player….” was in there too.
Oh I read the whole thing. Desharnais is also “a heck of a player” when you get over his size. At this point in their career, Roy and Desharnais have similar value and skills. Roy is more of a shooter, Desharnais a playmaker. 500k salary difference. Roy would have likely been a very slight upgrade on our current roster but would not fill any holes we currently have.
Roy played in 42 games last season, and had 7 goals 22 assists and 28 points.
I think you added your points wrong, Ed.
Desharnais played in 48 games last year, 10 goals and 18 assists for 28pts. Fairly comparable stats.
Tarnasky was on my list of guys to get this year. He had a great season in the AHL – I’m confident that he will skate some games with the Habs.
Why can’t many on this forum deal with some healthy criticism. This is not a booster club. Of course GMs have a lot of knowledge we are unaware of but many make stupid mistakes and not in retrospect. Good coaches and GMs do the obvious (coaches play the stars) and GMs strengthen their teams by acquiring assets the team needs most. For the Habs that is obviously size and durability. Briere fills neither of those needs and four mil could have been spent more wisely.
I have hope for MB but I won’t for long if he doesn’t beef up this team in the off season.
Lecavalier, Briere, now Jagr why does MB think he needs these guys??? I am more interested in the Fournier signing. The habs don’t need another 8th ,10th finish. Sink or swim with your youth and get the draft picks. Forget this Stanley cup dreaming until you build a serious product on the ice. The only stud we have is Subban. Until a couple more are found then you may have a contender. Until then keep dreaming.
“GMs strengthen their teams by acquiring assets the team needs most”
I think an NHL GM examines all Available! options and choses that or those which most benefit his team.
“Attach Brian Campbell’s legs to Andrei Markov’s body and you’ll have a really smart hockey player with four legs. Now, remove Markov’s original legs and you’ve got Nathan Beaulieu”
-Sean Bonjovi
Good point Bonjo.
I also think good GMs are infinitely more acutely aware of what’s needed now, what later, short-term/long-term, and of sub-surface factors that fans never know about.
What happens a good deal on fan-sites is:
a) fan is puzzled by GM move; therefore…
b) … fan chastises GM, perhaps calls for his firing.
You guys have me going back and forth on Jagr.
Either you guys are real good or I have become a weak-kneed lily-livered wimp.
Now I dont know which side to come down on.
Jagr yes, Penner no!

Hockey sine stercore tauri.
Penner looked BRUTAL in the playoff games I saw. Human turnover machine. Must stay far, far away from that guy.
I’m sorry, but Jagr? seriously? no, seriously? really?
I’m with you on that one. Jagr has been a Hall of Fame player. But he’s basically done, and he doesn’t fit the top-6 due to a complete lack of speed.
Jagr takes the puck, holds the puck, keeps the puck……….so long………it’s like the game is being played in retro 1990 speed;
I can’t watch it. He plays at beer league speed.
Ok.. that’s it! No Jagr… until..
Why is everybody hating on Crisp?
I like coffee crisp? It a nice light snack!
LOL!
You’d better make a trip to Tim Hortons and pick up some stir sticks, you’re going to run out.
Yeah but where do you stand on Jagr? LOL!
Hahahahahahaha
Don’t want Penner or Jagr and I don’t want a kick to the junk!
Penner has 11 goals in his last 117 NHL games.
Has @The_Creasy called any previous acquisitions before they were announced? If not, he’s just another guy like Eklund trying to rile people up.

Interview with McCarron weighing the pros/cons of OHL/college on tsn.ca.
He says one of his biggest assets is fighting, which you can only do in the OHL.
I hope I’m wrong. I hope I have never been so wrong about anything. But I think McCarron was a terrible pick.
Who did you like at #25 Ed?
Full Breezer 4 Life
I would have taken Adam Erne at 25. I really like his game. Exactly the type of power and skill combination we need;
He was just a first round pick in the NHL. He should be worrying about earning playing time by improving his skills, which are underwhelming in every category. The fighting will happen when it happens. Go take some lessons with a retired fighter if its that important to him.
or with Parros
Habfan17
Maybe Loonie used his “M… the Mouth” moniker too early!
He said fighting was an asset, but not his biggest.
Yikes.
If after a week at development camp our first-round pick is more concerned about developing his fighting skills than his overall hockey acumen, MB’s got some s’plainin’ to do…
I recommend watching the video, that’s not what he said.
Only way I would sign penner is if it was 1yr/600k at most
Jagr is obviously the better player to pick up
Hearing we are either getting, Penner or Jagr.

I call BS. There isn’t a GM in the world willing to give Penner a long-term deal at this point. He works year to year.
Noooooo. The only free agent I want less for the Canadians to sign is Daniel Briere.
5 QUESTIONS
All about your favorite GM (for now).
Give Marc Bergevin a letter grade for his work so far in:
1. Leadership & Vision
2. Communication
3. Trades
4. Signings
5. Drafting
– Now total those (as you like) into one grade: __
(Feel free to explain or elaborate.)
————————————-
Listen to the Smart Dog. He knows his poop!
A A A B A = 3.8 Dean’s List!
Actually, 4 should be inc. until we see how this year’s signings go
and 5 should take several years to eval but Galenchuk (sp?) gets his grade early.
Unrelated, but heard there was a train explosion near Lac Megantic (again, spelling?) Hope all the HIO gang are okay.
Sorry cant grade.
Nos. 1 and 2 are just too easy and also very subjective conclusions. I need to see the ‘iceberg hit’ before I honestly judge whether he can save the Titanic with his leadership and vision.
3. Actually this is a plus.. the Trades he has made are quite sound.
4. Signings ..twofold answer.. ahl bound players GREAT
Bigteam… c.
5. Drafting.. last year was too easy… this year still too many questions. Again need time here.
Thanks for the questions.. forgive my weak-arsed answers.
3 Teams interested in Jagr, but Jagr is most interested in Habs, (I would have no problem signing Jagr to 1 year 2-3 million dollar contract,
I support Carey Price
“Habs Insider”
Its a great depth move. He hold the puck and adds a decent amount of options to our attack.
He did pretty well last season with 45 points in 67 games.
Plus he is easily movable is the price is decent.
ALL GOOD THINGS FOR US.
I would love to see Jagr in a CH.
MB sign Jagr 3years $12 million and tell us who you really are…”You can do it!”
Too much.. way too much.. in my opinion.
Edit: Did I miss the sarcasm font?
If the Habs sign him, can they turn around and trade him for a 1st at the deadline?
Hey all! Like the additions. Bulldogs were bad last yr , nothing wrong with these signings to bolster the farm. Once again all your banter has entertained me! Now on to another beer.
Nic Cage’s view on the Habs and the job MB’s doing
So, MB has addressed size for the bottom 6 forward spots without giving up one asset! Who knows for sure if any of them will crack the Habs roster, but you have to hand it to MB, he is doing what he said, building from within, not giving away prospects and looking to the future.
Habfan17
Down below, Ben mentioned that he liked the St. Pierre signing the best.
Let me second that by saying that I absolutely love this signing. I had the good fortune of watching Martin St. Pierre play four years in Guelph with the Storm. That kid had the heart of a lion. NOBODY played harder than St. Pierre. He’s not blessed with great speed, or size or outstanding puck skills. What he is blessed with is a tremendous work ethic. St. Pierre gives 100% in every game.
For those that harp on his size, he’s not signed for the NHL. He’s signed to make the Bulldogs better. They are now better. But I will also point out that he routinely went head-to-head against both Corey Perry and Mike Richards in junior and he always performed.
Exactly, he is signed to make the Bulldogs better.
A major problem for the Bulldogs last year was offence… their leading scorers had like 30 something points.
You can’t develop offensive kids, if they don’t get the chance to play with other offensive players, and guys like St. Pierre, they don’t get opportunities with the puck on their sticks and don’t develop the offence. This is important to our future.
Go Habs Go!

Just play on there is one and hit “dislike” , I know I did.
Clarkson was unsigned. Just sayin’. Maybe Fournier turns into something, maybe not. Good signing either way. Like his size and skill set. Just what we have been asking for.
Gallagher was unsigned…no?
Gally was a 5th round pick
Makes you wonder why people are whining about why we picked similar players with our late draft picks…

Listen to the Smart Dog. He knows his poop!
You mean not drafted right?
yep
With the lockout, our GM has only really been on the job for 8 months. This, like building any program in any sport, takes time and patience. For those of you thinking that this (or any) GM would turn this team into a contender in 2 years or less, know nothing about sport.
You’re right. Fans are just impatient.
Either way, by now you can get a picture of what MB is doing. For the most impatient fans, his approach will ruffle their feathers because the results are not instant. Making big deals/signings may placate them for a while, until they start to stink!
MB has done very good job thus far. He has restocked our prospect pool in a short time and has added players like Fournier and others who have a shot at being good players in the NHL. He has also added players for the AHL to help our young guys develop and has drafted for depth. With Price and Fucale, we are set in goal, and it also gives Price some competition and makes him movable should he falter and should Fucale shine. He has also added size, toughness, grit and character at both levels.
Some balk at the small forwards we drafted, but they are very skilled and it’s not as if all 3 will make the team. They are projects that if successful can become goal scorers like Gallagher.
All in all, our asset pool has improved a lot in 8 months and the team is moving in the right direction.
Marc the Mouth? That must be an attempt at comedy, because Marc is a man of action.

So anyone who thought ‘a contender in 4 yrs’ know nothing about sport?
I didn’t say I know more or that people don’t know anything about sports.
I’m just backing up MB and stating that many fans are impatient and that his approach is easy to criticize because it is not characterized by big deals to get big name players but by getting picks and developing our own stars, which is slow and is a combination of many moves, some of which may not make sense on their own.

I will admit that 4 years was a bit outrageous, ok, quite outrageous. However, those calling for “right now”… yup, they know nothing about sport.
You didnt have to add the “know nothing about sport” part. You were doing fine. Some fans see need for more dramatic moves, more urgency, more risks.. you do not. Doesnt mean they know “nothing”.
I didn’t have to, I just don’t like the short-sightedness. Those wanting “right now” (a year or 2) know nothing about sport. At least, know nothing about building a program.
Attention HIO – MB sucks less today, MB sucks less today!

Agreed.. couple of the players he signed today especially Tarnasky looks like viable call-ups if injury hits us. Hamilton should be bigger by lots too, which may mean that our skilled players’s development is accelerated. Good news maybe for a LeBlanc etc.

Maybe play some cards my friend! He’s done like dinner.

45 points in 67 games…
Would have been 4th in scoring last season on the Habs….
I don’t think he is done.
I would still prefer to let the kids play

How many points in the first 24 games vs the last 24 games….and then add another 24 games, plus another 10.
He’s done.
Would prefer no but say I’m open minded what does he mean by ‘paycut’?
Didn’t you know trin the boy has inside information or at least he says he does…..
Edit: OK I have read the posts below by Jackal, Commandant,Florida Habs,HabCez on Jagr.
You have changed my mind. I was against it 100% (he looked so bottom heavy in the playoffs..really did) but I am kinda warming up to it on two conditions.
a) A real paycut.. I dont care if he gets Iginla type bonus clauses.. he performs he gets paid.
b) The final piece that bent my ear was HabCez. If, as HabCez puts it, the combination of Jagr and Briere provides that ‘respected leadership’ I’m warming up to the possibilities.
I am very very pro anything that makes the Briere signing ‘better’. And a jagr signing, dubious as I am, might just do that.
See it’s better to expound than denigrate dissenting views as belonging to people who know ‘nothing about sport’ and on top of that seeing some of our better posters express affirmation of such a statement.
That’s priceless trini. Now I got to crawl to the back of the bus with the know nothing about sports crew. How depressing. If I start a blog maybe I can crawl out of the depths.
Ok Trini, notify MB and tell him to seal the deal.
Looks like Bergevin is sticking to his plan. And he has addressed a little more size, sand paper and grit, without moving any of our prospects. Great job so far.
Summit News.
Summit game tickets, News, Pictures and comments
Okay so basically this all to bolster the Bulldogs, which is a good thing.
And Fournier has a long shot at the NHL being 21 and undrafted but also the EXACT kind of player we need (tough and big and can score), and putting up good numbers as a Memorial Cup winning Captain.
All good.
Now prove the know-nothings on here wrong and sign Jagr to one year. This guy still has it, he was one of the best on the ice some games in the playoffs and can teach our younger guys about puck possession and passing. He’s a freakin’ hockey legend with something to teach. Unlike Briere who’s a small guy, with concussion issues, and doesn’t seem like much of a teacher. Oh, but I forgot – Briere is… never mind.

That’s a bit of a misconception on your part florida, no one shot you down. One person suggested that reaction between the two may not be the same now and the other mentioned that the chemistry problem might be with Jagar and others on the team. How is that shooting you down ?
Gretzky and Kurri had great chemistry, but i wouldn’t sign them now.
Sign Jagr, need to say good bye to Gionta!
Habfan17
Don’t know if they still HAVE great chemistry now in what will be a year later. During the lockout in Europe they sure as hell did work together well and put quite a bit of points on the same line. Not to sure if playing together on the Habs now would equate to more of the great chemistry you describe. Not sure why Boston would not have reoffered a contract extension unless the figure to sign was too high. If so I would think it to high here as well with the cap we have left.
I have no problems with Jagr.
He makes it a habit of embarrassing a lot of wanna be GM’s.
No matter how many points he puts up..
Those wanna be GM’s will get it right someday but I think Jagr still has a year in the tank.

One on One!
“Emelin’s the real deal.”
– HabCez
Would that lead too some room decention with the team leaders now. Have Chucky pass by Gionta, Plek or anyother vet and go to Jagr and ask advise would cause a problem.
Can’t reply to Ron directly but Gionta more of a role model for Gally I would think.
Gio a workhorse just like Jagr.. they will have mutual respect.
Jagr knows his role and he wont be around forever and I think Plecy and Gio know it so no conflict.
PS: my opinion I think Plecy’s play and attitude on the ice tanked a lil when Jagr was rejected by the habs in the past.

Thank You WJC for probably the post of 2013 thus far in the previous thread.
Hope you don’t mind that I re-post it here….Its a classic and I agree 100%:
wjc JULY 6, 2013 AT 12:45 PM conveniently ignoring the the other 28 teams that fall short or fail to make the playoffs.
Instead of talking hockey, chat up the women instead.
Two observations about Timo (whom I’ve never met):
1) I’ve never once seen him attack another poster here.
2) His posts during Habs games are not negative.
Great points Mike …but there is a small group here from “the animal farm” THAT WANT HIM DEAD!
And probably couldn’t give a rats ass lol
public forum, all input accepted, and you should not take yourself, or insights, too seriously, Timo exemplifies that.
+1
+1. I vote Timo to do all our designated driving at the Summit. He’ll keep the back-seat drivers in check.
There’s a new ‘reality show on TV’ about some shippers… Timo reminds me of the gruff one.
Good points.
Timo is grumpy but light-hearted. It’s his thing and good for a laugh. Plus – take into account that he lives in Calgary. If anyone is overly sensitive to bad hockey decisions lately, it’s got to be the fans in Calgary.

“Oops, didn’t realize there was a new thread! Spent too much time typing this to leave it on an old thread!”
If I had a buck for every time I’ve done this! (Now to read your post…)
You’re right GMs know a THOUSAND times more than we do. But they are also biased by things that we don’t care about (like where someone is from) and take gambles that even to the average hockey fan don’t make sense (Kaberle, Gomez, DD).
The “wisdom of crowds” is often right. There will always be people who love or hate any deal, but when most people go “WTF??!!”.. often they are right. Which really worries me about this Briere deal BTW.
————————————-
Listen to the Smart Dog. He knows his poop!
True. But that’s where the “hindsight is 20-20″ comment comes in. I would hope, knowing what we all know now, that the MTL GMs involved, would never have made the Gomez, Kaberle and, possibly, the DD moves.
I like potential “upside” of the Briere move, what worries me is that he is nearing the end of his career and therefore may not be able to play as good as he used to and the injury potential. And, of course, adding a small player to a small team.
The best thing about this site is that we can all voice our opinion. The worst thing about this site is that we can all voice our opinion.
WOW! What an excellent point which if I may say so I have posted before. You said it more succintly and quotable than I did.. but “the wisdom of crowds” is often right. Very very true.
Case in point.. Gomez signing!
Bravo
“NHL execs, GMs, scouts, coaches etc. know a lot more than we do.”
— On HIO we pay lip-service to this reality. Deep down, however, we know it simply cannot possibly be really true.
“Drafting is based on how players perform against non-NHL players. They may or may not perform the same in the NHL and you don’t know that until they are in the NHL.”
— You need to move on, buddy, and take your rational, well-argued opinions to intelligenthockeydiscourse.com and share them with the 8 other people there. Folks don’t take kindly to your kind round these parts.
“Why on earth do you think any of the other 29 teams will give up a better player/top prospect/high draft pick to get our often injured, too small, washed up player?”
– Explain yourself: where the hell were you YESTERDAY when all of us were excoriating MB for not trading our small, injured, washed-ups for Crosby, Malkin or Toews or all three? Talk about missing the boat!
Cheers!
LOL Mike. Thanks for the laugh. I’m leaving now to join “intelligenthockeydiscourse.com”!
Going over to have a visit with my precious granddaughter later..she will be a month old tomorrow..she has made my world so much better..enjoy your afternoon and GO HABS GO
Ask her if she liked the Briere signing…

Of course she does. They see eye to eye.
good for you Mavid.
Have a good one Mary.
Enjoy!
Jagr is like a woman who would not go out with you when she was hot and now, older and not hot anymore, wants to hook up with you. Pass…

Jagr outscored all but a couple of the Habs this year and helped his team to the cup Final. Seems still pretty hot to me.

Every time Jagr is a free agent, he says he wants to come to Montreal and signs somwehere else. Maybe this time he would sign, but then Gionta would have to go. I am not sure if Gionta will be ready to start the season with his injury and the surgery. I guessm if he is on injury reserve, Jagr could fill in and it would help the kids. Then when Gionta is healthy, trade him if Jagr is working out.

Excellent!
Even though they tried last season, the guys in Hamilton took a beating. That will not happen this year. Adding Tarnasky, Fournier and Crisp to Sortini and Hagel will help a great deal. Good moves by MB.
“You’re always, always, always looking to make your team better. Always.”- Marc Bergevin
I imagine that Crisp will stay in junior so he can learn how to skate. And to think the Habs could have drafted Subban instead of this lug.
Unfortunately the playoffs in the NHL reward players like Crisp more though than Subban
Na Na Na Les Canadiens Les Canadiens
Hey watch what you say about Crisp buddy. Crisp=Clarkson 5 yrs from now.
Crisp will be back in Junior, he can not join Hamilton full time til 2014-15 (though he could be a late season addition if the Otters falter)
Go Habs Go!
Your 2013 NHL Draft Headquarters, Now Open.
Fournier is a 6’+ power winger who drives the net hard. A Gallagher, only bigger. Good hands and “Character guy”.
If he was that good, shouldn’t he have been drafted. It is not as if he was playing in Timbucktoo. He was the captain of the Memorial Cup Champions. With 30 teams drafting over 7 rounds, how come nobody took this guy. Kind of odd considering his size.
Once again skating seems to be the deal breaker.
I still think it’s a good signing. Not much to lose on either end.
Wasn’t that why Robitaille and Brett Hull were drafted so late? Not saying Fournier is comparable to them, I would say he is more comparable to Kyle Beach with his numbers in junior, Fournier, has more points, less penalty minutes. Like Timmins says, you can teach skating, you can’t teach character, heart, and hockey sense.
Habfan17
… and never before has a good player fallen through the cracks to not be drafted yet excel in the NHL, right? Time will tell, we shall see.
Fournier is a great signing for the Dogs and may one day have a shot at the big club. This big kid has yet to loose a fight and can score.
*Listen to my instrumental tribute entitled “Habs at War” at
Will Fournier’s use of the feminine version of the word “fier” to describe himself become the Pleky “little girl” meme v2.0?
Hamilton needs players. Ternasky could replace White I suppose…Fournier is the kind of heart and sould guy who could turn to be a perfect 4th line center
Na Na Na Les Canadiens Les Canadiens
Great signings for Hamilton. You can’t have all 20-year-olds. Proven scorers like St. Pierre will help make the young kids better. Tarnasky will give them a bit of room.
However, calling anyone other than Fournier “prospects” is a reach.
I watched about 35-40 Hamilton games last year and they had the same problem being undersized as the Habs. One guy I saw play 4-5 times is Nick Tarnasky (very tough and a decent scoring touch, at least in the games I saw him in). A welcomed addition to Hamilton. And I wouldn’t mind seeing him play against the Leafs, Flyers and Bruins. Finally we are starting to beef up and creating a bit of a cushion for the smaller guys to display their creativity.
Pleky could get one of his bestfriends to play in Montreal! The canadiens are talking to Jagr as thats what twitter says, but then again it is just twitter.
Jagr “talked” to us before signing for Philly two years ago and Dallas last year.
3rd times the charm!!
He is just using us to force the other team that wants him to raise their offer.
Hes always wanted to play in MTL but we have never exactly shown interest
The Northeast has seen a real arms race lately. It started with the Bruins and the truculent Leafs. Then Buffalo signed John Scott after Lucic ran Miller. Then Ottawa decided to get into it by signing Kassian.
Ottawa in the playoffs and Toronto during the regular season clearly set out to hit and possibly injure our players.
MB had no choice.
I just wonder how keen Parros will be to take on Scott, Kassian, Thornton, Orr etc …. night after night. A link to hockeyfights posted earlier shows he lost fights to every one of those guys last year.
I saw the Scott fight and would give Parros the decision, he decked him with a left and took down Scott. He held is own vs Orr. He does well in most fights.
He has also won fights with most of those guys also.
What are you smokin? Parros won the Scott fight, or at very least held his own (a draw). Both got in a punch or two but it was more of a defensive battle with Scott falling after a Parros shake and punch.
In the Orr fight, Orr got his sweater off and Parros had nothing to hold onto. Still, another draw in my view. But I watched several Parros fights and he won or tied all of the ones I saw. This is no Tom the Bomb. Parros is big and strong enough – and he knows what he’s doing. He uses his reach well and holds off the other guy from landing much of anything. I don’t think guys will want to fight him anymore than they want to take on Scott.
————————————-
Listen to the Smart Dog. He knows his poop!
Is he undrafted? I see he is at Habs development camp now.
Fournier went undrafted. He will likely never make the Habs, but he looks like a great AHL addition
yes undrafted. 21. late bloomer. captain of the mooseheads. 29 points in 17 playoff games. and if you havent seen this.
i think he’ll be a gem
I like the St. Pierre signing best.
He likely will never get a sniff of playing for the Habs, but the Bulldogs are in desperate need of a centre who can put up points in the AHL.
A player like St. Pierre is necessary to helping our young wingers like Thomas, Leblanc, Qualier, Andrighetto, and others who will be in the AHL next season. Gotta have someone to get them the puck.
Go Habs Go!
Your 2013 NHL Draft Headquarters, Now Open.
Every other H I/O’er hates the signing based on googling his height.
Thanks for your refreshing insights.
But you know the haters are going to focus on his and Briere’s size and ignore Parros, Fournier and Tarnasky…
Na Na Na Les Canadiens Les Canadiens
what’s the story with Fournier? his numbers look good/captain/size
Is not a strong skater. Maybe they can work with him on that.
I’ve got to see more. He’s a project at this point.
Plenty of 20 year old overagers, especially on a great team like Halifax, and those with size, and overage often put up great numbers. He’s worthy of a chance and he can help in the AHL, but he’s got a ways to go too…
Always worth taking these shots cause maybe 1/10 becomes a late bloomer, but ust be careful not to overrate him either.
Go Habs Go!
Your 2013 NHL Draft Headquarters, Now Open.
My goal is to follow the Bulldogs more next season.
thats why the development camp, is a great idea, invite ppl who were looked over at the draft, basically, adds round 8, 9, and 10.
Love the fournier signing, he could be a steal.
Also, see MB is surrounding bulldogs with guys who did well at ahl last year, so will raise everyones confidence if have a better team.
GET BIGGER, GET TOUGHER, GET EVEN.
Winning breeds winning. And confidence is everything, definitely need to support the prospects with veteran AHL quality.
love it. undrafted. 21. late bloomer. captain of the mooseheads. 29 points in 17 playoff games. and if you havent seen this.
i think he’ll be a gem
89 days till regular season starts
Best news of the day.
First!
Like the Fournier signing. Big body, sticks up for his team mates.
Hope he likes the AHL and does well.4) "Blackie" - Eric Clapton's Stratocaster hybrid
Sold for $959,500Two days ago, I mentioned the brakes that are located on the passenger seat side of our car....remember?.....that's where my wife sits because I am the greatest driver in the whole world? ...actually the best at doing anything? Yes, you do remember that, right? Let me tell you about the importance of those brakes.
But first.....a little aside to the men's department....a lot of guys I know, do not understand just how important those brakes on the passenger seat side are....some do not even know that the brakes are there! Guys....it is time to start appreciating our wives in a whole other way....especially because of those brakes.
Ellen applies those brakes at any sign of danger.... I see her foot come up to slam on the brakes long before I am aware that we could be having a problem....when I drive (understand here that not only am I not that great a driver, but my responses have slowed considerably as I have aged and...let me tell you about my eyesight.....it is pretty incredible that my eyesight has gotten better and better for distance year after year....to the point where I took the eye test again at the DMV when I renewed my license about 5 years back and passed the test....had the corrective lenses required thing removed from my license..... pretty cool....but I still can't really see all that well, and it takes a bit for me to focus in enough to see what's really out there at 60 or 70 mph. At this point, is there anyone out there who would like to be a passenger in my car? :)
Besides all that, I have two other serious problems.....one is that I am a terribly super focused individual and not very aware of things going on around the area of my focus......in other words, I don't see things that Ellen sees. What's even worse. I am probably the most easily distracted person that I know......translated: my focus shifts from totally here to totally there in a nanosecond.....fortunately, the lady sitting there at my right can bring me back to reality in yet another nanosecond by plunging her foot on the brake, snapping me back.......sometimes it's a deer off on the side of the road, another vehicle about to pull out into my path, a biker, runner, walker....maybe some obstruction in the middle of the road. Many accidents in our lives can be avoided when we understand how to see the brakes being applied over there by the woman who has been anointed for that specific purpose in our lives.
I cannot tell you how thankful I am for this gift God has given me to walk through this great adventure with me. She is my best friend, my partner, the love of my life and she sees the things that are a danger long before Jimmy the Dunce Philip does...... and applies the other set of brakes, just in the nick of time....she sees, feels, senses, and by her gifts knows when there is something dangerous ahead, just off the road.....and I have learned to respond and trust that knee jerk to the brake pedal.
Just a quick illustration. I had a secretary way back when, in a galaxy far, far away..... and many moons ago besides even..... that particular secretary, un-beknownst to this spiritual giant, was bent on seducing the Man of God to prove that all that religious stuff was just a lot of baloney.....every man could be had.
My wife put on the brake pedal when the secretary decided she would pick me up at the airport and bring me home after a trip.......whilst the wise, all knowing, head of his house, head of his wife, Christian leader in the area, chided the one applying the brakes about her just being suspicious, her silliness, etc ad nauseum.
I was picked up by the secretary. That trip home was the most uncomfortable car ride I ever experienced in my life.....it was the last day she worked for me and....it was the last time I failed to respond to Ellen's use of the brake pedal. I apologized to Ellen, told her she was absolutely right and thanked her for being who she is.......the gift God gave me who can see the dangers along the road so much better than I can.
This was just a little extra for everybody.....to the ladies: apply those brakes regularly.....to the guys: respond immediately!!
:)U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2005 - Monaco
Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor
March 8, 2006
Monaco, with a population of approximately 32 thousand, is a constitutional monarchy in which the sovereign prince plays a leading role in governing the country. The prince appoints the four-member government, headed by a minister of state chosen by the Prince from a list of candidates proposed by France. Legislative power is shared between the prince and the popularly elected 24-member National Council (parliament). The 2003 parliamentary elections were considered free and fair. The civilian authorities generally maintained effective control of the security forces.
The government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and the judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. The following human rights problems were reported:
- restrictions on citizens' right to change their government
- limits on freedom of speech
- legal officials employed them.
Prison and Detention Center Conditions
Prison conditions generally met international standards, and the government permitted visits by human rights monitors; however, there were no such visits during the year.
d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention
The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observed these prohibitions.
Role of the Police and Security Apparatus
In addition to the French national police force, the prince's police force (Carabiniers du Prince) performed security functions. The Prince's chef de cabinet is responsible for administering the police forces. Corruption and impunity were not problems. The police forces are generally considered effective.
Arrest and Detention
Arrest warrants, issued by a duly authorized official, two-month detention for additional two-month periods indefinitely. Detainees are allowed prompt access to a lawyer of their choice, and, if indigent, one provided by the government. The magistrate may permit family members to see detainees.
There were no reports of political detainees.
e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
The law provides for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected this provision in practice. Under the law the prince delegates his judicial powers to the judiciary.
The Supreme Court is appointed by the monarch based on recommendations from the National Council.
Trial Procedures
Trials are public, but there are no jury trials. As under French law, a three-judge tribunal considers the evidence collected by the investigating magistrate and hears the arguments made by the prosecuting and defense attorneys. The defendant has the right to be present and the right to counsel, at public expense if necessary. Defendants have the right to question witnesses against them and to present their own witnesses. Defendants and their attorneys have access to government-held evidence relevant to their cases. The defendant enjoys a presumption of innocence and the right of appeal. After a prisoner receives a definitive sentence, they are transferred to a French prison to serve out their prison. However, the law prohibits public denunciations of the ruling family, a provision that the media respected in practice.
The independent media were active and expressed a wide variety of views without restriction.
There were no government restrictions on the Internet or academic freedom.
b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
The law provides for the freedom of assembly and association, and the government generally respected these rights in practice.
c. Freedom of Religion
The law provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respected this right in practice. Roman Catholicism is the state religion.
No missionaries operated in the principality and proselytizing is strongly discouraged; however, there is no law against proselytizing by religious organizations that are formally registered by the Ministry of State. Organizations regarded as religious "sects" routinely have been denied such registration; however, there were no reports of religious organizations being denied registration during the year.
Societal Abuses and Discrimination
There were no reports of anti-Semitic acts. Monaco is 90 percent Roman Catholic and has a very small Jewish community.
For a more detailed discussion, see the 2005 International Religious Freedom Report.
d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
The law provides for these rights, and the government generally respected them in practice.
Nationals enjoyed the rights of emigration and repatriation; however, they can be deprived of their nationality for specified acts, including naturalization in a foreign country. Only the prince can grant or restore nationality, but he is obliged by the law to consult the crown council on each case before deciding.. In light of its bilateral arrangements with France, the government does not grant political asylum or refugee status unless the request also meets French criteria for such cases. The number of such cases was very small.
The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees and asylum seekers.
3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government
Authority to change the government and to initiate laws rests with the prince. The.
Only the prince may initiate legislation, but the 24-member national council may propose legislation to the government. All legislation and the adoption of the budget require the council's assent. Elections for the national council, which are held every five years, are based on universal adult suffrage and secret balloting.
The law provides for three consultative bodies: the seven-member crown council, composed exclusively of Monegasque nationals, must be consulted by the prince on certain questions of national importance; the 12-member council of state, which is not restricted to Monegasque citizens, advises the prince on proposed legislation and regulations; and the 30-member economic council, which includes representatives of employers and trade unions.
Elections and Political Participation
The 2003 parliamentary elections were considered free and fair.
There were 5 women in the 24-member national council, 1 woman in the 7-member crown council, and 4 women on the 30-member economic council. A woman was the mayor of Monaco.
There were no members of minorities in the government.
Government Corruption and Transparency
There were no reports of government corruption during the year.
The law provides for public access to government information and provides access in practice for citizens and noncitizens, including the foreign media.
4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
While the government imposed no restrictions on the establishment or operation of local groups devoted to monitoring human rights, no such groups were formed. International human rights groups did not seek to investigate human rights conditions in the country.
5. Discrimination, Societal Abuses, and Trafficking in Persons
The law prohibits discrimination based on race, gender, disability, language, or social status, and the government generally effectively enforced it; however, some legal discrimination against women remained.
Women
Violence against women, including spousal abuse, was rare. The law prohibits violence against women, and the government generally effectively enforced it. Any wife who is a victim of spousal abuse may bring criminal charges against her husband.
Rape, including spousal rape, is a criminal offense, and the government effectively prosecuted those accused of such crimes.
Prostitution is illegal, and it was uncommon.
Sexual harassment was illegal, and the government effectively enforced the law.There were no reports of sexual harassment during the year.
Under the law, women enjoy the same rights as men; however, women who acquire Monegasque citizenship by naturalization cannot transmit it to their children, whereas naturalized male citizens can.
Women received equal pay for equal work. Women were represented fairly well in the professions; however, they were represented less well in business.
Children
The government was committed fully to the protection of children's rights and welfare. The government provided compulsory, free, and universal education for children up to the age of 16.
The government provided free health care for children, and boys and girls had equal access.
There were isolated reports of abuse of children.. The government mandated that public buildings provide access for persons with disabilities, and this goal largely had been accomplished by year's end.
6. Worker Rights
a. The Right of Association
By law all workers (except government workers) are free to form and join unions, and workers exercised this right in practice; however, fewer than 10 percent of workers were unionized, and relatively few workers, unionized or nonunionized, resided in the country. Unions were independent of both the government and political parties.
b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
The law allowsunions to conduct their activities without interference, and the government protected this right in practice. The law provides for the right of workers to bargain collectively, but it is rarely used. A very small percentage of workers are under collective bargaining agreement, as industrial activity was very limited. The law provides for the right to strike in conformity with relevant legislation; however, government workers may not strike. There were no strikes during the year., which is approximately $9.60 (8 euros) per hour, plus a 5 percent adjustment, and this provided a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Most workers received more than the minimum.
The legal workweek is 39 hours. The government allows companies to reduce the workweek to 35 hours if they so choose.
Health and safety standards are set by law and government decree. These standards were effectively enforced by health and safety committees in the workplace and by the government labor inspector. Workers have the right to remove themselves from situations that endangered health or safety without jeopardy to their employment, and the authorities effectively enforced this right.* Malaysian protesters call for end to detention law
* Hundreds arrested in Kuala Lumpur
(Updates arrests)
By Razak Ahmad
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 1 Malaysian police used teargas and water cannon to disperse thousands of protesters on Saturday, arresting almost 600 people in the biggest demonstration in the country's capital in almost two years.
Up to 10,000 protesters, headed by opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, gathered in the Malaysian capital to demand that the government rescind a law that allows imprisonment without trial, a measure that has in the past been used against the opposition.
"We gather today to fight a cruel law under a cruel administration," Anwar told the rally.
Police fired teargas from the tops of buildings in the centre of Kuala Lumpur in an effort to prevent demonstrations from building up. They also mounted roadblocks in the Malaysian capital, causing huge traffic jams.
Kuala Lumpur Police Chief Muhamad Sabtu Osman said that 589 people had been arrested.
The mainly Malay crowd gathered at the national mosque, chanting "Allahu Akhbar (God is greatest)" and "Down with the government", sending passers-by fleeing and causing shops to put up their shutters while a police helicopter circled overhead.
Police fired teargas and water cannon to disperse protesters who were marching towards the palace to deliver a memorandum to the king urging him to support the repeal of the Internal Security Act (ISA) detention law.
ISA IS HERE TO STAY
The police however took a hard stance and one government minister vowed that ISA, used in the past to imprison Anwar among others, would never be revoked while the government that has ruled Malaysia for 51 years remained in power.
"We will keep on arresting until we can shut down this demonstration," Deputy Inspector General of Police Ismail Omar told Reuters.
The ISA allows for detention without trial and some analysts say it has mainly been used to quell political dissent.
The law was used last year on a pro-opposition blogger, a journalist, and members of Hindraf, an outlawed Indian rights group which had brought over 10,000 people onto the streets in 2007 demanding better treatment for.
There are 12 detainees being held under the ISA. Most are suspected of having links to terror groups including Jemaah Islamiah, which carried out the Bali bombings that killed hundreds in 2002.
Najib has promised to review the legislation and released 13 detainees from ISA on taking office in April.
"I regard this (demonstration) as being politically motivated, there is no benefit we can derive from a demonstration like this," he said on Saturday, according to Malaysian state news agency Bernama.
His administration has also been attacked by the opposition for what it says is a politically motivated prosecution of Anwar who is currently on trial for sodomy.
Anwar was dismissed as deputy prime minister in 1998 and imprisoned on corruption and sodomy charges in a country where all homosexual acts are illegal. (Additional reporting by Niluksi Koswanage; Writing by David Chance; Editing by Ron Askew)Select a person

LLANELLI manager Bob Jeffrey praised his team's superb 2-1 away win at Newtown, but warned they will face a fired-up Connah's Quay side on Saturday, writes the Llanelli Star.
Newtown had taken a first-half lead thanks to a goal from top-scorer Luke Boundford, but the Reds came back with a strike each from Steffan Lloyd and Craig Moses, who netted the winner against his former club.
Llanelli are now second in the Welsh Premier League Conference following the mid-season split, while defeat left Newtown two places below them.
"It was a superb performance," said Jeffrey.
"I am really pleased for the players as they proved here that they can get results at this level after the disappointment of our defeat against Afan Lido.
"The team has been reshaped with several new players coming in to supplement the players who stayed with us, but they all gelled together and worked so hard for this result."
Llanelli's next fixture is a home tie against Connah's Quay, and Jeffrey reckons his team will be buoyed by their triumph over Newtown.
"We will take great confidence from this result into our home game with Connah's Quay," he said. "We were missing a few players yesterday due to injury and suspension against Newtown, but it shows we have a squad who can compete here and gives us confidence for the last eight games of the season.
"Connah's Quay will be a tough test and they will be out to play catch-up after sitting out the previous two Saturdays."

Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, August 5, 2005
Consider the fate of America's favorite apple. It emerged from an Iowa orchard in 1880 as a round, blushed yellow fruit of surpassing sweetness.
But like a figure in a TV makeover show, it was an apple that its handlers could not leave alone. They altered its shape. They made it firmer and more juicy. They made it so it could be stored in hermetically sealed warehouses for 12 months. Along the way, they changed its color and hence its name -- to Red Delicious.
The only problem was the American consumer, whose verdict on the made-over apple has become increasingly clear: Of the two words in the Red Delicious name, one can no longer be believed.
"They eventually went too far and ended up with apples the public didn't want to eat," said Lee Calhoun, an apple historian and retired orchardist in Pittsboro, N.C.
In the 1980s heyday of the Red Delicious, it represented three-quarters of the harvest in Washington state, epicenter of the apple industry. By 2000, it made up less than half, and in 2003, the crop had shrunk to just 37 percent of the state's harvest of 103 million boxes. Red Delicious remains the single largest variety produced in the state, but others are ascending in market share as rapidly as Red Delicious is dropping, notably Fuji and Gala..".
As an industry, "we weren't consistent with the eating quality, and fairly soon, that erodes the base," said Gip Redman, manager of field services for the Holtzinger Fruit Co., a major packer and shipper based in Yakima, Wash.
Washington growers are seeking to spring back with intensively planted orchards of more lucrative varieties, better storage practices and new marketing strategies, including an emphasis on organic fruit. But if the future for growers in the Yakima and Wenatchee valleys looks brighter, the fate of the Red Delicious appears bleaker.
"You are sort of writing an obituary," said Calhoun, whose orchard grew hundreds of heirloom varieties that defined an age in which apples were regional and seasonal, with only a few strains suited to keeping to January. Now, the globalization of agriculture and high-tech storage give the consumer apples 12 months a year.
Dozens of strains of Red Delicious have been developed by breeders since the original appeared in Madison County, Iowa, though only a handful are widely used. Redman says the industry has moved to make Red Delicious more consistently high in quality, "but once you lose that shelf space, I don't think you get that back. The consumer wants a choice."
The decline of one of the most widely grown apples in history is momentous to observers like Calhoun. Unlike, say, the McIntosh, a wildling that made its way into commerce slowly, the Red Delicious was groomed for stardom from birth.
In the 1880s, a mail-order nurseryman named Clarence Stark held a competition to find an apple to replace the Ben Davis, a variety grown extensively in orchards from Pennsylvania to Missouri. At the same time, Jesse Hiatt, a farmer in Peru, Iowa, was trying to interest nurseries in buying and propagating a seedling he had raised and named the Hawkeye. Stark bit, so to speak, paid Hiatt for the rights, and then renamed the seedling the Delicious as a marketing ploy. When Stark's successors, in a similar stunt, found and named the Golden Delicious growing in West Virginia in 1914, the Delicious became Red Delicious.
At the end of the 19th century, a group of young and forward-thinking entrepreneurs settled in Washington state knowing that the high valley slopes would produce optimum conditions to grow apples on a massive scale, which could be shipped by railroad to eastern markets. At first, they relied on a storage apple called Winesap but in the 20th century developed a liking for the Red Delicious.
Its dominance was secured by the breeding of smaller, more productive trees in the 1940s and the advent of controlled-atmosphere storage in the 1960s.
Apart from its keeping qualities, the Red Delicious was a variety Washington growers loved because they could raise it better than orchardists in other states. The abundant sunshine and cool nights of the Yakima and Wenatchee valleys produced a fruit that was far redder and elongated and more distinctively lobed than Jesse Hiatt's Hawkeye, which was rounder and yellow-green with only a modest amount of red blushing and striping.
In spite of the wholesale replanting with other varieties, Redman of Holtzinger Fruit can't imagine a Washington landscape without reds.
"It's still a good eating apple and a very popular one. This is the best place in the world to grow Red Delicious, so we'll never do away with it," he said.
Stemilt Growers' Pepperl agrees, saying that "everything gets better or goes away, and I think it's going to get better. It's one of prettiest apples we have, it's got a long history and it's high in antioxidants."
Calhoun, the apple historian, is not as sure. "You could live a lifetime and never see a Ben Davis these days." The Red Delicious "is an apple that has done its duty and is on its way out."
That view is borne out at the Brookville Super Market in Chevy Chase, where manager Sidney Hersh offers Red Delicious at 20 cents a pound cheaper than Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji and Gala varieties but sees the others outselling it by as much as 2 to 1.
"People want something better," he said. "I would say in the past couple of years, something has changed."The. He was also co-producer of Beyond The Fringe, an early promoter of Bob Dylan and the author of Brewer's Rogues, Villains And Eccentrics (2002)..
Among those in receipt of the famed Root correspondence were Esther Rantzen, Nigel Dempster, the first sea lord, Root's hero, the prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and the young Harriet Harman, then at the National Council for Civil Liberties. Root advised "a pretty girl like you" to read the news or go on stage, enclosed a pound note for "a pretty dress" and suggested she ring "my friend Lord Delfont".
He also wrote to the senior Treasury counsel at the Old Bailey: "Now that the sensible practice of jury fixing is out in the open thanks to the irresponsible behaviour of the Guardian, I would like to nominate myself as a rigged juryman in certain trials. In cases involving pornographers, blasphemers and those prone to civil agitation and disorder, you'd have at least one vote under your belt ... Here's a pound! Put my name at the top of the list if you want a conviction!" The money was returned.
None of Donaldson's other works had anything like the commercial success of Root. Among them were The English Way Of Doing Things (1984); a crowded, muddled novel, Is This Allowed? (1987) and a television series, Root Into Europe. Another spoof series about proposed soaps was Heart Felt Letters (1998). He also extended the spirit of his newspaper column in the Independent into an account of modern manners and pretensions, I'm Leaving You, Simon, You Disgust Me (2003).
Avowedly chaotic, but blessed with a formal manner, Donaldson stumbled after his true métier, the right outlet for a wide and interesting knowledge fortified by concentric circles of friends. In his memoirs, From Winchester To This (1998), he recounts how, in 1985, he went back to Ibiza, enthralled by another young woman, and got a taste for crack cocaine. He insisted he was not an addict, though he appears to have used it for more than a decade.
His last book, the 700-page Brewer's Rogues, Villains And Eccentrics, was a repository of much fascinating, arcane lore, as well as entries for Brooklyn Beckham and the Duke of Edinburgh, all built upon a fiendishly entertaining system of indexing and cross-references. It was perhaps the book he was always destined to write.
He is survived by Cherry, from whom he was separated, and by his son.
Richard Milbank, of Weidenfeld & Nicolson, writes: Willie Donaldson warmed instantly to the suggestion that he should write a dictionary of Rogues, Villains And Eccen- trics. He knuckled down to two years' research and writing, and delivered - bang on time - 300,000 words of the most elegant, informative and understatedly humorous prose. All were entranced by what one reviewer described as "a breathtaking triumph of misdirected scholarship".
Willie's Flaubert-inspired Dictionary Of Received Ideas - I'm Leaving You Simon, You Disgust Me, followed in 2003, delighting Donaldson devotees but baffling others. Enraged by the absurdity of a culture dumbed down by the media, he was working, with Hermione Eyre, on a Dictionary Of National Celebrity at the time of his death.
Willie's conduct as a writer, while always playful, somewhat belied his image of a chaotic and irregular life. He was respectful of deadlines, receptive to editorial suggestion and meticulously correct in matters of style and presentation.

The Mill Between Goss and Ryan
Likely to Take Place on West Virginia Soil - Both Men in Prime Condition and Anxious for the Fray - A Brutal Prize Fight Near McKeesport, Pa., for $250 a Side.
The Curious Crowd.
STEUBENVILLE, O., May 31.
Special Dispatch to the Intelligencer.
It is now certain that the much talked of and much postponed Goss and Ryan fight will take place to- morrow morning, at or near Collier's Station, West Virginia. There is some little excitement in the city to-night, owing to the presence of New York and Pittsburgh roughs. T. J. H.
On the Spot.
COLLIERS', W. VA., May 31
Special Dispatch to the Intelligencer.
Your reporter arrived at this out of the way place this afternoon, and later in the evening found Paddy Ryan and his trainer, Johnny Roach, quartered here. Their party numbers only four.
Joe Goss and party are at the house of a farmer named Snyder, two miles below this point.
The ground for the fight has been selected, and is situated within one hundred rods of the Pennsylvania State line, and one mile and a half from the Station.
The ropes, stakes and all the paraphernalia of the prize ring are ready for use, and everything looks like business and no fooling, this time.
Ryan is in fine condition and is confident of winning the fight. Goss is reported well, and ready and anxious for the battle.
The fight will come off as soon after daylight as possible, to-morrow.
There is a very small crowd, present here, and everything is quiet up to the hour of writing.
They are Notified that They Cannot Fight on Pennsylvania Soil.
They are Notified that They Cannot Fight on Pennsylvania Soil.
PITTSBURGH, May 31. There seems but little doubt that a first-class prize fight will take place near this city within the next 12 or 24 hours. The city is filling with sporting men, who are attracted by the positive knowledge that Joe Goss and Paddy Ryan are in town, and that they will fight before to- morrow's sunset. Those in the best position to give particulars concerning this event are extremely reticent, particularly when questioned by newspaper men. Very few of the fraternity are certain when and where this mill will take place, but a general canvass fixes the time to-morrow morning, and the place as Collier's Station, on the Panhandle road, and within a short distance of the State line between this State and West Virginia.
The presence here of the principals in the coming fight increases the prevailing interest. Paddy Ryan has for some time been in training at Fairchild's, five miles out the Perrysville road, and has been actively preparing for to-morrow's event. Ryan is 28 years of age and six foot one inches in height, weight 160 pounds. He has never fought in the prize ring. His trainer is Johnny Roach. Joe Goss, who has been in training at Port Hamilton, N. Y., reached this city this morning from the East, via Cincinnati Express on the Pennsylvania railroad, at 8:11. He was accompanied by his trainer and by Billy Tracey, his backer. The men attracted a good deal of attention.
Goss was neatly dressed in dark clothes. He is an Englishman by birth, is forty-four years old, and stands five feet eight inches in height and his fighting weight is placed at 150 pounds. He entered the prize ring in 1859, and has taken part in many famous battles. It is claimed that he has deteriorated in condition and is scarcely a match for Ryan. After Goss had walked the length of the Union Depot he was hurried into a carriage that stood in waiting and was driven out of the eager crowd. A continuance of the present, delightful weather will tend to increase the assured big attendance at this mill.
In regard to the proposed fight Chief of Police Pender says that he is determined it shall not take place in this county, and he will use every means in his power to this end. He has had an eye on the principals all day, but has been unable to hear anything definite concerning their plans. Of course, if the battle takes place outside of Allegheny county, as in all probability it will, it will be impossible for him to interfere, and none of the parties can bee arrested until they have actually violated the law.
This afternoon it was learned that Joe Goss quarters at or near McKee's Rocks. The pugilist was sent for by Mayor In(?)dell, and was told that he must fight outside of Allegheny county. The pugilist and his friends assured the Mayor that the trouble would take place outside. Arthur Chambers, one of the party, stated that the fight would take place outside the State.

The Kentucky Enquirer reported Deb Sheldon, who is running for the open 24th District seat, said she and other candidates should have access to the names.
County clerks said that candidates previously had asked for the list of people who requested absentee ballots as a way of identifying likely voters.
The lawsuit seeks to make the names public before the May 20 primary. It also asks the court to declare the state law unconstitutional.

110 Firefighters Respond to French Quarter Fire

April 11, 2011
Investigators and sending bricks and other debris flying onto cars parked on the street. “Flames were coming out of the roof when they got here,” said Deputy Fire Chief Tim McConnell. First responders found no one inside the building after a primary and secondary search. Firefighters at the scene did a tremendous job protecting the neighboring buildings and prevented further devastation to a town already rebuilding its architectural gems.
“Everything in the Quarter has walls — brick walls, masonry walls, fire walls we call them — separating them that extend above the roof and that’s probably our biggest ally in these battles in these historic areas,” said McConnell.
Interestingly, the building was set to be sold to an investor for $762,000 within a week’s time. According to the bank’s real estate agent, the property can be salvaged, but the deal is probably kaput.Anime Expo - July 2nd - July 5th, 2015

Share SAT Reading: Score Big on Reading Passages without ReadingShare TweetI would like to send a sincere thank-you to the Diane Bolton UMW Circle, First United Methodist Church in Pineville. Your act of kindness will never be forgotten!
My husband, a school resource officer for the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office, was so surprised when two ladies from this group showed up at his school, St. Mary's, on March 15 and asked for the SRO. After telling them he was the SRO, they proceeded to give him a bag of goodies which was labeled a breakfast snack. They then explained to him they were doing this in memory of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
After the ladies left to continue their mission in a small SUV full of goodies for others, he opened their letter they had prepared for each of the SROs. He was so very touched by their letter. When he called to tell me he could not hardly speak. You never know how a act of kindness touches someone's life!
Renewing of the millage tax will not increase our taxes; they will stay the same, providing safety to our children, grandchildren and all the children in our parish, and safety to the ones who dedicate their lives to be a part of helping our children grow! This will provide as much safety as possible so let all get out to renew this tax! Children are our future!
I was not asked to write this letter. I was so moved by the brokenness in my husband voice I chose to share this act of kindness! Thank you again, ladies. You will never be forgotten, especially in the eyes of all SROs in Rapides Parish!

Got a few on the fly just to say I did it and a bunch more on LT, nothing over 20" but plenty fun this time of year. There were some large fish that would occasionally show in the middle, they were on a bigger bait then the little guys and they were heading West. Forgot what a PITA it is to fish the canal but I'm not complaining given the sterility of the water a few miles North. jfbasser10-31-2006, 04:25 PMI spent some time there Saturday myself with the HT. I slid down a mud embankment with my HT as a brace and fished a nice rip.....the return trip up the mud embankment that had turned into a small river was quite an experience:rolleyes: JimW11-01-2006, 06:14 AMSlower last night but I still managed a few. Tough to keep a connection to the fly with the wind blasting right down the ditch. Word is there are still big fish yet to come through, they've been hitting them on the end of the jetty sporatically. Beautiful out there last night even with the wind, nearly 60F. I didn't hang around for it to start running East . On another note if Deer is your quarry there's plenty of those running around, saw them every night at least once. Friday I pulled a real amature move - looking left "look at the pretty de...[BANG]" since I was going slow and had a foot on the break damage was minimal the deer got up and leaped off. If I'd had my HT maybe it would have been a different story. striperstripper11-01-2006, 05:08 PMJim are you flyfishing the canal with a single hander or spey rod?I 've been using the spey rod this year and doing quite well:hihi: Not having to worry about backcasts makes it more enjoyable. JimW11-02-2006, 01:41 PMSingle hander. I fish mostly from the boat but last couple of trips when I smile running on plane my lips freeze to my teeth so I switched to shore mode. Had a 2 hander that would have helped the backcast but don't know the spey thing. I can see how the spey would work great in the canal but don't have the equipment or the skill. How's the spey work in the wind? Years ago I used to fish the canal heavy non-fly so thought I'd give it a shot once the fishing slowed down in my area. Figured I'd have to catch a few on the fly to be allowed to post here. :hihi: It's going to be ice in the guides this weekend, may have to revert to coming out in the daylight:eek: Maybe the #@$@%%# deer will be in hiding, almost hit another one and have seen them at least once every trip at night.

Sarah Montague is in her seventeenth year as producer of the fiction series Selected Shorts for WNYC, and also produces features, dramas, and documentaries.
Theater and opera director Anne Bogart brought quantum physics to Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, and staged Macbeth as a 1940s radio drama. Now, she wants to return to the basics.
Her new book is entitled What’s the Story: Essays about Art, Theater, and Storytelling.
Bogart’s work with SITI Company, which she founded in 1992 with Tadashi Suzuki, has involved the pulling apart of mainstream dramatic texts, from Antigone to Midsummer Night’s Dream. She’s invaded Orson Welles' The War of the Worlds, and re-imagined the lives of artists like Joseph Cornell and Robert Wilson.
Now, Bogart says that we’ve deconstructed to “the point where nothing means anything any more,” and that the times call for a different focus.
“Suddenly in this new “ism” that nobody had created a word for—‘postmodernism’ is followed by what?—is the issue of: whose stories do we tell now, who are they for, and how do we tell them?"
What’s the Story tries to answer this question in a collection of essays organized around one-word themes like “heat,” “error,” and “politics.”
It’s about art practice, of course, but it’s also about life practice. “It is a book that takes the existential blips and bleeps of my own life and tries to organize them into something that is meaningful,” she said.

The Recreation Program offers a curriculum for persons interested in careers in recreation and leisure services. It provides a solid professional foundation complemented by concentrations that allow majors to work in a variety of fields, such as outdoor, community, therapeutic, military, and commercial recreation. In addition to its philosophy of professional study based in priniciples of liberal education, the Recreation Program features an innovative phased curriculum. "The Phase" is a four-part sequence of courses which students typically enter in the spring of their sophomore year and finish the fall of their senior year. Approximately 60 students enter and complete the four blocks of phases together as a community of learners. This arrangement has many advantages, chief among them:
- A supportive community of fellow students, faculty, and alumni.
- A variety of learning environments in addition to the classroom, such as overnight retreats, field experiences, and professional conferences.
- Greater access to faculty and comprehensive advising.
- Being part of the Phase tradition and its growing alumni network throughout the state, region, and nation.
The Phase, in a word, is special. We encourage you to ask faculty, students, and graduates about it.

We desperately need to revisit this topic. It hasn't been talked about here in a while. I need to mention two that come to mind. One, a squeegie guy from the mid-90s, pre-Giuliani having them killed or whatever he did to them. I was waiting in traffic to get to the Lincoln Tunnel when this black god came to my window. Handsome as hell and shirtless. He had an incredibly ripped body with a mouthwatering treasure trail. He climbed on the hood of my car to wash my windows and I could see a bit where that trail led. I jerked off, of course, as he he my windows, and I gave him $5. He saw me JO-ing, and joked that I need to get a girlfriend. Um, yeah, right. I want to suck off your hairy cock, and I need a gf? Whatevs! A second guy was a homeless black hustler I met on the street near Port Authority last summer. It was a hot day, and he was standing there shirtless. Very thuggish looking. His upper body was just ridiculously hot. I cruised him several times, and he finally took the bait. He followed me down to 38th St. He approached me and said hello. He was just breathtakingly beautiful. We walked for a bit and he told me his hard luck story. I told him he was very attractive. We ducked into a construction site on a side street. I told him that I need to see him totally naked. He pulled down his jeans to reveal a huge piece of meat. He asked if I wanted to suck on it. I told him no. The sight of that against his muscular torso practically made me cream. I JO-ed myself through my pants and thanked him for that. I gave him $20. Any stories?

The Kachemak Bay State Park and the State Wilderness Park have recently applied to operate commercial heli-skiing ventures, a decision that may lead to some controversy.
Officially established in the 1960’s by mountain guide Hans Gmoser, heli-skiing has been quickly growing in popularity as a sport. It involves the use of helicopters to transport skiiers and snowboarders to downhill skiing areas that offer more favorable conditions than those found at ski resorts and are otherwise inaccessible by conventional means.
According to Jessica Quinn, a heli-skiing guide and the owner of Points North Heli-Adventures in Cordova, heli-skiing provides skiing enthusiasts with an experience that simply cannot be recreated any other way.
"There really is nothing like heli-skiing," said Quinn. "The way that the snow comes in and produces these massive amounts of snow ... and then 24 hours later, you're out skiing the most glorious ... powder."
Despite the unique oportunites that heli-skiing provides, it is also a sport that has a fair amount of controversy surrounding it.
In addition to possible safety and environmental concerns, the main issue raised is the marked increase in helicopter traffic, something that Roger McCampbell, the chief ranger for the South Kenai district and a liaison for the Kachemak Bay State Parks Citizens Advisory Board stated is primarily about the noise produced by said helicopters.
"Helicopters ... always seem a little bit more divisive," said McCampbell.
While the noise produced by helicopters is a concern, Quinn says that in operating her business she and the other guides of Points North make it a point of theirs not to disturb the citizens of Cordova.
Recently, the Kachemak Bay State Park and the Kachemak Bay State Wilderness Park have considered options to operate heli-skiing ventures. McCampbell stated that the options for operating such ventures have technically been on the table since 1995, albeit with heavy restrictions.
He says it's been many years since park officials have looked at the regulations. A permit has granted to Maritime Heliciopters a few years ago to allow the company to land on Grewinck Glacier but the permit was never used.
While the options for commercial heli-skiing have been proposed, McCampbell says that the process of testing all potential variables is being continually addressed and that they are seeking statewide public comment on the matter.
"We're still in the process," he said. "We want to know how people feel about this throughout the state."
Also, when asked if she had any comments or concerns about the desirability of the State Park and State Wilderness Park for heli-skiing, Quinn said that the one potential concern she has is the oceanside location of the parks and how that might impact the snow’s ability to accumulate, though she was quick to place her confidence in those exploring the options as well.
To submit comments on the ongoing development of commercial heli-skiing in the Kachemak Bay State Park and State Wilderness Park, contact information for the Kachemak Bay State Parks Citizens Advisory Board can be found at dnr.alaska.gov.Highland Mint® Raymond James Stadium Desktop Photo Mint

Personalized Graduation ThrowNon-Members $39.99 Buyer's Club $35.99We stayed here in 2009 on our fourth trip to Orlando, after booking we were a bit worried as we read some very worrying reviews of the hotel. We arrived right in the middle of the hotel refurbishment and were allocated one of the newly decorated rooms. Two extremely comfortable double beds, tv, free wifi, large wardrobe and set of drawers. There is a bathroom with shower and toilet, outside of which is where the sink is allocated along with fridge, microwave and hairdryer, there were 2 adults and 2 children staying in the room and we never felt cramped.
The staff were lovely and friendly and felt very safe with the security patrols. The hotel has 3 good sized swimming pools which can get busy but we could always find a sun lounger at one of them.
The location of the hotel could not be better, situated at the quieter end of International Drive there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance and Pointe Orlando Centre straight across the road.
We absolutely loved this hotel, so much so we have booked to visit again next year!
~~~ Background ~~~
I went to Florida with my boyfriend last year. I had been before but he had not. We wanted a hotel on International Drive because it is so central for all of the attractions, but I was aware of how tacky some areas of the drive could be. Imagine my surprise when we ended up staying down at the bottom end of the drive which is comparatively classy compared to the garish, blackpool-esque top end of the drive! We stayed at the Quality Inn Plaza from the 21st August until the 4th September 2010 and we had a wonderful holiday.
~~~ Introduction ~~~
On arrival we were placed in a room facing the back of the building, away from International Drive. At first glance, this may seem like a good thing, being away from the main tourist area...WRONG! If you are in a room at the back of the building you are facing the I4 which is a very busy 8 lane interstate. It's busy 24 hours a day. On entering the room we realised instantly that we could hear the roar of the traffic over the air conditioning. So we went down to reception to ask to be moved. In typical American fashion, this was not a problem and we were instantly moved to another room on a side area of the hotel...but still towards the back. We could still hear the traffic. My boyfriend looked at me hopefully, thinking it would be alright. But, after a nine hour flight and a 4 hour diversion to Tampa, I was in no mood to take half measures. It was 10pm I wanted a quiet room!!! So we went back down and my boyfriend bravely approached the desk for the second time. Again, this was not a problem, the placed us in a lovely room on the front of the building in block C.
On entering the room we were relieved to find that we couldn't hear a single sound from outside. Success! We collapsed in a heap, followed by nice cool showers after the Florida heat!
~~~ The Room ~~~
The rooms have been refurbished between 2009 and 2010 and some were still being refurbished when we were there.
The room is your typical motel room. You open the door and are looking towards the back of the room which has a sink area, dressing area and bathroom. On your left or right depending on where the room is, you will find a large window with good, heavy, blackout curtains and lighter net curtains. Under the window is the individually controlled air conditioning unit - an absolute must if you are visiting Florida. We used to set the A.C. so cold that we would wake up shivering during the night!
The room had two twin beds with mustard coloured top sheets and lovely soft feather pillows. The beads had large, dark wood headboards. All of the furniture in the room matched this dark wood and the overall look of the room was clean and modern. None of your old style mish mash of colours on the beds and curtains!
On the wall opposite the beds there was a large standard lamp, a desk, a large TV unit with flat screen TV and a chest of drawers and a large wardrobe. All the storage space you need! There was also a nice armchair by the window and beside tables and lamps between the beds. The bedside tables had a radio alarm clock, plug points and a cupboard underneath which is where the room safe is located.
The room was very clean, neat and tidy. It was larger than we needed and would comfortably accommodate a family of four. We were very impressed. It has clearly been refurbished recently and everything was brand new.
The beds were fairly hard compared to your own bed at home but were remarkably comfortable! It was wonderful to have proper feather pillows!
~~~ The Bathroom and Dressing Area ~~~
The bathroom area is closed off from the rest of the room by sliding doors of the same dark wood as the rest of the furniture. This is really handy as it allows the sink area to be used as a wee dressing room. The sink area had a large mirror and a marble worktop. The area was large enough to use as a dressing table or to shave at. There is also a hairdryer, a small fridge, a microwave, and a coffee maker with coffee etc there ready to use.
The bathroom was fairly small and a little bit stuffy, but it was very clean. There is a door which separates it from the large sink and kitchen area. There was a bath with a shower over it, a toilet, and a sink. Each room was provided with a 4 large bath towels, 4 smaller hand towels and a 4 face cloths. The towels were changed daily which was really useful as I usually had two showers every day, one in the morning and one before going out for dinner.
These bathroom and sink areas were very useful as they were closed off. This allowed me to get up and get ready earlier than my boyfriend and stand and blast my hair dry with the hotel hair dryer (hair takes an age to dry in the humid Florida air!)
~~~ The Hotel Facilities ~~~
The Quality Inn has a little shop called the Lite Bite Deli. It sells all of the usual essentials like water, juice, snacks, fruit etc. However, it is very expensive and I would avoid using it if possible. There are a number of other options which I will discuss in the next section.
There is also a restraint in the hotel called the Plaza Garden. We did not eat here as there were so many other choices which were cheaper and more inviting. As well as the restraint, the hotel has a gift shop selling T-Shirts and postcards and toys. It's very nice and there's great variety, but you tend to buy these sorts of things when you are out and about anyway so again, we didn't use it.
There are computers with pay as you go internet, phones, a post box etc all located in the reception area. One of the most helpful things we found is that there is a kiosk in the reception area where you can book various trips. We used this to book our day at NASA and Kennedy Space Centre. The girl there is very helpful and can tell you about various options for park passes and the iTrolly etc. She is a mine of information and I would recommend speaking to her about anything at all you have questions about!
The hotel also has three swimming pools. They are relatively small but absolutely lovely. They never seemed too busy, although, it being Florida, no one comes to sit by a pool. We went to the pool after a water park one day and it's lovely. The water is a nice temperature, it's quiet and secluded. Very relaxing away from the Florida Buzz.
There is a small play park at the back of the hotel but I doubt it is used often. The hotel has excellent parking space and a beautiful reception. The rooms are cleaned each day and at the end of the holiday it is generally accepted that you should leave the cleaner a tip as they are taxed quite highly and they really do a good job. We left about $30 (£20) which worked out at $2ish a day. This seems to be the generally accepted amount.
~~~ Hotel Information ~~~
Address: 9000 International Drive Orlando, FL 32819

~~~ The Hotel Location ~~~
The hotel is at 9000 International Drive. This is at the bottom end of International drive across from Pointe Orlando. This is generally regarded as the classier end of International drive. It is certainly quieter and has much nicer restaurants.
Right infront of the hotel you will find your breakfast provider for the two weeks...Sizzler. $5 for a buffet breakfast. This is perfect for a busy holiday like this one, however, you are best to arrive early (before 8am) or late (after 10am) otherwise you have to stand in a queue before you are seated and the buffet is very busy. The food on offer is your general buffet fayre but tastes great and there's loads of fruit in the fruit bar and cereals as well as the cooked food.
The hotel is near a number of great restraints. The Olive Garden is just up the street, this is a lovely family Italian. There is also the Pointe across the road. This is a wonderful area full of great eateries! We ate here several nights. Our favourite restraint of the whole holiday was a 5 minute walk from our room - Maggiano's. It's a big, noisy, family Italian restraint. It serves massive portions for great prices and all of the food is absolutely wonderful. While we were there there was a giant Italian wedding going on in one of the function rooms. If you stay at the Quality Inn Plaza you simply MUST eat a Maggiano's. It's wonderful! There are also more upmarket black tie restaurants in this area such as the Oceannairre Seafood Room which is really divine - we loved out waiter John - but very very expensive.
As well as being perfectly located for food, the hotel is only a 20 minute drive to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. Both of these parks are worth two visits each! Please do not try to get around both in the one day, YES you can walk between them, but it's not worth it, you will miss things out! It's an easy drive too, up I.Drive, turn left, turn right and you're there. It is also only a 15 minute drive in the other direction to Sea World and Aquatica.
Disney is a slightly longer drive, probably about 40 minutes depending on which route you take. Still, it's reasonably straightforward to get there. You pass under the Disney sign after about 25 minutes driving, but it takes a further 15 minutes once inside the Disney boundary to get to your chosen park gates and then to park. The Disney Parks are Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, Epcot and the Magic Kingdom. All of them are worth at least one visit! I'd suggest do the Magic Kingdom twice to really take it all in.
I should also mention here that there are a number of shops near the hotel which are cheaper than the hotel shops. There is a Walgreen's across the street. This is kind of like a Boot's pharmacy crossed with a convenience store. They sell everything (socks, toys, booze, digital cameras, make up, toys, towels, souvenirs, sweets, proper food, sunglasses, coffee, stamps) and are fairly cheap compared to theme park prices or hotel shop prices. We bought our water and root beer and stuff here.
~~~ Conclusion ~~~
If...no... WHEN I go back, I plan to stay in this hotel again. It is clean, tidy, friendly and very convenient. It's in the nice bit of I. Drive and away from the tackiness of the top end. There is an I.trolly stop (No 23) right outside the hotel so it's convenient even if you don't have a car. However, I would recommend a car, it's just so much better to be independent. We got a sat nav which made driving pretty simple.
This is a perfect base hotel for sleeping in and getting ready. It is wonderful to come back from a hot, sticky, busy and stressful day at a theme park and enter an icy cold room with a crisp, fresh bed to spread out on. It's not a luxury hotel by any standards, but it has everything you need for a magical holiday in Florida. I would not hesitate to go back to this hotel. Infact, I'd go back tomorrow!
The Quality Inn Plaza has been taken over by the Rosen Corporation who have a very good name in terms of hotel/motel quality. There is another Rosen hotel next door and I think you can now use some of their facilities too.
If you visit Florida, I cannot recommend a better budget hotel. It costs what a budget hotel should cost, but the quality and location make much higher than a simple budget hotel.
I booked to stay in this hotel with my boyfriend in March 2009 for 2 weeks through Virgin Holidays and after reading several not so good reviews about the hotel I was a bit worried about going. I couldn't have been more wrong!
The hotel is in an excellent central position down International Drive and is right opposite Pointe Orlando and Wonderworks, a short walk down the drive from the hotel you have got Pirates Cove golf, Walgreens, Subway, Dominos etc.
The hotel itself is very big and has 1020 rooms within about 7 blocks named A-G, If you are in block G be prepared for a long walk from reception to your room but in the florida sunshine this isn't a bad thing!
As like a lot of american "motels" the rooms all have massive windows at the front which people can just walk by and look straight through and see in to your room, so I would suggest keeping your net curtains closed all day. To be honest you are never in your room so this isn't a problem, it is just better to keep them closed so people can't nosy at what you have in your room.
The rooms have recently been renovated and look really lovely and modern, you can go to their website to see the pictures. When we stayed we were in the old rooms which to be honest were in need of modernisaton but they were totally adequate for what you needed them for. The rooms are very clean and spacious and the bathrooms are also very clean. In your room you get:
two double beds, chair, bedside table, long set of draws, TV, fridge, coffee maker, microwave, clothes rail, great air conditioning unit, bath/shower, sink, large mirror.
A lot of people moan about the rooms saying they are too basic etc but in Florida you don't want anything fancy, you are never in your room you are always out at the parks till late or shopping etc. All you want is a clean room, comfy bed and somewhere to have a nice shower and that is what you get at the Quality Inn Plaza.
The restuarant is an all you can eat buffet and the breakfast is lovely and only costs $8 for as much as you like. In the evening they have different themes american night, italian night etc and the food also looked really nice but we didn't ever eat there as we were always out.
There are three outdoor swimming pools of which two are heated and they all have quite a few sunbeds around them, we went here usually at about 3:00pm for an hour just to relax before going back to one of the parks.
They have also got a little supermarket and deli etc but I would suggest walking down to the road and going to Walgreens as it is a lot cheaper than the hotel shop. The day you arrive I would suggest going to Walgreens and getting some milk, cereals, fruit juice etc and stick it in your fridge in your room, it is nice to come back after a long day at the park to a nice cold drink and some Fruit Loops :D There is also a Pizza Hut in the hotel park which is very handy, if you don't fancy going out after a long day just ring up and order your pizza then go pick it up and take it back to your room. The maids take your pizza boxes the next day for you.
You get free transportation to Universal, Seaworld, Aquatica etc from the hotel and I think the times are 8am, 10am, 12pm, 2pm but I am not 100% sure. Transport to the Disney parks is available but this isn't free and costs about $18 return. If you go to the ticket desk in the hotel reception and ask about local buses you can get to Disney for a lot cheaper than $18. That is what we did we got the i-ride to a local bus stop then got on a certain bus that took us straight to disney for about $2, you can't go wrong.
The i-ride is a great way of getting around International Drive and is so cheap there are stops all the way down the i-drive and one directly outside the hotel. It costs about $16 for a 2 week pass and you can then use the i-ride as much as you want during that time, it takes you all the way down to the premium outlets, it is well worth the money.
I have stopped in the Holiday Inn International Drive before and Parc Corniche but I would defantly stop in this hotel again. It is in an excellent position, really reasonable, the rooms are prefectly adequate (even more so now they have been renovated) and the staff are all very friendly. Please don't take notice of any bad reviews you won't be disappointed!
Weve stayed at this hotel twice now...once in 2003 and again in 2009 - and both times we havent been left disappointed.
Most hotels in Orlando (or america in general) are of the room only, motel variety and all have pretty much a standard layout and style... and to be honest - the Quality Inn Plaza is no different than the layout of the Holiday Inn or The Ramada. However, the good thing about this hotel is its location.
You have to drive everywhere in Orlando. Fact. You cant get about without some for of vehicle transport. Which means a constant designated driver. The beauty of the Quality Inn is that after a day of trekking around and driving to and from the parks - your right on the doorstep of a number of restaurants and bars and shops that everyone in your holiday party can enjoy without having to get back into the car. Across the road is Pointe, Orlando - filled with family bars and restaurants and shops galore (Sizzler, Johnny Rockets and Pizza Hut to name but a few).
Its also equidistant from Sea World as it is to Universal Studios.... both of which again, you need to drive to. And it has easy signed access to Disney world.
Whilst you arent going to get a different room at this hotel than youll get at a number of others... i would definately reccommend this hotel for its location.
Me and Boyfriend decided to stay at this hotel after reading the reviews which were 80% good and the price alone was a decider - £200 pp for 2 weeks in April 2009 great stuff!. When we arrived at the hotel I was pleased with the service and the room was very clean along with sky tv!
Another great point with this hotel is the location, placed on International Drive with Bars and restaurants across the road and directly infront of the hotel was the I Ride Stop. For those of you that have never been here this is a little tram that takes you up and down International Drive as it is huge! This tram also takes you to the Prime Outlets (great for shopping!)
The hotel also provided complimentry shuttle transfers to Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure and to Sea World. The hotel can also arrange transfers to Disney World...you do have to pay for this as its about 45 minutes, the cost of this was $16 return but was the quickest and cheapest price around to get there so we took the shuttle with them to get there and they provide many return time slots, which was also great!
The hotel has 3 swimming pools which were all very clean along with a sports bar, shop and restaurant on site!
Can I also recommend across from the hotel is Millers Ale House, we found ourselves in here most nights! The food was delicious and very cheap and they also had great offers on the drinks! So would highly recommend going there for drinks and food if you stay at this hotel!
If i ever visit Orlando again I will definitley return to this hotel!
Myself and my wife stayed at the Quality Inn Plaza International in September 2008 for 6 days. The location of the hotel is its best feature. It is pretty much opposite Pointe Orlando shopping mall (with numerous shops, restaurants and a cinema). It is about a 5 minute walk from Ponderosa which is a great place to go for a buffet breakfast in the morning. It also is about a minute walk from Pizza Hut and TGI Friday.
We had a car but I think the hotel may put on a shuttle bus to the main theme parks (most hotels on i-drive do). The rooms are very basic but acceptable. They contain 2 queen size beds, tv, fridge and bathroom. The rooms are very typical for the hotels in the area. We didn't use the pool at all as there was so many other things to do so I can't comment on that. If you want to shop, there are numerous outlet centres in the area. Premium outlets and Prime outlets are the two best. Also visit Florida Mall if you have a car (do not attempt by bus, we did once and it took us about 1hr 15 mins to get there when it is around a 10 min drive by car!!).
A no-frills hotel that does the job. Don't expect luxury.
we stayed at the QIP june/july 07 and was so impressed we have just booked to go this year.The hotel is in prime location on i drive ,the eateries are out of this world ,our favourite was the ponderosa.the hotel is cleaned daily,includes a laundry,3 pools and regular entertainment and a 24 hour deli .Never ate here but supposed to be good.They provide free transport to seaworld,universla studios,islands of adventure and wet n wild but make sure you book this in plenty of time as places go quick .
This was a great base for our Florida holiday, great spot on International drive, lovely heated pool and clean rooms. We did not taste the food as it is across the street from the Golden Corral resturant which is out this world. Easy to drive to the parks as they are all well signposted. There was entertainment on 3 nights a week but we were all too tired to go and watch it. (think it was singers).There is perhaps no more interesting and no more difficult problem in biology than the question as to the transmissibility of acquired characters. It seems not impossible that a compromise answer will afford—here as elsewhere—the true solution, to the effect, namely, that such characters as are purely local are not transmissible by heredity, while those that represent a permanent change in the organism as a whole may be so transmitted, providing, of course, they have developed prior to conception. Thus, the loss of a member or the development of a neoplasm would not be capable of hereditary transmission, nor would disease as such, because of its temporary quality. It may be stated as a general proposition that disease as such is not hereditary, that which may be transmitted by heredity being a certain predisposition or susceptibility on the part of the cells of the organism. Disease in the fetus.Eurogamer has spoken to Creative Assembly studio director Mike Simpson about the future of Total War. What new historical settings are under discussion? Will there be more remakes? What about consoles? Those questions, and more, are answered in the article below.
Total War and consoles
It's never been a question of how you would control a Total War game on console that's held the core series back - the stumbling block has always been power.
"Total War on console, the reason it's not there has never been about control.," Simpson told Eurogamer (later acknowledging that SmartGlass and touch-screen controls would "make it much easier").
."
When Creative Assembly reassesses the suitability of Total War for the next generation consoles from Microsoft and Sony is "an interesting question". "Not yet, is the answer to that," Simpson said. "We're not in a position to do that yet."
"You can't fit a gallon into a pint pot, it doesn't go."
Mike Simpson, on putting Total War on consoles
Wii U is something Simpson hasn't "particularly" looked at. "But lots of other people look at that stuff," he said, "so it all goes in, into the mix."
Total War sequelitis
Medieval 2: Total War was the first Total War sequel, but it wasn't a proper one - Creative Assembly Australia made it while Creative Assembly Horsham (HQ) started from scratch with Empire: Total War. Therefore, Shogun 2 was the first proper Total War sequel, and very fine it was. Now, Creative Assembly has announced Rome 2, another sequel. So, where will it stop?
"I'm comfortable doing it up to a certain extent," Simpson told us. "So much changed between original Shogun and doing Shogun 2 that we thought we could do a lot better. There were all sorts of things we couldn't do in the original game that we can do now, and we wanted to go back and revisit that. And the same is true of Rome.
"I doubt we'll have the appetite to go back and visit anything a third time - I very much doubt we'll ever do that. I'll never say never, but that certainly wouldn't be high on our list, going back a third time."
When asked whether this ruled out Medieval 3, a wily Simpson said, "to be absolutely honest, we haven't decided what we're going to do next, after Rome 2 - which period we're going to do next".
"Yeah, I'm sure it's a possibility, but me personally, it wouldn't be my first choice. But I've got to argue with the rest of the team and persuade them that that's the case."
"I doubt we'll have the appetite to go back and visit anything a third time - I very much doubt we'll ever do that."
Mike Simpson, studio director, Creative Assembly
Revisiting Empire: Total War "is probably on the list somewhere", and will be discussed in "due course". "But like I said," Simpson said, "we haven't really had those discussions yet."
New Total War games and historical settings
Creative Assembly doesn't wait until one Total War project has been finished before discussing the next. "We never stop talking about them," Simpson revealed. "We're constantly discussing what to do next."
"We have a list of all of the things we want to do, and we argue about the order we're going to do them in, so pretty much everything you can imagine is on that list. Various different ideas for things we could do with Total War are in various different states at any point of time."
That list is revisited "all the time", and is big enough that Simpson "can't see an end to it".
"It's one of the things that I like about Total War," he told us. "I don't think we'll ever run out of content for it, and we'll always be able to do new and interesting things."
The historical periods Total War has covered so far are Medieval/feudal Japan (Shogun, Shogun 2), Medieval Europe (Medieval, Medieval 2), Ancient Rome (Rome, soon Rome 2) and the 18th Century (Empire, Napoleon). So, which other historical periods does Creative Assembly look at for Total War?
Late 18th century is, so far, as modern as Total War has been.
"Lots; all of them!" exclaimed Simpson. "Pretty much everything you can imagine is on that list of things that we would consider. And that's all the way from almost pre-historic, all the way through to futuristic.
"Most of those actually fall away fairly quickly. We're not going to do Dinosaurs: Total War," he said, even though it was popular in the office "for a while".
But it would be it would be the absolute triceratops - It would be incredible!
"Pretty much everything you can imagine is on that list of things that we would consider. And that's all the way from almost pre-historic, all the way through to futuristic.",
Mike Simpson, on possible Total War settings
"It probably would," he rebounded, "but that's not really what we're about. So, that one falls off.
"I guess we aspire, in the long run, to visiting every area that fits the Total War ethos: anything that's an interesting period from a historical point of view; has lots of factions vying for control and any of them could have won; and has a period of technological change that drives a tech tree. Those are the three components that we require, and there are still many, many periods of history that satisfy that, that we haven't visited yet."
Creative Assembly is owned by Sega, as are game rights to the Alien franchise. Has something off-the-wall like Alien: Total War ever been talked about?
"Like I said, we think about all sorts of things," Simpson surprised us, "but that's probably closer to the dinosaurs end of scale rather than what we actually do.
"You'd be surprised at some of the things that have been seriously considered!"
Winds of change in the next five years
Creative Assembly talked about its 25-year history at Rezzed, but we can't show you our recording because it had pre-pre-alpha gameplay footage of Rome 2, which the studio's understandably not ready to share with the internet. Beyond the core Total War games and their expansions, Creative Assembly has made console spin-offs Spartan: Total Warrior and Viking: Battle for Asgard. So, there's been a console presence at Horsham HQ for years, and it lives on with the Alien project. Stormrise, incidentally, was Creative Assembly Australia game. That studio became Sega Studios Australia and made the London Olympics game.
Rome 2 is scheduled for late 2013, probably autumn. The Alien game doesn't have a release date. There's also a small mobile team at Creative Assembly that made Total War Battles. Consider those three teams, and the next five years looks fairly well mapped out for Creative Assembly - maybe Rome 2 expansion pack fits that time-frame.
But when we asked Mike Simpson about where Creative Assembly will be in five years, he suggested there were more things afoot.
The well-received Total War: Battles. Expect more from CA's mobile team.
"We'll have a whole bunch of new games out there; we will have explored lots of areas we've not been in before, especially from a gameplay point of view and content point of view; we might have expanded out in some interesting directions."
Mike Simpson, on the next five years
"That's another five years, which isn't actually that long. We'll have a whole bunch of new games out there; we will have explored lots of areas we've not been in before, especially from a gameplay point of view and content point of view; we might have expanded out in some interesting directions," Simpson said.
Does that mean Creative Assembly has more games than Rome 2, than Alien, than another mobile game?
"Not that we've announced yet, no," Simpson deflected.
What are the areas Simpson talked about exploring?
"I'm just saying that the industry's changing quite a lot, and there are all sorts of interesting things happening, and we're part of that," he answered.
"The next five years are going to be quite interesting."
Total War mobile
Total War Battles was "great", Eurogamer declared, and Creative Assembly was "very happy" with how it went down.
"It certainly sold well," Simpson said, "and it isn't finished selling yet, which is one of the things about games on these platforms - if you make a good game, it'll be around for a very long time.
"That's one of the features of Total War: the games just keep selling for years and years. We still sell - most of the games on the back catalogue are still available to buy.
The Total War Battles game used the Shogun 2 setting. Does that mean there will be a Battles game based on Rome 2?
"We haven't made a decision yet on what we do next with that team," Simpson said, "but we will do something."
For now, the plan is to keep supporting Total War Battles, and to push it out onto Android and other platforms. In "theory", those other platforms could include PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade, "but it's not something we're currently doing".
Live action Total War: Rome 2! It's all we're allowed to show you for the moment.A Delhi court on Thursday directed police to file a report on last week's midnight raid allegedly led by Law Minister Somnath Bharti in South Delhi after a second African woman filed a plea seeking registration of FIR.
Metropolitan Magistrate Chetna Singh asked Deputy Commissioner of Police, South, to file the report on the probe carried out by the agency in the incident of January 15-16 in which three other foreign women are also reportedly victims.
"The DCP, South should file the report by January 25," the court said.
The African woman approached the court for lodging of separate FIR in relation to the midnight raid, after another foreign woman last week had sought a similar relief from the court.
Delhi police has already registered a case on January 19 against unknown persons on the first plea.
Three foreign women have till date recorded their statements before a magistrate, in which they have stated that Bharti, the MLA from Malviya Nagar, had barged into their house along with his supporters on the intervening night of January 15-16.
The woman, who has filed the latest application through advocate Rakesh Sherawat, has said the group had forcibly held her hands and took her out of the house along with her sisters who live with her.
"They (the group) continuously abused and misbehaved with her (complainant) and her sisters and directed them to leave India immediately," Sherawat claimed in the court, adding "while watching television she identified those persons who had trespassed, assaulted, misbehaved and molested them on the aforesaid night".
"The complainant came to know through media that the assailants are from Aam Admi Party led by the local MLA of the area," Sherawat said in the court.
Sherawat told the media outside the court that after the application was filed, the court had sought a report from the police, which in its reply has said that the women are the victims of the incident.
In the earlier application filed before the court, the foreign national had alleged that she and the other women were subjected to a cavity search during their medical examination at AIIMS and that the minister and his people had asked them in public to give urine samples.
On her plea, the court had ordered registration of FIR against unknown persons under sections 451 (house trespass), 427 (mischief), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of IPC.
Television footage on news channels had shown Bharti asking police officers to conduct the raid as he had received complaints of drugs and prostitution racket in that area.

articleWayne Hatswell’s reign at the Daniels got off to the perfect start yesterday with a victory away from home against one of Stamford’s main promotion rivals.
Stamford recovered from an early setback at Gresley to win 3-1 with Jake Gibson equalising after 36 minutes and Ricky Miller adding two more to his impressive tally with a goal late in each half.

Ricky Miller puts Stamford ahead at Gresley Photo: Geoff Atton
With just one out-and-out striker available, Hatswell was forced to field an unfamiliar 4-5-1 formation and the omens didn’t look good early on. Stamford looked nervous and Richard Hanslow capitalised to give the hosts the lead after just five minutes, following up after Matt Finlay had blocked Marc Strzyzewski’s header.
Gresley had the lion’s share of the early possession with Jordan Nadat’s speed a danger on the wing, and Hanslow’s movement a constant threat. The Gresley striker had the ball in the Stamford net a second time only for a marginal offside call to come to Stamford’s rescue.
Danny Holmes had Stamford keeper Matt Finlay scurrying anxiously to his right as the midifielder’s 35 yard drive fizzed past his right hand post just shy of the half hour and still Stamford hadn’t created a clear-cut chance.
But with seven minutes of the half remaining, the Daniels broke quickly with Miller playing the ball to Andy Hall in an advanced central position and he slipped the ball left to an on-rushing Jake Gibson who slipped the ball low to the right of former Stamford man Gary Hateley in the Gresley goal.
Stamford completed the turnaround just five minutes later when Miller capitalised on half a yard of space inside the Gresley box to drive the ball low into the net for a half-time lead.
After the break Stamford defended in numbers and although Gresley enjoyed territorial advantage they rarely looked like breaking down Stamford’s resolute defence.
Stamford looked the more threatening of the two sides when they did go forward and they could easily have added to their tally sooner than they did.
Jack McGovern’s cross on the break eluded Gibson, Hall and Miller when the slightest touch from any of the trio would have done, and not long afterwards Gibson fired wide when he should have at least forced a save. Miller finally sealed the results, cutting in from the left before rifling past Hately from close range for his second and Stamford’s third.
The result lifted The Daniels above Sutton Coldfield into second spot in the Evo-Stik First Division South. Gresley drop to sixth.
Stamford’s next match is against Leek Town at Kettering Road on Saturday.
Stamford: Matt Finlay, Michael Jacklin, Adam Hewitt, Tom Batchelor, Richard Jones, Jack McGovern, Jake Gibson (Louis Hamilton), Danny Brooks (Jack Cotton)), Andy Hall (Dan Marshall), Ricky Miller, James Ozmen. Subs: David Staff, John Swales.

Hi,
I tried to add a couple photos to this group today via "My Group Images> Non Group Images" tab
Here is the RED warning I got:
This group only allows 2 image additions per day. You have added 0 images within the past 24 hours and are now trying to add 2 more. Please wait 24 hours before trying to add new images.
As you see from the text above I added ZERO within past 24 hrs and still can't add 2 ones which are within group limits...
That's a weird situation.

People are still adding more than 2 a day to my group and I just delete them, I'm gonna change the limit to one a day now
Posted by: Ausra Paulauskaite on 2 Years Ago
Tracy, it won't change the attitude of some people who do not respect hosts. Sadly. And, of course, some are doing that NOT on purpose. Some are more used to 3 a day limit, or simply forget.
The problem about too many images is being discussed in one of FAA forums now. There is a glich in new limit system which they are trying to fix, and disrespectful people are trying to use while it's available.
By the way, THANKS for taking this group over. That's brave of you :-) This group has such a wide subject and so many images. I bet it's hard to manage.

I tried to resubmit images one by one. The first was sent to pending folder. I'm not adding the second since you want to change a limit to 1.

Someone said on Twitter today, “Thanks Blizz, for making me feel the way I did when I logged in for the first time all those years ago.” That’s exactly how it was for me. I can hardly wait to explore the rest of the world, too.
I did enjoy the post, very much. Yes, kudos to Blizzard for doing a really nice job in breathing even more vibrant life and emtion into the world, but kudos to you as well for bringing… well, yourself and being inspiring. It’s really nice to read the thoughts of someone so positive and excited. It brings me part of the way up right there beside you. :)
Plus, I didn’t know about Withers… I’ve been running in a spoiler free zone.
Thank y’all for the recommendation. Ran Darkshore today and it was excellent.
I’ll plug the new Azshara–the hubby and I took some troll newbies through it and just about died laughing (one little set of quests particularly, which I will not not not spoil).
I really was impressed with the patch roll out. Hats off to Blizzard on this one. After 4.0.1 I was cringing at the thought of playing last night. I didn’t see many of the new areas mostly the major cities but I did not have a single problem last night either. :)
I have to agree – the patch went very well. Everything was super smooth, and the world (from what I’ve seen so far) looks great. I’m excited about checking more things out, and starting on the thousands of new quests.
I haven’t seen as much as I would like, because I’ve been sort of busy playing entrepreneur on the AH. :P But this patch launch gives me higher hopes for the Cataclysm launch: perhaps my computer won’t be choking to death from lag (and I won’t be yelling at it constantly) for the first week of the expansion! :)
I opened up my achievements menu and under loremaster I find that each area now has a #of quests to be done. I’m soo happy I got mine done when I did. As for everything else I like what they did, makes the game new again :)
I might even do it on my big old bear butt, now that I have some way of figuring out where I left off back 5 years ago.
I think Blizzard heard your call BBB.
I fired up a new ten day trial just to see some new starting areas. The Tauren and Troll starting areas are great so far. The Tauren really are having a rough time, and it hits some poignant notes, especially in parallel with their Native American inspiration. I could blather at length about the game design, but what really struck me is the storytelling. Citizen Kane, maybe not, but it’s Blizzard putting a good foot forward.
I thought about it long and hard and Clapus will always be a Tauren Druid, broken horn and all. My wife played him for a week while I was at work. She never noticed the broken horn right away. She called me one evening to tell me she broke his horn fighting some monster. I told her she had to get her own account if she was going to break my Taurens.
I’m glad they managed to fix some issues this patch – the last one broke half my game after all.
The shattering on the other hand has been nothing but fun so far (and you really wanna get alll the other pets too btw!). =)
Loaded my 22 shammy in thunderbluff and ran all the way to Ratchet then flew to Og. Stunning way to explore the new Barrens as we actually had to pay attention and not stride god like through as our 80’s. Had an absolute blast and took our time. I’ve never taken over an hour to do that trip before! So much to see and explore in our new sandpit.Today, Google announced Google TV. This is not to be confused with Google Radio, or Google Automotive. Apple doesn't have radio or automotive yet, so far as we know; neither does Google....today. If Apple was going to be inside the Chevy Volt, it would be a guarded secret and the prototypes would be lost in parking lots.
Why would we like Google TV? Well, first there's Google's deep experience in the explosive growth of GooTube, I mean YouTube. I love YouTube. I've seen more has-been rock stars and neat videos than in any place but my local library. It's fascinating. Old TV shows that I'd love to see? Plenty of them, even though I don't watch TV much, and currently, The Office and 30 Rock is on in the living room--- and I'm NOT there. Thankfully.
Yes, there are episodes of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Get Smart, and a bunch of shows I remember from my youth that will be fun to watch. I'll watch them when I've retired and am in a wheelchair in the nursing home. I already have all the DVDs of Monty Python, most of the Star Wars episodes, so I'm fixed, thank you. For a while, I was a director of a PBS affiliate, and love PBS shows. Those can wait, too. I know others will positively love the possibilities. Already I have emails asking me where to sign up.
Obstacle 1: There's competition that's already somewhat mature.
But wait. There's Boxee. Hulu is pretty darn cool, too. What does Google add to what's already out there? There are rumors and what Google's stated, which isn't a whole lot. And now that they've announced this intention, they've also painted a big red X that will be the easy crosshairs for other organizations to compare themselves to.
Yes, Google has comparatively infinite experience with videos, if they're less than eleven minutes long. Yes, Google knows a lot about the client side, in terms of how Chrome has been working. Add YouTube to Chrome control, and there's a new reason to make a connection between your PC or Mac and your new-ish HD TV. Or not.
Obstacle 2: Competition for your eyeballs increasing each hour.
Andy Grove, the wisened paranoid guy behind the success of Intel once said that the battle is "two eyes and twenty-four hours". He was right. Google TV must not only compete against current offerings, and those from its brighter competitors, but it, too, just like PBS, has the battle of 2-i's and 24hrs. That's all we have. Will we do picture-in-picture with Facebook and Google TV? I'm not sure. I'm still getting my mind around all of this.
Obstacles 3 and 4: Apple will try to kill it. So will Comcast and carriers.
Who would love to kill it? Everyone. Take Comcast and their soon to be acquired NBC broadcast network, and their new on-demand services. Apple will undoubtedly find a way to compete with it. Every carrier that has even the first misgiving about net-neutrality will also jump on the bandwagon. Already Comcast has put new download caps on user systems where I live. I wonder if the cap will include NBC and Comcast's demand services. Microsoft has failed in a TV connection. Set top box makers are also unhappy. You can add to the list consumers with already sagging broadband lines. Imagine three teenagers trying to do Google TV while they do homework. Or the sag in the already stanched bandwidth at airport WiFi access points. Would you sit through commercials-- and video buffering episodes?
Some of these problems would have an effect on any TV-over-broadband providers. That's one part of Apple's cleverness, being captive to a carrier that they can essentially control, as bad as they might be (yes, you, AT&T). Google would have an international appeal, however. It's a big market out there across the planet. Google already knows about the problems via YouTube in terms of localizing and media latency issues. If this becomes popular, latency issues will be exacerbated. Does your GoogleVoice call go thru, or does the video? Do we get to pick?
Obstacle 5: Google itself.
Google also handily competes against itself. It's said that YouTube doesn't make much money, and is likely a money pit. If people (remember 2i's/24hrs?) start to watch ad-supported video, then the drain of resources undertaken with YouTube go down. Google also gets to capture one more piece of your turf.
And Google has turf. Yes they have market capitalization and yes they have smart people. Will they be able to make this reliable and not embarrassing as other Google products have occasionally been? Can they sustain the effort it takes to take on iTunes and RealNetworks, not to mention Amazon, Hulu, and others? Will the product be first rate, or will we have to wait for generations and betas before we really like Google TV? It's unknown. Check back in a year.Arpi Chakurian (1946 - 2009)

Over the generations there has been nothing tougher in South Canterbury senior rugby than heading out to Temuka to take on the Magpies.
This weekend marks the 50th anniversary of one of their best sides, the champion 1964 team.
Under the guidance of coaches Leo Brosnahan and Ray Nolan and with captain Phil Ryan always leading from the front, the side dominated the club scene.
With no finals format back then, Temuka finished the year champions, winning 13 games, drawing 1 and losing 4.
The Magpies scored 340 points with 181 against and collected the Skinner Cup, Beri Cup and Collogan Cup.
But 1964 was just a taste of what was to follow - the next four seasons produced a similar results. The side grew in strength, season by season, to win the competition five years in succession.
A coaching change in 1966, to Mick Kerr and Dick Comer, did not disrupt the run.
Reunion organiser Lindsay Parke said that in those days a ruck was a ruck and the odd back who found himself caught up in one learned that the hard way. The ruck was also a good way to "educate" a cheeky halfback, he said.
There were no replacements - except for injury - so substitution was only a word in the dictionary.
Parke said the club timed the event to coincide with the Temuka and Pleasant Point game on the oval.
Ironically, back in 1964 Pleasant Point were not playing in the senior competition, which was definitely to Temuka's benefit.
The club's senior side featured some prominent players, most notably the Ryans. There were four in the 1964 team - brothers Phil (the captain), Stephen and Quentin along with cousin Frank.
For five years on the trot Temuka were winners of the Skinner Cup, the Jack Dunne Memorial Cup, the Beri and Collogan cups as well as the Ian Pearce Memorial Trophy.
During that time the Magpies won 68 games, losing 13 and drawing three.
For a couple of years in that period Temuka were also the Geraldine and Waimate 7-aside tournaments champions.
Many Temuka players represented South Canterbury, and two players went on to higher honours in being selected for the Combined team - Phil Ryan captained the side with halfback Alex Millar also included. Ryan also played against the 1966 British Lions team in Timaru.
Hooker Tane Norton moved north after playing three seasons from 1964.
He famously went on to represent Canterbury and captain the All Blacks in 1977 to victory over the Lions. He was capped 61 times for New Zealand including 27 tests.
Parke said that for some reason Norton could not make the South Canterbury team, even in one year when three hookers were used.
Dick Sharpe went on to play more than 100 games for South Canterbury.
Parke said the 1964 Magpies featured a number of characters.
"Lock Peter Slee was a good footballer but he was always a character and still is."
There was also a front-row club, including Merv McDowell and Norton, that no-one crossed.
Parke said the five years of supremacy not only generated a huge camaraderie and team spirit but was also a very rewarding period for the Temuka club.
"Those five years also laid the foundation stone for the next three and half decades, when the club's strength grew into a major force in South Canterbury rugby.
"Ironically it was two players from the 1964-68 era who coached the start of the Magpies' seven-year consecutive reign in the late 70s and early 80s."

Strategies to Prevent Staphylococcal Infections
Hand Washing is the Single Most Important Behavior in Preventing Infectious Disease
The proper way to wash your hands:
- Use warm water.
- Wet your hands and wrists.
- Using a bar or liquid soap.
- Work soap into a lather and wash between fingers, up to wrists, and under fingernails for at least 15 seconds.
- Dry, using a clean cloth towel or paper towel.
- Use alcohol-based hand sanitizers to wash hands immediately if they come in contact with any body fluid at the playing field or other places where hand-washing facilities are not available.
Wash your hands as described above:
- After sneezing, blowing, or touching your nose.
- Before and after close contact or using the toilet.
- Before leaving the athletic area.
Other Precautions
- Keep your hands away from your nose and groin.
- Do not share towels, soap, lotion or other personal care items, even on the sidelines at games.
- Shower with soap and water as soon as possible after direct contact sports 4. Dry using a clean, dry towel.
- Use a moisturizing lotion to prevent dry, cracked skin.
- Prewash or rinse with plain water items that have been grossly contaminated with body fluids.
- Wash your towels, uniforms, scrimmage shirts, and any other laundry in hot water and ordinary detergent and dry on the hottest possible cycle.
- Inform your parents of these precautions if laundry is sent home.
-.
- Take all medication even after the infection seems to have healed.
- If a topical ointment is prescribed, apply as directed.
- Follow all other directions the physician/practitioner gives you.
- Inform the physician/practitioner if you are not responding to treatment.
How to Take Care of Wounds at Home
- Avoid direct contact with others until the wound is no longer draining and you have been instructed by your physician to resume your usual activities.
- Wash your hands frequently, especially before and after changing band-aids, bandages, or wound dressings.
- Keep the wound covered. The dressing must be changed at least twice a day; or, more frequently, if drainage is apparent.
- All disposable materials that come into contact with the wound (including dressings or bandages) need to be placed in a separate plastic bag and closed before being disposed of in the household trash. Wash your hands after removing and disposing of the soiled dressing.
- Use isopropyl alcohol (available at pharmacies or grocery stores) to disinfect reusable materials, such as scissors or tweezers after each use.
-.
- Have a designated chair or area for sitting. It should have a hard surface or an easily cleaned plastic or similar cover for easy disinfection. No one else should sit there until the wound has healed completely.
- Utensils and dishes should be washed in the usual manner with soap and hot water or using a standard home dishwasher.
- Carry laundry away from the body in a plastic or other lined bag that will not allow wet articles to drain through.
- Handle and launder all clothing, towels, and linens that come in contact with the wound separately from those of other members of the household. Use a separate hamper.
- Articles that come in contact with the wound should be washed in hot water with the usual detergent.
- Dry clothes thoroughly using the hottest setting.
- Towels and linens should be changed daily.
- Do not share ointments or antibiotics.
How to Take Care of Wounds at School
- Follow any instructions that your athletic trainer, coach, or school nurse give you regarding direct contact with other persons at school.
- Carry and use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available.
- Wash hands immediately after contact with the wound.

Foreclosures will be a factor impacting home values in the next several years.

iTunes rip off to launch English version in blow to developers
Installous. It claims to offer Chinese fanbois who are “not very familiar with the iTunes system and how to effectively manage it”, a safe and secure alternative.
In effect, this means providing one-click access to thousands of free apps and in so doing depriving hard-working devs and Apple of not insignificant sums of money.
As spotted by TechInAsia, the service will add an English version of its iTunes rip-off store for Windows “soon”, creating all sorts of possibilities for fanbois unfamiliar with chinese script.
In a statement on the site, Kuaiyong had the following:
Kuaiyong offers detailed descriptions of apps, free app download trial, IOS device management and visual and audio file backup system. IOS system backup and recovery features will also be released in the very near future.
The statement goes on to claim rather dubiously that Kuaiyong has managed to reduce the number of jailbroken devices in China from 60 per cent to 30 per cent in the short time it’s been up and running.
Apple representatives in China couldn’t immediately be reached for comment on the news, although it can’t be long before Cupertino aims its legal cannons in the direction of Kuaiyong.
Things are already pretty bad in the region, according to a report last year from Shanghai analyst Stenvall Skoeld. It claimed that high piracy rates mean App Store revenues in China account for just three per cent of the global total but 18 per cent of worldwide downloads.
The iPhone-maker has been both victim and perpetrator when it comes to copyright violation in China.
It received a 1.03m yuan (£102,000) fine from a Beijing court last month after being accused of violating local copyright laws by failing to remove apps containing unlicensed content from its App Store. ®

To the Editor:
Margaret Drye’s self-righteous and intellectually dishonest sentiments are more convenient than they are factual (“Let Us Confront What We’ve Lost,” Sunday Valley News, Jan. 20). Supporters of reproductive rights — including, yes, abortion rights — are well aware how significant is one’s choice to terminate a pregnancy, all the more so because they are often the ones in the trenches, supporting the women making that choice. The mission of pro-choice organizations is first to prevent unwanted pregnancies (Planned Parenthood provides 11 times more contraception services than it does abortion services), arguably doing more to prevent abortions than any “pro-life” organization in operation today. Meanwhile, while there are some women who suffer long-term physical and emotional effects after terminating a pregnancy, study after study since 1987 has shown these cases to be anecdotal and far outside the norm.
So, there have been 50 million abortions since Roe v. Wade in 1973. That’s millions of women who were able to finish their education, providing a more secure life for their future children; women who were able to leave an abusive partner; women who were able to continue taking necessary medication they otherwise couldn’t during pregnancy; women who spared either themselves or their unborn child from certain painful death after birth; women who could continue working and continue being able to feed children already at home.
Children aren’t born in a vacuum. They are born into circumstances, sometimes more complicated and heartbreaking than we can imagine. Celebrating Roe v. Wade isn’t celebrating abortion. It’s celebrating the freedom women now have to take careful consideration of their own circumstances and make choices that, while difficult, may ultimately save their own lives. Meanwhile, may I remind Drye that today — now — there are 16 million children in this country who have to worry about getting adequate nutrition. If she wants to focus on “lost potential,” how about starting with the already-born?

COLUMBUS, Miss. (WCBI) – Watching destruction as it happens. That’s what state-of-the art technology allow us to do. Not only can you see the storm develop, but we can also see the damage the storm is doing in real time.
During the April 28th, tornado outbreak, our team of meteorologists said terms like “debris” and “debris ball” more often than ever before. That’s because we’re now able to detect such things with dual pole radar or what we call, our Live Vipir Radar. Technically we show what’s called a correlation coefficient. Simply stated, it’s showing debris flying in the air. Depending on the height in which the dual pole radar is detecting debris, a TDS will populate. A TDS is a tornado detection signature.
While we’ve been able to pick up on debris based on radar alone for many many years, it’s never been identified as a TDS or a debris ball until 2011.
Steve Wilkinson is the Warning Coordination Meteorologist at the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Jackson, Mississippi.
“We’ve researched tornadoes around the country that shows the height of the debris, and we were getting up well into the 25,000 to 35,000 ft. range on the Louisville storm. That told us that it was a violent tornado. At that point, we issued a Tornado Emergency,” said Wilkinson.
A tornado emergency is issued on average once a year in central Mississippi. Because of the debris ball technology, the National Weather Service (NWS) in Jackson would have issued the tornado emergency based on the debris signature alone.
A tornado detection signature also helps survey teams at the NWS determine where a tornado potentially touched down.
“Even if we don’t get reports, we know there was a tornado there and we can go and sure enough you drive underneath it, go around the corner right underneath it and there’s your trees down you’re damaged house,” Said Wilkinson.
During the 28th tornado outbreak, when we identified debris with our Dual Pole Live Vipir Radar, more than 85% of the time a tornado was confirmed.The term SEO has gained wide spread recognition over the last 18 months by zealous marketers looking to make money on the rise of Search Engine usage. But as we talk to small business owners about Search Engine Optimization, we are finding many mis-informed consumers. So in order to answer the question, “What is Search Engine Optimization or SEO?” we need to clarify a few terms used by Search Engine Marketing companies. By clarifying the following terms we can start to answer the question posed in this article.
Google’s spider and algorithm
Google’s spider and algorithm is setting the bar for all search engines and directory sites to follow. Google’s spider is a computer program that searches, reads, and indexes everything on the internet. The spider goes to your web page, reads the information there, and clicks on every link on your website, it then reads the information on those pages, and clicks on every link on those pages, and so on. After reading all the information on your site, Google indexes your site in their database. This is where the Algorythym comes into play. Google’s algorithm is their complex process of comparing information they’ve gathered about your company, and determining how to list you in the Google Search Results. Google’s algorithm is kept secret, to protect against competition using it, and to keep spammers from manipulating the search results. One thing we know about Google algorithm is that it is always changing.
Search Engine Marketing or SEM
Search Engine Marketing or SEM is most commonly used to describe a paid online advertising strategy. Examples of Search engine marketing would be hiring a company to do one of the following; Manage your Pay Per Click Advertising, Manage Targeted online ad placement, create and manage Organic SEO strategies, create and manage Local SEO strategies, and/or other general online advertising efforts that get you listed on the first page of major search engines.
Search Engine Placement or SEP
Search Engine Placement or SEP is most commonly used to describe Paid placement on major search engines. The “Sponsored Links” section of the Search Engine’s results page, is where Search Engine Placement companies provide exposure to their clients. The advantage to SEP over SEO is; SEP is the quickest way to get listed on the first page of Major Search engines for any keyword phrase (no matter how competitive that keyword phrase is). This is accomplished by paying more than your competition for clicks.
For example: Let say the keyword phrase “Roofing Contractor” has all (11) sponsored link slots filled up. To get listed as the 1st link in the sponsored links section, you only have to pay more than the current #1 is willing to pay… & within 48 hours your listing is on top of page 1.
The disadvantage to SEP is you are only listed as long as you are paying to be listed. Also, studies are showing that about 1/3 of traffic on Google’s search page is clicking on a “Sponsored Link”, which means by far the majority of people searching on Google are clicking on Organic and Local Search Listings.
Organic Search Engine Optimization or Organic SEO
Organic Search Engine Optimization or Organic SEO is most commonly used to describe efforts to create multiple sources of content for Search Engine Spiders to read that helps boost a company’s listing in the search results.
Google Organic Search Results are based on information collected by the Google spider, and indexed according to the parameters of the Google Search algorithm.
SEO providers have the job of Identifying what content is considered most relevant to the Google Algorithm. Because SEO providers have to learn their craft through trial and error, it is wise to choose an SEO company that can prove their methods work for your business type. Some examples of different types of SEO strategies:
- Social Media Marketing & blogging
- Video Marketing
- Article writing
- Press Release and Media outlet submission
- industry website linking
- Onsite Optimization (making changes to the content on your website)
- Valid html in a CSS tabless design (making changes to the html code, “Validated html”)
Local Search Engine Optimization or Local SEO
Local Search Engine Optimization or Local SEO is most commonly used to describe efforts to create content for the Search Engine Spider to read that helps boost a company’s listing in the local search results.
Local Search results is one of the newest developments to hit the Internet, emerging over the last 24 months. Local Search has been widely adopted by people all over the united states, mainly because you don’t have to be in front of a computer to use it. When you search on your mobile phone, or use your GPS navigation system, or even call 411 for information you are tapping into Local search results.
The largest and most used provider of Local Search results is Google. When you search on Google and type in the name of a city or city/state combination Google recognizes you are looking for something in a “Local Area”. The search results page is tailored to your local area. The 1st organic listing is a Map with the “top 8 local Listings” in your area matching your keyword phrase. below those “top 8 Local Listings”, you’ll find the Organic Search Results (top 10 Organic listings).
So… “What is Search Engine Optimization or SEO?”
When you ask nuResponse that question we’ll tell you it depends on your company, and how you use the Internet to acquire new customers. SEO is all about acquiring new customers, subscribers, and/or followers. At nuResponse we help business owners grow sales and cut costs through our website tools and Search engine marketing strategies. Our target client requires a mix of Local SEO and Organic SEO. When we’re done, our client is properly indexed in the major search engines, online directories, social media sites, GPS navigation systems, & 411 services.

Good information, umpteen thanks to the author. It is inexplicable to me now, but in general, the usefulness and significance is strong. Thanks again and good luck!
Good post mate!! Keep ‘em flowing!
If only there was more time in the day.
This is a really good read for me, Must admit that you are one of the best bloggers I ever saw.Thanks for posting this informative article.
Thanks!
Great Post on this Blog…
I saw this really good post today….
Thank you for your help!
The posts here are great. I learn alot reading other sites about Google Adsense! It’s such an exciting topic. Thanks again for a very educational site!
Google needs definitely to seriously revamp the way search engine work. Otherwise… it will just spacing out room for fakes to sell valueless merchandise.
Interesting assessment. Of all the search engines it seems that Google is doing the best job of weeding out the spammers or “Fakes” as you call them. Allowing companies that use true white hat SEO tactics to slowly but surely rise to the top!… And once the legitimate companies are getting to the top, they seem to be staying, which is making the search results better.
Hey this is some good info. Keep up a good work.
Awesome post! You have a great blog, absolutely the best Ive read so far. I will be looking forward to your next entry. Thanks again.
Online marketing is not merely for the latest product, making a website or for letting customers buy items online. Online marketing can also include how a business owner can employ a work team. The measure of people who are studying computers, web design, and learning to host websites proves just how productive online marketing can make the employer, the employees, and the independent contractors. And with a comfortable Internet savvy team, your business profits can increase too.
The SEO industry has changed alot over the past few months, what used to work before, stopped working. You obviously know what the deal is, but I can’t wait to see the changes of Google in the next few months.
Really excellent information on SEO! Appreciated.Thanks a lot and best wishes from Rome!
Thanks for this post. I am always looking for more information on this, and your input has been very helpful.
No Press Releases!? What’s with you man!
Jason,
Yes, Press releases are a very effective way of generating quality 1 way links for a website. Thanks for the reprimand!
Howdy I was just strolling through cyberspace, looking for some entertaining sites to browse and found.
The SEO industry has been developing some best practices lately, but the Search engines are constantly changing to insure that the search results can’t be falsely manipulated.
There is so much information here! I’m trying to remember all of it so I can put it to work.
Good Luck Katie. This article really only scratches the surface.
Thanks you for writting this article. It is enjoyable reading.

Thanks for the comment. I agree that SEO is for small business. Especially with Local Search, Mobile Search, GPS, & 411… now being aggregated across platforms instead of just single websites. This makes it affordable for small and local business owners.
Hi there! I found your blog via Google while searching about SEO.And your post looks very interesting and informative to me.It's the eternal stoner dilemma... what to do about that smell when straights are coming over?
Of course, we're talking about the odor of marijuana. Whether it's that wonderful skunky fresh-bud scent or the sweet smell of burning cannabis, it's sometimes hard to remember that not everyone shares our enthusiasm for the essence of hemp.
Covering up the smell of our favorite herb sometimes becomes a necessity, whether it's because of potential law enforcement encounters, that roommate or spouse who doesn't toke, nosy neighbors, or just the folks coming over for the holidays.
For those times, one good solution is Blunt Block Incense Spray. You won't break the bank since Blunt Block is only $4.99 a bottle, and it's very effective.
In fact, the manufacturer recommends that when you first try Blunt Block, you spray just a small amount... it's that strong.
I tried this stuff in the most challenging conditions imaginable, also known as my house, and it actually does do wonders in getting rid of the smell of marijuana.
Just one spray neutralizes the smoke smell, and pretty soon the whole room smells like one of the dozen fragrances available.
Blunt Block comes in Cherry Vanilla, Coconut, Jasmine, Lemon, Mango, Mulberry, Peach, Pineapple, Rose, Strawberry, Tangerine, and Honeysuckle.
Lemon's on sale right now for just $4.20, so you may want to give its citrusy freshness a try first. I rather like Tangerine, as well.
Or if you just can't make up your mind, or you own a head shop, and/or you smoke a shitload of weed, you can order the Display Case with all 12 flavors at a discounted price of $49.99.
To order Blunt Block Incense Spray online, visit BluntBlock.com. You can also email sales@bluntblock.com.
BluntBlock Incense Spray is made in America.

What can be done to correct damage or compression? Is there any way to definitely tell what is causing these late onset symptoms ie nerve compression or scar formation. Any type of imaging or diagnostic test?
Can Damage or Compression of the Great Auricular Nerve Cause Tightness/Numbness Post Surgery?
Doctor Answers 14
Can Damage or Compression of the Great Auricular Nerve Cause Tightness/Numbness Post Surgery?
Compression, injury or severing the Greater Auricular nerve during a Face Lift or Neck Lift will give numbess to the ear lobe and a small area, of the neck, just below the ear lobe(s). This is a sensory, not a motor nerve and there's no treatment if the nerve is damaged. If damaged, the nerve can regenerate at 1mm per day and could return some function within 12 months IMO. This nerve can be quite superficial, in the neck tissues and one of the reasons patients should seek experienced Face Lift surgeons.

Numbness=Damage of Greater Auricular Nerve?
Web reference:
Numbness May Be Related To Swelling, Healing or Scar Formation
Under these circumstances, your tightness and numbness are probably related to swelling, wound healing and scar formation. For this reason it’s important to consult your plastic surgeon. Your surgeon can hopefully determine the cause of your symptoms and institute appropriate treatment.

Web reference:
Numbness or Tightness 7 Months after Facelift
The great auricular nerve provides sensation to the earlobe and the numbness would be noticed after surgery and should not arise 7 months later. I would recommend an exam by your plastic surgeon. Kenneth Hughes, MD Los Angeles, CA
Web reference:
The greater auricular nerve is a sensory nerve that supplies sensation around the earlobe and the jawline area.
The greater auricular nerve is a sensory nerve that supplies sensation around the earlobe and the jawline area. Injury to this nerve would manifest immediately after the surgery in the form of loss of sensation in these areas.
So, your delayed symptoms are not likely to be related to an injury to this nerve. Instead, these symptoms may well be related to wound-healing and scar maturation which typically does occur several months after the surgery. Gentle massage, lymphatic massage or ultrasound therapy may be helpful in improving the feeling of tightness. Any numbness that you are feeling may well have been present earlier after the surgery but not been as noticeable to you at that time.
Tightness/Numbness 7 mo Post Surgery
Injury to the GAN typically manifests immediately after surgery, not months after. There is no imaging that can detect the problem and no treatment that can make the nerve regenerate faster, but sensory nerves do continue to regenerate for years after the injury
Facelift and greater auricular nerve injury
The greater auricular nerve can be injured during a facelift. If the nerve is injured the result would be pain and or numbness around the lateral neck and cheek, in the area of the earlobe. However, these symptoms would be present immediately after the surgery. It is highly unlikely that symptoms that began 7 months after a facelift are due to a greater auricular nerve injury from the facelift surgery. I would suggest you see a neurologist and have them evaluate your problem. Good luck.
Web reference:
Numbness after Facelift
You did not specifically state where you have numbness. Greater auricular nerve injury will only affect a portion of the ear and won't cause any numbness on the face. It would also present immediately and either improve or persist over time, but not present months later. You should probably see your plastic surgeon and/or a neurologist to determine the cause.
Dmage to Great Auricular Nerve During Facelift
Injury to the Great Auricular Nerve, located below and behind the ear, can cause numbness and the sensation of tightness in the ear and adjacent skin. If the nerve was injured or cut, only the tissue supplied by this nerve would be affected. However, this would be noticed shortly after surgery, not 7 months later.

Prologue
Looking at Christian I can’t believe he never told me. Told me why I was kidnapped and why I was so important to Luke. I was the solution – I – Sasha. Why didn’t he tell me? Did he want me near him just in case he would soon turn? Was that it? He says he loves me but he has lived for thousands of years, he would obviously be a good liar. Was he in on the plan to abduct me? To use me as his own personal sex slave, making me think he loves me? Because that’s what’s happened, I was all his. Maybe he didn’t know how to share; maybe he just wanted me all to himself.
I stare at him intently as he stares out the window of our small rented cottage, he was checking of course. We were being chased and now I know why – because of me. Not just because Luke wanted me as a sex slave, but because of what was inside of me. And I still hadn’t figured out why Christian was with me, it could be love – or it could be because he wanted me to himself; as his sex slave and as a solution. There was only one way to find out. Picking up the cold metal shotgun from behind the sofa, I aim it at Christians back and cock the gun. You need to find out what he wants, my mind says to myself, before I close my eyes and shoot.
A/N - Okay, sorry if this doesn't make some sense as I haven't edited His Personal Slave yet, as I was going to go more into the plot line! It will unravel itself throughout the book though, so you won't be lossed! Hope you enjoy! & please could you leave some feedback thanks!See how travelers like you rate the airlines for value, comfort, on-time performance, and more.

In a city where many council districts seem to have been pounded together out of random bits, Los Angeles 4th District is right at home. It includes a smattering of the east San Fernando Valley and a bit of bohemian Silver Lake. It has a gangy smidgen of the Rampart area. It has most of opulent Hancock Park and a swath of Hollywood. It contains all of Griffith Park, the citys largest open space. And it has a handy stretch of the Miracle Mile -- the scenic yet problematic commercial area that these days seems to be in both decline and revival.
The 4th District was compiled during the 35-year tenure of the most powerful L.A. council member of all time. It contains scarcely an inch that the late council President John Ferraro didnt put there as he created a district that would re-elect him as long as he lived. Ferraros death in April left City Hall handicappers scratching their heads. The two most plausible candidates were both associated with Ferraro: longtime aide Tom LaBonge and friend and former state Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti.
But voters saw it another way. In a special election on September 11, 17 percent showed up and gave nearly one-third of the vote to LaBonge. Roberti fell by the wayside to make room for labor attorney Beth Garfield, who got 18.6 percent of the votes, to qualify for next Tuesdays runoff.
Garfield is banking on her recent success as a community-college-district board member and president. After all, if the community-college board could be a political springboard for county Supervisor Mike Antonovich and former California governor and present Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, Garfield seems to think it can certainly pop her into a council seat. Former City Controller Rick Tuttle says she deserves part of the credit for the passage of a $1.2 billion bond measure to renovate and build new classrooms.
Her private law practice specializes in labor issues. Says Tuttle: At a time when a lot of people were leaving the labor-law field [for greener pastures], she got into it. She got into politics for the right reasons.
Garfield characterizes herself as an outsider: If you think things in Los Angeles are just fine, just as they are, then vote for LaBonge. If not, vote for me.
Garfield exaggerates the disparity. But the two candidates do flaunt beliefs as different as their schooling (she went to Stanford and the University of Michigan School of Law; LaBonge attended Cal State L.A.). LaBonge, who started working for Ferraro at 21, is virtually the citys foundling: He champions Los Angeles government as the constructive source of neighborhood well-being.
Garfield, on the other hand, demonizes city bureaucracy as the major source of urban woes. Its basically similar to the top-heavy, downtown bureaucracy I found in the college district, she avers.
Well, yes. But then, the government of a city of nearly 4 million probably needs to be more centralized than the administration of nine nominally independent two-year colleges. Garfield does offer strong support for a partnership with developing neighborhood councils. She also stresses the new city charters provision that makes department managers accountable to the Mayors Office, instead of both the mayor and the council. Constituents should not be asking their council members, she says, for stop signs and pothole mending. Rather, Garfield contends, such services ought to be the equal right of every Los Angeles resident.
LaBonge says that he glories in helping constituents get the services due them. He says this is part of a larger duty: I love to empower the people, help them achieve their goals. This city is a good place to be a public servant. Im proud of what I managed to do here.
Julie Butcher, leader of Local 347, which represents most of the citys #unions and supports LaBonge, says that its a mistake to differentiate City Hall from the city itself: Our entire community is the city, she says.
LaBonge asserts that a councilman must intercede on behalf of the residents -- to keep an eye on things, to make sure he knows when services falter or fail and then to restore them.
In parts of the 4th District, those services look weak. Hancock Park housing prices remain high and Museum Row still shines like an urban gem, yet the densely populated areas on the districts eastern fringes still have too much blight and crime. LaBonge acknowledges that residents near the districts northeast boundary complain how bad their neighborhoods look, compared to nearby Burbank. Its not reasonable to blame all this on LaBonge, who worked in the Mayors Office during Dick Riordans last term.
LaBonge, with the support of key city unions -- including police and firefighters -- and the downtown establishment, has led Garfield in fund-raising, with nearly $220,000 by October 6, to Garfields less than $11,000 raised. But Garfield, who has an affluent family, has loaned herself $350,000, plus, according to the Ethics Commission, she received $41,000 from County Federation of Labor locals. (LaBonge got $5,000 from the city firefighters union.)
The self-financed Garfield obviously has the huge edge in media buys -- including the recent TV ad volley in which she tried to offset the Police Protective Leagues LaBonge endorsement by flaunting her backing by the Association of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs -- whose members patrol no part of Los Angeles except community colleges.
Contrary to her first interview with this newspaper, Garfield now opposes the controversial three-day workweek proposed by the LAPDs Police Protective League. (LaBonge supports trying out some form of a compressed workweek.) She also told me she approves the citys living-wage philosophy, but expressed reservations about expanding it in an earlier interview with the Weeklys editorial board. Her endorsement by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (who, as councilwoman, championed the L.A. living wage) may moot out this ambiguity.
Garfields trump-card endorsement by the County Federation of Labor (most of her professional career has been spent representing local unions) upset any hope that this runoff might help to heal the split between the Fed and the citys uniformed unions, which was created by the Hahn-Villaraigosa mayoral campaign.
The latest polls show Garfield behind, but moving up, with 35 percent of prospective voters versus 39 percent for LaBonge. Garfield has nearly doubled her numbers since the primary, while LaBonge has pulled ahead only 7 percent, despite his runner-up endorsements.
Being the standard-bearer of the old guard may not be for LaBonge the asset it was for Big John Ferraro: Even some former Ferraro supporters could feel its time for a serious change. LaBonge has tried to expand Ferraros base by cornering some major environmental endorsements: the Sierra Club and Lewis MacAdams of Friends of the Los Angeles River, who says LaBonge even taught him things about that oppressed stream -- in which LaBonge swam as a child. He even got Tom Bradley interested in saving the river, MacAdams recalls.
But otherwise, LaBonge is part of the old city. And being the most familiar and friendly face on the block may no longer, in an age of urban distrust and transition, be the key to winning close localThe defending National Champion Men’s Basketball team got an early start to their season in Canada. Today they met with the media to discuss their upcoming season and defending the National Championship.
Coach Billy Donovan:
“I think with the trip to Canada, we got a little bit earlier of a start than most. I think coming out of that trip, the level of competition was not great where we were able to get tested much as a basketball team. The thing I thought was good is that we got an opportunity to really give our freshman a lot of experience and a lot of playing time in both of those games. As I mentioned going in to that trip, it was the fact of getting us all back together again, because it had been quite some time since April that we were able to get together collectively as a group with coaches and players working together. The trip was definitely beneficial for our team.
“Really, the last month or so has been dedicated strictly to those guys lifting weights, trying to get better and get in better shape, and then doing some individual workouts and some team workouts. For me, personally, I have been on the road quite a bit. This has been a big recruiting period for us that finished up last Thursday. So, we will be good here on Friday to really get started, focus on the season and get focused on our first basketball game.”Clinical and Applied Paediatric Neuropsychology
CPD Courses- registration is now open for 2014-15 courses
CPD Course 1: Introduction to developmental cognitive neuroscience (Oct 2014)
Also available as a Taster course for delegates considering later diploma/MSc registration
Developmental cognitive neuroscience provides the scientific knowledge underpinning contemporary paediatric neuropsychology practice. In order to study the complex multifaceted development of human cognition and its neural underpinnings it is essential that scientists in traditionally distinct fields integrate their methodologies. Students are introduced to the fundamental principles behind a range of methodologies with examples of cutting-edge research and the potential clinical implications. Students are provided with detailed teaching of human neuroanatomy via lectures and practical classes. If students feel unable to work with human brains in the neuroanatomy class they are free to opt out but it is recommended whenever possible.
TWO COURSES– Special Offer.
Any two CPD/Taster courses are offered as a discounted rate- see application form

This
module describes a range of paediatric neurological disorders as well as the different settings in which neuropsychologists work. Disorders include; epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, non-accidental brain injury, neurovascular disorders, metabolic disorders and hydrocephalus. Professional issues are discussed that are associated with practice is different professional contexts, such as
specialist neuroscience centres, child and adolescent mental health
teams, educational systems and medico-legal work.
The roles and overlaps with multidisciplinary colleagues are described.
Ethical issues and potential dilemmas relevant to neuropsychological
practice are considered.

CPD Course 4: Developmental disorders and neuropsychological profiles (Jan 2015)
Also available as a Taster course for delegates considering later diploma/MSc registration
This module describes how cognition and aetiology are related in a range of developmental disorders. The complexity of studying a brain that is developing abnormally is illustrated by clinical case studies and syndrome profiles. Neuropsychological outcome following interventions in childhood such as neurosurgery are considered. Developmental disorders used to illustrate brain-behaviour relationships include neurological disorders such as epilepsy and Traumatic Brain Injury, neurodevelopmental syndromes such as Autistic Spectrum Disorders, ADHD and dyslexia, and psychiatric problems such as childhood schizophrenia.

CPD Course 6: Assessment of neuropsychological disorders (March 2015)
This module considers the underpinning principles of neuropsychological assessment in children and adolescents and the many variables involved in the administration, interpretation and reporting of neuropsychological assessments. Paediatric neuropsychologists are required to diagnose functions that are at risk of compromise and provide prognosis of outcome after brain injury/disease at different stages of development. Therefore all assessment procedures within this module build on key concepts of normal and abnormal development described in Modules 3 and 4. Workshops are used to review the strengths and weaknesses of various tests used for assessing different components of cognition and behaviour. The importance of interpreting tests within the context of individual cases and describing potential functional implications is highlighted.

Overview
Please read full details below.
Entry Criteria for the CPD Modules 1 - 7
Professionals from all backgrounds interested in topics in paediatric neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience are welcome to register as CPD delegates. CPD delegates attend the lectures and enjoy electronic access to the course materials but do not sit any examinations.
Entry Criteria for Taster Modules (for Modules 1 - 4 only)
For modules 1 to 4 it is also possible for some delegates to register as Taster delegates. To register as a Taster delegate you need to be a Clinical or Educational Psychologist registered with the UK Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).
Should delegates consider there is a possibility they may decide to complete the whole professional diploma or MSc at a later stage, as Taster delegates they can ‘bank’ the credits for these modules. Taster delegates who are later accepted onto the degree programme would be exempt from studying these modules again or paying for them twice.
In order to complete the Taster modules successfully, delegates must pass an unseen examination (for Modules 1 and 3) and complete a short piece of coursework (for Modules 2 and 4). The exam lasts for 1½ hours and comprises multiple-choice and short-answer questions.
Important Points to note for Taster applications-
- It is only possible to apply for exemption for Diploma/MSc modules in Clinical Paediatric Neuropsychology at a later stage if you have registered as a UCL Taster student. Registering as a CPD delegate does not permit any future exemptions from the full degree programme.
- A maximum of 3 modules may be taken as a Taster student. Any 3 from modules 1-4 are available.
- No other course, will qualify for any exemption of the UCL Diploma/MSc modules. This is only possible by completing a module from this programme.
- Successful completion of a Taster Module does not guarantee acceptance onto the Diploma/MSc programme at a later stage. Applications have to be made to the degree programme following the standard UCL procedures for post-graduate programmes.
- Applicants for Taster modules are accepted in order of application. Places are limited.
- UCL Taster students can only gain exemption from these modules on the full degree programme providing they have successfully registered on the degree programme within 2 academic years after passing the Taster module.
- Potential UCL Taster candidates should note that whilst they are on ICH premises they will have access to electronic resources, journals, computer rooms and printers and be able to pay for use of the photocopy machines. However, when working off-site, it is currently NOT possible to access electronic journals remotely.

Dr Krzysztof Fijalkowski
MA Curation Unit Tutor
MA Curation at NUA is distinguished by an emphasis on practical curatorial experience. Curation is understood in its broadest and most forward-thinking sense as a process of bringing together objects, still and moving image and/or texts into a coherent whole. The course appeals to a range of applicants, including graduates in Fine Art and Art History and those from non-art backgrounds with an interest in curatorial practices.
NUA has a strong reputation for high quality curatorial practice, having staged the prestigious Eastinternational between 1991-2009. The Gallery at NUA provides a showcase for exhibitions of international contemporary art and design and plays a central role in the MA Curation programme. Recently the Gallery at NUA has showcased work by artists including: Grayson Perry, Gilbert and George, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Damien Hirst, Jeremy Deller and Rachel Whiteread. MA Curation students have the opportunity to curate in the Gallery and in 2013 selected work for their Degree Show from the Arts Council Collection.
The University has strong links with the Tate and Hayward Gallery as well as with galleries in the region. Tutors and industry guests encourage professional understanding as you develop your appreciation of location and audience and the communication of ideas, meaning and information. You will become accustomed to liaising between artists, dealers, galleries and agents as you progress on your curatorial career..
There is a big emphasis on practical work. During the course I curated three shows in independent galleries in London.

For some people, investment activity really complicates annual tax return preparation. In fact, without too much trouble, some people manage to so complicate their tax returns due to their investing, that the investor has no hope of preparing such a return themselves and may need to go to high-priced professional for tax return preparation.
Fortunately, a few simple tricks can greatly simplify the tax accounting related to person's investment activities. And the tricks may allow an investor to prepare his or her return him or herself or at reasonable cost.
Tip #1: Trade in tax-advantaged accounts
If you're going to actively trade (regularly and actively buying stocks and bonds), move that activity to a tax-deferred account such as a self-directed IRA.
Taxable trading creates lots of work on a tax return — including lots of detail on Schedule D (of Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses, and the related Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets. But by moving the trading into tax-deferred account, all of this work evaporates. This approach also eliminates one of the common triggers for IRS correspondence audits: mismatched broker proceeds due to investment activities.
Tip #2: Trade a given security within a single account
If you must trade in a taxable account, be sure to trade any given security (shares in Apple, Inc., for example) only in a single account.
In other words, if you have a Schwab account, an E*Trade account, and a Fidelity account, don't trade shares in Apple across all three accounts. You won't be able to easily apply the wash sale rules if you spread your trading. And you won't be able to avoid having a competent accountant check for wash sales—which will be expensive.
Tip #3: Avoid foreign accounts
Congress has greatly increased the cost of U.S. investors investing money in offshore accounts. Accordingly, you therefore want to avoid these options so you can avoid annually preparing Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets, and Form TD F 90-22.1, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts.
Tip #4: Don't DRIP in a taxable account
Lots of people like to use dividend reinvestment programs, or DRIPs, to grow their investments in dividend paying stocks. Such programs are convenient and add up over time.
However, if you participate in DRIPs inside a taxable account, you create a bunch of work for yourself. You need to carefully track increments on a regular basis over the time you hold the shares and reinvest the dividends so you can someday calculate your gain or loss.
The trick here, then, is to either avoid DRIPs, or use them inside tax-deferred accounts where you don't have to worry about the capital gains calculations.
Tip #5: Understand how partnership accounting works
Before you invest in a partnership be sure you understand how partnership accounting works. Most small investors don't. And as a result, they sometimes get terrible surprises at tax time.
For example, you probably owe any of the states in which an investment partnership operates a nonresident tax return. So be sure you're ready for that.
Another example: None of the complexity of what's going on inside a partnership is hidden. That complexity simply flows through the partnership tax return and then onto the individual partner's tax returns via the partnership Schedule K-1.
Accordingly, if you're investing in oil and gas partnership with depletion allowances or hedge funds with reportable transactions, you want to first make sure you know how to deal with all of this stuff. Or, make sure you're comfortable paying someone else to deal with this stuff.Totnes MP Sarah Wollaston breaks arm in fall on towpath
Posted: January 30, 2014|
TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston (pictured) has broken her arm in a cycling accident.
Dr Wollaston, who will find out later this week if she requires surgery to pin the break, said: "I fell off my bike while training for the 100-mile RideLondon event and this is going to set me back six weeks, which is very annoying, but one of those things."
She said the accident happened on Saturday on a towpath while on her way to watch her daughter compete in a rowing competition on the Thames.
She thanked staff at Charing Cross Hospital, who treated her after the accident, and all those passers-by who stopped to help.
She still hopes to compete in the fundraising event in August.

My wife is 28 and she was diagnosed with MS about a month ago. Her doc got her on Copaxone and I had to pay $2681 for the month supply. Her insurance only covers about %30 of the medicine. She has about a weeks supply left and I have no idea where im going to get that kind of money every month.
This is how fucked up our health care is here in America. After the government takes advantage of us and the money we pay for taxes and spends it in other countries for war, after that the Pharma bends us over and fucks us again for crazy amount of money for medicine.
We live in the Los Angeles area, if anybody has advise on what to do or what kind of insurance we can find please email me.
Thank you

Some have called it a “house of horrors.” Others, a “house of bondage.” And still others simply see it as “The President’s Executive House.”
Which was it?
With Independence Day upon us and memories of George Washington and the Founding Fathers once again in the air, questions about recently unearthed aspects of the President’s House at Sixth and Market streets have become pressing.
Who were the nine slaves reported to have lived in the house with Washington during the period when Philadelphia served as the country’s capital beginning in 1790? What were the circumstances?
A memorial to the house was to have been unveiled on Independence Day. But the concept of a memorial to the house seems to have been a kind of a racial Rorschach test. It appears to have conjured up different images depending on whether it was whites or Blacks viewing it.
It is unclear whether such differences caused the postponement of the July 4 unveiling to sometime in November.
According to one organizer, Michael Coard, the event is on schedule.
“The unveiling of the President’s House/Slavery Memorial project was initially scheduled to take place on July 4, 2010. But the Mayor’s Oversight Committee — of which I’m a member — decided to expand the project in terms of more culturally inclusive interpretations — i.e., necessarily stronger words and images — to complement the previously approved and thoroughly impressive architectural design. Accordingly, the grand opening is now set for early November 2010.”
This year, at the same site to which President George Washington transported nine of his 316 slaves from Virginia, a special “Emancipation Proclamation 2010” ceremony will be held to ceremonially free those nine, none of whom was ever freed by Washington in his lifetime.
Ironically, the location of the slave site is at the site of the new Liberty Bell Center at Sixth and Market.
Controversy has dogged the memorial that is to be laid at the site.
At a raucous public meeting in May, critics denounced one version of the memorial.
Critics at that meeting said the design did not portray the harsh realities of slavery in Philadelphia.
Others complained that a white-owned general contractor was used at the site instead of a non-white firm.
“When we started, we wanted a commemoration for the enslaved,” said Sacaree Rhodes, one of close to 50 who attended, according to a May 8 article in The Philadelphia Inquirer. “We didn’t want no house!”
Originally the edifice, the Robert Morris House, torn down in 1831, was just another house. But the allegations, the lies, the hypocrisies and the myths entangling it seemed to transform it into some kind of House of Seven Gables for some.
The bondage there, rather than the freedom, seemed difficult for some to stomach.
Most of the slaves who lived there during the presidencies of George Washington and John Adams, were Washington’s personal slaves. According to sources, the slaves with the exception of one or two like Hercules were light-skinned “mulattos,” reported to be children of the sexual intermingling of slave and master under still-murky circumstances.
According to historian Charles Blockson, emeritus director of the Afro-American Collection at Temple University, the house may have had as many as two children [not necessarily among the nine]. Some Blacks are claiming to be descendants.
They say George Washington fathered a son with a young slave, Venus, who lived on the estate of his half brother John Augustine Washington.
Three descendants of Venus’s son, who was called West Ford, say that according to a family tradition two centuries old, George Washington was West Ford’s father. They have expressed the hope of developing DNA evidence from descendants of the Washington family and Washington’s hair samples to bolster their case.
Martha Washington was reported to have a number of relatives among slaves at Mount Vernon — though likewise none amid the nine.
One historian, Henry Wiencek, in a 2004 book, claimed that Martha Washington owned her own mulatto half-sister, a slave named Ann Dandridge, who had a child by Martha’s son, John Parke “Jack” Custis.
Such blood connections made it even more difficult to live by simple rules or regulations governing slaves and freemen.
The site has been the witness to the spectacle of champions of freedom like Washington, on one hand, calling for freedom for all mankind while at the same time dispatching agents to enslave Africans who had escaped from bondage at the house.
Hypocrisy apparently was part and parcel of the American republic’s birth and growth.
Thomas Jefferson, well known for his own miscegenation, led the boycott of Haiti after Haitians won their independence from France a few years after the American Revolution. Some say that embargo spread and led to the impoverishment of what was the Black twin of the American Revolution.
At the President’s House, Black freedom was likewise quashed. Washington’s house must not have been a pleasant place for slaves to work, surrounded as it was by prevailing abolitionists’ sentiments as well as a fairly sizable number of free Blacks.
At least two of Washington’s nine slaves who frequented the Philadelphia house made good their escapes. Two others attempted unsuccessfully. For those who escaped, the Fourth of July is an ironic independence celebration — independence from George Washington and his white version of freedom.
For their part the slaves seemed to love their liberty as much as their masters, risking their lives to pursue their freedom to escape.
And Washington was a relentless pursuer who employed agents to hunt down his slaves.
Most of Washington’s Philadelphia slaves were part of Martha’s dowry.
Washington would have had to reimburse his wife’s estate if they were freed or escaped. This remained one excuse Washington could use for not living by his avowed “repugnance” for slavery.
Even at Mount Vernon most of the over 300 slaves were “dower” slaves [part of Martha’s dowry].
They were given their liberty only in Washington’s will.
To hold on to their slaves even in abolitionist Pennsylvania, the Washingtons illegally circumvented a Pennsylvania law, the Gradual Abolition Act — which allowed citizens of other states to hold slaves only six months before the slaves could claim their freedom.
The Washingtons regularly and illegally shuttled their slaves across state lines before the deadline expired, thus resetting their residency at zero.
Hypocrisy once again raised its ugly head when, Blockson tells us that while violating this Pennsylvania law, Washington simultaneously signed into federal law the 1793 Fugitive Slave Act, which guaranteed the right of a slaveholder to recover an escaped slave, even if the slave was in a free state.
According to Coard of Avenging The Ancestors Coalition (ATAC), the planned memorial under construction for this house to be unveiled in November exhibits the deficiencies as well as the strengths of the nation’s birth.
Most if not all of Philadelphia's local, state and federal elected officials are expected to attend this historic grand opening.
“If the project is controversial,” said Coard, “it should be because slavery was controversial and obviously much more so. Also, controversy can be cathartic. In connection with that, the meaning of this ‘controversial’ project, at least from ATAC’s standpoint, is to finally tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about American history.”
He added: “For whites, it will finally force them to face the demon of past slavery and its present effect. It will also show them that enslaved Africans and enslaved African descendants deserve as much credit for building this country — if not more credit than — as the Founding Fathers do.
“After all, it was the millions of enslaved Black folks who labored 24/7 for 246 years from 1619-1865 without pay for the benefit of America.
“For Blacks, it will finally instill the pride of knowing that their ancestors’ blood, sweat and tears yesterday are the direct and most important cause of America’s greatness today.”
Washington’s slaves included: Molly, Richmond, Austin, Giles, Paris, Christopher Sheels, Joe (Richardson), Oney Judge and Hercules. Records of their existence are scant — no graveside markers, no memorials and no birth or death certificates.
Even so, they must have been extremely competent since they were proudly used by Washington to fete generals, ambassadors and other dignitaries.
A Black free man, Samuel Fraunces, oversaw the entire house, which included the Black slaves as well as white servants. One white chef, according to an online source, is said to have quit his job rather than work for Fraunces.
For slaves in general, dependence on their masters frequently prevented them from even contemplating escape.
The slave Molly is said to have spent her entire life serving the Washingtons.
She came to Mount Vernon shortly after the Washingtons married in 1759. She is said to have been the nanny for Martha Washington’s son and daughter, and later, her grandchildren.
Born circa 1739, she was about 51 when brought to Philadelphia. She was returned to Mount Vernon in 1797.
Two of the most well-known slaves were Hercules and Oney Judge, both of whom successfully escaped.
Hercules, Washington’s famous chef and Philadelphia fop and man-about-town, was born in 1754, making him 36 years old when brought to Philadelphia. He was might have reacted to being mere property to Washington despite being given freedom by Washington to roam the streets of Philadelphia on occasion. He escaped from Washington’s grasp on Washington’s 65th birthday — February 22, 1797 — while at Mount Vernon and remained free at some unknown location until his death.
Oney Judge, born around 1773, was the other Philadelphia slave who escaped. She was the younger half sister of Austin.
She was a needlework expert and Martha’s personal servant. She was about 17 when she was brought to Philadelphia in November 1790. She discovered she was to be given, as a wedding gift, by Martha to Martha’s eldest granddaughter.
With the active help of Philadelphia’s fairly large free Black population, Oney plotted her escape.
She left on May 21, 1796, going from Pennsylvania, then apparently through New York, and ultimately settling in New Hampshire.
Although Oney’s escape was successful and permanent, a relentless Washington kept after her reportedly as a result of Martha, who was almost unyielding in trying to track down and capture her.
Oney nonetheless married and had three children and lived free until her death at about 75.
Richmond, the son of Hercules, tried unsuccessfully to escape.
Richmond, born in 1776, was the son of Hercules and Alice. He had two sisters and possibly a stepsibling.
After being brought to Philadelphia at age 14, he was forced into the backbreaking labor of a scullion and a chimney sweep.
Three months before his father’s great escape, he apparently had his own escape plan.
It was foiled.
Christopher Sheels’ escape plans were also disrupted. He was born circa 1774 and was approximately 16 when brought to Philadelphia.
He apparently was literate because, sometime in or about September 1799 at Mount Vernon, an enslaved woman from another plantation, wrote him a note regarding an escape plan.
Unfortunately, Washington intercepted that note and broke up the plan.
Austin, one of the slaves who were not known to have attempted escape, was born between 1757-1759, according to biographies of Washington.
Austin was approximately 32-years-old when brought to Philadelphia and was about 15 years older than his half sister Oney Judge. He was married to Charlotte, an enslaved seamstress, with whom he had five children.
He worked as a waiter, carriage footman and probably stable worker who likely lived in slave quarters with two additional transported enslaved Black laborers, namely Giles and Paris, and probably another person. He died on December 20, 1794, at around 36 years old in Harford, Md.
Giles, born around 1758, was approximately 32-years-old and served as a carriage worker and driver when brought to Philadelphia. He apparently was housed in slave quarters with Austin, Paris and probably another person.
Joe (Richardson), also known as “Postilion Joe,” was born probably in 1769 and married Sall, a Mount Vernon enslaved seamstress. Together they had at least seven children. He was an approximately 26-year-old presidential coach footman and stable worker when brought to Philadelphia on or about on Oct. 20, 1795, which was five years after the other eight.
Paris, born approximately 1774, was a stable worker at the Mount Vernon plantation and later. When brought to Philadelphia around the age of 16, was housed in slave quarters with Austin, Giles and probably another person. After being taken back to Mount Vernon in June of 1791, he died there sometime around October 1794.Gary Parret, associate professor of educational ministries and worship at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, has an article over at Christianity Today bemoaning the changing of hymns for the sake of making them understandable for the vast majority of church goers. Read the article here. Parret adds an interesting voice to the debate and forces those of us who do "update" language in hymns to give an account.
Using the hymn "Come Thou Fount" as an example Parret writes, ."
Parret makes three points about changing the wording of hymns.
1. He protests first on artistic grounds. The hymn writer knew what he/she wanted to write who are we to change it.
2. Second, the revisions are, at best, inconsistent attempts to be culturally relevant. He suggests that the revisions are done haphazardly and inconsistently.
3. Third, he protests on biblical grounds. By changing a word like "ebenezer" we are robbing people of biblical literacy.
Let me react in turn.
1. As to the protest on artistic grounds I would suggest that the hymn writer's intent was not to once and forever have an indelible hymn. I would think the hymn writer's intent was to help people experience God. If that means changing a word or two to make in more understandable for persons and thus help them to be transformed by the grace of God I think they could probably give a rat's you know what. We will have to ask them in the "sweet bye and bye" (notice I didn't change the words of that wonderful hymn)- translation- we will have to ask them in heaven.
2. As to inconsistency I do not think an argument that generalizes like this has much power. Has a study been done that shows churches that change words have done so inconsistently?
3. Professor Parret's third protest is kind of funny. I am sorry. But I am willing to bet in the churches that have sung "Come Thou Fount" over the last twenty years and among the parishioners that have sung the hymn, that I can count with all nine of my toes the number that know what in the world ebenezer means (even among people who have been in the church all their life). I am sure they ran home and got their concordance. Now I think an argument can be made that the worship leader might explain what it means for persons and therefore bring more meaning out of the hymn. I must confess that I went to seminary for three years, took two Old Testament courses and until a couple of years ago had no idea what was meant by "I raise my ebenezer." Then again, I didn't go to Gordon-Conwell.

Lately at New Season we have been using the old anonymous hymn "I Have Decided". I arranged it in a bluegrass style, tweaked the lyrics to verse 3, and wrote a new verse 4. This is a song that is definitely blessing our church.
From a songwriter's point of view...I feel confident in saying that if Robert Robinson were still alive today he would be absolutely flattered that the church is still using "Come Thou Fount" in worship.
Changing arrangements and tweaking lyrics is a way of keeping old hymns alive...almost essential to make them relevent to today's culture.New War of Choice in Uganda Follows Familiar Foreign Police Doctrine

Anyone who spends time in Entebbe, Uganda (the lovely airport town), knows that there have been at least a hundred US military personnel there for some time now, though the numbers have been increasing this year. They have taken over Sophie's Hotel and a compound nearby. Plus there are numerous contractors involved with spy planes based in Entebbe. The disclosure now means "they" are preparing for something bigger.

Surely, and to say that Empire USA is in a downfall mode while it is still expanding, this is an illusion of light and the worse kind of darkness.

President Obama, following George Bush has brilliantly crafted a strategic manuever in Africa that will bring peace to Africa and stability to Der Homeland.
Women, instead of being raped by evil doers can now be raped by handsome, clean, genetically superior white American soldiers whose DNA will help Africa move from bing the dark continent to the bright one.
Africa's oil is best untilized by the United States which can sell the oil back to the Africans at a reasonable price.
Sending troops to Africa provides jobs. Not only for Americans but for the Africans who service them.
President Obama has been misunderstood by the liberal media. He is one of our own, a true fascist.
And fascism should not be a dirty word. It is rule by the most intelligent, (who have proven their intelligence by amassing great quantities of wealth) over the least intelligent, the poor, the downtrodden, the weak.
All hail our great leader. And no matter what happens in the elections, more brilliant Americans are waiting to take over from Obama should he decide that he doens't really want to be president all that much anyway and he resigns or loses the election because of that.
Whatever he does, it will be a sign of his visionary intelligence which so many of you who complain, should follow. Let the 1% guide you.

(2) Our fate in life is set in concrete at birth.
(3) Planet earth is an intelligence dictatorship.
(4) Everyone is a slave to the next class more intelligent.
(5) The only purpose of this world is to establish a full and perfect understanding of darkness,
(6) Then again, if (5) is false, then we all need to maximize pleasure, avoid all pain and seek all pleasure, for this world has no purpose.

FASCISM
Stu Piddy says, “Whatever Obama does, it will be a sign of his visionary intelligence”
Fascism is a religion based on the belief that, God created fascists to be the most intelligent so they could rule the world. Surely a fake morality and fiction religion, for it there is a creator, and he wanted the one most intelligent to rule earth, then ruled directly by nature’s God would be earth.
For logically, if there is such a thing as nature’s God, then the purpose of this world would have to be to teach us the difference between good and criminal, with allowing those most intelligent to rule being the rule cause of all crime and slavery.
Then, as trusting in the word of those most intelligent is the root cause of all darkness, deceit and slavery, then trusting only in the word of God would be just as enslaving. For only by experiencing the ultimate conclusion of misery, can we ever establish if there is such a thing as good, namely the existence of a God that is full and perfect good.

the u.s. has to keep its military sharp via war against all because there are no jobs.Overnight polls showed most Americans, at least initially, gave Kerry the edge. An ABC News poll showed 45 percent said Kerry won, 36 percent thought Bush won and 17 percent called it a tie. Other polls had similar, or larger, victories for Kerry.
A CNN/Gallup/USA Today post-debate survey found 53 percent said Kerry "did the better job in the debate"; 37 percent said Bush did; 1 percent said neither candidate did; and 8 percent said they were tied. But instant polls also have a much higher potential for error than those conducted over a few days. And the Gallup organization has asked the question in five previous races and in four of them the candidate said to have won the first debate lost the election.
The next debate, a town-hall meeting Friday in St. Louis, and a debate scheduled for Oct. 13 in Tempe, Ariz., will focus on domestic policy, potentially changing the tone of the campaign, which has centered on Iraq to a great degree in the past few weeks.

Beijing, Nov 12 — Journalists may be known for their single-mindedness, but in China, they are in a single category of a different sort. The profession has the largest numbers of singletons, the survey has found.
According to matchmaking site zhenai.com, 4.8 percent of media professionals in China are single, the most among all occupations, the China Daily reported Tuesday.
"When joking about their daily routines, journalists sometimes say that they 'wake as early as a rooster and go to bed as late as a dog'," the China Daily report said.
"Now they have another reason to poke fun at themselves: being single."
The zhenai.com report is based on an annual survey of single population in China in which 10,000 of its members were taken as samples.
Low salaries and tight work schedules leave journalists with little time for dating, the report said citing some media professionals.
One journalist interviewed by China Daily said that journalists remain single as they have to work overtime and on holidays and weekends to follow the news.
He said the night shift, a common schedule in newsrooms, was one major reason for a high divorce rate in the website office he worked in.
According to a 24-year-old reporter working in a news agency in Beijing, media professionals "have a hard time on the dating circuit because they don't have a fixed schedule and have to travel frequently for interviews".
"It's even more difficult for those in TV news because they have to work late," the reporter was quoted as saying.
The report cited journalists as saying that media professionals tend to spend a lot of time on internet following the news, resulting in them living in a cyber world.
Even if they get a break from work in the daytime, it does not help in terms of dating as others remain busy with their 9-to-5 schedule, the report said, citing a journalist.
The China Population Employment Statistics Yearbook 2010 figures show single Chinese men and women aged between 18 and 43 numbered nearly 180 million in 2011, 60 million of them living in urban areas.

Community development usually involves millions of dollars for new construction and lots of political support.
Beltzhoover would love to get some of all that, but its own leaders aren't waiting. They're developing community themselves -- one plateful at a time.
Once a month, the Beltzhoover Civic Association and allied church congregations set up tables in the Warrington Recreation Center and serve free square meals to 80-100 of their neighbors. The Beltzhoover big meal is a third-Friday event "that might be some people's only real meal of that day," said Marilyn Hornsby, administrator at the Full Life Deliverance Ministry, a participating church.
Feeding struggling neighbors is the first level of community building, but the big meal brings together people who might never have met; old friends seeing each other for the first time in years; young people observing other young people in a nurturing setting; people networking.
"I want this to be a bridge to get people to break bread and build relationships," said Raymont Conner, a recreational therapist and activity director for the city's Department of Parks and Recreation. "This is open to everyone."
He proposed the idea to the civic association -- of which he and his wife, Mechelle, are members -- then to other organizations and churches.
"God dropped the idea into my spirit," he said. "My son is a drummer at Central Baptist, where they have a meal ministry, and I said 'I'd like to do something like that here.' It took off like a wildfire."
Each month, a sponsoring organization provides the food. This month, all the agencies came together to provide Thanksgiving dinner Saturday before the holiday. It was the biggest gathering yet with 150 people, said the civic association's event coordinator, Malik James.
A number of the Thanksgiving dinner diners were elders who got there in an Access van.
Norma Jackson lives three blocks away, but this was her first time at the Beltzhoover big meals. "My daughter is on the civic association, and she said, 'Ma, you've gotta come.' I'm seeing a lot of people I hadn't seen in awhile."
Mary Ann Weber said the meal helped open her world to the recreation center. "You can take exercise classes and use the weight-lifting room," she said. "I didn't even know that was here."
Then there's the more basic issue of hunger.
"I think it is more than what people want to admit," Ms. Hornsby said. "And some of our seniors now are limited, having worked hard all their lives, helped build community" and have to have the meals delivered.
"My thing is," Mr. Conner said, "if we can save you from spending money to put food on your table one day a month, that's money you can spend on the next day."
Another goal of the meal is to get youth to see each other in a positive light, Ms. Hornsby said. "If we said, 'We want you all to come together and be friends,' it wouldn't work. But if we say, 'Come eat,' it might."
Beltzhoover has struggled against blight and crime and languished without much investment for many years. But the civic association recently garnered a $15,000 grant from the Design Center for a parklet, and the 12-neighborhood umbrella group the Hilltop Alliance will begin a multiyear housing strategy with $35,000 from the Design Center.
Both grants were recently announced as part of the city's Neighborhood Renaissance Fund grant program.
Pat Murphy, executive director of the Hilltop Alliance, said the big meal is important to an overall community development effort because "to redevelop a community you need strong organizations and strong relationships among people. It takes a lot of volunteerism."
The Beltzhoover Civic Association is active in after-school programs and is working with the Hilltop Alliance on a greening vision, she said. A relatively new group, it is full of "really committed people, young and full of energy in service to community," she said. "They recruit partners, raise funds, do coordination and management -- all the things you need to tackle the larger issues."food - neigh_city

In a move that may slightly ease Hollywood’s strike fears, SAG’s decided it will be ready to resume bargaining with the majors in two weeks — or sooner, if possible.The Screen Actors Guild has accepted the invitation of the congloms to head back to negotiations on May 28 or earlier. Neither SAG nor the AMPTP had any comment Wednesday. The lack of resolution on the SAG feature-primetime deal, which expires June 30, has created a “de facto” strike in features in which major studios won’t greenlight any films until the guild makes a deal. SAG and the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers last met May 6 with talks recessing amid SAG’s objections that a deal was within reach. The majors have asserted the two sides were still far apart at that point — after 18 days of talks — and that they were obligated to launch the twice-delayed negotiations with the American Federation of Television & Radio Artists the next day. AFTRA and the majors have remained on track to make a deal on the union’s primetime contract within the next few days. Negotiators are set to sit down for a seventh day of talks today at AMPTP headquarters in Encino with both sides continuing to observe a news blackout until bargaining is complete — possibly working into this weekend. In its most recent message to members on May 6, SAG stressed the importance of the issue of actors being able to give their consent for film clips to be distributed online. And in a sign of the hostility between the unions — which are negotiating this pact separately for the first time in three decades — SAG noted that AFTRA agreed to a clip use formula that doesn’t include a consent provision in its network code deal, which covers non-primetime and was ratified by 93% of those voting. Studios and nets are seeking to establish a market for use of clips online but want to dispense with performer consent, asserting that doing so would prevent such an enterprise from being feasible. SAG has scheduled a town hall meeting on the negotiations for members Monday night at the WGA Theater with SAG president Alan Rosenberg and national exec director Doug Allen speaking. AFTRA’s contract also expires June 30 and covers a handful of shows including “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” “Reaper,” “Cashmere Mafia” and “‘Til Death.”Overview

Shipments of smartphone units having a screen between 5 and 7 inches have drastically increased since the last year. Out of the 261.1 million shipped units, 21% of those were actually the ones in the phablet category (that number was a mere 3% a year ago). "Almost all successful Android vendors have added one or more 5-7-inch phablets to their product portfolios," said Ryan Reith, Program Director with IDC?s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. Reith even considers the notable lack of market share growth for Apple due to, among other reasons, the absence of a larger mobile device.
Curiously enough, even though the average selling price (ASP) continued to go down for many platforms (down -12.5% in 3Q13, accounting for an average price of $317), the aforementioned large-screen devices, which are generally more expensive than their ?regular? counterparts continued to rise. Just as Reith noted, many manufacturers have decided to follow the trend arguably set by Samsung ? including the relative newcomer to the category, Nokia. With recent announcements of the Lumia 1320 and the flagship Lumia 1520, they are certainly trying to bring out the ?big guns? before the merger with Microsoft finally occurs.
When it comes to mobile platforms themselves, it is worth noting that aside from Android grabbing an incredible 81% of the cake (IDC?s own predictions still note that by 2017 share will fall to 68.3%), the Windows Phone platform grew by 156% compared to the previous year. Of course, analysts note that the base was very small (3.7 million in 3Q12) but it still rose to almost 10 million shipped units. ." Successful sales in the Europe put aside, Microsoft?s mobile platform still has difficulties reaching 5% of the global market share.
33.8 million iPhones were shipped in the 3Q13, which is a notable increase to the last year?s 26.9 million ? however, that is not the whole story. iOS has actually dropped from 14.4% market share to 12.9%. If someone considers that to be a bad result, it is worth looking at the BlackBerry ? or whatever is left of the share it had not that long ago. In 3Q13 the company shipped just 4.5 million units capturing 1.7% of the market share. IDC analysts do note that the fallen company has recently received an injection of $1 billion, but the plans regarding their platform are completely unknown.This poll is now closed

We hitched a ride to Kirkwood through SnowPals.org in the back seat of a pickup truck, departing from SF at 4:30 Friday morning. We were on the slopes at 9 a.m. There were several inches of nice powder, with clear sunny skies.
(Video of me skiing in thick powder)
By lunch time, the clouds had moved in, and it started snowing very hard. The powder piled up fast. Around 3 p.m. it was hailing. We were going to do a few last runs, but being exhausted and getting pummeled by hail, we decided to call it a day.
We were back home by 9:30 p.m., and slept very, very soundly.
Saturday I worked at home, making up for the lost time on Friday. (That way I kept my PTO for later and [hopefully] set a good precedent with the boss.)
Sunday morning, the weather was beautiful, and we decided it was a good day to start planting an herb garden on the porch. So we started up the motorcycle to drive to a nearby nursery. As we loaded up, we realized it was too nice a day to waste merely on errands. So we took a detour for an hour and a half and drove south on Route 1. Along the way, we stopped at a beach, where (despite what had to be very cold water) there were people surfing and swimming.

Singer Younha appeared on the MBC music program "I Am a Singer 2" and shocked the audience with her first performance on stage.
Today (August 12), MBC's "I Am a Singer 2" featured the young and talented singer Younha who sang the song "Days Far Away," originally sang by singer Park Jung Woon. For the first half of the song, Younha sang the song with emotions flowing out of her and then concluded the song with her powerful vocals. The audience was completely captivated by Younha and her powerful voice that erupted out of such a young girl.
Younha's concentration level was clearly evident because she even drooled a little bit on stage. Younha was so immersed into the emotions of the song that she burst out crying as soon as she left the stage.
In the interview prior to her first performance on "I Am a Singer 2," Younha stated, "I will try to perform to the best of my ability to show my gratitude for giving me another chance to sing. Please don't disqualify me." After her rehearsal, Younha promised her fans she would sing all of her organs out during her performance..August 15, 2013 | By Sean Buckley
L K Consulting is proud to be a Sprint Master Agent
Sprint (NYSE: S) continues to make progress with its own 100G optical path by completing two key trials of the technology on its wireline network.
Working with its optical systems partner Ciena (Nasdaq: CIEN), the service provider deployed a 100G circuit over a 1,304-mile span in the United States and recently completed a live 400G trial.
During its 100G circuit trial, which is now integrated into its network infrastructures and is in-service between Chicago and Fort Worth, Texas, it did not need to conduct regeneration between each point. Sprint said that being able to transmit at longer distance enables the service provider to reduce latency and increase reliability.
The service provider said that the 100G technology it has deployed will enable it to achieve speeds up to 10X faster and, later, up to 40x faster without network upgrades. Its Ethernet Wave Services can provide 100G speeds now and 400G in the future.
In its 400G trial in Silicon Valley, Sprint ran 400 Gbps channels alongside existing channels carrying live customer traffic. While it has not announced any specific date as to when it would need 400G, it said that it "foresees the opportunity to add a network equivalent of high-speed traffic lanes for customers with high-demand requirements."

Postmaster says farewell to Lake Orion
July 18, 2012

Here, Hamlet (Cooper Nicholas) is consoled by his friend Horatio (Karen Graves) and two guards before seeing his ghostly father.

Review Intern
By the close of July, the Lake Orion post office will lose one of its valued members, postmaster Ted Banks, who will retire before the month is out.
"It's a good office and I've enjoyed running it," Banks said.
Banks served as Lake Orion's postmaster for the past eight years, and has worked for the U.S. Postal Service for 31 years last April, serving 14 of them as postmaster to various offices. He worked in Southfield and Rochester, among other offices, before becoming Lake Orion's postmaster.
"It was an opportunity I couldn't pass up," Banks said. "My father went to school here way back in the day, so it was nice, when the opportunity made itself available, to come into Lake Orion."
A postmaster is essentially the boss of the office, as the name indicates. They are responsible for ensuring that the post office runs without a hitch—which means making sure that all the mail for citizens in their area is properly processed, sorted and delivered in a timely manner six days a week. They also have to manage other operations within the postal service. The Lake Orion branch, for example, has a processing plant in Pontiac that delivers mail to the local office every morning, which has to be processed and delivered. In addition, the postmaster acts as an administrative head of the office, managing finances and other issues surrounding the post office.
"For all intents and purposes he's like the CEO of your local post office," Banks said. "He or she—or in this case, me—they're in charge of everything."
Banks did not originally intend to spend 31 years with the postal service. When he got out of the military and started attending college, there were letter-carrier jobs available in Pontiac. Banks was looking for a part-time job at the time, and so decided to take the test to become a letter-carrier part time. Not three or four weeks later, on his route, Banks was trapped on a porch by a German Shepherd, which, "wouldn't come any closer to me, but every time I tried to get off the porch and go to the next house, he'd start barking and growling," Banks said. 31 years after that experience and many others, Banks is ready to retire.
"The opportunity provided itself, and I wanted to do some different things," Banks said.
One of those things is spending more time with his family. Banks has three adult children and a 14-year-old son entering high school in the fall. Due to work, Banks was busy when his older children went through high school, and now that his youngest son is entering high school, he intends to enjoy those years with him.
In parting, Banks has only positive things to say of his employees and fellow postal workers at the Lake Orion office. By Banks' estimation, they really, "want to make sure that the people of Lake Orion are taken care of." Though he called the past eight years, "the best years of my career," Banks is ready to spend more time with his family.
"I love working in the community, but it's the right time," Banks said.- THE MAGAZINE

Tosoh Renames Nippon Silica Glass USAJapan-based Tosoh Corp. has changed the name of Nippon Silica Glass USA, Inc. to TOSOH SGM, USA Inc., effective January 1, 2001. Located in Bound Brook, N.J., TOSOH SGM, USA Inc. will continue to be the sales and distribution channel for silica glass materials, zirconia powders and advanced ceramic products and materials in the U.S. for Tosoh Corp. As part of the quartz group unification process, Tosoh aims to further enhance its worldwide silica glass material line of business by bringing about a more efficient utilization of resources through the sharing of information and technology, as well as research and development and marketing efforts.
This renaming strategically follows the recent name change of quartz material producer NSG Yamaguchi Co., Ltd., to TOSOH SGM Corp., as well as the transfer of silica glass sales assignments from Nippon Silica Glass Co., Ltd., to the Tosoh Quartz Division. In addition, Tosoh recently unified all Tosoh-affiliated quartz fabrication companies throughout the world under the name “TOSOH Quartz.” For more information, visit.
China WTO Talks Expected by MarchBeijing’s chief World Trade Organization negotiator, Long Yongtu, said it was unlikely the next round of WTO talks would be held in February. He said that China wants to wait until all parties in the new Bush administration are ready before the two sides meet again. But he denied an Australian news report saying China may delay WTO entry until as late as next year.
“Given the atmosphere and progress in Geneva in the last talks, I still believe we can get in the WTO this year,” he said. “Which month is not important.”
After talks in January in Geneva, the next round of meetings was planned to take place at the end of February or in early March.
“If we are to meet, I prefer to have a good meeting. But because of the changing of new administration in the U.S., they may have new adjustments. We want to wait until all the parties are ready. It will be in March but we will not press for a date.”

Vietnam’s Building Sector Remains StrongSpeaking at a recent conference in Hanoi, Nguyen Manh Kiem, minister of construction, said Vietnam’s building materials production grew 17.5% over the past 10 years, an increase of 5.5% over the average growth rate of the national industrial production. He added that it was noteworthy that the production value of cement, ceramic tile, sanitaryware and construction glass accounted for 84% of total construction materials production in the 1990-2000 period, compared to 75% reported in the 1991-1995 period.
Kiem said the country now has 32,450 companies producing construction materials, including 486 owned by the state, which make up 70% of the sector’s total production and 85% of aggregate tax payments.
Over the past 10 years, the population of urban areas has risen from 18% in 1990 to 20% in 1995 and 23.5% last year to 18 million.

Metal fans young and old braved the cold weather to rock out with other metalheads. But before the show, frontman and guitarist Alexi Laiho talked about the tour and what's next for Bodom.
Are there any pre-show rituals you do to get pumped up before a show?
Alexi Laiho: I just warm with up with some guitar and listen to music...to stuff that gets me, like you said, pumped up.
Are there any specific band or songs you listen to before shows?
AL: It could be anything. Right now we're listening to Guns N Roses...'80s stuff is usually the best.
The band has been together for over 20 years. Did you guys ever think you would last this long and have such a dedicated following?
AL: Oh not at all. Well, I knew that I wanted to this for as long as I'm alive. Me and the drummer started the band when we were like 13 and 14 years old. So, obviously it took a while for us to get a record contract and stuff, but it's gotten so much bigger than I ever thought it would be. It's pretty awesome.
“Halo of Blood” is your latest album and fans are hungry for new music. When can we expect that from the band?
AL: We're still in the middle of touring, so we got a couple of more tours lined up. I think we got s*** lined up until this fall. After that I'm gonna start writing new stuff and see what happens, so basically next year we're gonna hit the studio in April maybe.
With so many albums and songs under your belt, where do you get inspiration for new songs?
AL: You know it's funny, the thing is I don't really know. When I start writing music I just kind of try to block everything out of my mind and try not to really think about anything. Usually, I can just get an idea, a melody, or a riff or anything out of the blue, just out of nowhere when doing [anything] – like driving a car or something. Or sometimes when I'm sitting down with a guitar kind of noodling around and it kind of starts from there. It differs, but obviously I listen to music all the time things that you hear. I just kind of absorb stuff without really thinking about it. I don't really know where it comes from, but I'm glad it still does.
Where are you guys headed once the North American tour is finished?
AL: Yeah, we got tons of European festivals before that. After this we're going to Finland for three weeks and then we do – it's kind of like around the world tour. We start off in Russia, we're supposed to do Ukraine too, and Turkey, Israel, Australia, a bunch of countries and Asia and stuff. And then we go to South America. So, it's basically it's two months of going all over the place. After that the European festivals and after that we have one more tour and we should be done.
Do you guys ever take a break? It sounds really hectic.
AL: It is really hectic (laughs), but that's the way we like it. That's really what the band is all about anyways, playing live and touring. We've been doing this since forever, since the first album, like 1998. Since then we've been on the road. Everybody still enjoys it; we love being on the road and just love playing live.
So, no partying for you guys?
AL: Well, we do. Personally, I used to party like crazy every night, but the thing is I'm not 25 anymore. I;m taking it pretty easy when I'm on the road. Trying to make sure that I'm not all f***ed up and hung over when I hit the stage. I used to be able to do it, but I'm getting old so I gotta take it easy. I'll do my partying when I go back home.
Later that night, the venue buzzed with excitement as fans waited for Bodom to come on stage. When they finally did, the cheers were loud enough to bring down the walls. The band opened with their slaying hit “Sixpounder,” which got everyone in the crowd shouting “666!” The excitement in the room kept building as the band knocked out classics “Living Dead Beat,” “Halo of Blood,” “Bodom Beach Terror,” and “Hate Crew Deathroll.” They made sure to please everyone by doing old fan favorites along with tracks from their latest album. Occasionally, they would stop to thank Chicago for coming out or reminiscence about when they started playing in city back in 2003. They even treated fans to quick covers of the “Beverly Hills Cop” theme song, which got everyone clapping along.
Laiho pulled off intricate solos with ease, making it look simple. And keyboardist Janne Warman's playing is so unreal he looked like he was making the keys play by sheer willpower. Some of the songs that got the biggest cheers were “Are You Dead Yet?” which opened a massive circle pit in the crowd. When they signed off before their encore, a chant of “Bodom! Bodom! Bodom!” erupted. The final song of the night was the explosive “In Your Face.” Fans went nuts as moshing, jumping, and crowd surfing broke out. Onstage the guys seemed to revel in the adrenaline as Laiho leaped across the stage and even spinning his guitar around his body. Bodom left the crowd in bruises and aches, but most fans will agree it was well worth it. Children of Bodom is a metal act you don't want to miss.
Children of Bodom are currently finishing up their North American tour. Their last two shows are in New York March 28-29. Their latest album "Halo of Blood" is out now. Keep up with Bodom visit their website and follow them on Facebook.Dai Hue Hotel
Clean and spacious
What we say:
This big, salmon-pink number caught our eye because of the good location, and the clean, spacious rooms with rubs and balconies -- though the views are mostly of the trees separating the main road from the beach. There's no pool, but perhaps that's why the doubles are a bit cheaper here than elsewhere. They quoted us 'year round' prices, which, given the neighbourhood, is a dubious assertion, but it true then it's not such a good deal in the low season, but a place to stop in and check out in the high season.

The HOF results will be announced tomorrow morning. Your dependable blogger predicts that two players, Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez, will be elected.
The HOF keeps running itself further and further into the ground. The ballot as it exists today is stuffed with credible candidates. There are close to 25 players on the ballot that SHOULD be in the Hall.
But they won’t be. The archiac rules that the Hall and the BBWAA use has forced this type of backlog. The santimonius approach of many of the BBWAA members regarding PEDs has only added to this backlog with way too many players being excluded using that criteria.
Just so you know, I have never been to Cooperstown. I will never go to Cooperstown until Barry Bonds is elected. Barry was the best player I ever saw play BEFORE there were any suspicions about steroids. But he is the poster child for any sprotswriter who has an axe to grind.
So, another year, a larger backlog. The HOF is a running joke that no one thinks is funny.
The Kung Fu Panda has Left the Building
Well, no use denying the inevitable. Pablo Sandoval has left the Giants to join the Boston Red Sox. Both Brian Sabean and Mike Krukow have come out and said that they wished him well in Boston and thanked him for his contributions to three rings in five years. They appear to be saying the right things despite the disappointment of him leaving SF.
Folks, I am not nearly as magnanimous.
This stinks. If we are to believe what is being reported, the Sox got him for $100 mill over 5 years, while the Giants offered $95 mill over the same period. The Giants said that they thought they would get the chance to put in a ‘final offer’ but it appears they were not allowed to do that. So Pablo leaves the only franchise he has ever known, a franchise he said he wanted to be with ‘for life’, a franchise that nurtured him through weight issues, hamate bones breaking, sexual assault charges and a litany of other personal issues. He leaves a fan base that adores him, dresses in panda hats to honor him, delighted in every accomplishment he did while looking the other way when he did not do well.
A few facts to consider here. Pablo has been with the Giants 7 years, but it really a tale of 2008-11, 4 years but with a horrible 2010, then 2012-14 or three years. Leaving out the horrible ’10 season, his OPS was exactly .900, which was excellent. For ’12-14, his OPS has slid to .762, with drops every year from 2011 (.909,.789,.758,.739). OPS for a corner infielder should be in the .850 to 1.000 range, so a regular season .739 is really not very good.
His weight. The Giants have been frustrated for years with his weight, all reports are that the BoSox would be including a weight clause in his contract. I’m sure he is saying all the right things but one thing is for sure, the Boston media and the fans will not be, in ANY way, forgiving if he looks fat and plays as if it effects him.
As a casual observer, when he has a lot of pressure on him, his performance suffers. I’m not talking about postseason. Early this season, after he had rejected a Giants extension, he played horribly. The pressure of a ‘walk year’ really got to him early on, he had to rally to put up a .279 batting average. He struck out more times than ever in his career and his walks were down. He averaged a little over 9 errors a season through his first 4 years, his last three he averaged 14. He was a finalist for 3B Gold Glove but did not win and it didn’t seem like he had a chance.
Lastly, I think that the Giants and their fans lose their minds a little when it comes to resigning their players. $20 mill or very close to it for a .279 hitter, with little or no pop, only 2 All Star appearances and just one, thats right, one player of the week honor in 7 years? For that kind of money, the Giants could get a top-of-the-rotation arm (Lester, Hamels) or a middle-of-the-order hitter (Cespedes, Tomas, Upton) and figure out 3B on the fly. Isn’t Marco Scuturo still under contract? Adam Duvall? Chris Dominguez? Matt Duffy? Basically, my belief is that when Sabean said they had no options in-house, that was to make their pursuit of Pablo seem important. It’s not. They may go out and find a stopgap, Chase Headley maybe, but they have lots of IF options.
Pablo will find out quickly how much patience the Red Sox nation has and at $20 mill per, they will be on him like white on rice. If he starts like 2014, hitting .193 on May 13th, he will experience something in Boston that he never has in SF, hatred.
Others may wish him well but not me. Any respect I had for him was gone, he is now Jose Uribe heavy.
Did the best team win?
As the analysis of the Giants third World Series win in five years circulates, there is a large number of columnists/bloggers that decry the fact that the ‘best’ team didn’t win. HOGWASH! Regardless of how many wins they had in the regular season, the post season awards like Manager of year, Rookie of the Year, Cy Young or MVP, the bottom line was this in 2014, when it counted the most, the team that played the best, won. Once the postseason starts, any reference to the regular season should be ignored, because the Giants have shown that they shine when the lights are brightest. The Pirates, Nationals, Cardinals and Royals know that directly, the Dodgers have learned that their ‘stars’ do not shine when too harsh of a light is placed upon them. Kershaw has proven himself to come up small in October. Puig can not be trusted to even play in important games. And Donnie baseball looked like the inexperienced manager he really is.
So when Kershaw is in his trophy room, gazing at his Cy Young and MVP, does he think about how he has all this hardware but Mad Bum now has three rings? Who was the best pitcher in the NL, $30 mill/year Clayton or the guy who won the Wild Card game, NLCS MVP, World Series MVP and threw the last pitch of the year? If it truly is all about winning, you know the answer to that question.
Let’s recap shall we, postseason useless awards based on the regular season versus a Ring and a Parade. Giants and their ecstatic fans will gladly take the latter.
From the shores of McCovey Cove, mid October 2014
What a game last night. My first playoff action of the postseason and I picked a good game to attend. The place was a-rockin’ and the Giants faithful in full throat. Maybe it’s because most of the games I attend, I sit out in the open, but where we were at last night was undercover and man oh man was it loud. First couple times the Giants did something, the crowd erupted and I jumped. Got used to it though. Maybe not good for my hearing but joining 40k nutcases in rooting on their guys was something to experience, if you never have.
So, with Buster Posey having 2 hits last night and 3 RBI, do you think Mike Matheny, the Cardinals manager, has changed his mind about him? If you don’t recall, Matheny was the All Star manager this year, as the Cards had lost to the BoSox in the World Series. As for the catcher position in the All Star game, Yadier Molina was voted in, LuCroy and Mesoroco were appointed based on steller first halves offensively. But Molina was hurt and had to be replaced. Matheny picked Miguel Montero of the Diamondbacks as the replacement. So Mike Matheny, you didn’t feel that Buster Posey was any better THAN THE FIFTH (5TH!!) BEST CATCHER IN THE NATIONAL LEAGUE? REALLY?
Here are the final OPS numbers for the regular season (BTW Mesoroco struck out 103 times, Montero 97, Buster 69)
Mesoroco .893
Posey .854
LuCroy .837
Molina .719
Montero .699
One last point. When Buster came up in the 6th, with a runner on 2nd, 2 outs, the crowd started chanting POSEY, POSEY, POSEY, reminiscent of the Barry chants from the 90’s. And what did Buster do with 40 thousand fans chanting his name? Base hit of course, RBI and the final margin of victory. Geez, I loooooove that guy.

Soon after he got a congratulatory text message from an surprising admirer: Sidney Crosby. The two players grew up in neighboring towns in Nova Scotia, just ten minutes away by car. They often played against and with each other at early age and have kept in touch throughout the years.
“As big as he is, he’s kind of got that small-town kid in him and it’s nice when he does little things like that for guys like us,” said Gordon. “I hate to break all your hearts, but he’s a good guy. I don’t have a bad thing to say about the guy, other than the crest on his jersey.”
“I’m one of the few players in the world that knows, personally, the two best players in the world,” he added, referring to Crosby and Alex Ovechkin.
Gordon’s goal came after seven games over three years at the NHL level. The 25 year-old Canadian has dominated with the AHL’s Hershey Bears but hopes that this time he can stay with the big club.
“I want to make sure every time I touch that ice, I’m working 100 percent and showing the coaches that I can skate at this level and think at this level,” he said. “You have to be ready every time they call your number and be ready to work as hard as you possibly can and try to generate some energy.”
With the Winter Classic just days away, Gordon hopes that he’s shown enough of that hard work to be featured on hockey’s biggest stage. “I try hard not to even think about it. Being here and breaking in all this fancy new gear is pretty exciting in itself,” he said. “I think it would be an amazing experience and I’m going to cross my fingers.”
This wouldn’t be his first taste of the Capitals – Penguins rivalry for Gordon. He has faced Pittsburgh’s minor league affiliate, the Wilkes Barre/Scranton Penguins, down a level with the Bears.
“It’s exciting to be part of a team that has a genuine hatred for somebody,” Gordon said. “It is one of those things that’s sort of bred into you when you step into the dressing room in Hershey, you know Wilkes Barrie is coming at you every night and if you’re not at you’re best, they’re going to beat you,”
“I think it’s the same thing here,” he added. “The 20 guys that are in have to give 100 percent. They have to be at their best to beat [Pittsburgh].”
Gordon, who also picked up his first career assist on Tuesday, has certainly showed his enthusiasm for his Caps teammates. When the RMNB Blogger got to the bench after scoring his goal, he made sure to thank Johansson for setting him up though he might have gone a little overboard when he kissed the 20 year-old Swede on the cheek.

Said Johansson: “I don’t know if he really hit me [with the kiss] but I think he was just very excited and I’m happy for him.”
“That’s going to haunt me forever, I think,” Gordon said. “I don’t even really know why I did that. I was just a happy guy, I just wanted to express it.”Activities of Secretary-General in France, 7-9 October

Size-dependent space debris density distribution and implications for size to mass conversion.
Advances in Space Research, 13

Over the past 15 years, modelling of the near-Earth space environment has become a prime tool in assessing satellite reliability and survivability. Using the available data sources on tracked space debris objects, a density distribution for orbital spacecraft and large fragments rho = 1.29 d-0-49 has been derived. Although this is somewhat different from previous models, the range of densities for individual objects of a given size is so large that the relationship is only of statistical significance. In addition, uncertainties in debris mass derived from observation are at least a factor of 4 and can be larger than 10. An assessment of the accuracy of sizes derived from observations and consequent errors in derived mass is made.Seattle to Spokane, WashingtonToday's Sights:.

Twin Peaks, Northern Exposure
We are excited about hitting our next stops, the Twin Peaks and Northern Exposure towns, Snoqualmie, North Bend, and Roslyn. Seminal '90s "quirk" TV shows filmed here were demographically designed so advertisers could shoot from the hip, hitting our young but family-oriented friends right between the eyes. The roar of the mighty waterfall and scenic overlook at the "lodge" get our Twin Peaks fevers burning. We hope to ourselves that in addition to "The Big Log," resting under Snoqualmie's Historic Log Pavilion, we will be able to see a large tribute to Ernest and Julio Gallo's White Grenache wine, or a fifty-foot prospectus monument under the Fidelity Tax-free Mutual Fund Pavilion.
Nothing like this greets us. Perhaps it is because no one cares about Twin Peaks anymore. North Bend's Mar-T Cafe still sells their famous cherry pies and coffee, but mainly to regulars. Fireplace logs, with tags identifying "Official Log Lady Logs," sit in a pile at the drug store and gather dust. [Note: This report was written only 1 year after the show ended!]

We quickly head to Roslyn, television's Northern Exposure town, where things are slightly more animated. Scads of sweat-suited retirees disgorge from their RVs and wander ugly vistas from NE's opening credits.

George, Washington
The flat drive toward George, Washington gives us plenty of time to imagine what funny civic permutations await us there. But the town doesn't get its own joke. Instead of dressing the residents in powdered wigs, or having any kind of photo opportunity that spells out the gag in no uncertain terms (Like a billboard with a hole cut for your head, making you look like a termite in a giant set of George's wooden teeth), all we see at the city limits is a sign reading "Welcome To Town of George." What!? They do sell postcards of the world's largest cherry pie, baked in 1983, at the chamber of commerce. But, man, what a disappointment.
- Address:
- Royal Anne Ave., George, WA
- Directions:
- I-90 west of Moses Lake, northeast of Wanapum State Park.
We are behind schedule, and on the dusty streets of George, have a disagreement. Doug wants to go north and see the windmills made of household items in Electric City, and stay for the laser show on the side of the Grand Coulee Dam. But Mike thinks we will waste too much time waiting for darkness to fall before the laser show, and if we go South, we'll not only see more, we'll make it to Spokane before dark to see their stuff, too.
South we go. Loser chooses music, and since we have to proceed with all the speed the law allows, Doug unzips his complete collection of Hawkwind tapes, and pops in a live version of "Sonic Attack." Hawkwind, an early '70s British space rock band that still performs, never did ballads and their songs often end in explosions. Hawkwind's constant 85 MPH drumbeat and pulsing broken white line bass, no matter what the number, offer a much better driving aura than more obvious, less hypnotizing choices like Elvis and Led Zepplin.
Nuclear Panic
Two loud hours later, at the Hanford Science Center in Richland, we learn about the nearby Hanford Site, a Manhattan Project boom town that once produced plutonium for atomic bombs. But the Science Center focuses on boring "don't panic" education, with computer games like "Learn Your Personal Radiation Dose." Brochures teach us that "radiation is emitted by earth, water, food...Radiation also comes from human-generated sources such as color TV sets, medical procedures and nuclear weapons production."
[Update 2005: According to Connie Estep, Curator, the Hanford Science Center "reopened in a different location in 1997 as the CREHST Museum (Columbia River Exhibition of History, Science, and Technology). We still feature exhibits from the Hanford nuclear site but we also have Lewis & Clark, geology, early area settlements, and various short-term exhibits." CREHST Museum, 95 Lee Blvd. 509-943-9000]
Make this stop worthwhile by visiting B, B & M Sporting Goods for a Richland High School T-shirt. Sports teams there are called "The Bombers"; the logo features a billowing mushroom cloud. B, B & M usually sells about 30 a week, "But if the DOE boys are in town, they just fly out of the store."
[Update 2005: B,B & M Sporting Goods is gone, but you can still buy Bomber gear via the school alumni web site. Thanks to Blake Lindsey for the link.]
Whitman Massacre
Horrible two lane traffic makes our race to the Whitman Massacre Site Interpretive Center, just west of Walla Walla, a nail-biter. When a National Historic Site says they close at 4:45, they mean it. Running in just ahead of the door locker, camera tripods akimbo, we find that politically correct forces have reshaped the old dioramas of Dr. Marcus Whitman and his wife, Narcissa, futilely running from tomahawk-wielding attackers, into a scene where food is peacefully exchanged between the couple and their culturally distinct neighbors. Only the recorded messages outside hint at the tourism-rich horror of the 1847 massacre that left 13 dead, buried together in the "Great Grave" at the bottom of the Whitman Monument hill. Doug says, but does not mean, that the interpretive center is as good as laying on the grass, watching lasers dance to Dark Side Of The Moon.

Codger Pole
We speed along Hwy's 12 and 127 between rolling green hills, Gaia's attractive
pagan buttocks, toward Colfax. Signs quickly direct us to the Codger Pole,
a sixty-five-foot tall chain saw sculpture commemorating a 1988 high school
football rematch -- played fifty years after the first game by the same participants.
The pole is actually a fagot of five separate wooden columns, with the heads of all the golden-aged players carved into them. Town fathers have done a great job displaying and publicizing the Codger Pole, perhaps because town fathers are the very people portrayed.
- Address:
- 324 South Main St., Colfax, WA

- On Hwy 195, between Pullman and Spokane between two insurance agencies. Look toward the town's concrete riverbed, and you'll see the Codger Pole, centerpiece of a square built around it.

- Worth a Detour.", 1994) which he edited. As the Halloween season approaches, the second largest holiday in retail sales in the U.S., we are privileged to have Dr. Santino provide his perspective on this interesting holiday.
TheoFantastique: Dr. Santino, thank you for making time to share your research with the readers. Let's begin with a little background on you. Where did you do your studies, and how did you end up teaching academically in the area of popular culture?
Jack Santino: I grew up in Boston and attended Boston College, but I really wasn't too interested in academics. On my own, however, I had a great interest in folklore and mythology, as well as what we now call popular culture, particularly comics and rock'n'roll. Two years after I graduated I found out that there were graduate programs available in folklore. I applied to a couple, and I attended the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate Department of Folklore and Folklife, where I got my Ph.D. From Penn I took a job at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, where I worked on the Annual Folklife Festival, and after 8 or 9 years I responded to an ad for a teaching position in the Department of Popular Culture at Bowling Green State University.
TheoFantastique: What contribution do the perspectives of festival and Folklore studies bring to an understanding of Halloween?
Jack Santino: As you mention, Halloween has become a major annual festival in the United States, and the American-style version of the holiday is being introduced abroad as well. Folklore helps us understand the customs and symbols that are central to the occasion, and how we received or inherited them. But as a discipline, Folklore is not only about the past. These customs and symbols are fluid, as are their meanings and the ways people use and understand them. I got interested in writing about Halloween because I enjoyed it as a child, but also because I could see it changing all around me. The rise of grown-up masquerade parties, the explosion of elaborately-decorated homes, and city-sponsored festivals -- none of these were a part of my childhood experience. So I wanted to document and try to understand the change in Halloween from a child-oriented event to a more inclusive and multifaceted one..
TheoFantastique: From my research, including the book you edited on the topic, I know that Halloween has a long and continually evolving history and variety of influences. But can you summarize it for us as to where its roots may be traced, some of the key influences, and how it arrived at its present form in the U.S.?
Jack Santino: It is generally accepted that the most influential forerunner to Halloween is the Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced "Sawin"). The Celts were the ancestors of today's Irish Welsh, and Scottish, among others, and Samhain, on November 1, was both the first day of winter and the first day of the New Year. It was believed that the souls or spirits of those who had died during the year previous were now allowed access to the world of spirits. So spirits were wandering on the eve of Nov. 1, and people would leave their fires lit and put food and drink on the table for any family members who happened by. Ireland was converted to Christianity in the early centuries of the first millennium, and the Christian church tended to believe that people who held non-Christian beliefs had been deceived by the Devil. So the idea of evil was added into the mix. Eventually, the church set the Feast of All Saints, or All Hallows on November 1, and October 31 was known as Hallo Even, or Hallowe'en.
TheoFantastique: Unfortunately, many fundamentalist and evangelical Christians tend to focus on the Pagan origins and elements of Halloween to the exclusion of a variety of other elements, while also ignoring the continually evolving nature of the holiday as it takes new forms and meaning in American culture. How would you respond to this narrow interpretive lens through which some view the holiday?
Jack Santino: I understand people's objection to Halloween insofar as they believe strongly in the existence of a literal Devil who is engaged in an effort to steal our souls. But I was raised in a religious atmosphere where that simply was not a problem with the celebration. I tend to view it as a healthy occasion for the parading and confronting of aspects of life -- symbolically -- that we usually pretend don't exist. Also, Halloween is tied closely to harvest imagery, and I think the lesson is that, as the natural world faces death as a part of ongoing life, so must we. Halloween is many things. It allows us to mock our fears, and to celebrate life. There is room for parody and topical satire in the costumes and displays. But it also deals with deeply important issues involving life and death, nature and culture.
TheoFantastique: What does the increasing popularity of Halloween say about Americans if we understand Halloween in part as a vehicle "for the expression of personal, social, and cultural identity?"
Jack Santino: I think a lot of the popularity of Halloween is due to the maturing of the baby-boom generation. People who had fun after WWII and in the 1950s and 1960s seem to have decided not to give this up. In addition, the U.S. is a consumerist society. I have noticed that when people start to do something en masse, commercial entities jump on it pretty quickly. So when people started decorating with homemade dummies, it wasn't long before mass-produced Halloween figures began to appear in the department stores. Likewise, as people began decorating more elaborately for the autumn season, electric outdoor lights, similar to those of Christmas, were offered.
TheoFantastique: How does Halloween compare with similar festivals and celebrations in other cultures?
Jack Santino: Halloween compares in a couple of ways. Many countries observe Halloween; it was very popular and important in Ireland long before it was widely-known in the US. Most Catholic countries observe certain rituals and customs for All Saints Day and also All Souls Day on November 2. These may involve visiting the family graves, for instance, and not resemble the current American Halloween at all. We are becoming increasingly aware of the Latino Day of the Dead celebrations (Dia de los Muertos), which are reminiscent of the U.S. Halloween in some ways but very different in others. On the other hand, many countries have celebrations that are reminiscent of Halloween but are different occasions, such as Walpurgisnacht in Germany (May 1). And the way Halloween is celebrated in street festivals in the U.S. reminds me of Mardi Gras in Louisiana and elsewhere.
TheoFantastique: Some scholars have applied the work of anthropologist Victor Turner and his notion of liminality to Halloween. Might the process of entering a liminal space and engaging in costuming as a process of social inversion in some instances account for the popularity of Halloween among adults? I was surprised to find the holiday and related items, like the haunted attraction industry, to be huge in Utah after my relocation from northern California. This is a religiously and culturally conservative state, and might the aspect of liminality and social inversion be part of the appeal in this state's context?
Jack Santino: Yes, I think there is enormous appeal to adults to being allowed in this period of license to break everyday social rules. I see people working in banks on Halloween dressed as moose. I see grown-ups turning there homes into haunted houses and actually scaring children. I see people who keep their front yards impeccable and the lawns trimmed to the appearance of a golf course put fake gravestones and hang ghoulish monster on their property. At any other time of the year they would have the police at their door. But at Halloween, they have friends and neighbors congratulating them on their creativity.
TheoFantastique: Dr. Santino, thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts. I hope the readers will pick up a copy of your book on the topic so that they will have a broader understanding of the history and multicultural influences of Halloween as we near the month of October.

- Region: Washing affirmed its 'AA' rating on Chelan County Public Utility District No. 1 (Chelan or the district), Wash.'s Rocky Reach hydroelectric system revenue bonds and Rock Island hydroelectric system revenue bonds. The outlook is stable. Securing each project's debt separately is the respective project's output. The rating reflects our view of each project's superior economics, stable financial performance even under poor water conditions, take-or-pay off-taker contracts for most of projects' capacity, and physical attributes and operational practices that substantially mitigate the risk of production curtailment due to unit outage or environmental requirements. In our opinion, the two projects' credit strengths include the following: Historical production costs that are very low we expect to remain highly...

Among all the herbs, celery has the highest nutritional value, and is good for maintaining overall health. As per the botanical classification celery belongs to the Apiaceae family. It is from the genus or specie of Apium graveolens. It is also called smallage, marsh parsley and wild celery.
Chinese and Indian cultures consider it to be an herb. Celery leaves have an aromatic flavor and they grow from seeds into a bulbous stock. The leaves can grow up to 50 centimeters in length. The green white flowers usually have grayish brown seeds. All the parts of the plants are used, including the stock, seeds and leaves. The seeds are used in cooking, garnishing and as well as oil production. The leaves and stock are also used.
Celery is an aromatic herb that helps to cure blood pressure, stimulate the uterus, relieve problems with indigestion, and also is an aphrodisiac. It does have sedative effects also and that is why can kill pain caused due to rheumatism. It contains ingredients like monoterpenes, flavonoids, butylpthalids and coumarins. These ingredients have several therapeutic uses.
Celery can also be used as an external application to cure fungal infections and tumors. Celery is widely used in the Indian alternative medicine like Ayurveda. It is used to cure bronchitis, asthma, and also as a nerve tonic. The oil from the celery seeds can tone the nervous system and also make the immune system stronger. Having a spoonful of celery paste or seed powder can have long term positive effects on the health.

SANTA MONICA, Calif., Feb. 13, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Consumer Watchdog is calling on the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission to block Comcast's deal to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion because it is anticompetitive and not in the public interest.
"Combining the two largest cable television providers into one company would create an unjustifiable monopoly that would have unfair power over consumers who would inevitably see prices rise and bad service get even worse," said John M. Simpson, Consumer Watchdog's Privacy Project. "The implications for broadband access to the Internet where we in the United States pay more for slower speeds than most of the rest of the industrialized world are dire. Comcast would have no incentive to improve broadband service and would have the power to do what it wants."
The Justice Department must review the proposed deal considering competitive issues and decide whether it would violate antitrust law. The FCC has a broader mandate and must determine whether the deal is in the public interest.
"This deal may be good for Time Warner's shareholders and Wall Street fat cats, but there is no way creating this media juggernaut can be considered in the public interest," said Simpson.

When asked to share one of our favorite Cincinnati hidden gems, it didn’t take us long to figure out what we would write about. Instantly we knew what it had to be…. when it comes to dining-related hidden gems in Cincinnati, look no further than food trucks! Not only are food trucks perfect for families with picky eaters, but they are fun and affordable too! For our Livin In The Cin mission we met up with Emily Frank, owner of C’est Cheese Food Truck. On this particular evening C’est Cheese was serving up it’s ooey, gooey cheesy goodness out front of Mad Tree Brewing in Norwood.
If you haven’t had the chance to experience it, C’est Cheese is a food truck dedicated to serving up gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches, soups and home made pickles. All of their items are made to order while you wait. Best of all, these are no ordinary grilled cheese sandwiches. C’est Cheese takes it up a notch with ingredients like smoked gouda, caramelized onions, basil infused honey, pesto, brie and even hot dogs!
Our experience
For our trip to C’est Cheese Food Truck it was myself and my two boys, ages 8 and 10. We arrived to Mad Tree Brewing around 5:30pm and even though there was a line, it moved quickly and before you knew it, it was our turn. We were greeted by the owner, Emily Frank, whose customer service skills were impressive. Even though she was quite busy she greeted us right away and even made it a point to chat with my boys.
For our order we requested a Green Lantern ($6) and two Cheesy Wonders ($5 ea). The boys also each got a drink. All three of us were happy with our selections. The grilled cheeses were hot and gooey (you want to see the cheese stretch….) and tasted great. As we dug in, things got silent – always a sure sign of a good meal. The sandwiches were somewhat large and we ended up taking 1/2 of one home for Dad to eat.
When things died down, Emily was kind enough to invite the boys in to check out her truck. They’d never been in one before and thought it was pretty cool to see a mobile kitchen. Emily also took time to answer a few questions for us.
Emily Frank, Owner of C’est Cheese Food Truck
When did you start C’est Cheese?
“C’est Cheese got it’s start in July of last year. It’s hard to believe it but we’re actually getting ready to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. We’ll be having a celebration on Sunday, July 28th at Mad Tree Brewing.” You can view the Anniversary party details here.
Where are people most likely to find you?
“The best way to find us is to check out our calendar at. We also post updates regularly to our Facebook and Twitter accounts.”
Can people get C’est Cheese year round?
“Because of the weather, our season typically runs March – October. During that time you can usually find us serving up grilled cheeses six days a week.”
Do you just go downtown?
“You can find us all over town. It’s not uncommon for us to be working from office parks in Blue Ash, Milford, Anderson or West Chester. We also do the food truck rally in Covington.”
When you are working from an office park, are you still open to the public?
“Absolutely! Everyone is welcome to stop by.”
What is the best way to find food trucks?
“The best way to find food trucks is to check out their Facebook or Twitter feed. Most trucks will share where they are working from there. If you are looking to connect with a food truck for a private event, you can also check out the Cincinnati Food Truck Association on Facebook.“
While we are big fans of C’est Cheese, Cincinnati is lucky to be home to quite a few food trucks. As a matter a fact, in doing our research for this post, we found more than twenty of them. Choices and variety are a plenty and you are sure to find something for everyone when it comes to Food Truck dining. Some of our favorites include Bones Burgers (amazing grass-fed burgers), Cafe de Wheels (love their Cuban sandwich and sweet potato fries), Fireside Pizza Wagon (they have this pear/Gorgonzola pizza…OMG), Queen City Cookies (SO.GOOD) and SugarSnap! Truck (cupcakes to die for).
Food trucks can be found all over town. We frequent them at Washington Park as well as at various events such as Crafty Supermarket. You can even find them at Farmer’s Markets and at Findlay.
If after reading this you’re wanting to check out food trucks for yourself, check out this comprehensive listing of Cincinnati food trucks we put together on Family Friendly Cincinnati: Cincinnati Food Trucks Directory.

This post was inspired by our Livin’ in the Cin mission to discover and share a Cincinnati dining hidden gem..
My name is Lana Heckman and I am a member of the Harmony Social Committee. I live in Harmony Subdivision in Union, Ky about 17 miles from Cincinnati. Every year we have an October/Halloween event, this year’s is slated for October 26th, and I wondered if you would be interested in coming with your food truck to provide grilled cheese and your other menu items for our event? This isn’t the only event we have throughout the year so there are several opportunities to score work/money from our community and it is feasible to do this two ways. Please contact me if you are interested in learning more about becoming a sponsor and getting free advertising or about the opportunity of coming to the event to make sales for cash.
Thank you for your time,
Lana Heckman

I will have to mangle the names. Can someone make a case why the names should be generalized?
15:47:19 [hak]
Gary: it is possible but a pain to handle such quirks
15:47:42 [ChrisW]
did we deal with this: 1. PRD prohibits member (#) in rule heads. Core allows it. I think
15:47:42 [ChrisW]
Core must follow PRD here.
15:47:57 [hak]
DaveReynolds: integers as slots in frames are not really an issue
15:48:34 [hak]
CSMA: Core does not have numbers at all
15:48:48 [sandro]
The alphabet of the presentation language of RIF-Core is the alphabet of the RIF-BLD presentation language with the exclusion of the symbol ## (subclass) and the set of symbols ArgNames (used for named-argument uniterms).

15:51:34 [hak]
DTB reviewers ?
15:52:25 [hak]
Chris: there were issues about lists
15:52:55 [hak]
Chris: prefers cons-like lists to numerical index
15:53:27 [DaveReynolds]
+1 to put in append
15:53:41 [hak]
Sandro: indexed lists are useful for efficient insertion ...
15:54:07 [csma]
q?
15:54:33 [ChrisW]
add an append function to DTB for lists
15:55:14 [ChrisW]
...instead of having numerical indexes that go past the end of the list
15:55:28 [sandro]
Sandro: the reason for the rule about too-high-indexes being reduced is that it lets you use insert-before like append.
15:56:19 [Gary]
I think append(list, element) = concatenate(list, make-list(element))
15:56:33 [AxelPolleres]
There is a statement in DTB Sec 1.2.1:
15:56:33 [AxelPolleres]
* rif:iri (,
... ... ... A rif:iri
15:56:33 [AxelPolleres]
constant must be interpreted as a reference to one and the same
15:56:34 [AxelPolleres]

15:57:01 [sandro]
true, Gary

Axel: already dropped the text from the DTB document
16:02:12 [AxelPolleres]
Here two more TODOs which are less clear:
16:02:12 [AxelPolleres]
* Speaking of "primitive datatypes" should be avoided
16:02:12 [AxelPolleres]
We call our datatypes "primitive" but this is not in compliance with
16:02:12 [AxelPolleres]
16:02:12 [AxelPolleres]
since we also use "primitive" for what are actually "ordinary" datatypes following XSD. I suggest we just speak about datatypes.
16:02:13 [AxelPolleres]
* in my BLD review, I suggested that the Base Directive should refer to *absolute* iri:
16:02:15 [AxelPolleres]
"where iri is a unicode string in the form of an *absolute* IRI
16:02:17 [AxelPolleres]
[RFC-3987]."
16:02:45 [AdrianP]
I would propose to call it simple datatypes
16:04:24 [ChrisW]
action: axel rename "primitive" datatypes to datatypes
16:04:24 [trackbot]
Created ACTION-816 - Rename "primitive" datatypes to datatypes [on Axel Polleres - due 2009-05-26].

16:06:07 [csma]
q?
16:06:28 [ChrisW]
michael is back one issue
16:08:49 [sandro]
MichaelKifer, I think XML has "complex types" not "complex datatypes". datatypes seems to be the same as "simple types"

MK: there is an issue about short names ... need to check with Axel ... should be moved out
16:20:13 [hak]
Axel: not see a problem
16:20:14 [ChrisW]
"The short name of a symbol space is an NCName, typically the character sequence after the last '/' or '#' in the symbol space IRI (similar to the XML local name part of a QName). "
16:21:29 [hak]
MK: problem is with symbol space for short names
16:21:51 [hak]
Axel: where do you suggest we put them ?
16:22:37 [hak]
MK: they should not be in the definition of the symbol space ... the problem is that short names in BLD and FLD do not coincide then
16:23:16 [hak]
ChrisW: do not understand what the issue is
16:23:39 [hak]
CSMA: nothing references them - why do we have them ?
16:23:58 [hak]
ChrisW: they are not formal - just a handy thing
16:24:17 [hak]
Axel: need them for other sections
16:24:46 [hak]
ChrisW: just list all the datatypes and their short names there
16:25:17 [hak]
Axel: we can do why MK suggests cleaning up the definition
16:25:35 [hak]
MK: yes but move them to the preamble
16:26:08 [hak]
CSMA: are any of these short names different from the names of the datatypes ?

Axel: no
16:26:51 [hak]
ChrisW: I still do not understand the issue ! they are just handy things

16:42:18 [sandro]
# the external predicate pred:list-contains has the valid binding pattern (b, u).
16:42:22 [AdrianP]
The Terms of RIF-Core are the terms of RIF-BLD with the exclusion of subclass terms and of terms with named arguments.

He has been in conversation with Michael Hyatt who recently switched from the Tablet PC to a Mac Powerbook and he’s written an article that addresses some of the reasons that Michael has given for the switch.
One of the statements that caught my eye was the claim that Michael makes that whipping out a Tablet PC in a meeting is often distracting and thus defeats the purpose of using a Tablet in that setting. It has me thinking about my experience and I have to say quite the opposite is true for me. I have attended countless meetings where at least one attendant pulls out a laptop and goes through the motions of getting set up for note taking and that is always very distracting. Then you have the constant clacking of the keys throughout the meeting and it is especially distracting, especially for those sitting near the clacker. Tablet PCs can be whipped out silently, and after a minute of resuming from Standby can be used like any other note pad of paper. It’s completely silent operation with ink makes everyone forget about it almost instantly and it’s a non-factor during the meeting. A notebook computer on the other hand when used in a meeting sets up an effective barrier between the user and the rest of the group and is a definite factor in how the meeting progresses. I am curious to know what you readers think about this and what is your experience in this regard?Wes Anderson's filmography will have a tiny Owen Wilson–less patch in Moonrise Kingdom, but that's it for now.

SPCA volunteers will be hitting the streets tomorrow as part of a three day street collection.
The SPCA Paws Appeal is being held on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and aims to raise $200,000 to meet increasing demand for its services.
''Last year we raised $120,000 thanks to the generosity of Aucklanders,'' SPCA Auckland chief executive Christine Kalin says.
''This year we have set ourselves an ambitious target of $200,000 for the simple reason that our costs keep going up and the number of animals we receive continues to rise.
''To help us meet this target we have asked for more volunteer collectors this year and Aucklanders have answered our call with more than 1,000 already signed up. Last year we had just under 800 volunteers so this is a huge increase. Thank you Auckland.''
SPCA Auckland cares for animals lost, abandoned, injured, or abused in the Auckland region from Wellsford to Port Waikato.
Between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012, SPCA Auckland cared for 18,538 animals, microchipped 3,995 animals, and returned 321 stray animals to their owners.
During that same period SPCA Auckland inspectors travelled 380,373 km within the region investigating cases of animal neglect, abuse, abandonment, and injury.
The organisation also achieved an impressive 100 per cent success rate in bringing prosecutions against people who abused animals in their care.
''We provide an essential service for Auckland every day - but we need help. Our annual budget amounts to several million dollars but we receive no automatic government funding,'' Ms Kalin says.
''So we are appealing to members of the public to carry cash this Friday, Saturday and Sunday and give it up for SPCA Auckland.
''For those who prefer to donate online, our website at spca.org.nz makes it super easy.
''Many thanks in advance to the people of Auckland for their ongoing generosity and support.''

Practice Management Feature — June 2014
Tex Med. 2014;110(6):35-38.
By Kara NuzbackReporter
Databases crash; backups fail. Sometimes, the very tools designed to help a practice operate smoothly from day to day can cause the biggest disruption themselves.
Are you and your staff doing everything you can to make sure your electronic health record (EHR) system doesn't botch prescription information or confuse one patient with another? If you're not sure, a new toolkit can help you find out.
The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) released a free toolkit in January to help health care organizations identify and mitigate patient safety risks associated with EHRs. The Safety Assurance Factors for EHR Resilience (SAFER) guides are available online.
Houston internist Hardeep Singh, MD, helped develop the guides, which he says can improve the quality and safety of EHRs in a real-world practice setting.
Dr. Singh is a patient safety researcher at the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness and Safety at the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center and an associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine.
For the past five years, he has researched EHR-related patient safety risks, one of which involves clinician entry of inconsistent prescription information in the EHR system. If a physician wants to prescribe warfarin, for example, the EHR's order entry interface likely includes a drop-down menu to select the drug's strength, commonly 5 or 10 milligrams, Dr. Singh says.
While physicians select the dosage from an electronic list of selections, they also may write free-text notes to clarify the dose, which can contradict the electronic selection.
"This contradictory order introduces ambiguity," he said.
An ambiguous prescription leaves pharmacists and patients confused and patients at risk.
Even without ambiguity, a computer glitch or a typographical error could change a prescription from 3.0 milligrams to 30, or an EHR alert system could become an annoyance to a physician who begins to ignore the alerts and overlooks an important drug interaction notification.
Because EHR systems are new and continually evolving, Dr. Singh says, "introducing technology into health care is complex," and health care professionals are just now beginning to understand new types of unintended consequences resulting from the use of EHRs.
ONC sponsored the SAFER project to develop practical tools for practicing clinicians and hospitals. The tools allow physicians to close loopholes in the practice's EHR system that could put patients at risk.
"SAFER guides help us anticipate and deal with consequences," Dr. Singh said. "The goal is to develop guidelines for the front lines."
A Team Approach
Each SAFER guide includes a recommended practice checklist that you can download and use to assess a practice's EHR system safety components. For example, a checklist item might say, "The status of orders can be tracked in the system." The user can rate the item as fully, partially, or not implemented, depending on the EHR's capability.
If the practice has not fully implemented orders tracking in the system, or if the user is unsure, an accompanying Recommended Practice worksheet provides guidance on the importance of tracking orders and suggestions for resources to provide more information about it.
Clinicians can save the Recommended Practice worksheet for further review and forward it to others. (See "Practice Makes Perfect.")
The authors of the SAFER guides — Dr. Singh; Dean Sittig, PhD; and Joan Ash, PhD — recommend setting up a multidisciplinary team for each of the nine guides to evaluate which of the recommended practices are already being done and which practices need to be implemented to strengthen patient safety.
For example, Dr. Singh says, the Test Results Reporting guide team could consist of one or more clinicians, information technology staff, lab personnel, practice leaders or administrators, and an EHR vendor.
Dr. Singh says it is important to have meaningful conversations on safety with all the stakeholders involved, including EHR vendors.
After completing the checklist in each guide, the multidisciplinary team can use the Team Worksheet included in each guide to document its assessment. The Team Worksheet allows the group to assign a team leader; identify team members and their roles; record the self-assessment completion date; and add notes about considerations, conclu¬sions, pending software updates, and more.
Small practices should start with the High Priority Practices guide, which poses questions about computer downtime, backup availability, and procedures to ensure correct patient identification. Practices can then see which EHR safety hazards need to be addressed immediately, Dr. Singh says.
After users review the High Priority Practices guide, they can complete the remaining guides in order of where patient safety risks are likely to occur in the system, he says.
The Grand Challenge
Dallas pediatrician Joseph Schneider, MD, chair of TMA's Council on Practice Management Services, says physicians must select an EHR system carefully and use the SAFER guides to make sure they implement the system correctly.
Dr. Schneider hopes the guides become a popular tool among physicians, but he says it's too early to tell how effective they will be.
"They won't take care of everything, but if they can help you avoid one or two major problems, then the time people spend looking at them is probably worth their weight in gold," he said. "In my years of using EHRs, I've selected the wrong form of medicine more than once because of poor EHR design."
Dr. Schneider says typographical errors are easy to make in EHR systems and can be hard to correct. For example, he says, a staff member might intend to enter a premature infant's weight as 4.1 pounds but forget the decimal and enter 41 pounds. The bad data might not be noticeable until weeks or months later, perhaps when the growth chart shows a spike where one should not exist, he says. By then, it might be too late to change the data.
"In the paper world, you would never write '41 pounds' for a two-month-old," he said. "Not all systems are clever enough to alert you that you can't have a 41-pound two-month-old."
But most EHR systems are not capable of summarizing patient information or suggesting treatments to better aid physicians, says Dr. Sittig, a professor at The University of Texas School of Biomedical Informatics.
"That's what I call a grand challenge. That's what computers are supposed to be able to do," he said.
According to "Electronic Health Records and National Patient-Safety Goals," a 2012 New England Journal of Medicine article by Drs. Sittig and Singh, the number of certified EHR vendors in the United States increased from 60 in 2008 to more than 1,000 in 2012. The article says many vendors focus on using EHR technology to achieve meaningful use requirements instead of focusing on patient safety.
Dr. Sittig says EHRs are a relatively new form of technology. Ultimately, he hopes EHRs will be able to recommend treatments for individual patients, much like Amazon can suggest books based on what the customer has already read.
"The first thing we have to do is get people to use the computer system," he said.
Most physicians are not computer experts, and many doctors who have a 20-year history of using a paper system are likely finding it difficult to transition to EHRs, he says.
"In the old days, the doctor would scribble on a piece of paper or call in the nurse," Dr. Sittig said. "The computer is now requiring people to do more work than before, and it's a new kind of work."
Even with minimal computer experience, physicians know it should not be as hard as it often is to use EHRs, Dr. Sittig says. The SAFER guides empower physicians to expect more from their EHR system, including the fast processing of information.
"It should take less than a second to get lab results on the screen," he said.
By allowing physicians to expect more, the guides can give professionals the confidence to call their IT staff or EHR vendor and demand the systems be fixed or upgraded when they encounter flaws, Dr. Sittig says, adding the more knowledgeable doctors are about EHRs, the less they will stand for glitches.
But that doesn't mean doctors can pass all the responsibility. Basic typing skills and time commitment are pivotal to ensuring the systems operate correctly.
"The guides require more work, and they're going to require physicians to invest more money, and they require EHR vendors to offer some new features," he said.
Dr. Sittig believes that if health professionals implement and regularly review the SAFER guides for the next five years, superior EHR technology will hit the market.
"Eventually, better systems are really going to improve patient care," he said.
Dr. Singh says he foresees three phases in the evolution of EHRs: Develop safe technology, learn how to use it safely, and monitor and measure its performance.
"It's a starting point," he said. "We think this process of evolution is going to be long but fruitful and will improve patient care and health outcomes."

Practice Makes Perfect
Health professionals in any practice setting can use the Safety Assurance Factors for EHR Resilience (SAFER) guides to assess the organization's electronic health record (EHR)-related patient safety risks based on a list of recommended practices. Health care professionals do not need to review the guides and implement the best practices in any specific order, says Hardeep Singh, MD. Each of the nine SAFER guides analyzes a specific EHR system component:

Former Vice President Walter Mondale was sharply critical of the Reagan Administration’s freeze on the delivery of four F-16 jet fighters that had been scheduled to go to Israel last month. Speaking to reporters here, he said, “I am opposed and always have been, to withholding essential security assistance to Israel to try to achieve other political purposes.”
Mondale, who is here to analyze Israel’s election results for American television and to receive an honorary doctorate from the Hebrew University, observed that “Our two nations ought to respect each other. If we do have differences — as we will from time to time — we ought to go at it as equals,” otherwise the U.S. would undermine the basis of trust.
Mondale met with Premier Menachem Begin and with President Yitzhak Navon. Earlier, Begin told a group of visiting U.S. Congressmen that Israel will honor its promise to give special envoy Philip Habib more time to find a peaceful solution to Israel’s missile dispute with Syria. Habib, who was recalled to Washington during Israel’s elections, is due to return to the region this week.DC Funk Parade

Review Gallery
Rigler’s mould-forms call simultaneously to industry and architecture, to engineering as well as sculpture. With their strict, efficient lines, they reflect on robotic replication... (F. Jardine 2012)
In autumn of 2012 James Rigler installed some new ceramic pieces in Pollok House, the Maxwell’s Georgian manor in Pollok Country Park. These works, predominantly glossy and highly-glazed, respond directly to the genteel architectural embellishments in the house. They include a newly-tiled floor in the china closet; a lantern (or cage) for the eagle grasping the pendant light in the main hall; and a hanging garland of flowers that reflects the preoccupation inside the house with floral decoration.
These ceramics will be installed at The Lighthouse, challenging Rigler to re-position the site-specific works within the 1990’s architecture of the Review Gallery. James Rigler studied Architecture at the Bartlett School, 3D Craft at the University of Brighton and gained an MA in Ceramics and Glass at the Royal College of Art. His work is in public and private collections, including the V&A and Chatsworth House, Derbyshire. In 2011 he was Craft Resident at Cove Park, and awarded the Jerwood Prize for Making.

Hello Grokette_wannabe! I'm pretty new, too. I complete my 2nd week today. So scale appt. tomorrow morning 6 am sharp
Anyway - not sure if this will help you or not, but my first week I made sure to concentrate on having more protein at each meal then I ever did before & added to the veggies to that. The high protein kept me from starving between meals after the 1st couple days (1st days I allowed a handful of nuts between meals if I felt hungry). I found that it was easy in the second week to eat smaller meals and not needing to snack as much. I also found I sometimes wanted to skip meals. I never had the carb-flu, either. (probably just lucky on that point). Anyway - best of luck on your continued Primal journey.

Do you drink coffee or tea: Green tea with lemon regularly
Motivator for switching to Primal: I got tired of the plateaus of the other "diets" (Abs Diet, vegetarian, whole grain everything, etc.) and still felt deprived of energy, still had intestinal issues, still just didn't feel "right"... I just wanted to get lean and toned and feel better.
Favorite exercise: Anything outside... love trail running in my VFFs!
Favorite Primal food: There are so many... nothing beats grass-fed beef/steaks... I also really dig spaghetti squash and homemade sauce!
Best part about being Primal: No more post-lunch carb coma, better sleep, better play, better body composition, odd looks when I have to eat out and order a bunless burger, eating eggs and bacon for breakfast, no more intestinal distress or gas, creating Primal meals, Elevation Burger is 5 minutes away from the office, Big Ass Salads, having my doctor shocked at my awesome blood profile without whole grains.
Worst part about being Primal: Eating out is no doubt the biggest challenge. Red Robin and Elevation Burger have saved the day many times. I wish more places offered lettuce wraps for burgers. Otherwise, I'd rather starve and/or wait to get home and cook. Another pet peeve of mine... having people ask how I got to be in such great shape, and then they either say "I couldn't live without my bread/pasta/pizza/other carb-and-sugar-laden food" or "I'm gonna have to do that" and then have a million excuses as to why they couldn't a few weeks later.
The Questions:
Your location: Sacramento, Ca.
Age (If you want):41
How Primal are you:somewhat
Do you consume dairy:yes, in my coffee. And also the occasional cheeses.
Do you drink coffee or tea:both
Motivator for switching to Primal:weight gain
Favorite exercise:circuits and weight training
Favorite Primal food:chicken
Best part about being Primal:the satiety
Worst part about being Primal: no grains or rice.
I think I'm doing it all wrong cause I've been gaining weight versus losing. I don't know what else to do. So I hope this forum will help me in figuring out what I'm doing wrong this whole time.
Thanks,
Chunli1972
Your location: Seattle
Age (If you want): 38
How Primal are you: 50-60% at present.
Do you consume dairy: Flavored creamer in my coffee and various cheeses.
Do you drink coffee or tea: Coffee 2-3 times a day and tea when it suits me (sometimes every day, sometimes once a month).
Motivator for switching to Primal: Hitting 460lbs with various permanent injuries that hinder most basic exercises, thus needing a diet that could shed a decent amount of the fat with little-to-no exercise.
Favorite exercise: At present, wrist/arm curls for rebuilding my arms after an auto accident last year put me in a place where neither arm had much strength left.
Favorite Primal food: Vanilla cream flavored whey protein smoothies made with frozen mixed berries and unsweetened vanilla almond milk.
Best part about being Primal: It works. Last year (before the accident mentioned above) I started a primal diet, going cold turkey on everything wrong in my normal diet and going hardcore on primal foods. The result? I lost 52lbs in two months. Once the accident occurred injuries & depression put me in a bad spot and I regained it all plus more. The past three months I've been steadily ramping up the primal in my diet again and am once again loosing weight, down another 45lbs so far this time.
Worst part about being Primal: Not being able to eat my roommate's awesome cooking!539 studies found for: (elderly OR senior) AND osteoporosis AND (woman OR women OR female)

About This Book
The classic story of Dracula, introduced here by Walter Dean Myers, still chills the soul. Dead for centuries...yet still he walks the earth. He is a vampire — brilliant, bloodthirsty, and cruel, hiding from the light of day and emerging at night to search for his next victims.
Count Dracula enlists the aid of a solicitor who will secure a house for him in London, where the Count intends to have his sway with some of the many people inhabiting that teeming city. By becoming involved with Dracula, Jonathan Harker learns of the true horror of the Count's power, but little does he know just how far the monster's power will reach.
Bram Stoker's fictional account of Count Dracula is based on vampire mythology and is constructed of many voices and impressions. The novel is a collection of journal entries and letters, penned by characters who become acquainted with the infamous Count Dracula. The book opens upon the journal of Englishman Jonathan Harker, who records, often in meticulous detail, his visit to the Count for the purpose of officiating over a land transaction. As he makes his way through the Carpathian Mountains, "one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe," to the Castle Dracula, he accepts a crucifix from a peasant woman, who implores him not to continue.
Harker at last meets Dracula. He's strong faced, with a "mouth... fixed and rather cruel looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed an astonishing vitality in a man of his years." Eventually, the Count will insinuate himself into Harker's life in England, turning Harker's associate's wife, Lucy, into one of the Undead, and eventually trying to win the love of and eventual dominion over Jonathan Harker's own bride, Mina, who will continually elude his grasp.
Stoker's interpretation of the myth is powerful because it allows evil to remain mysterious. What readers do learn is that this is a world where simple, virtuous action has little impact, and that, dramatically, it is only the old magic — crucifixes, garlic, and wooden stakes — that will ward off evil.
Published in 1897, Bram Stoker's hypnotic tale of the vampire Count — cunning, meticulous, intelligent, and imaginative — who embodies both the carnal and non-carnal worlds, moving freely in both, yet belonging to neither, endures a century later in this quintessential story of suspense and horror.

Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014)Samsung Android and processor It's running the latest Android 4.3 Jelly Bean (and expected to upgrade to 4.4 KitKat early in 2014) but as usual Samsung has overlaid its TouchWiz interface over the top. It's a busy and distinctive UI that some will find unnecessary but extras like the shortcut tray you pull out from the side don't distract from basic Android, only enhance it.You also get a lot of extras, including Multi Window (two app windows on one screen), Polaris Office 5, dual-screen media sharing app Group Play, plus S Note and Sketchbook, which make good use of the S Pen stylus hidden away in a neat slot on the side and the generally reliable handwriting recognition software.The 1.9GHz quad-core processor is backed by a full 3GB RAM which puts it right up there with some of the best we've come across. Our AnTuTu benchmark test gave it a score of 32,395 -- a little behind the Galaxy Note 3 but still among the highest we've yet seen. But even so, the processor didn't seem to perform quite as well as it should do, considering the spec, and there were occasional instances of slight lag. It's not terrible by any means, this is still a very fast and powerful device, but the fact that it happened at all came as a surprise. Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014) test photoDave Oliver Photography There's now an 8-megapixel camera on the back with autofocus and an LED flash, plus a good range of Samsung settings. Picture quality is pretty good, making it almost seem worthwhile having a quality camera on a tablet for once. There's also a 2-megapixel camera on the front for video calls.The large 8220mAh battery held up well, seeing us comfortably through around a day and a half of steady use.Conclusion The Galaxy Note 10.1 is one of the best-specced and most powerful tablets available. It's not cheap, and it doesn't have the high-quality metallic casing of the iPad Air, but it has a feast of features and the ability to handle them all very well indeed.

- 0
Sun 27th Mar, 2011 in Event Reviews
MF Doom’s first tour to Australia was plagued with doubt after the postponing of the east coast shows due to the performer’s ill health. Perth fans were left with uncertainty while waiting for a significant amount of time before he arrived onstage, well after 12am. The crowd were restless and cries of “Doom” could have been confused with booing, although there was always a certain feeling of anticipation.
When Doom came onstage, there was no announcement of illness, no explanation with regards to the postponements of previous gigs and no explanation for why he was late. Perhaps we will never know and because it was his first show in Australia, no-one could tell whether he was in standard Doom form or not.
The support acts had a couple of rappers along with someone on the decks, allowing for the dynamics naturally occuring between the three. The rapping took center stage with not much variety in the musical backing.Layla [SBX] and Dazastah were on early together, and it was a fiery pairing with this fierce lady showing that boys can be challenged at the game and she was certainly not afraid to tell it like it is. As early as it was, they were able to get a rise from the crowd who appreciated their skills. Next act up was Simplex who kept things pretty simple, stripped back and getting on with it. Briggs was a treat, upping the energy with some cheekiness and amping up the crowd with the vibrancy coming off the stage.
Of course Doom was the main event and the crowd responded amazingly to him, everyone bouncing in sync, without needing much encouragement. He wore his signature metal mask that did look quite sinister, although his onstage presence was not. In plain t-shirt and jeans, Doom’s mask stood out as a disguise, rather than the costume of an alterior persona. He had a sidekick and they bounced off each other, taking turns with the rhymes and interacting together with the audience, pretending to push each other out to surf the crowd.
The fans loved it, hands in the air, filling in missing lyrics when called on like the loyal followers they are. It seemed all was forgiven re his tardy arrival; now they had their Doom fix they were happy.
Overall it was a night of stripped back hip hop, going back to the roots of rhymes bouncing back and forth. His lyricism was admirable and for a supposedly sick man, he looked to be in fairly good spirits. We can only imagine what he’d be like in perfect health.

Chairman House Committee on Banking and Currency, Sir Jones Onyereri
By Ernest Chinwo
The House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Currency has said it is not happy with the volume of dirty naira notes in circulation.
The committee said it had observed that while the Nigeria Security Printing and Minting Company (NSPMC) had been printing new notes, there were no new notes in circulation in the country.
Chairman of the committee, Sir Jones Onyereri, expressed the concern when he led other members of the committee on an oversight function to the Port Harcourt branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the weekend.
“We are very worried. We went to the NSPMC and the truth is that they keep printing new notes but we do not see this in circulation. We are worried,” he said.
He said the matter needed to be addressed as the quality of naira notes in circulation in the country did not portray a good image for the CBN and the country at large.
Onyereri said the committee decided to visit branches of the CBN to see the operations of the apex bank and ensure that it was well prepared to serve the needs of the country.
He also expressed surprise that key departments of the bank were complaining of being under staffed when millions of Nigerians were seeking for employment and said the committee would take up the issue to ensure that the bank was living up to its mandate.
On the issue of the introduction of new N5,000 notes, Onyereri said the issue had been foreclosed as the CBN had not made any statements about the new currency notes.
“We put a stop to the introduction of N5000 notes. For now, no going back on it. The Central Bank has not said anything about it. So until then, until new information is available to the National Assembly, the matter is closed,” he said.
The Port Harcourt Branch Controller of CBN, Mr. Kennet Effa, had in his address said the treasury and other departments of the branch did not have enough manpower to carry out its duties.
He said the branch was also having challenges in getting adequate police security for its operations because of competing demands by international oil companies operating in Rivers State.
He also listed ageing fleet of bullion vans as a major challenge to the operations of the branch but said the branch had no mandate to procure such items as they were usually purchased centrally and distributed to the branches.
On the dirty naira notes in circulation, Effa explained that what the NSPMC supplies to the CBN was not enough to ensure clean notes in circulation.
He also added that many commercial banks were not ready to follow the procedures and make the necessary deposits to collect new currency notes from the CBN.
He also said some members of the public were contributing to the dearth of new notes in circulation as they refused to spend any new notes that they collect from the banks, instead preferring to keep them in their houses.

Compare Prices on Freedom of the Seas Western Caribbean Cruises
Freedom of the Seas - Western Caribbean
Let me say Embarkation was amazing, 10 minutes we were on the ship. This ship is beautiful, and has many things to do. Even with 4300 people on board it never really seemed crowded. Never had problems finding chairs by the pool, or seats in the Arcadia theatre.
The food is below average even in the formal dining room. This was my 6th cruise and RCCL has the worst food in my opinion, but the food in Chopps Grill ($25 per person) was excellent. Well worth trying.
Ports of call were all nice, Labadee was better than I expected, but don't shop at the market. The locals who sell their things there are extremely pushy, but very negotiable. If they're asking $10 they will take about $3. Ocho Rios did the Dunns River Falls with City Highlights and that was a lot of fun, would recommend that. We don't normally do the excursions, but didn't feel safe enough to venture out. Grand Cayman has the best snorkeling of all the places I've ever been. You can just get off the boat More and snorkel and Eden rock and it's awesome. Cozumel was good also for snorkeling.
The gym is the best ever. The inside cabins seemed smaller than other ships and very cramped. Recommend the balcony for the larger room.
On board see all the shows, they were all good. Becky the cruise director was very good. Try the surfing but go early in the morning to avoid long lines. Our room steward was great, but this ship did not have the friendliest staff especially at guest services. Had problems with the toilet for about 3 days before it was fixed, problems with on board account, and a couple other staff members who obviously were not happy with their jobs.
Overall, we had a great cruise, and the ship was awesome, but I think we are going back to a little smaller ship and see if the service is better. I think you lose a little service on that big of a ship. Less

In the aftermath of Tuesday's tornadoes and thunderstorms, about 4,400 MLGW customers were still without power today at 10 a.m.
Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division had restored power to roughly 60,000 homes and businesses that lost service Tuesday.
But utility officials still say it could take up to three weeks to rebuild electric system infrastructure in the Hickory Hill area, which was hardest hit.
MLGW's Substation No. 71 on Clarke Road, which serves much of the area, was severely damaged and remains out of service.
"We have made significant progress, and our crews have worked quickly to restore power to 60,000 customers in two days," Jerry Collins, MLGW president and CEO, said in a prepared statement.
"All of our efforts are now focused on the remaining 4,400 customers that have been most affected by the storm."
Customers without power who have not reported their outage should call 544-6500.

Back to Men's Basketball coverage
Kansas guard Conner Frankamp smiles while talking with teammate Tyler Self on the bench prior to a scrimmage on Wednesday, June 12, 2013, at the Horejsi Center.
Advertisement
Last December, after one of his amazing shooting displays, Wichita North senior/future Kansas University combo guard Conner Frankamp heard himself glowingly referred to as, “The White Mamba.”>.
“Some reporter on the news said something about it. It kind of went on from there. Everybody picked it up from there,” said Frankamp, a deadly shooter who doesn’t mind being nicknamed after one of the world’s most venomous snakes.
“It’s all right,” he added of the moniker, “because I like Kobe (Bryant) a lot and he’s the ‘Black Mamba.’ It works out pretty well.”
If anybody in Kansas deserves a ‘Mamba’ moniker it has to be the 6-foot, 160-pound Frankamp, who, as he proved in last Wednesday’s Bill Self campers game, can strike quickly. He iced four threes in as many tries, at least two from NBA range.
.”
Frankamp’s work ethic showed in his high school feats.
A two-time all-state selection, who was often double teamed, Frankamp averaged 31.1 points, 3.8 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 2.5 steals a game his senior season for 20-3 North. He made 93 three-pointers, shot 49.2 percent from three-point range and 91.7 percent from the free-throw line.
Frankamp had 14 games of 31 or more points and five of 40 or more. The all-time leading scorer in Wichita City League history, Frankamp broke the 33-year-old city league single-game scoring mark by potting 52 points as a sophomore against Northwest. In that game, he was 18-of-38 shooting (he made eight threes and was 8-of-8 from the line).
“Probably winning the three-point contest (at 2013 Final Four) in Atlanta,” Frankamp said, asked which of his three-point displays proved most memorable. “That was pretty cool. There were some really good shooters there and everything. I felt there was good competition. I shot pretty well, so that helped.”
Frankamp hit 22 of 25 three-pointers in the final round to defeat current KU teammate Brannen Greene, UCLA’s Bryce Alford, Michigan’s Zak Irvin, Memphis’ Nick King and others at the American Family Insurance three-point championship last April.
“In a competition like that, for sure,” Frankamp said, asked if it was the most accurate he’s ever been.
Frankamp, who despite being leading scorer for USA Basketball’s Under-17 national team that won gold at the FIBA world championships two summers ago, was snubbed by the McDonald’s All-America game committee last spring. Rivals.com’s No. 34-rated player in the Class of 2013 admitted that oversight had him fired up for the competition in Atlanta on ESPN.
“That for sure motivated me a lot. I didn’t get too down on myself about it. I had to keep moving on and work harder,” he said.
His workouts with his rebounder — dad Marty — are legendary in Wichita.
.”
Now in summer school at KU, Frankamp is working at both shooting guard and point guard as he vies for minutes his freshman season.
“For sure,” he said, asked if he can play on the ball. “I feel I’m a good passer as well. I just try to work on everything. Wherever coach needs me.”
He said he needs to work on ... “defense, lateral quickness and staying in front of quick guards. There are some quick guards in the Big 12 ... defense for sure.”
Like all freshmen, Frankamp figures to benefit from KU’s weight program, directed by Andrea Hudy.
“Last week we had a really tough workout on Monday. Today’s Monday, too. I’m kind of nervous about today. I think it’ll be all right,” Frankamp said with a smile on Monday. “I’ve had some pretty tough workouts with my trainer over the past four years (his dad’s former teammate at Coffeyville Community College, Roy Birch). The one last Monday was probably the toughest I’ve had for my entire life, actually.”
Frankamp, who is roommate of KU transfer Hunter Mickelson, said he’s been impressed with fellow members of his freshman class.
“Wayne Selden is playing really well. He’s so physically strong for such a young kid. Brannen Greene has been playing really well, too, and shooting the ball well,” Frankamp said. “Pretty much everybody has impressed me. Frank Mason is so quick, so fast. He gets to the lane pretty much whenever he wants. It’s nice having him kick it out to me and Brannen for an open shot. He’s helped a lot.”
KU coach Self is certainly happy the Jayhawks beat out Kansas State, Oklahoma, Texas, UCLA, Boston College, Wichita State and others for Frankamp, who committed in July of 2011.
“Hey ... the dude can make shots,” Self said. “That’s one thing we’ve got to free his mind to be able to do that. With USA Basketball, he did everything. He played on the ball, off the ball and was leading scorer on the team that had Jabari Parker (No. 4-ranked player headed to Duke) and guys like that. He’s a good scorer. Other players enjoy playing with him and I absolutely love watching him play. He’s a stud.”
Alexander visit coming: Cliff Alexander, a 6-8, 240-pound senior-to-be from Chicago’s Curie High School, will make an unofficial recruiting visit to KU on Thursday, JayhawkSlant.com reports. Kentucky and Michigan State have been believed to be leaders for the No. 5-ranked Alexander.
“No one is on top. I’m open to everybody. I’m open to all of the schools that are recruiting me,” Alexander told JayhawkSlant.com, citing a close relationship with KU assistant Jerrance Howard.

400 out of 410? 22 out of 25? Good grief! I guess I don't know much, but it seems like the winning strategy would be to get him open, then get him the ball. Your team is four offensive rebounders (just in case) and Frankamp. Absent turnovers, you should average around 2.7 points per possession!

I'm thinking this sharpshooter is going to hit a lot of big shots for KU during the next few years. I'm very happy that he's a jayhawk.
thmdmph 1 year, 11 months ago
I really like Frankamp. He IS a stud. His stroke may not be pure like Ben, but he's arguably even more deadly. Moreover, he can drive and pull up and knock it down. Ben is predominantly money only when he catches & shoot, or drive in for a dunk. When he tries to creates his own shots, it's not as pretty. The White Mamba on the other hand is way underrated outside of Midwest.
martyks 1 year, 11 months ago
He might not shoot quite that well if someone guards him though. :) Still... I can't wait to see the kid light the place up.
David Hodges 1 year, 11 months ago
I think you missed this part of the article... "A two-time all-state selection, who was often double teamed, Frankamp averaged 31.1 points, 3.8 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 2.5 steals a game his senior season for 20-3 North."

There will only be 2 or 3, and when you're shooting for the best, they will play regardless. A big (Okafor or Alexander?), PG (Jones or Mudiay?), and possibly a wing (Vaughn or Winslow?) would do nicely.
Kevin Huffman 1 year, 11 months ago
We're not getting Jones or Mudiay.
I'd say be SERIOUS about getting Josh Perkins. Ranked low enough at No. 24 that he could not balk at playing off the bench his freshman year but then could start his next 2-3 years potentially.
Often regarded as the best passer in the Class w/ somewhat decent size - i.e., 6'3, 185.

• Conner has amazed me with his recovery from his ankle Fracture; that's often a tough recovery and he worked through it like it was nothing!
• Self calling a freshman a stud is something too!
• Sliding at D1 speed appears Conner's get better path. Tyrel Reed, how about working with Conner. You mastered it.
• Conner, like Travis Releford before him, is one of those guys that make Self feel younger about his own hair issues. :-)
• Conner's glow on Mason's get-in-the-paint speed encourages me about Mason.
• Embiid Skills redux---yesterday JayHawkFanToo took issue with my remark that Self's quotes perhaps suggested Embiid might be farther along on skills than all KU bigs but Ellis. His was fair questioning. HEM responded he had noticed a lot of skills in Embiid videos as far back as last season, which I then recalled him noting back then. My only add here is to look at the skills Self referred to and ask: which bigs other than Ellis already possess all these skills?
Self's quoted: “From a raw skill set, he’s big, long, quick, athletic, can move his feet, he can shoot over both shoulders, jump hook, things like that. It’s unbelievable for a guy playing three years to have that skill set.” He also is a decent FT shooter, if I recall correctly.
Last season, Jamari lacked the jump hook and shooting over both shoulders. Landon seemed a.bit slow footed and lacked quickness.. Justin lacks the shooting. No one talks about Tarik being able to jump hook.
There are other big man skills like drop step, arm hooking, hedge defense, holding spots, screening, rebounding, and passing. Self says Embiid needs to get better and so we can infer he means these things. But all of KU's bigs need to get better at those things and they are not footers.
I'm not knocking our other bigs. I am just saying they too are early in development, excepting Tarik, who I don't know much about, and Justin, who seems unable to harness his athleticism so far.

Ha! I noticed the hair too, Jaybate. Dude is going to be bald before he leaves KU.
DoctorTK 1 year, 11 months ago
As a specialist dealing with people's hair loss day in and day out, I have seen many young men's self confidence destroyed by this unfortunately hereditary condition. I know neither Jaybate nor NebraskaJayhawk got any ill intention towards Conner or made any sly remarks. I only use this opportunity to plea for everyone to be kind to those suffering from hair loss. It is no laughing matter to many of them. A simple mentioning of their hair loss can be like a dagger through their heart.
One reason for all this hurt is the amount of misconceptions on male pattern hair loss and that most doctors do not know the best way to treat it. The most important truth he needs to know is that it can be a very treatable condition, especially at his young age. Many of my patients can attest to that fact.
I have just completed 29 hours of travel. 18 of which were in the air. My head is spinning and my ears are ringing. Time to say good night and keep my mouth shut.
jaybate 1 year, 11 months ago
"Doctor, doctor, tell me the news, I got a bad case of losin' you..."
You're being a tease, DocTK.
If you want to help Conner, and everyone else with high hair lines and thin hair, which is most of us sooner or later, and you know how to treat the problem, just tell us.
Just post exactly what we need to know about how to hold onto our hair and grow more. Don't say you know and then not tell us. This topic is nothing to withhold information about in order to get paid a fee for explaining the cure. :-)

LuLu, Jayhawk Network should broadcast their pickup games on prime time. Unfortunately, living in Boston, it won't benefit me, but still would be very radical.
As for Naadir, I wonder if say this next year, he turns over too much. Is Self going to be able to play Mason or Frankamp over seniority? Scares me what happened at end of last year.

If Self keeps landing 40% trey shootists like Conner, Greene, and White, plus recent dead eyes like Ben, Travis, Xavier, Tyrel, Brady, Sherron, Chalmers and Brandon, BIGMANU may have to change his alias to MAKESHOTU!
Really, it's been a stunning run of shootists.
Self's formula increasingly seems:
(Efficient bigs + great shootists + get-to-the-rim game) x DEFENSE^3 = .84 W&L

Someone young like him, there's no need to jump right into hair transplant. That's what hair transplant mills like Bosley want you to think. At his age, 1/10th of the cost you had mentioned would allow him to grow much of his own hair back.

"“Last week we had a really tough workout on Monday. Today’s Monday, too. I’m kind of nervous about today. I think it’ll be all right,” Frankamp said with a smile on Monday."
Thanks for clarifying that he said it on Monday. His being able to keep the days of the week straight is a good sign.

Jerry Rockhold 1 year, 11 months ago
I took my younger son to watch Frankamp play in an AAU tourney in KC his junior year. At 1st glance, he's a very unlikely looking ball player at around 6' 160. However, his handle was very good, had good hops & can dunk, and shot the ball well against very good AAU players. He has a very high BBQ & can not only shoot, but can get his own shot as well. He's a winner & a gamer & a true gym rat/coach's son. After the game, we talked to him & did our small part to welcome him to Jayhawk Nation. He took a couple of minutes to talk to my son & seemed like a very good, very unaffected kid. There were big-time coaches in the bleachers a few feet away, Bill Self, Coach K, Huggins, to name a few & he was focusing on talking to my son. Pretty impressive & cool for a 17yr. old.
No one can accurately predict exactly how his skills will transfer/translate to D-1 level, but he's played with & against the best in AAU & International ball & to this point has done well.
Welcome to the tradition that is KU basketball, Conner. RCJ, GO KU!!!

The next few years may be some of KU's best 3 point shooting years in a while. Frankamp, Greene, Selden are all outstanding shooters. Andrew White was already a good 3 point shooter. I am sure that Andrew Wiggins can drain some 3s too. I think that is an edge that we will have against other teams.
thmdmph 1 year, 11 months ago
Because of this, Embiid, Ellis, Black should thrive offensively
KansasComet 1 year, 11 months ago
It will be hard keeping this young man on the bench this season. He can flat out play. He is one of a kind. He is not a Tyrel Reed type or a Kirk Hinrich type. No disrespect to any guards that we have had in the past. He has his own style. Those that have not seen this young man play, get ready for a treat. This is one loaded KU team. The great thing is we have other great shooters on this team as well. Imagine if Conner Frankamp gets going, Andrew White III gets going and Brannen Green gets going, all at the same time. What an impressive run that could be. We could go up 20 or comeback from double digits in no time. I am not predicting championships, because those combine luck and skill. We do have a chance to be really special on the inside and from the outside.
KansasComet 1 year, 11 months ago

“Boschee”
He’s more like the Boschee Supreme Deluxe, version 5.0
The guy outplayed The World at the U17 championships. He is more than dialed in. He is laser guided. His experience alone puts him a light year ahead of Boschee. He would take Boschee for a ride in a one-on-one, a game of H.O.R.S.E, or a match of Tiddly Winks.
Height and White don’t make him compare with Boschee.
KGphoto 1 year, 11 months ago
By the way, I’m not knocking Boschee. I loved Boschee and realize he was a Micky D, and a highly sought after recruit. It’s just that, shooting wise, he was a one-trick-pony. He was a spot up 3pt. sniper. Conner has many intangibles that would allow him to lead a team, ala Jacque Vaughn, to go with his incredible marksmanship.
Ben Simonett 1 year, 11 months ago
This year is most likely going to feature alot of ball screen and perimeter action to put Wiggins in positions to utulize his natural ability. that being said, I'm actually more looking forward to the '14-15 season because I can see Self finally having the peices to go back to his bread and butter Hi-Lo system that won us the national championship.
The problem we've had the last few seasons is that a defense could pack the lane to counter the Hi-Lo without worrying much about the shooters they were leaving open on the perimeter. EJ and Releford were great, but between Frankamp, Greene, and White, we're now going to have 3 guards in our rotation who all can realistically shoot 40% from behind the arc. Defenses aren't going to be able to leave the perimeter to help inside.
Perry Ellis + Joel Embiid with no help defense inside or 40% 3 point shooting, pick your poison. That's going to be a very potent offense.
Brett McCabe 1 year, 11 months ago
What I like about the class is that we have the potential, if needed, to play bombs away with Freddy Up North. The ISU games were tough last year - having some scorers could help. Though they are freshmen, I'm confident that Bill will find a way.

Self has assembled the kind of talent around Tharpe that he needs. He should only average around 9 pts a game next year. This is why Self got Tharpe so he can be a facilitator. I am very excited to see how he responds!! Should be positive!
Jack Wilson 1 year, 11 months ago
kD .. Tharpe's assist to turnover was 2.21 - 1.0 this past season. By contrast, EJ's was 1.45 - 1.0. So you can breathe a little easier. I think you'll get a guy whose ratio is well above 2:1, and who will score appx. 8-9 per game.
I do have a concern with Tharpe offensively getting "shot happy" .. kind of in line with the infamous Tyshawn quote a few seasons ago after a high scoring game ("I finally got mine."). Tharpe's mindset is key. Distributor/facilitator more than scorer -- and take the points that are given to him.
Jack Wilson 1 year, 11 months ago
Good point ..
thmdmph 1 year, 11 months ago
Agreed. For past 2 years, Tharpe's downfall has been this ill advised quick pull-ups from downtown. Hopefully, another year wiser and much more talents around him, it won't even occur to him to do this anymore.

ParisHawk 1 year, 11 months ago
Of all the players, Conner is the one most likely to play less than I want him to. Is that a compliment or not?
I guess that means his offensive talent makes my mouth water, but can he step up to D1 level defense?
I like Selden as much, but I'm much more confident about his PT.
Too much talent, too many players to like, too much growing up to do too fast, not enough PT!

I think his age will be questioned more than any player since Greg Oden.
We all know he will not take the number of shots he did in HS. An amazing shooter. He does look fast, too. But as noted here, no defense, no real playing time. I am not saying that he cannot defend, I have no idea yet.
Maybe more hype, but he looks like a better shooter than Heinrich, Vaughn or Hawkins initially. Hard not to find it exciting.

Once he gets stronger he will be by far one of the best 3-point specialist KU has ever had. IMO Kirk was the best of them all.
Does anyone have a clue about a starting lineup? I know Self will mix it up until he gets a good group of guys. I'm so excited for this year, so much potential. This should be a better freshman class then Chalmers, Rush, Wright.

Im thinking:
PG- Tharpe, Frankcamp, RS Mason SG-Seldan, Green. Franks SF-Wiggins, White, Green PF-Ellis, Traylor C-Black, Embiid
justanotherfan 1 year, 11 months ago
There's no need or reason to question Conner's offensive abilities. He can shoot and handle. He is an ELITE shooter from distance. That will take him far. I think he could go down as one of the all time great three point marksmen in collegiate history. He's just got that shooters ability, like a JJ Redick or Steph Curry.
My questions remain about his defensive abilities. His HS played quite a bit of zone, much of it to let him save his energy for offense, where he represented the majority of their scoring. I can't fault them for that. If you have a guy that's in permanent heat check mode, you do what you can to maximize those opportunities.
He rarely had to guard anyone that was college ball talent outside of AAU - again, I understand that you have to maximize the fact that you have a truly gifted shooter on your hands. But my question is how he will handle guarding bigger and stronger guys in college, particularly if he ends up playing off the ball to maximize his shooting skills? This is especially a concern for a guy that is slightly built. It's not like Conner is built like Michael Lee. I think his quickness will help him here, but still worry that he could get bullied by bigger guys.
I'm especially curious because there's a good chance he will spend most of his career playing with similarly sized guys (Naadir, Frank) and someone has to guard the opposing 2 guard. Frank is so small that i doubt he can handle 2 guards at the college level and we saw last year what bigger guys were able to do to Naadir. If Conner can't guard bigger guys, I don't know how you can play more than 2 of those three for any kind of minutes because you won't be able to play them together. That doesn't mean Conner will be the odd many out (Frank probably is this year), but it does make things interesting going forward.

Stephen Harper And the Future of Canada by
William Johnson (Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 2005)
Pages 50-55]
Harper and Weissenberger wondered
why Canada was different. They received a powerful
lesson when, in October 1986, the Mulroney
government—their government—made public a decision that
shook all of western Canada. It announced that the
maintenance of the newly acquired fleet of 138 CF-18
fighter jets would be done by Montreal`s Canadair rather
than Winnipeg`s Bristol Aerospace. The $1.2-billion
contract went to the Montreal firm despite the fact that
the jury appointed by the government to evaluate the two
bids had found the Winnipeg bid represented “the most
favourable price and technical proposal,” according
to the briefing paper prepared by the PC caucus` own
research staff. Though Bristol Aerospace offered to
service the aircraft at lower cost and with a superior
performance, Canadair won the contract…
Once again, as so often in our
history, western Canada was treated as a colony destined
to serve the interests of central Canada, and
specifically Quebec. This decision, like others of the
Mulroney government when Quebec`s interests were
involved, led the pair to reflect on the place of Quebec
in recent Canadian politics. By coincidence, a book on
the subject had been published shortly before,
The Patriot Game: National Dreams &
Political Realities, by Peter Brimelow. It was a
shocker, a bombshell, a call to arms. For bright young
men trying to make sense of their country at a time of
disillusionment, it offered powerful medicine.
“Brimelow`s book, that was a
big influence at the time,” Weissenberger says.
“Whether you believe his analysis completely or not,
it was strong., `OK, we want
to buy ten copies of this book, what deal will you give
us?` So we bought ten copies and gave them to all our
friends.”
Brimelow was a Brit who had
received an M.B.A. from Stanford University and had then
worked in Canada as a staff writer for the Financial
magazine. He wrote The Patriot Game as a kind of
Parthian shot aimed at Canada after he left for the
United States, where he would become a senior editor of
Forbes magazine, and a senior editor of the
conservative National Review. He wrote with wit
and irony. His perception of Canada was depressing. He
turned topsy-turvy all the political platitudes and
pious assumptions of Canada`s right-thinking
(left-thinking) elites. Brimelow invited Harper and
Weissenberger on a new voyage of discovery, and they
willingly embarked. He described many fault lines in
Canada. They included the inherent conflicts between
central Canada and the other geographical regions, and
the struggle for wealth and power between the mainstream
society and the native. But the one fundamental conflict
that he saw was undermining Canada, past, present, and
future, was that which opposed French and English
speakers, Quebec and the rest of Canada.
“The
history and politics of Quebec are dominated by a single
great reality: the emergence of the French-speaking
nation. The process has been slow, complex, and
agonizing. There have been false starts, reversals, and
long periods of quiescence. But for over 200 years its
ultimate direction has remain the same: toward
ever-greater self-expression, as the growing plant seeks
the light.”
For Brimelow, the Liberal Party is
the villain of Canadian history. It imposed a way of
thinking about country, a vision, that was detrimental.
In effect, the Liberal Party became the surrogate of
French Quebec, ruling the country because our
parliamentary and electoral system allowed a minority to
rule that majority: French Canada voted as a bloc, while
English Canada was split.
“Some
time this [20th] century, English Canada lost
its nerve,” Brimelow wrote. “As the Anglophones
retreated, the Francophones advanced. But their movement
was not simply opportunistic. They were also impelled by
the seismic upheaval in Quebec society that led to the
so-called Quiet Revolution in the 1960s.”
Brimelow saw the history of the
previous century as essentially a competition between
French and English to assert their nationality through
the state, with the Liberals representing the
French-speakers, the Conservatives representing the
But the competition proved unequal,
in part because the Liberal ascendancy managed to impose
a false consciousness on English speakers whereby the
latter were seduced into accepting a political vision
that was contrary to their reality and to their
interests:
“The
Canadian Liberal Party has been able to persuade English
Canada that preserving the Canadian Confederation and
common morality itself requires continual concessions to
Quebec…The Liberal Ideology to a considerable extent is
the projection of internal Quebec concerns onto the
national stage, so that Canadian politics in the Liberal
era have been essentially those of a sort of Greater
Quebec.”
The Liberals had a left-wing
philosophy. They tailored their policies to attract
needy minorities wanting protection and favours from the
(Liberal) state. This included buying the loyalty of
client constituencies with the money of the taxpayers
with, for instance,
“the
bewildering variety of subsidies and incentives
orchestrated by Ottawa in the 1960s and 70s to stimulate
development in the peripheral regions. If you have
convinced yourself that economic growth is not best left
to market forces but always requires government
direction, it is easier to justify what might otherwise
appear a crude attempt to bribe the regions to shut up
about federal trade policies that benefit only Central
Canada.”
So it happened, according to
Brimelow, that Canada acquired a hypertrophic welfare
state, with a “New Class” of politicians, civil
servants, employees of the multiple Crown corporations
such as the CBC, welfare workers, teachers, journalists.
And these opinion leaders were tributary to the Liberal
ideology which they then propagated as the true national
vision and the New Nationalism. Any other view was
politically incorrect.
The Liberals were defeated in 1984,
and Brian Mulroney brought the Progressive Conservatives
to power. Bur, for Brimelow, this was again playing the
same old Liberal game. Mulroney was from Quebec, he was
perfectly bilingual, and Quebec`s concerns were his
priorities. He maintained and promoted the same old
“Liberal Ideology.”
The focus of Canadian politics on
the concerns of central Canada, and especially of
Quebec, was causing powerful strains east of Quebec and,
above all, west of Ontario.
The attempt to remodel Canada into
a Greater Quebec would provoke a reaction, Brimelow
prophesied:
“The
sectional divisions within English Canada will be a
continuing problem. This is particularly true of the
western provinces. They may lead some sort of rebellion
against the Liberal hegemony, perhaps by supporting a
right-wing, fourth party.”
The Reform Party would be founded
the following year.
Weissenberger commented:
“This
was the time when Mulroney was bringing nationalists
into his caucus—separatists, let`s be honest. He was
trying to play both sides against the middle. And then
there was what we perceived as the crisis of the welfare
state in Canada, with the debt problem. And there seemed
to be essentially an ideological consensus between the
three major parties. Everybody had essentially bought
into the system; they weren`t willing to consider an
alternative—certainly not from the right. If anyone had
a question about what to do in public policy, well,
`we`re not spending enough money in the area,` right?
[peals of laughter]. So we were looking at it from the
other side and thinking, there have to be some other
possible solutions to this. So, in retrospect I may not
agree with all of Brimelow`s points, but certainly it
was a very important book for us at that time.”
As Harper and Weissenberger saw it,
Weissenberger in particular, Mulroney`s attitude toward
Quebec revealed a fundamental problem which made the
much-needed conservative shift in the country nearly
impossible…The West, notably Alberta, was once again
being sacrificed to Quebec. And Mulroney, despite his
rhetoric, was doing very little, they thought, to deal
with the monstrous and crushing dimension of the state
in Canada.
As Brimelow had pointed out:
“Canada
suffers from a particularly acute form of the
generalized late-twentieth-century crisis of the welfare
state. Its politicians apparently feel unable to respond
to this problem, partly because of what they believe is
the danger of exacerbating sectional and linguistic
divisions by withdrawing any subsidy or privilege.”PUBLIC RECORD

There are many mentions of "Aunt Lizzie" and pictures of gravestones with Zimmerer - Schneckenberger. But... I can't figure out just how she fits in. Any info on her would be greatly appreciated!!!

Shark conservationists are still trying to undo the damage more than three decades later, struggling to quell an annual slaughter that has pushed many species to the brink of extinction”Biologist Rob Hicks
The centre will take your old copies of JAWS and give you free entry in return from October 15-23.
Peter Benchley’s tale of a seaside resort terrorised by a rampaging Great White and the subsequent Spielberg blockbuster were a disaster for sharks, Sea Life marine experts claim.
Biologist Rob Hicks said: “For the vast majority who read the book or saw the film, JAWS engendered or reinforced the stereotype of sharks as mindless man-eaters,”
“Shark conservationists are still trying to undo the damage more than three decades later, struggling to quell an annual slaughter that has pushed many species to the brink of extinction”
Ironically many of the scientists working to save them were themselves inspired by Benchley’s creation, says Ali Hood, conservation director of UK-based charity The Shark Trust.
Towards the end of his career Benchley also became a staunch advocate of shark conservation.
The attraction will be hosting a range of shark-related activities next week, from special quiz trails and talks to shark face painting.
They will also be getting visitors to sign a petition urging Governments to ban the removal of shark fins at sea to reduce fishing quotas of sharks and rays.It is always annoying to listen to agents of paternally centric groups speak. Their statements are always posited as dictum or edict rather than conjecture which they really are.
For example the National Rifle Association's response to added gun violence is to place armed guards in every school in America, which will sell even more guns and bullets turning a potential bust into a boom for the gun and ammo makers. Their spokesman Wayne LaPierre repeatedly states that: "The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun." End of conversation. No, it is not even the beginning of a conversation or a conversation at all, it is a proclamation.
Firstly, the statement implies that good guys are better at killing than bad guys as if there were a Hopalong Cassidy in every situation.
Secondly, If we do hire armed guards for schools they will mostly be middle aged, overweight and slow moving as compared to the average young agile and cunning mass murderer out to make his mark in infamy. Just imagine the scenario where after a year and a half of standing around in hallways eating double bacon-wrapped cheeseburgers for lunch; the guard is wandering around during recess when a round of five bullets from an automatic rifle by a shooter behind a tree ends his career and begins the career of another record breaking murdering whacko.
This week, Texas District Attorney Mike McLelland, a well-armed and forewarned experienced gun carrier, was shot 20 times before he could get to his gun because a killer had the jump on him demonstrating once again that good guys with guns are not a proven effective defense against bad guys with guns.
Since McLelland was shot 20 times it is obvious that a high-capacity assault weapon was used. If the capacity was only 10 rounds perhaps McLelland's wife would at least have been spared.

"It's time"
Wow, I never thought that this time would ever come. Interviews are the one thing that We are all looking forward to. Interviews are the main goal that we are in this and we are finally here. There is really no words to describe how i feel right now. I am a little nervous to say the least about them. We don't know what we are getting into as far as who we are meeting. Definitely excited to be doing this and to be able to talk to others about things you normally wouldn't talk about in a daily basis. To prepare for the interview we did research and we looked at some questions that we might ask to them about their life. We really don't have a specific topic that we want him to talk to us about but we want to hear about him and his life, see where he came from. Again, I am excited and glad we are at this point in the process. It is going to be interesting to see where we end up and how we do in our interviews, also to see what we learn from them. i bet it is going to be fun.

BENSON — It’s not your typical parking ticket that is being contested in district court in Swift County.
BENSON — It’s not your typical parking ticket that is being contested in district court in Swift County.
The BNSF Railroad entered not guilty pleas to the citations in a brief court hearing in Benson on Friday, according to Ben Wilcox, Benson city attorney. He said it was only an initial step in the matter. The court will be scheduling a motion hearing in the coming weeks.
Wilcox said he could not discuss an on-going police investigation.
The city’s concerns about trains blocking the three main intersections date at least to the mid-1990s, when the volume of train traffic was less than one-half of what it is today.
The busy BNSF line connecting Fargo-Moorhead and the Twin Cities cuts through the community. Also, a spur line from Watertown, S.D. connects to the line west of Benson’s downtown.
A manual switch must be thrown for trains to enter the main line from the spur.
The city has asked the railroad to automate the switch. The city has also discussed the possibility of an overpass, but has not been able to line up funding for the idea, according to Mayor Paul Kittelson.
The city had also sought $1.45 million in state funding at one point to develop an all-weather, emergency access road on the east end of town for emergency vehicles that might be blocked by trains.
Mayor Kittelson said the city has worked with the railroad in the past to address the concerns. One result is the city is one of only a very few in the country that can directly call train locomotive engineers and request that a train be moved during an emergency.
But the mayor said he and others are concerned that the engineers might not be able to move the trains quickly enough in response to an emergency call. In an emergency, minutes can be the difference between life and death, he noted.
That’s not to mention the frustrations that many motorists have expressed as they’ve waited for motionless trains. The mayor said there have been instances where stalled trains have blocked the crossings long enough to make people wonder if they’ve broken down.
The mayor noted that the trains carry many tankers with oil from North Dakota, and most expect that traffic on the line will only increase.yoester

Hello,?Kingda-Ka was about an hour all day. 1st thing in the morning, at 5pm and again at 6pm. They only had 1 boarding line open all day because of a staff shortage. So whenever there was a time-to-wait sign in the line, I doubled it and that was very accurate.
El Toro was down to one train all day, and the line was outrageous. So I waited until 6:45 to get in line. I figured if they only had 1 train working, then they can stay until I get on the darn thing. I was off the ride by 7:45 (they close at 7). Worth the wait. This is the only wooden coaster I would ever wait an hour for.
A couple of other pointers:
- be through security by 10:45
- sprint to Kingda-Ka 1st
- run to superman 2nd
- right across to The Great Amercan Scream Machine. This should make the best of your 1st 60-90 minutes.
- skip Skull Mountain
- all other coasters worth a ride
- during my day, i wished i had spent the $$ on the flash pass
- ask for no ice in your drinks. almost 50% ice in my drink
- get your season's pass card before you eat. there is a coupon for some $$ off your meal.
Cell phones. OK. LISTEN UP. IF YOU PUT YOUR CELL PHONE IN YOUR JEANS POCKET, IT WILL (WILL, W-I-L-L) ABSOLUTELY FALL OUT. I met 3 people whose cell phone fell out. One was in 4 pieces on the ground. Very simple solution. Purchase an under-your-clothes belly-bag (from a travel shop) and zip your phone in there for EVERY ride.
KINGDA-KA. LISTEN UP AGAIN. If ANYTHING falls off your person, the ride stops for 25 minutes while the staff inspects the ride to make sure your thing hasn't been stuck anywhere dangerous. NO HATS, GLASSES, CELL PHONES, BANDANAS, NECKLASSES, ETC. Happened twice while I was in line. You are going 128MPH (206KPH). Anything loose will fly off.
Batman. Worth the wait for from row.
Superman. NOT worth the wait for front row.
Kingda-Ka. Front row much more fun than anywhere else. But HUGE wait.[EDIT]
Again, great review, there just isn't any point to wasting posts seeing as how they only allow 50 responses.

The adjustments will, however, impact subsequent shipments.
Allocation, Delivery and Return of Rented Items: We reserve the right to process orders and otherwise allocate and ship items among our members in any manner that we, in our sole and absolute discretion, determine. In addition, we will, in our sole and absolute discretion, determine the quantity of items we purchase for any Item, their location within our distribution network and the level of staffing and number of shipments to be processed at each distribution center. As a result of the operational practices described in this section, we may not always send you the top choices from your Online Closet, ship out your next item on the same day that we receive one from you, or process orders from your local distribution center.
At present, our goal is to ship you the items listed highest in your Online Closet. Generally, on the same day that we receive an item from you, we ship the next available item from your Online Closet. In certain instances, your next available item will not ship until at least one business day following our receipt of your returned item.
In determining priority for shipping and inventory allocation, we may utilize many different factors, including the number and type of Items you rent through our service, the membership plan you select, as well as other uses of our service by you. The type, number, mix and weighting of the various factors impacting shipping and inventory allocation will change from time to time and will be made in our sole and absolute discretion. As a result of your selection habits and our operational practices, the actual number of items you rent in any month may vary, and you may experience differentiated service during the course of your membership. Also, such service may be different from the service we provide to other members on the same membership plan. The type of differentiated service you may experience includes, (i) the shipment of your next available item occurring at least one business day following return of your previously viewed item, (ii) delivery taking longer, as the shipments may not be sent from your local distribution center and (iii) the items you receive coming from lower in your Online Closet more often than our other members. These effects will not occur unless we are faced with limited inventory or when the number of shipments to be processed on that day is exceeded.
Other factors that may affect delivery times, include, but are not limited to, (i) the distance between the distribution center from which your item was shipped and your delivery address, (ii) the timing of your placement or adjustment of items in your Online Closet, (iii) circumstances impacting delivery by the U.S. Postal Service, and (iv) any unplanned downtime of our computer systems.
We receive mail from the U.S. Postal Service and process returns Monday through Saturday, except Holidays. Generally all of the returns are processed on the same day received. We make no guaranty as to the shipping and delivery of items and may, in our sole and absolute discretion, change our business practice regarding allocation, delivery and shipping, without notice. We believe that our operational practices, including how we prioritize shipping and inventory allocation among our members, provide a great value to all our members.
We offer a number of items in high-end quality, items with an MSRP of $75 or more. Premium quality items occupy additional slots in member's Online Closets. The number of slots a premium item occupies will be listed in that item's product description. When you add premium quality items, the allocation, delivery and return of premium quality items is governed by the "Allocation, Delivery and Return of Rented Items" above

The drive up will take you about 10 -11 hours traveling a little over the speed limits. July fishing is close to peak time on the Matane. Many of the other rivers in Quebec on the Gaspe Peninsular require advanced booking, however most of the rivers have sections called public water ---there is no limit on the number of fishermen fishing the public water. Nevertheless, July is very good time to salmon fish in Quebec. Good luck. juro02-20-2001, 09:08 PMSeth - Thanks and welcome to the Forum. I sense a direct experience with the area in your reply... I'll have to admit that I have long been obsessed with fishing the Gaspe region. I recently met with a lodge owner / guide from the region who hosted Dec Hogan from Mt.Vernon Washington, steelhead country. It's my dream to organize a conclave in the Gaspe region within the next couple of years. If you have direct knowledge in the region we would be grateful for your insights. regards, Juro juro02-21-2001, 07:52 PMSeth - Thanks for the email, it's a pleasure to have a veteran of the Gaspe' region in our ranks!

Posted 2 years ago on Aug. 29, 2012, 8:24 p.m. EST by OccupyWallSt
Tags: nyc, s17
Next month, help us fulfill the dream of economic justice for everyone!
As you read this, the whirring machinery of mass media is increasingly focusing the spotlight on Romney, Obama and the spectacle of elections.
A lot will be decided this November but almost none of it where the public can see. We receive an endless stream of TV commercials funded by SuperPac billionaires in lieu of a true democratic discourse. The 99% is left in the wake of campaign commercials acting as currency for both the candidates and the media charged with covering them for us.
If you want to have the greatest impact on our democracy, cast your ballot on September 17th - in the streets. Join us.
#S17: 3 Days of Education, Celebration & Resistance
Our mass mobilization of the 99% on September 15 - 17 is coming up soon. And as it was when OWS first began, the most impactful way to help is to show up, do your thing and help all our voices be heard!
Below you will find a series of actions and events building up to S17 as well as planning meetings and conference calls where you could help organize the litany of S17 festivities throughout the weekend. You can also check out the Occupy Classifieds for immediate needs leading up to our one year anniversary. Have a great idea? Make it so!

The Crushing Burden of Debt
Tuesday, September 4th, 7pm
McNally Jackson Books, 52 Prince Street
76% of Americans are in serious debt. At least 1 in 7 is already being pursued by debt collectors. Median household debt in America has risen to $75,600, and much of it can never be repaid in our lifetimes. Credit was supposed to help us realize our dreams. Instead, predatory lenders are rapidly closing off the opportunities that a democracy ought to nurture. Panel members will discuss the consequences, and the possibilities for debt resistance.
Call for Artists: Submit Media for S17
Anytime. From anywhere.
This movement can't happen without your creativity. Please share pictures, videos, drawings, signs, posters, or anything else we can re-post online!
We need all! Even voters! Come one come all!
Ive traveled down to OWS on numerous occasions only to hear the human mic reiterate their necessity of supplies, donations, sleeping conditions etc. Everyone here is preoccupied with designing picket signs, emo time, and catching attention. where is the politics people??! IM AS PISSED OFF AS EVERYONE HERE BUT GODDAMN IT.. Moral judgement on the surface of an educated and unified whole. NO more confusion between what is wanted and what is needed. IS CONSENSUS NOT THE KEY WORD?!
Training, art, planning, support, solidarity.
Anniversary right around the corner. Prepare at one of these events.
Come support the brave protesters of OWS.
"We receive an endless stream of TV commercials funded by SuperPac billionaires in lieu of a true democratic discourse. The 99% is left in the wake of campaign commercials acting as currency for both the candidates and the media charged with covering them for us."
If the 99% are shown to not trust the lamestream media and ads at all - i'm talking ZERO trust whatsoever- and not even try looking at ads, those things were designed to lure based on psyops and also subliminal messaging, the SuperPAC's and their corporate overlords lose all their power- corporate money for ads will now be POINTLESS and totally weak. Then maybe the politicians will start thinking about the people, as they will now realise that whether they get elected or not now doesn't depend on their sponsors, but on the People.
Another great idea. Now all we have to do is get the 99% to not trust the lamestream media and ads at all!
How do we do that?
Propaganda.
Ex-cellent. How do we do it?
As always - spread the word. {:-]).
Tweeted.
Join us, Support the 99%
Are you kidding Eddie?
Don't blame OWS for an uninvolved populace. OWS and all of the Occupy movements are pointing out the serious ill's of our societies - they are ringing the alarm bells - they are spreading the word and sharing education. OWS and all Occupy groups are providing education and a place to come together.
It is up to us THE PEOPLE to get involved and make the needed changes.
So Fuck Your Shitty Rant.
A good tactic would be to get the people to vote Communist, like CPUSA- if they win, then the corporatists will be left with a coup as their only option. That will lead the people, all of them, to understand that change cannot come through the ballot, and all will rise and overthrow.
It would be excellent if the CPUSA won. I will vote CPUSA. If you do we got 2 votes! Good Idea.
But then, they don't stand for election and tell us to vote corporate Dems...
If we vote Dems, a corporate party (one of the two) will have more votes. So?
I don't think so. What do you think.How to Sign-Up as a Seller

Commission Method (Basic / Advanced): This is where your commission rate may be modified. By default, the commission rate is set for 10% of the pre-tax selling price for each case a customer buys using your image.
Example: If 1 case at $24.99 was purchased using your artwork, a $2.50 commission will be earned.
Dollar-Added Per Case Method: If you would like to place a premium on your artwork and earn more commission for it, you are free to modify the image selling price to receive greater earnings per case sold. For each dollar added to the price, it will increase the cost per case for the customer by an equal amount. However, you will receive that amount of increase as your extra commission.
Example: If you added $1 per case. A case originally priced at $24.99 will now sell for $25.99. You will still receive 10% commission based on the default price of the case ($24.99) plus the extra dollar.
So, $24.99x0.10= $2.50 plus the extra $1 added equals $3.50 commission earned.
Note: A very large premium on an image may discourage customers from choosing to purchase it!

Books like Diet for a New America and The Food Revolution helped Aimee come to the realization that an animal-based diet just ain’t right. Aimee’s cousins, aunts, uncles, and mother have all gone veg as time has gone by. While the horrific cruelty involved in the meat, dairy, and egg industries were the main reasons for most of her family members’ adopting a vegetarian diet, Aimee’s father’s untimely death at the age of 48 due to a heart attack was a huge eye opener as well. Take a gander at Aimee’s insightful interview with PETA2.com, including suggestions for kids who are having trouble with their parents and answers to all those nagging questions you may have about being vegetarian, by clicking here.
Yet another piece of proof that the PETA2 Street Team kicks butt- Mike Ski of The A.K.A.s e-mailed today to tell us he’s been seeing Street Teamers spreading his interview with PETA2 everywhere. This makes Mike super happy, and of course we’re pretty stoked about it too. After all, everyone who clicks on a link to The A.K.A.s feature is one more person who is going to hear about vegetarianism. We still have our eye on The A.K.A.s, so keep an eye out for more juicy little tidbits from Mike and the guys in the future!List of my favourite cafés.

Upon our return, the hubs requested paella at home. I accept this challenge!
The problem? Paella’s expensive! With Kevin’s approval, I had free reign of the grocery store. Scallops not on sale? Who cares! Shrimp not on sale either? A girl needs variety! Saffron at regular grocery store sells for $280 per ounce? Well… I’ll just buy 0.035 oz for $6 at Trader Joe’s instead. (That little TJ’s bottle is just a hair over this recipe’s saffron requirements.)
Scallop and Shrimp Paella
** Adapted from Easy Lobster Paella
Ingredients:
- 2 tsp & 2 tsp butter, divided (I used Earth Balance spread)
- 1 large yellow onion
- 1 bell pepper (red recommended)
- 1-2 cloves minced garlic
- 1.5 cups white rice (I used brown, but it did not cook quickly enough.)
- 4 cups vegetable broth (Trader Joe’s low-sodium is the best!)
- ½ tsp saffron threads, crushed
- dash of crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 tsp salt
- ½ tsp ground black pepper
- ½ lb bay scallops (minis)
- ½ lb peeled shrimp
- 1 cup frozen peas (canned might work too)
Directions:
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
Melt 2 tsp butter in a large ovenproof Dutch oven on medium heat. Once melted, cook the scallops and shrimp in two batches. Cook these for approximately 3 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Quickly wipe the pan.
Melt the remaining butter in the same Dutch oven on medium heat. Once melted, cook the onions about 4 minutes. Add the bell pepper and cook 5 more minutes. Lower the heat, add the garlic, and cook for 1 minute longer. Stir in the rice, vegetable broth, saffron, crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper. Bring this mixture to a boil.
Cover the pot and place it in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove the pot to gently stir the paella mixture. Return the pot to the oven uncovered until the rice is cooked (approximately 10-15 minutes).
Return the paella to the stove top and turn on the burner for only about 30 seconds to get it warm again. Fold in the scallops, shrimp, and peas. Cover the paella, and allow it to steam for about 10 minutes with the burner OFF.
Serve with sangria. (Oh come on, you knew I was going to say that…)
- Ever re-created a meal from vacation?
- What would you put in your paella (veg, chorizo, chicken?)
I’ve only ever made paella once, and I’ll admit it was sort of a failure. I used a traditional paella pan, but it was the first time it had been used and I guess it wasn’t properly “broken in”. I added shrimp, but next time I want to do scallops!
I wish I had a paella pan, but hey, whatever method makes a tasty dish works for me!
Every once in a while I say “screw it” and indulge in making a big homecooked meal for no reason at all. Sometimes it’s just worth it!
Oh, the ridiculous amounts that I’m sometimes willing to pay for good food… It’s a good thing that I’m not an overly-exuberant spender in other areas, or I’m pretty sure I’d be broke and homeless…
I wish I ate shrimp because that looks SO good right now!! I’ve never tried a paella but maybe a veg one would be nice!! Loving all of the colours in yours! YUM.
I’ve never had Paella before but it looks awesome.
I’ve made paella before & it was delicious. I’d make it again, but it’s not in our budget. haha. Yours looks very good!
Delicious! I’d definitely go for a seafood paella just like yours!
One time we tried to recreate Pad Thai from our adventures in Thailand. After hours of preparation, it tasted so bad we couldn’t even eat it!
I fell in love with Barcelona in Barcelona.
This looks awesome – you CANNOT find good paella in ATL, so I need to try my hand at it at home.
when I got back from Italy I was making “healthified” Italian food like it was my j-o-b.
I’m coming over for dinner
I never heard of Paella but that looks delicious! Do you have any leftovers? (:
I never ordered paella in Barcelona because I never knew how to eat it/cut it/peel it appropriately with the eyes on the shrimp. The same goes for fish. I never order fish in Europe due to the fear of the head being attached. I need a lesson on that one. 😉A great plugin for wordpress Admins to search and manage posts, pages by type and filter.

Well, it is always nice to find a shop that is good! I had a good feel for this place right out of the box. They are warm and friendly here. Made me feel at ease, not uptight like some shops in the St. Louis area. The owner, Eric, really knows what he is doing here. He is a SPL champion, and has other compatition awards. I was very impressed about his knowledge. Bought a set of Image dynamics components, and had them installed there. They carry them as well a memphis and other very good brands. Image dynamics was my choice here. You can watch them install your gear there and not be hid away in some cave. Every step of the way I might add. The attention to detail was very impressive here. They are not done with you until you are happy. They are very customer oriented at this place. It would be worth your time to stop in and check them out. They seem to taylor to what YOU want, not to sell you what you don't need. They are located off of highway 50 in Union, Mo.School students studying in Classes V to XI in the Pimpri and Chinchwad area can now avail for a free one year PMPML bus pass. The local governing body, the PCMC has announced a free bus pass to all students who have passed out last year and are studying in any government or a government recognised private primary and secondary schools within the municipal limits.
However, in order to avail this free bus pass, there are various conditions. The facility is available to only those students who passed out this year and are attending Classes between V and XI. Even the student’s attendance record should not be less than 75 per cent. Moreover, the student should be residing within the PCMC limits. Education officer, secondary education department, PCMC, Uttara Kamble said that the students who have received free bicycles under an earlier scheme cannot avail the scheme.LARGO — He was the Fortune 500 executive with a six-figure salary, assignments in China and Malaysia, a private plane, a Corvette, a million-dollar waterfront home.
This week he looks just as important, dressed in a well-cut suit, sporting a new haircut, blending in perfectly with the carefully groomed lawyers who surround him.
But only two things remain on Patrick A. Evans' to-do list: stay out of prison and off death row.
Evans, 44, went on trial this week based on accusations that he shot and killed his estranged wife, Elizabeth K. Evans, 44, and her friend, Jerry B. Taylor, 43.
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.
In opening statements Tuesday, Assistant State Attorney Christopher LaBruzzo told jurors about a unique and key piece of evidence that will persuade them to find Evans guilty.
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is rare in cases in America where a murder is actually captured on a 911 call," LaBruzzo said.
But that's what happened in this case: Someone called 911 from Elizabeth Evans' Gulfport condo just before the murder and did not hang up the phone, creating an audio recording that will be played for the jury.
LaBruzzo said Evans, a former Jabil Circuit vice president, and his wife, Elizabeth, had been having marital difficulties. He filed for divorce, changed his mind, then she filed for divorce. Evans knew that on Dec. 20, 2008, she was planning to go on a date with Taylor.
Evans came to the Gulfport condo with a handgun, LaBruzzo said, and told his wife: "Sit on the bed."
Elizabeth Evans said no. Taylor said "put the gun down," LaBruzzo said.
LaBruzzo told jurors: "Boom, you will hear a gunshot, a single shot, close range, striking Mr. Taylor in the throat."
After witnessing her friend get shot, LaBruzzo said, "Elizabeth Evans says, 'Are you out of your f- - - - - -' Boom, second shot."
But the 911 recording isn't the only evidence. LaBruzzo said police determined Evans owned a Glock handgun. They matched shell casings fired from his gun to those fired at the crime scene.
Evans' defense attorney, David Parry, did not make an opening statement Tuesday, but said he might later.
After the shootings, Evans was stopped by sheriff's deputies and brought in for questioning.
A recording was made of that conversation, though it may not be played for the jury.
The trial resumes today..

CLEVELAND, OH -- In my continued search to save you time and money, today we celebrate a great way to get dinner on the table, on a dime.
As you probably know by now, I've made it my mission to hunt down your deal requests and recently we've added food to the mix.
Every week you nominate a different food group, item or ingredient and I find the deal. Today we explore Asia with a price drop on a top cooking kit.
If you overdo it on take-out (as I do), you might not be surprised to know the average person in our region spends about $1000 per year on take-out. If Chinese or Thai tops your wishlist, today you can make some of your favorite dishes on your own for a fraction of the price.
I found a deal with enough food to feed 12 people for $25, or exactly $2.08 per portion. My pick today: super delicious Asian noodles that cook up al-dente every time, alongside some great sauce. Aside from being delicious, these noodles are gluten-free, high in fiber and a low carb. They're delicious for stir-frys, soups and other dishes, or just add your favorite sauce.

"Jaws" swam onto bookshelves 40 years ago, with the blockbuster movie arriving a year later, and Americans are still feeling the bite today.
There's the infamous music ("duh-duh...duh-duh..."). The famous Peter Benchley book cover with a swimmer innocently paddling above a giant shark. The catchphrases ("you're gonna need a bigger boat"). The numerous other threatening-animal movies and books that soon filled theaters and bookstores, from "Orca" to "Anaconda." And of course, the book and film launched America's fascination with sharks, which continues today with "Sharknado," Shark Week and more.
Sign up to have top entertainment news sent directly to your inbox.
"The original 'Jaws' impacted the culture like few movies ever have," said Robert K. Elder, author of "The Best Film You've Never Seen." "Try swimming in the ocean or even the pool at night and not hearing that menacing theme music."
Benchley's bestselling novel was published in chilly February, when few readers were bobbing in the ocean warily watching out for fins. But the Steven Spielberg movie adaptation came in June of 1975, prime time for scared swimmers, and it became the highest-grossing film of all time, until "Star Wars" blasted it off the throne. It is often credited as creating the summer-blockbuster genre: simple-concept action films that boast high budgets and aim for even higher box-office receipts.
"It's been well-documented that 'Jaws' invented the summer blockbuster," Elder told TODAY. "But it did more than that. It was the catalyst for modern-day sequel fever. That legacy comes directly out of 'Jaws,' and producers' desperate attempts to recapture lightning in a bottle whether the material supported it or not."
"'Jaws' spawned an army of imitators, not just its own sequels but also movies like 'Piranha,' 'Orca,' 'Deep Blue Sea' — even the 'Sharknado' movies," Elder said. "There would be no Shark Week without 'Jaws.'"
Neither author Benchley nor Spielberg returned to the "Jaws" franchise for its three sequels, which were mostly panned by critics. "Jaws 4: The Revenge," which came out in 1987, has a 0 percent positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Tim Grierson, film critic for Deadspin.com and vice-president of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, notes that many of the lessons of "Jaws" have been lost over the years in favor of a bigger-is-better mentality.
"If anything, 'Jaws' should be a reminder to modern-day filmmakers how to do an event movie right," Grierson told TODAY. "We don't need a wall-to-wall bombastic score: A few indelible notes can be far more effective. Additionally, finite resources can spur inventiveness in a way that limitless effects can't. Spielberg's inability to get the mechanical shark working forced him to get creative, hinting at the deadly creature rather than showing him to audiences. As a result, the shark's absence was frightening: We imagined a horror no concrete image could come close to matching."
"Jaws" the movie also deviated from the book's ending, and while it wasn't the first film to stray from the source material, it was an influential change. (Warning: Spoilers for a 40-year-old novel and film ahead.)
"In the book, Richard Dreyfuss' character has an affair with the police chief's wife and is later eaten by the shark," Elder explains. "The shark itself drowns. But what Spielberg did by recasting the story and rewriting the explosive ending was give movie makers further license to re-imagine and heighten the stories they adapt."
Even though "Jaws" has been studied in film classes and viewed on late-night cable channels for four decades, many summer movies ignore its lessons, at their peril. For every "Jaws," it seems there are several dozen summer bombs, from "Waterworld" to "Battlefield Earth."
"Rather than being relentless, 'Jaws' is beautifully paced and measured," Grierson said. "I know some people blame 'Jaws' for everything that came in its wake. Personally, I wish we had more summer movies like it."

Calbuzz on the ever-elusive and victory-by-being-pummeled California gubernatorial campaign of Jerry Brown
With anxious Democrats from one end of the state to the other wetting the bed over Krusty the General’s Sun Tzu fight-by-indirection approach to the battle for governor (“He who knows when he can fight and when he cannot will be victorious”) to be disquieting, if not downright scary.

Bob Morris Posted on Fri Jul 9, 2010 19:30 pm.
Surely you're not suggesting I need to talk about the issues?
Jerry Brown’s gubernational campaign in California is unfocused and he’s slipping in the polls. Part of the problem is eMeg’s deep pockets. But the truth is, Brown’s campaign so far has been lackadaisical and apparently unconcerned with the issues. Whitman, by contrast, is running a tight, disciplined campaign where she relentlessly stays on message. Brown doesn’t even appear to have a message and to date has said nothing about the California budget crisis.
So far, Brown’s campaign has been, well, quirky. He’s made no statements on how he will handle the budget crisis, something Whitman has rightfully lambasted him for. He recently said he would “rock the boat” but not too much in an attempt to put the state on an even keel. That’s a nice cotton candy sound bite but it contains little substance. What will he do to get the state solvent again? That’s what we need to know.
And what is it with his campaign website? The homepage still features his announcement video, even though that’s ancient news, and has truly odd blurbs about his tires being stolen, his mother’s banana cake, and asks what theme song they should use for an upcoming “Recession Reception.” Um, those who have lost jobs and homes might not think the recession is something to be taken so apparently lightly.
Eli Stephens, in comments to our earlier post on Jerry Brown, says
Jerry Brown is a schmuck and about as inspiring as dry toast. The fact that he’s the best they could muster speaks volumes about the Democrats, who almost literally have nothing to offer the people of California.
Indeed. Out of ideas. Running on empty.
Bob Morris Posted on Thu Jun 10, 2010 10:47 am.
The Democrat will have a hard time convincing voters that Meg Whitman’s ideas are not workable if he doesn’t have a better plan of his own.
It’s worse than that. Jerry Brown’s campaign website still has nothing about the California budget crisis. This is inexcusable.

Comments about Jackson SL3MG Soloist Electric Guitar with Floyd Rose Bridge:
I own the SL3MG in Green Swirl. This thing plays like hot, melted butter. Fast, fast, and did I mention fast? It sounds great with the EMG 81 in the bridge and 85 in the neck. The 85 is just right with 24 fret guitars. I like the 60 better for 22 fret guitars. I lowered the action to just barely above the frets and added a Floyd Upgrades.com trem stop to make it dive-only. It is solid and lets me dive bomb away! The ftret work on this thing is superb. The neck is straight and level. It can play any style of music from pretty and clean to mean and brutal. I love it!
BTW, I have a RR5FR that I love, too. Jacksons are very addictive. Once you own one, you will want more.
I love the 24 jumbo frets, neck-thru and the 81/85 EMG pickups. The Floyd Rose is great, too. It is light and fast.
The Japanese have done a fantastic job with this one. Their quality is very, very high.
Mine is the green swirl which costs $200 more than plain black. It impresses everyone that sees it and I am glad that spent the extra money. It plays like a $2000+ guitar, so it is a pretty good deal.

We concluded this experiment was a success.
It’s nice to have a recurring calendar invite to open, click “Join Hangout” and start talking.
Gotcha: laptop/monitor switch
Google Hangout is sometimes choppy over wifi. The settings need to change when we switch from laptop to monitor, so we often are without sound for a few seconds before changing the “FaceTime Camera (Built-In)” setting to “FaceTime HD Camera (Display)”.
Gotcha: choppy wifi
We’ve noticed in longer meetings, we sometimes need to refresh the page if sound starts to get choppy, presumably to clear some buffering.
Gotcha: internal microphone on a MacBook Air
We’ve noticed during Hangouts that the sound captured by a MacBook Air’s internal microphones is often muffled. We generally have MacBook Pros for better performance of test suites, but there are a few of us who have Airs. We use Apple earbuds with Hangouts on MacBook Airs.
Gotcha: stenographer
For weekly retrospectives, one person is typically taking notes. When they type, their microphone will be muted. So, when multiple people are in the same room on a Hangout, we mute and cut the sound on the stenographer’s laptop, restricting it to video and using other’s nearby laptops for sound.

The product pages on ZAGG.com presently utilize three types of imagery for product display: static images, video and 360º product images. The original design of ZAGG’s product pages placed the static product image as the default for visitors. ZAGG’s conversion and usability analyst, Kollin Kilian, ran an A/B test to determine whether presenting the video or static image as the default on the product page led to more clicks on the “add to cart” button. He found that showing the video as the default yielded a 27% increase in revenue per visitor. Not satisfied with this testing victory, ZAGG looked for further optimization opportunities.
“The video default was selling, but you always want to be testing,” Killian says.
Equipped with Optimizely and their existing video and photo assets, ZAGG set out to design a layout with an even higher conversion rate than its predecessor.
Hypothesis
Killian constantly looks to other e-commerce sites for ideas on product page design. He found 360º imagery to be a popular format and decided to test out how ZAGGs product pages would perform with that view as the default. The team’s instinct favored video as it has been a core part of their successful product strategy – however, Killian and the team thought 360º imagery could potentially be the perfect balance between static images and video.
Original
Variation
Solution
On the first experiment with the product page, ZAGG was quickly able to learn that the video outperformed the static image. Having already built the simple test in Optimizely, all it took was a few minutes to duplicate the experiment and add a variation that set the 360º product image as the default.
“Optimizely is too simple not to use,” Killian says. “With a couple clicks you can measure engagement, revenue, and set up multiple event tags throughout the page to see how people are navigating through it”.
Results
In the first test, using the video as the default increased revenue per visitor by 27%. The second test which placed the 360º image as the default increased ZAGGs revenue per visitor an additional 12%.
Conclusion
Killian was delighted to uncover an additional revenue gain that required virtually no additional resources to test and implement. The simple change to the 360º image as the default resulted in a near 40% increase in revenue.
ZAGG’s experience demonstrates the value of A/B tests that don’t require new resources. Gains can emerge from tests that utilize repurposed content. While your development team is exploring new product ideas to build and test, you may uncover big conversion wins by applying the resources you have available in fresh ways. ZAGG demonstrates that until new features can be developed, there’s still a valuable opportunity to refine and improve conversions on your site using the resources you have today.The 24th annual Honolulu Pride Parade!UPDATED 7:53 PM HST Jun 07, 2014post a comment

>>IMAGE ‘Somebody exclusion amounts are gradually increasing from $2 million in 2007 to $3.5 million in 2009. In 2010 there is no estate tax, and in 2011 the applicable exclusion amount remains uncertain. Estates that exceed the exclusion amount may be subject to federal tax ranging from 36%-55% (1). This can leave a large hole in what remains of the estate for heirs. You may be thinking, “My estate couldn’t possibly be over the exclusion amount, $2 million is a lot of money so I shouldn’t worry about estate tax." Remember the uncertainty surrounding the exclusion amount in 2011, the lower that amount remains, the more revenue the government gains in taxes. If the amount settles back to a $1 million exclusion,.
Probate issues
The ultimate goal of estate planning is to efficiently transfer assets and property from one generation to another. There are a few different ways this can be accomplished: 1) by passing through the probate process, 2) by right of a contract with named beneficiaries, or 3) by rights of survivorship whereby when one owner dies, everything transfers automatically to the other owner.
The probate process is one of the most important concepts to understand in estate planning. When an individual dies and leaves a will, his or her estate goes through probate, by which a state court supervises, administers and distributes the property. The probate estate includes all of the property that is in your name at the time of your death. Providing that there is no successful challenge in probate proceedings, the court will allow a final distribution of your estate after all debts and taxes are satisfied.
In the alternative, property owned by right of contract and by right of survivorship will pass outside the probate process. These assets avoid the delay and public record of the judicial system. Some examples of non-probate property includes: 1) property held in a trust where the property passes to others on death according to the terms of the document, 2) property owned in joint tenancy at death which passes to the surviving joint tenant automatically on death, 3) life insurance on your life that names a beneficiary other than your estate, and 4) qualified plans, such as 401(k)s and IRAs that name a beneficiary other than your estate.
Revocable living trusts
One of the more popular probate-avoiding estate planning tools is the revocable living trust. A revocable living trust creates a legal entity that owns your assets. You can dictate the provisions of the trust document which will control the disposition of the assets inside the trust during your disability or your death. For example, if you have certain wishes for a pet or a horse you can outline them within these trust provisions. The person who must follow the directions outlined in the trust is the trustee, they hold fiduciary duty. Typically, the initial trustee of a revocable living trust is you. Upon your death or disability, a successor trustee, whom you named in the trust document, takes over to distribute your property according to your wishes.
Equine assets in the estate
Please remember that anyone with assets, family, children or horses should evaluate an estate plan. If you have children, a will is necessary to ensure that if you die, you (and not a judge) have chosen a guardian for them. For those of us with horses, remember that with proper care and a little luck, horses can live for 25 to 30 years, sometimes even outliving their owners. When that happens, the surviving horses become tangible personal property in the estates of their deceased owners. Though subject to laws prohibiting cruelty to animals, the law treats surviving horses and other companion animals just like any other assets in the estate. Unless specific instructions are provided in an estate plan, the executor or administrator of the estate has the discretion to keep the equine asset in the estate, sell it at auction or by private treaty or otherwise humanely dispose of it, such as by euthanasia.
Pet trusts
Another trust which is becoming increasingly popular with pet owners is a pet trust. Several states, including Oregon, permit legally enforceable pet trusts so that individuals can transfer funds to an enforceable trust to provide for the care of their pet. In a pet trust, you name a trustee who will carry out your wishes for the animal, and provide detailed instructions for the distribution of trust funds for the animal’s care. In addition, you name a caretaker who will care for the pet if you cannot do so. The document should include the identity of the pet, the amount of compensation for the pet’s caretaker, and should specify additional details and instructions about the care of the animal, its habits and needs, end-of-life decisions, and other guidelines and instructions that would be important to the care and support of your companion animals.
Estate planning for pets and other companion animals like horses is a new niche, so you will want to seek out an attorney who is well-versed in this area of the law. When establishing any trust, however, you will need to hire an attorney to draft the trust, preferably a lawyer with experience in estate planning. Eden Rose Brown, an estate planning attorney out of Salem, OR has drafted many pet trusts over the years and has found that, “We’ve had a number of clients who feel that sometimes their pets are more important than their children.” She emphasizes that in the right situation, a pet trust is a responsible, loving thing to do for your pets and is an important part of a comprehensive estate plan.
It is important to understand that a trust is just an empty bucket until the appropriate assets are re-titled into the name of the trust. As we discussed above, the way the asset is titled dictates whether the asset will avoid probate. Many times clients spend a great deal of money to have an attorney draft a trust in order to avoid probate but never change the ownership of their assets. The consequences of this inaction may force some of these “unfunded” assets to go through probate. Therefore, it is very important that if you do set up a trust, be sure to use an attorney who knows how to assist you in the proper transfer of your assets into the name of the trust.
Estate planning is important
Though proper estate planning can sometimes be a complex process, having the right professional team can lift much of that burden. And while getting started can be daunting, remember the values that guide you and your family, and let those guide the process. Taking the time to think about these issues will preserve your life’s work for your family, your horses and your community.!

It’s not too early in the year to say that this book will be a highlight of 2015 for me.</p> <p>And then comes the dilemma: how do you follow such a powerful and affecting book, when there’s a danger that anything else will disappoint? Well, you read the new work of an author who wrote one of your favourite books, that’s how!</p> <p>William Boyd’s 2002 novel <em><a href="">Any Human Heart</a></em> is in my personal Hall of Fame, and so I was excited to bag an advance copy of his forthcoming book, <em>Sweet Caress</em> (it’s due out in September). I’m about a hundred pages in and I’m pleased to report to fans and newcomers alike that it’s so far living up to my fairly high expectations! Like <em><a href="">Any Human Heart</a></em>, <em>Sweet Caress</em> is a study in character across time, in this case following photographer Amory Clay as she documents life in the twentieth century. I’m looking forward to spending some more hours on the couch with it this weekend.</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="drone-theory" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Chris Somerville</a> is reading <em><a href="">Drone Theory</a></em> by Grégoire Chamayou</h2> <p>After reading less than half of an excerpt from Grégoire Chamayou’s <em><a href="">Drone Theory</a></em> on the Longreads website, I’d made up my mind to purchase the book itself. (You can find the excerpt <a href="">here</a>.)</p> <p.</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="everything-illumin" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Georgia Delaney</a> is re-reading <em><a href="">Everything is Illuminated</a></em> by Jonathan Safran Foer</h2> <p>I loved this book as a teenager, but when I gave it to a boy I went out with a few years ago, he showed me into a dark world of Foer-haters, and called it ‘pretentious’ and ‘derivative’. I probably don’t need to describe the melodramatic betrayal that is a partner canning a book you loved, but I now know for sure that said boy’s judgement was completely flawed: This book is wonderfully generous and achingly clever, but not pretentious, or derivative. I love the way Foer exposes the skeleton of a story and how he tells truth about Holocaust and trauma through fiction. And it is hilarious, and heartbreaking. Who needs romance, anyway?</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="on-the-move" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Mark Rubbo</a> is reading <em><a href="">On the Move: A Life</a></em> by Oliver Sacks</h2> <p>I’ve been dipping into Oliver Sacks’ memoir, <em><a href="">On the Move</a></em>.!</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="corner-white" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Bronte Coates</a> is reading <em><a href="">The Colours of Madeleine</a></em> series by Jaclyn Moriarty</h2> <p>I was <em>extremely</em> apprehensive about reading this series, as it marked a big departure from Moriarty’s earlier books (which I’d loved). The story – a ‘crack opens between two world (the 'real’ world and Cello) and allows two characters (Madeleine and Elliot) to communicate via letters – sounded a bit twee and I wasn’t sure if that was how I wanted my fantasy to be. (I wasn’t even sure if this <em>was</em> fantasy.) Nevertheless, I tried to put aside my concerns and ventured into book one: <em><a href="">A Corner of White</a></em>.</p> <p>At first, the situation was worrying. Unlike the immediate rapport I’d felt with <em><a href="">Feeling Sorry for Celia</a></em> (I’d picked it up in a bookshop, read one page and laughed out loud), I felt immediately out-of-step with <em><a href="">A Corner of White</a></em>. From the beginning I just wasn’t sure I was going to <em>get</em> this book. Maybe, I even thought to myself secretly and sadly, I’ve outgrown Jaclyn. So, I sought out Emily Gale (a steadfast and loyal Jaclyn Moriarty fan) for advice. Stick with it, she assured me. And, as usual, she was right.</p> <p>As I read on I fell in love with the characters, got caught up in the mystery of the narrative, and was enchanted by the magic. Like Madeleine in the story, I hadn’t been quite able to believe in the Kingdom of Cello at first but by the end of book one, it felt more real to me than the other world. Moriarty’s Cello is the most marvellous and unique version of ‘Narnia’ that I’ve read in recent years. I’m so excited for book 3.</p> 9937 The best books to take on a long flight 2015-05-22T00:00:00Z <h2>Earlier this week, a customer requested a list of aeroplane reads. Here, different staff share what they consider the ‘perfect’ read for a long-haul flight.</h2> <hr> <h2><a href="">Nina Kenwood</a></h2> <p>I never buy celebrity magazines until I am faced with a plane trip (of any length) and then suddenly, I must have <em>WHO</em> and <em>NW</em> in my hands. This also applies to books – I read a lot of literary fiction in my everyday life, but I can’t stomach it on a plane. I generally want easy, fast-paced or funny during my air travel.</p> <p>To that end, I recommend taking an addictive psychological thriller (along the lines of <em><a href="">The Girl on the Train</a></em> and <em><a href="">Gone Girl</a></em>), something legal or criminal (I once read <em><a href="">The Lincoln Lawyer</a></em> on an international flight and it was exactly the right combo of pacing, intrigue and light entertainment) or a funny memoir (Tina Fey’s <em><a href="">Bossypants</a></em> was my companion on a long plane ride across the USA).</p> <p>Finally, I like to watch a lot of movies on long flights, so a book about movies (such as the wonderful and very fun <em><a href="">Life Moves Pretty Fast</a></em>) would be an excellent addition – read a chapter, watch the movie discussed in the chapter, read the next chapter, watch the next movie, and so on.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="">Fiona Hardy</a></h2> <p>I’m a great believer in taking as many books as possible in your carry-on luggage, or at least in my case, as many as I can fit around all the Pringles. I never know what mood I’ll be in, so I need to cater for anything Future Fiona might want.</p> <p>If I was going on a long-haul flight soon, I’d probably pack my so-far-unread copy of Knausgaard’s <em><a href="">A Death in the Family</a></em>. It’s a book that I’ve been wanting to read for a while, but which requires a place of concentration (i.e. not my loud house). I also love magazine on flights and recently came across <em>The Happy Reader</em> series. Each issue of this publication is split into two halves: the first half is an in-depth interview with a book fanatic and the second half gets under the skin of one classic work of literature. Having adored the <a href="">first issue</a>, I’d definitely pack the <a href="">second issue</a> (which has been inspired in part by Kakuzo Okakura’s <em><a href="">The Book of Tea</a></em>).</p> <p>And, for something completely different, I might even pack a bunch of pencils and Emma Farrarons’s <em><a href="">The Mindfulness Colouring Book</a></em> – to pull out when staring at hours of sky and sea starts to get a little mind-emptying.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="">Emily Gale</a></h2> <p>It doesn’t feel good to write that I’ve spent 200 hours in the air during the past decade flying backwards and forwards between Australia and the UK, mostly with two small children. Yes, we were the family you tried to repel using unspeakably dark thoughts as we crashed up the aisle with strung-out expressions, nappy bags and – once – a toddler loudly declaring: ‘Mummy, fink I got worms.’</p> <p>So, for your sake and mine, I suggest purely escapist reads. Liane Moriarty’s funny, sharp stories about family have helped me to go to my happy place on several flights (<em><a href="">The Last Anniversary</a></em> would be a good choice; it’s quite eccentric). I also remember being so absorbed by Maggie O'Farrell’s <em><a href="">After You’d Gone</a></em> that I didn’t even squeeze my eyes shut or grip the armrests during the landing (I’m usually a nervous flyer).</p> <p>If novels failed I would re-read <em>For Better For Worse, For Richer For Poorer</em>, a memoir about a couple with two small children who decide to switch their comfortable existence on land for six months on a very small boat travelling down the waterways of France. The narrative flips between the husband and wife and it’s a good reminder that it’s alright to absolutely loathe your spouse on long journeys. It doesn’t count.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="">Alan Vaarwerk</a></h2> <p>I find it difficult to concentrate on flights, and I also get a bit queasy, so Serious Literature doesn’t work for me in the air. Rather, I tend to favour short-story collections and humour writing, that I can read easily or dip in and out of. I recently devoured Amy Poehler’s <em><a href="">Yes Please</a></em> over a return flight, and I can see myself reaching for Zoe Norton Lodge’s new collection <em><a href="">Almost Sincerely</a></em> as the seatbelt sign switched off. On my next flight I’m going to try taking along a graphic novel – maybe Scott McCloud’s <em><a href="">The Sculptor</a></em> or Jillian Tamaki’s <em><a href="">This One Summer</a></em>. </p> <p>When I get sick of reading I’ll usually switch to a podcast. My current favourites include <a href="">Reply All</a>, <a href="">Kill Your Darlings</a> and <a href="">Bring A Plate</a>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="">Bronte Coates</a></h2> <p>The mere thought of packing causes me crippling indecision and so, naturally, choosing which books to take on a plane trip is a fraught process. I tend to save this decision until the end and am usually facing a shortlist of eight to ten titles. So begins the culling process during which I consider all aspects of the book’s potential: length vs. weight, suitability of subject matter, diversity of the multiple books.</p> <p>In the past I’ve often taken Important Dense books that I’ve been intending to read for years but never quite found the time for. Surely, I think to myself, I should use my impending and temporary imprisonment in a cramped space to my advantage by only packing this one book, thus forcing myself to read it. I can now say, unequivocally, that this has always been a mistake. It turns out that there are many, many ways to avoid reading <em><a href="">Middlemarch</a></em> on an aeroplane if you try hard enough.</p> <p>These days, my general rule of thumb is to pack no more than three books as I just know I’ll end up buying others because, heck, I love buying books. I always try to have one read that sounds fun and fast-paced, and one read that sounds smart and serious. One of the best books I read on a flight recently was <em><a href="">The Silent Woman</a></em> by Janet Malcolm which was a combination of fun/fast-paced and smart/serious. I don’t mind packing a tearjerker. I’m one of those strange people who likes books that make me cry and planes are particularly conducive to this kind of read. Also, if the flight is overseas, I try not to pack any book that is <em>too</em> dear to me as I like being able to trade books in at hostels. </p> <p>Lately, I’ve also been trying out audiobooks on long trips and it’s been tremendously enjoyable. A friend of mine who’s more well-versed in this area than me recently recommended I try Joan Didion’s <em><a href="">Slouching Towards Bethlehem</a></em>, as read by Diane Keaton.</p> <hr> 9936 What I learned from the Level 87 Book Club 2015-05-21T00:00:00Z <h2><a href="">100 Story Building</a> is a centre for young writers based in Melbourne’s inner-west, where children and young people from culturally and linguistically diverse and marginalised backgrounds are given the opportunity to foster their creative voice. The Readings Foundation is a proud supporter of the centre.</h2> <h2>Readings staff member Bronte Coates recently visited <a href="">100 Story Building</a>, and was lucky enough to sit in on their weekly book club for secondary school students.</h2> <hr> <p>Last week I met with the Level 87 Book Club which is hosted by 100 Story Building in Footscray. The club is comprised of some very excellent, smart and lovely teenagers (they didn’t pay me to say that, I swear!) who get together each week to consider things like: the merits of blurbs, reading outside your favourite genres, and <em>never</em> finishing books vs. <em>always</em> finishing books.</p> <p>To kick off the meeting, everyone shared what they’ve been reading lately, or were planning to read next. One member had loved <em><a href="">Days of Blood and Starlight</a></em> by Laini Taylor and was now dying (as in clutching-her-hair-and-sinking-down-in-her-chair-with-anticipation kind of dying) to read the new book from Sarah J. Maas: <em><a href="">A Court of Thorns and Roses</a></em>. Another member was planning to re-read Raymond Feist’s <em>Magicians</em> series (which starts <a href="">here</a>), and this time, in it’s entirety. Everyone looked very solemn and impressed by this news. A third member had just finished <em><a href="">Paper Towns</a></em> by John Green, which led to a discussion about whether the new film adaptation will be any good. (Verdict: Undecided.)</p> <p>So, Lesson #1: Teenagers <em>do</em> like to read books and, most importantly, they all like <em>different</em> books.</p> <p>The discussion took a sudden turn when one member announced they’d had a Book Crisis. (Lesson #2: Book crises are better when shared then when tackled on your own.)</p> <div class="figure-overhang-left"> <img alt="100-story-photo3" src="" /><em>Photos by Simon Conlon, 100 Story Building</em> </div> <p>A staunch fan of Rainbow Rowell’s <em><a href="">Eleanor & Park</a></em> and <em><a href="">Fangirl</a></em>, she’d found the premise of the romance in the author’s debut book <em><a href="">Attachments</a></em> ‘creepy’. Having persevered despite her misgivings, the ending had made her so angry she’d all but thrown the book across the room. It’s worth noting that a fellow fan of Rowell’s was <em>appalled</em> to hear this development.</p> <p>This turn in the discussion led us all to reflect on how several other famous love stories are creepy as well, including a personal favourite: <em><a href="">Jane Eyre</a></em>. (Lesson #3: When you start analysing it, ‘romance’ just is creepy.) Eventually, it was decided that some of the classic novels could be excused because you know – history. Other more contemporary love stories (looking at you <em><a href="">The Time Traveler’s Wife</a></em>) were less easy to make sense of but we all agreed that the romance only <em>feels</em> creepy if you personally don’t believe in it.</p> <p>In less creepy news, for a great love story, one member recommended <em><a href="">Americanah</a></em>.</p> <p>To finish the week’s discussion, everyone voted on which book they would read to discuss and eventually settled on <em><a href="">Eat the Sky, Drink the Ocean</a></em>, a collection of sci-fi and fantasy stories from Indian and Australian writers and artists. We’ll be publishing the book club’s response to this read so keep an eye out.</p> <hr> <h2>Find out more about the Level 87 Book Club (as well as other workshops run by 100 Story Building) <a href="">here</a>.</h2> 9944 Mark Rubbo is named the recipient of the 2015 Lloyd O’Neill Award 2015-05-21T00:00:00Z <div class="figure-overhang-left"> <img alt="mark-rubbo-lloyd" src="" /> </div> <p>Our Managing Director Mark Rubbo has been named the 2015 recipient of the Lloyd O’Neil Award for a person who has made a significant, dedicated contribution to the development and reputation of the Australian book industry.

Were you scared? Do you have any advice for others dreaming of greener fields?</h2> <p>People often asked if we were scared, but you know, we were so excited about the move that we had little time to be scared. It was something we really wanted to do for so long and the timing was right. We were so keen to be in the country. In terms of advice, I should be sensible and say research the area, find a job before you go, have lots of savings and a back-up plan. We, however, didn’t do any of that. We visited Tasmania, fell in love and just took a leap of faith. That worked for us. It might work for you too! </p> <h2>I know the book is shaped a little by your terrific blog (find it <a href="">here</a>). How long have you been writing and sharing stories of your family life?</h2> <p>I started the blog in 2006, so that’s quite a while now. I can’t quite believe how far we’ve come since then, how much the children have grown and how much the house has changed. It’s wonderful to have documented the changes and now be able to look back and reflect on all we’ve achieved and the fun times we’ve had.</p> <h2>Do you write every week, every season or every harvest?</h2> <p>I vary in the regularity. Ideally once a week, but life’s been pretty busy lately and finding the time to blog regularly is tricky. That said, if we something happens and the words flutter around in my head then I can’t do anything else until I write them down. </p> <h2>The images used in your book are simply beautiful. The garden is obviously a continual work in progress. Do you have a preferred time to be outside?</h2> <p>It depends on the time of year. In summer, early morning or late in the evenings are truly lovely times to be outside as the air is milder and the sun has lost its fierce sting. In midwinter though, it is best to be out in the middle of the day when it’s sunny and warm, and the frost has melted. </p> <h2>Do you have a favourite season, and therefore a beloved meal to serve at that time?</h2> <p>I’m a huge fan of comfort food – hearty stews, slowly cooked roasts, fruity puddings – so that means winter to me! I love winter because of this kind of food and I spend a lot of time indoors by the stove, keeping warm.</p> <h2>I’m positive that the images in your book would make even the most city-centric person want to run to your place. But do you ever dream of running back to the city?</h2> <p>I get the occasional pang for sure. I miss the diversity of the city, the culture, the beautiful parks and the well-dressed people. Our town is pretty daggy! But after a couple of days of visiting the city I really do yearn to get back to the country to my friends with their holey jumpers and scruffy boots. </p> <h2>Will you continue to write your blog now that you have a solid wonderful tangible book?</h2> <p>Of course! The great thing about blogging is that it is relatively instant – a post only takes a few hours to put together and a book can take years. I still love writing and taking photographs and blogging is the best way to set those words free into the world.</p> <hr> <h2>We have a limited number of signed copies of <em><a href="">A Table in the Orchard</a></em> available at our Carlton shop, and online.

We’re enormously proud.</h2> <h2>Here, he tells us his favourite books to handsell and why publishers must continue to be ‘daring’.</h2> <hr> <h2>What are your favourite books to handsell to customers?</h2> <p>Two books I always enjoy sending to good homes are Katherine Dunn’s <em><a href="">Geek Love</a></em> and Sarah Bakewell’s genial but sagacious biography of Michel de Montaigne: <em><a href="">How to Live: A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer</a></em>. Dunn’s novel is <em>sui generis</em> among modern American fiction yet never quite gained the foothold on the popular consciousness it deserved, while Bakewell’s biography is a charming and clear-sighted primer on one of the most influential – and delightful! – writers who ever lived: the 16th century French nobleman-turned-spelunker-of-the-self who (arguably) first put the ‘I’ in ‘non-fiction’ in any meaningful way. Witold Gombrowicz’s <em><a href="">Diary</a></em> is another book I’m forever entreating the right customers to read.</p> <p>More recently, I’ve loved connecting readers with John Darnielle’s <em><a href="">Wolf in White Van</a></em>, Deborah Levy’s slim but weighty volume <em><a href="">Things I Don’t Want to Know</a></em>, Elena Ferrante’s astonishing <a href="">Neapolitan novels</a>, Antonio Muñoz Molina’s equally jaw-slackening Spanish civil war epic <em><a href="">In the Night of Time</a></em> and my friend and colleague A.S. Patrić’s <em><a href="">Black Rock White City</a></em>.</p> <h2>What’s the most memorable thing to happen to you in a bookshop?</h2> <p>Working in St Kilda, there have been many – some of them too salacious or distressing to repeat. I’ll decline the easy route of the celebrity anecdote and instead recall the day a dust-caked and grizzled old timer with a face John Ford would’ve loved lumbered up to me, thumped his heavy, callused hands on the counter and, fixing me with a bugged and bloodshot eye, drawled, ‘Where’s ‘ya gold prospectin’ section, matey?’</p> <h2>Who’s one of the most important authors you’ve ever read?</h2> <p>Montaigne really had a huge impact on me when I began reading him intently about four or five years ago; his famous sceptical remark, ‘Que sçay-je?’ (‘What do I know?’) somehow permissioned me as both an aspiring writer and indeed a human being to be okay with dwelling in doubt, equivocation and ambiguity. Keats’ idea of negative capability is similarly resonant to me.</p> <p>I’ve long been suspicious of all things and people resolute and unbudging – a holdover, perhaps, from a Catholic education. But then again, intransigent rationalists freak me out almost as much as anti-abortion campaigners and suicide bombers, so who knows? I suppose I just flinch from anyone unreceptive to outside influence. Montaigne’s ability to question received wisdoms, quite radical in its day, and to hold every thought, however trivial, up to the light and examine all its facets has played a major part in developing the sense of fertile uncertainty I try as best I can to meet the world with.</p> <h2>How do you envision the future of bookselling?</h2> <p>The critical advantage that bricks-and-mortar bookstores have over retailers like Amazon and its dubious subsidiaries, and that ebook thing, are the relationships we form with customers. And, at the end of the day, booksellers are proselytisers for the church of literature – books form our pantheon – and no-one wants to feel like a shill by preaching through gritted teeth about some false idol. So, we need good books. Publishers must continue to produce bold and wonderful books, to be daring in their lists. For bookselling as we know it to remain culturally viable, publishers need to keep booksellers’ faith alive – encourage us to spread the word! – by engendering a rich and heterogeneous literary culture.</p> <hr> <p><strong><a href="">Gerard Elson</a> works as a bookseller at Readings St Kilda.</strong></p> 9929 Our top ten bestsellers of the week 2015-05-18T00:00:00Z <ol> <li><em><a href="">The Mindfulness Colouring Book: Anti-Stress Art Therapy for Busy People</a></em> by Emma Farrarons</li> <li><em><a href="">The Strays</a></em> by Emily Bitto</li> <li><em><a href="">Beyond Literal Belief: Religion As Metaphor</a></em> by David Tacey</li> <li><em><a href="">A God in Ruins</a></em> by Kate Atkinson</li> <li><em><a href="">The Green Road</a></em> by Anne Enright</li> <li><em><a href="">The Little Paris Bookshop</a></em> by Nina George (translated by Simon Pare)</li> <li><em><a href="">The Girl on the Train</a></em> by Paula Hawkins</li> <li><em><a href="">The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically</a></em> by Peter Singer</li> <li><em><a href="">Enchanted Forest</a></em> by Johanna Basford</li> <li><em><a href="">My Brilliant Friend</a></em> by Elena Ferrante (translated by Ann Goldstein)</li> </ol> <p>Our bestsellers this week include two stunning colouring books (<em><a href="">The Mindfulness Colouring Book</a></em>, <em><a href="">Enchanted Forest</a></em>), two translated novels (<em><a href="">The Little Paris Bookshop</a></em>, <em><a href="">My Brilliant Friend</a></em>), two fascinating non-fiction releases from Australian thinkers (<em><a href="">Beyond Literal Belief</a></em>, <em><a href="">The Most Good You Can Do</a></em>) and an award-winning debut novel from a local author (<em><a href="">The Strays</a></em>).</p> <p>The list also includes two May releases from much-loved UK authors: Kate Atkinson’s <em><a href="">A God in Ruins</a></em> which our reviewer calls, “<a href="">a beautifully structured novel with a breathtaking narrative</a>”, and Anne Enright’s <em><a href="">The Green Road</a></em> which our reviewer calls, “<a href="">a gorgeously raw and expansive examination of the family</a>”.</p> 9930 The Miles Franklin Shortlist 2015 2015-05-18T00:00:00Z <h2>The 2015 Miles Franklin shortlist has been announced.

Just the words ‘Judy Blume’ evoke comfort in me. Along with most of the adult population of my generation (and those before, and after) I grew up reading her books, and I also grew up hearing other people talking about her books. Blume is more than just an author – her impact on literature has been profound.</p> <p>I’m about a third of the way through <em><a href="">In the Unlikely Event</a></em> and so far, it’s a delight. Blume’s writing is warm and funny and similar in tone to Anne Tyler’s, although Blume is more concerned with her younger characters than Tyler. </p> <p><em><a href="">In the Unlikely Event</a></em> is out in June, and I can’t wait to discuss it with other people. </p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="gutshot" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Alan Vaarwerk</a> is reading <em><a href="">Gutshot</a></em> by Amelia Gray</h2> <p>I’m pretty excited to get stuck into more of Amelia Gray’s deliciously weird and punchy flash fiction..</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="other-side-reading" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Emily Harms</a> is reading <em><a href="">The Other Side of the World</a></em> by Stephanie Bishop</h2> <p>I’ve just finished reading an early copy of the second novel from superb Australian author Stephanie Bishop.</p> <p>In 2006, Bishop was named one of the <em>Sydney Morning Herald’s</em> Best Young Australian Novelists for her debut novel, <em><a href="">The Singing</a></em>. Her second novel has now arrived, almost ten years later, and has already been shortlisted for the 2014 <em>Australian</em>/Vogel’s Literary Award – under the original title ‘Dream England’. The book is due for release in July as <em><a href="">The Other Side of the World</a></em>.</p> <p>Set in Cambridge in 1963, the novel hones in on the subtle unravelling of a relationship. Having gone through a miscarriage and now struggling with balancing parenting with limited time for herself to paint, Charlotte is in a bad place. Her husband, Henry, wants life to return to how it used to be before they had children and believes everything will be alright again – if they just avoid another English winter and move to Australia.

Now, in the book that this long article began, Bolick looks at the lives of a number of great ‘spinsters’ throughout history – single women who were highly productive, successful and prolific artists.

The second thing you need to know is that she’ll change your life (sort of).</p> <p>I bought her bestselling book about tidying, <em><a href="">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying</a></em>, at the start of the year because I was determined that 2015 was going to be different. I am someone with little to no interest in cleaning, and my boyfriend is a very messy person by nature, so combined, our one-bedroom apartment can get a little out of control. (If a visitor drops by unannounced, we sometimes pretend we’re not home.)</p> <p>I read about Marie Kondo’s method of tidying and how revolutionary it was, and I thought: ‘This is the answer to all my housecleaning problems – perhaps even <em>all</em> my problems, period.’ After all, Kondo has clients whose lives are completely changed after completing her KonMari Method. My hopes were sky high when I bought the book. I was going to become a better person, and I was going to force my boyfriend to change too!</p> <p>I read the book aloud to him over the course of a few nights. I’m not going to lie – we laughed a lot. Marie Kondo is <em>intense</em>. She’s appalled that very few people have studied tidying formally (less than 0.5%, she shockingly reveals). As a child, while other kids at school were outside playing she was ‘checking on the content of the mop cupboard’. She would tidy her room obsessively every day after school and monitored her family’s clothing – if she deemed they weren’t wearing something enough, she would secretly throw it out. When she puts her clothes away at the end of the day, she thanks each item, out loud, before putting it in its designated spot. This is a woman who is <em>serious</em> about tidying. (She’s also now such a celebrity in Japan that she gets mobbed on the subway.)</p> <p>As well as being a highly entertaining read, <em><a href="">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying</a></em> does have a lot of interesting things to say about keeping your house tidy. </p> <p>Here are a few snippets of wisdom from the book:</p> <p>‘Tidying by location is a fatal mistake.’<br> ‘Tidy a little a day and you’ll be tidying forever.’<br> ‘Tidying is a special event… tidying should be done just once.’<br> ‘Put all your clothes in one pile, take them in your hand one by one, and ask yourself quietly, “Does this spark joy?”’<br> ‘Folding is a form of dialogue with our clothes.’</p> <p>I bravely undertook the special, once-in-a-lifetime KonMari Method clean out of everything. I put every single piece of clothing in the house in a huge pile on the floor in the lounge room and sorted through it all, assessing carefully for feelings of joy. (Admittedly, joy became harder and harder to come across as the day wore on, and the pile remained terrifyingly large.) As a result, I discarded bags and bags of stuff. It felt great. It was very liberating to realise I was hanging on to a lot of clothing for the wrong reasons. We then did the same with our kitchen cupboards, and discovered they were full of unnecessary clutter. </p> <p>Here’s where I admit I didn’t undertake the KonMari Method properly, because I couldn’t bear to KonMari my books. Kondo has some very strong thoughts on books, including a rule about getting rid of any books you haven’t read yet. Kondo believes if you don’t read a book immediately, then its chance is over and it has to go. Needless to say, I strongly disagree and my bookshelves remain stuffed.</p> <p>The special KonMari method of folding and storing clothing did change my life – or, at least, it changed how I fold and keep my clothes in my cupboards. I did all of this six months ago, and I’ve stuck to it, mostly. Certainly my clothes cupboards have been kept in much better order, I no longer hang on to stuff I don’t need and I’ve figured out a place for everything in my apartment. Is my house perfectly tidy? No. But it’s not because of clutter anymore – it’s because I hate doing the dishes. </p> <hr> <p><strong><a href="">Nina Kenwood</a> is the digital marketing manager for Readings.</strong></p> 9897 Best new crime in May 2015-05-12T00:00:00Z <p><a href=""><img alt="truth-fiona" src="" /></a></p> <h2>CRIME BOOK OF THE MONTH:</h2> <h2><em><a href="">The Truth and Other Lies</a></em> by Sascha Arango</h2> <p>Claus Moreany’s publishing house is on the verge of going under when his distractingly beautiful employee Betty discovers unknown author Henry Hayden’s manuscript in a pile. <em>Frank Ellis</em> becomes a runaway bestseller, subsequent books sell millions, and Hayden becomes a wealthy man living in a beautiful house with his lovely wife, a sporty-looking dog and the magazine spreads to prove it. All is well until the day that Betty, who is not his wife, tells him that she is pregnant with his child. Henry vows to himself: it is time to tell Martha the truth. But Henry has never been a man to care about things like the truth when a skewed version of events will suffice.</p> <p><em><a href="">The Truth and Other Lies</a></em> is a marvellous book, the kind that never lets you get comfortable enough to let you think you know what’s happening – author Sascha Arango is always one step ahead of you, and his creation, Henry, is one calculated story away from reality. Being this wrong-footed is quite the delight, as is Hayden, smooth as aged whiskey but with as many secrets as a thirteen-year-old’s diary. I barely want to say more in case I spoil anything for you, but Arango’s icy prose and Germany’s sun-kissed seaside locale make for the perfect read as our own nights get longer, and as dark as Hayden himself.</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="crash-fiona" src="" /></a></p> <h2><em><a href="">After the Crash</a></em> by Michel Bussi</h2> <p>In 1980, a plane crashes into a mountainside in the middle of the night, on the way from Istanbul to Paris. Out of the 169 on board, 168 perish – and one survives, a three-month-old baby girl. But when two separate sets of paternal grandparents – one rich and connected, one poor and sick – contact the hospital to check on her, the world is gripped by her story: a little girl no one can prove is their own. Eighteen years later, the private detective hired to find the truth sits with a gun in front of his notes, no closer to a solution and ready to end his own life, when, finally, the answer becomes obvious – and someone else beats him to the gunshot. </p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="dislaimer-fiona" src="" /></a></p> <h2><em><a href="">Disclaimer</a></em> by Renée Knight</h2> <p>Documentary filmmaker Catherine and her husband Robert, having downsized in the wake of their adult son leaving the nest, are in the middle of sorting out a house-worth of mess and memories when Catherine starts reading the book at her bedside, <em>A Perfect Stranger</em>. It starts pleasantly enough, until she realises that the woman at the centre of the book is more than familiar: it’s her, and the story is that of a long-ago holiday shrouded in danger that she hoped to forget, and a secret she was planning never to disclose. So how did the book get into her house – and who knows her secret when the only witness is dead?</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="zagreb-fiona" src="" /></a></p> <h2><em><a href="">The Lady from Zagreb</a></em> by Philip Kerr</h2> <p>Let’s face it, I almost made this Book of the Month for the title alone: not ‘The Girl from Zagreb’, but The LADY from Zagreb. A+ and a gold star then to Kerr for the title and, of course, for the book itself, another tale following deliciously cynical detective Bernie Gunther whose sardonic travels throughout Nazi Germany have entranced readers. With his ability to make historical Berlin and its surrounds seem real enough to be just beyond your front door, he plumbs the past for a complex series of events, not least Gunther’s task of tracking down a highly desired actress’s missing father in Zurich on the orders of none less than Joseph Goebbels himself.</p> <hr> <p><strong><a href="">Fiona Hardy</a> blogs about Crime Fiction at <a href="">readingkills.com</a> and puts together the Dead Write column for the <em>Readings Monthly</em> newsletter.</strong></p> 9918 Getting to know our shortlisted authors: Tamsin Janu TAMSIN JANU</h2> <hr> <p><img alt="tamsinphoto" src="" /> </p> <p>Tamsin Janu is the debut author who is taking Australian children’s literary shortlists by storm with <em><a href="">Figgy in the World</a></em>. (<em>Ed. note: Ahem, we were the first…</em>)</p> <p>Tamsin is originally from Sydney, where she studied law and international and global studies, but since January 2014 she’s worked as a youth worker in a remote community in the Northern Territory Central Desert.</p> <p><em><a href="">Figgy in the World</a></em> was inspired by her three-month stay in Ghana, West Africa, in 2009, when she worked in a school and orphanage and stayed with a local family.</p> <hr> <h2>1. What were you like as a kid?</h2> <p>Stubborn!</p> <h2>2. When did you first want to be a writer?</h2> <p>I’ve loved writing stories since I was a kid. I don’t think there was a moment when I wanted to be a ‘writer’ as such, but I was 19 or 20 when I first began to write stories outside of a school environment, just for fun.</p> <h2>3. How did <em><a href="">Figgy in the World</a></em> begin?</h2> <p>When I returned home from three months in Ghana I wanted to write something that would help me remember my experiences there. I decided that Ghana would be an interesting and unique setting for a kid’s story, and that’s when I came up with the character of Figgy and her mission. I had written journal entries everyday during my stay in Ghana, so that helped to bring back memories, sights and sounds; I visited most of the places Figgy and Nana visit in the book. </p> <h2>4. What is your favourite scene in the book?</h2> <p>I like when Figgy and Nana visit the orphanage. It is quite a sad scene but it helps Figgy to understand how lucky she is to have a loving family. And every time I read the scene it reminds me of the orphanage I worked in when I was in Ghana, and the kids who lived there. </p> <h2>5. How did the book get its contract?</h2> <p>I sent the first chapter of the book to two big publishers, and the whole manuscript to Scholastic Omnibus. Scholastic Omnibus suggested some improvements I could make – I made them, and they offered me a contract!</p> <h2>6. What were some of your favourite books when you were a kid?</h2> <p>I loved anything by <a href="">Morris Gleiztman </a>(<em>Two Weeks with the Queen</em>, <em>Water Wings</em>, <em>Blabber Mouth</em>, <em>Misery Guts</em>), by <a href="">Roald Dahl</a> (<em>Matilda</em>, <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>, <em>The BFG</em>, <em>The Witches</em>) and by Enid Blyton (<em><a href="">The Faraway Tree</a></em>, <em><a href="">The Wishing-Chair</a></em>, <em><a href="">Malory Towers</a></em>). </p> <p>I also really liked horses as a kid, and the idea of owning one, so the <em><a href="">Saddle Club</a></em> series was a favourite. And – of course – I devoured <em><a href="">Harry Potter</a></em> every time a new book came out. </p> <h2>7. What was the last book you loved?</h2> <p>I recently read <em><a href="">The One and Only Ivan</a></em> by Katherine Applegate, which I thought was great. Sweet, funny, a bit sad but ultimately uplifting.</p> <p>(<em>Ed note: <a href="">The One and Only Ivan</a> is narrated by a silverback gorilla, and has won several awards.</em>)</p> <h2>8. What is your ultimate ambition as a writer?</h2> <p>To write stories that are entertaining but also make kids think.</p> <h2>9. If you won the RCBP, who is the first person you would tell and how would you celebrate?</h2> <p>I’d probably tell my Mum first. And I’m not sure how I’d celebrate, maybe I’d have a nice dinner or something!</p> <h2>10. And finally, what is your preferred writing snack?</h2> <p>Chocolate and/or roasted almonds. Preferably chocolate covered roasted almonds!<> 9921 Our top ten bestsellers of the week 2015-05-11T00:00:00Z <ol> <li><em><a href="">The Strays</a></em> by Emily Bitto</li> <li><em><a href="">A God in Ruins</a></em> by Kate Atkinson</li> <li><em><a href="">The Mindfulness Colouring Book: Anti-Stress Art Therapy for Busy People</a></em> by Emma Farrarons</li> <li><em><a href="">The Green Road</a></em> by Anne Enright</li> <li><em><a href="">The Girl on the Train</a></em> by Paula Hawkins</li> <li><em><a href="">Between You and Me: Confessions of a Comma Queen</a></em> by Mary Norris</li> <li><em><a href="">Double Act: The Remarkable Lives & Careers of Googie Withers & John McCallum</a></em> by Brian McFarlane</li> <li><em><a href="">One Life: My Mother’s Story</a></em> by Kate Grenville</li> <li><em><a href="">The Little Paris Bookshop</a></em> by Nina George (translated by Simon Pare)</li> <li><em><a href="">Bloodhound: Searching for My Father</a></em> by Ramona Koval</li> </ol> <p>Our head book buyer Martin Shaw described the month of May as ‘<a href="">a bountiful one in terms of new releases</a>’, and this is evident by the number of fantastic new releases in our top ten list.

Her debut was <em><a href="">Rivertime</a></em>, a graphic novel about a boy who, initially reluctant to leave behind the comforts of toys and computer screen, ends up having the time of his life on a boat trip with his Uncle Egg. A beautiful and very moving picture book called <em><a href="">Shine</a></em> comes out next month, and rumour has it that <em><a href="">Rivertime</a></em> may have a standalone sequel, which here at Readings we are extremely excited about!</p> <hr> <h2>1. What were you like as a kid?</h2> <p>I spent a lot of time in my favourite spot, up a tree in my garden. Otherwise I was often hanging out on my Dragstar bike or with our dear dog Sha, or drawing in my bedroom overlooking that tree in the garden. I remember how I was struggling to draw people’s hands so I used to put them in their pockets. Now I just let them have wonky hands!</p> <h2>2. When did you first want to be a writer?</h2> <p>I believe us humans can all sing, dance, make art, and write… just some people get paid for it. I’ve been writing letters to friends across the planet, often filled with sketches and doodles for most of my life. Having a son inspired me to make him lots of little picture books, some of which have since become recorded songs. ‘The Trusty Rusty Bike’ is my favourite. When I hear the song I feel happy, just like I do when I’m gliding down a hill on my bike. I also wrote a song about my experience paddling whilst on the Glenelg River. I have made several animations, which start with drawing and writing storyboards.</p> <h2>3. How did <em><a href="">Rivertime</a></em> begin?</h2> <p>The little seed was a beautiful wooden canoe that I spent ten days in on the Glenelg River, with my partner Greg. Of course my trusty journal came along too, and by the end was overflowing, and ready to be twisted into a story! The river’s natural beauty and remoteness from the modern world really affected me. Sitting in a silent boat with a keen bird watcher sparked my growing interest in birds. </p> <h2>4. What is your favourite scene in the book?</h2> <p>I like the night scene where they’re paddling on the river. It takes me back there. And when they have dinner on the boat… oh, and the swimming wallaby (yes, we did see one).</p> <h2>5. How did the book get its contract?</h2> <p>A dear friend told me about some funding from the Australian Society of Authors to develop children’s books, due in two days! I had just returned from the river and thought if I made our story of travelling on the river about a kid and his uncle, then the story would be worth sharing with kids, especially city kids. </p> <p>This is my first published book, and aiming for a graphic novel was like setting off on a huge adventure into the unknown. So when I saw a workshop for comic makers I booked in. But I was the only one who did! So I took the teacher out for lunch, showed him what I was up too, and quizzed him on any clues on how to go about such an ambitious undertaking. He gave me some great advice, as well as introduced me to Erica Wagner, the publisher at Allen and Unwin. She really trusted and understood what I was aiming for.</p> <h2>6. What were some of your favourite books when you were a kid?</h2> <p>I loved <em><a href="">Pippi Longstocking</a></em> - she was so mischievous. Also loved the whimsical <em><a href="">The Little Prince</a></em> and <em><a href="">Storm Boy</a></em>. I wanted to be like him, roving around in the wild with a bird friend.</p> <h2>7. What was the last book you loved?</h2> <p><em><a href="">The Encyclopedia Of Early Earth</a></em> , a graphic novel by Isabel Greenberg. I really admire her combination of words and images, and the story and characters are just so quirky!</p> <h2>8. What is your ultimate ambition as a writer?</h2> <p>I’d love to keep on getting books into libraries, and out to people for the rest of my life! I love that <em><a href="">Rivertime</a></em> and the workshops I’ve been running related to the book are getting readers inspired to care more about this beautiful planet. </p> <p>I recently spent a week with 500 kids making local bird posters for the Castlemaine Festival. For some of those kids it may spark a lifelong interest in birds. So I guess my ambition extends well beyond the books, which are like a stepping stone for myself and the readers. I could also imagine <em><a href="">Rivertime</a></em> as a beautiful film. </p> <p>My latest book with Allen and Unwin is <em><a href="">Shine</a></em>, a children’s book about death. I hope if faced by loss of someoneclose to them, readers may find some comfort and insight. I wrote it specifically for my niece at a hugely difficult time. </p> <div class="figure-right"> <img alt="traceatwork" src="" /> </div> <h2>9. If you won the RCBP, who is the first person you would tell and how would you celebrate?</h2> <p>Uncle Egg and Clancy… whoops, I mean my partner Greg and my son Joe! It’s easy to get them confused! I reckon we’d take some fish and chips out for dinner in the canoe.</p> <h2>10. What is your preferred writing snack?</h2> <p>Seeds, a bit of fruit… like a bird, really!<> 9898 Our favourite family recipes 2015-05-08T00:00:00Z <h2>We’re loving the gorgeous new cookbook, <em><a href="">Margaret and Me</a></em>, in which Kate Gibbs explores how her grandmother Margaret Fulton has influenced Kate’s own passion for food.</h2> <h2>Inspired by <em><a href="">Margaret and Me</a></em>, we recently tried our hand at making some of our favourite family recipes and sharing them over lunch. Here’s our staff on their own culinary influences…</h2> <hr> <h2>Jan Lockwood:</h2> <p>I’ve decided to make my mum’s cottage pie, mainly because I loved it, and also because I haven’t eaten it for about 30 years. This dish (not really a recipe) was made out of leftovers from the Sunday roast. Whatever the roast meat was, it was minced up in my mum’s hand-mincing machine and put into a baking dish. Then veggies and gravy were thrown in, and the lot was covered with leftover mashed potato and topped with grated cheese (the only non-leftover part). From what I remember, this pie tasted nicer than the original roast dinner – maybe it had something to do with being cooked twice. So, to re-create this, I too will make a roast dinner and leave it, in my attempt to capture that <em>je ne sais quoi</em>.</p> <hr> <h2>Alan Vaarwerk:</h2> <p>Growing up, Salmon Mornay was my family’s go-to meal and my dad’s favourite meal to cook for my brother and I when Mum was out. My dad, however, decided early on that ‘Salmon Mornay’ was a name unworthy of his creation and therefore, in a moment of pure dadness, christened the dish ‘Fish Delish’. We’d usually have it with rice or sometimes over vegetables, and the basic white sauce part of the recipe was the backbone for lots of other dishes. There’s nothing remotely sexy about it, but as far as bang for your buck goes, there’s not much that beats Fish Delish. </p> <hr> <h2>Emily Harms:</h2> <p>My childhood memories come flooding back with the smell of a cinnamon tea cake. I remember walking in the door after a big day at school with my brothers and sister to the smell of a freshly baked cinnamon tea cake, which we would devour in seconds while still warm. My mum originally found this recipe from <em>Margaret Fulton’s Baking</em> – Margaret’s first ever baking collection that includes her best tried and triple-tested recipes. It must be good as this recipe has even made it into the <a href="">recently updated edition</a> of the cookbook. </p> <p>I now know why it’s a staple recipe in any household: it’s quick, simple and tastes amazing! So when I thought about what to bake for today’s celebration of our family recipes, as my kids were driving me nuts and I realised I’d have to whip something up quite quickly – Margaret’s (and my mum’s and no doubt, so many other mum’s) trusty cinnamon tea cake was an obvious choice. The combination of vanilla cake topped with a generous sprinkling of sugar and cinnamon – YUM! – always reminds me of hot jam donuts and is the perfect, rock solid comfort food for this autumnal weather.</p> <hr> <h2>Judi Mitchell:</h2> <p>I’ve made ‘Parlies’ or ‘Scottish Parliament Cakes’ for today. I found this recipe in a tiny Scottish cookbook I bought years ago whilst living in Glasgow. They are not actually cakes but tasty, slightly ginger biscuits first supplied by a shop in Edinburgh to Members of the Scottish Parliament and gentry. Whilst not handed down through my family it is a nod to my Scottish heritage and the ten years I spent living there. They remind me of Sunday afternoons spent at my Nanna’s as a child, her warm heart, gentle Scottish brogue and mean Canasta skills. She always had tea and biscuits for us and I wouldn’t have been surprised if these had been in her repertoire. Now, I’m wondering what my Nanna would think of the current political events in Scotland?</p> <hr> <h2>Bronte Coates:</h2> <p>Even though my mum makes terrific meals she’s not actually a fan of cooking – she’d really prefer to wash the dishes instead of chop the onion – and has a very practical approach to mealtimes. Easy, organic and large quantities seem to be her guidelines and ultimately, what I’ve learned from her is a general philosophy as opposed to specific recipes. While I’ve adopted many of her culinary habits as my own (such as taking health fads far too seriously), the most notable influence is the fact that I decided to become a vegetarian. My mum stopped eating meat herself when she was sixteen which meant there was always a meat-free option available, alongside our meat dishes so it felt a very natural decision for me to stop myself at eighteen. So today, I’ve made an easy, mostly-organic, large salad with ‘ancient grains’ (one of the health fads we’ve both subscribed to).</p> <p>My sister has also been a big influence on my culinary habits as she loves to entertain. When I was growing up, I longed for the days that I too could host glamorous murder mystery parties and fondue nights. I got a chance to host the latter when she went on exchange to Brazil and gave me her fondue set for safekeeping, during which I discovered such a night was far less glamorous than it appeared. And when my sister returned home she brought with her a recipe that I loved at the time: <em>Pão de Queijo</em>. I made some for today and have been told they have a decidedly 70’s feel about them.</p> <hr> <h2>Chris Gordon:</h2> <p>My mum is probably the best cook I know. This high praise because I am completely surrounded by excellent cooks, chefs even, and I like to think of myself as having a pretty deft hand in the kitchen. She’s also a kind and generous cook. The food is always laid out on platters, presented with a flair here and there. The table is set for every meal – napkins are always involved.</p> <p>My family love to eat at my parent’s house. My son adores Mum’s Rice Pudding. My daughter could live off Mum’s Caesar Salad. My bloke expects Mum’s Seville Orange Marmalade every year. Sometimes we say quite selfish things like: “Okay, we will come <em>IF</em> you can cook…” In fact, I think it was partially out of desperation to stop the flood of these kind of requests that Mum made me a collection of my favourite recipes in a little book. The book is beautifully presented, of course, and has all my favourites from cheese sticks and minestrone, to caramel filling for tarts. Mostly though, I’m a sucker for just sitting around her table, hearing my Dad natter on and watching my Mum give a final swipe of a plate. It doesn’t seem to matter what age I am, home is still a Tupperware container of homemade biscuits.</p> <p>Today I made her hummus recipe: easy, quick and delicious. She serves it with curly celery sticks and cheese straws; I cut up pita bread.</p> <hr> <h2>Stella Charls:</h2> <p>I’m an only child of separated parents, with little to no heritage to speak of in the culinary sense. These days, my parents are pretty adventurous cooks but my only memories growing up are of spag bol, roast chook or baked beans on toast (soft-boiled eggs and toast soldiers for a special treat). But my dad’s partner is a genius when it comes to curries. She used to be married to a Sri Lankan fellow and from him, she learned how to balance spice and sweetness like a pro. Her Syrian chicken is my favourite dish with the chicken pieces left on the bone and slow-cooked in an aromatic spice mix with honey, currants and a generous pinch of saffron. My mum loves it too, so it’s probably become the dish I associate most with family – my dad’s girlfriend’s ex-husband’s Syrian chicken, adopted by my mum (and me!).</p> 9908 May highlights in children's and young adult books 2015-05-08T00:00:00Z <h2>As I compose this sentence, election fever is about to come to the boil in my home country and so, in the spirit of democracy, I asked my colleagues to help me compile this blog post by each voting for their favourite new release.</h2> <hr> <h2>PICTURE BOOKS</h2> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="sammy-skyscraper" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Kathy’s pick</a>: <em><a href="">Sammy and the Skyscraper Sandwich</a></em> by Lorraine Francis and Pieter Gaudesaboos</h2> <p>Kathy loves this stylish, over-sized board book about a boy who is building the tallest sandwich the world has ever seen. She says it’s a visual feast with a very satisfying conclusion.</p> <p>This book is one of a beautiful new range from New Zealand company Book Island, who are bringing some wonderful translated picture books to our shores from Europe. This includes these stunning books: <em><a href="">Maia and What Matters</a></em>, <em><a href="">The Big Question</a></em>, <em><a href="">The Rabbit and the Shadow</a></em>, and <em><a href="">The Umbrella</a></em>. The latter of those is a beautiful wordless story about a little dog who goes on an adventure, sailing across the lands under his red umbrella. This is a brilliant way for pre-schoolers to define their own narrative.</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="teddy" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Angela’s pick</a>: <em><a href="">Teddy Took The Train</a></em> by Nicki Greenberg</h2> <p>Nicki Greenberg is a talented local author-illustrator whose graphic novel version of <em>Hamlet</em> is sheer brilliance. Here’s something for the younger crowd, particularly for a pre-schooler who knows the horror of leaving a favourite toy behind.</p> <p>Angela says: “Set on the Melbourne train network, with rhythmic rhyming text and gorgeous retro illustrations, this is a delightful story that will allay children’s fears and set their imaginations free.”</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="mumgoestowork" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Isobel’s pick</a>: <em><a href="">Mum Goes To Work</a></em> by Libby Gleeson and Leila Rudge</h2> <p>During a week when mothers are being bombarded with messages about the sorts of gifts they <em>should</em> want for Mother’s Day like pink crocheted baking trays, Isobel’s choice is a fully-refreshed version of a book that first appeared in 1992. Leila Rudge’s lovely new illustrations have brought this picture book into 2015.</p> <p>Isobel says: “At first glance they seem just the normal (yet lovely) illustrations of the actions contained in the text, but upon closer inspection more and more storylines are revealed that complement the main, and beautifully inclusive, depiction of the mums’ days.”</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="howbigistoosmall" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Alexa’s pick</a>: <em><a href="">How Big Is Too Small?</a></em> by Jane Godwin and Andrew Joyner</h2> <p>The new picture book from two local favourites (the author of <em><a href="">Today We Have No Plans</a></em> paired with the illustrator of <em><a href="">Tim and Ed</a></em> ) is a real treat – lively, cheeky fun from Andrew Joyner’s illustrations and a rhythmic, sensitive story with a triumphant ending from Jane Godwin.</p> <p>Alexa says: “Jane Godwin really understands childhood and conveys that in warm, friendly stories told with an assured, poetic tempo that makes them a joy to read aloud. Here she is partnered with the talented Andrew Joyner who seems to effortlessly portray the exuberance and irrepressibility of being a child.”</p> <hr> <h2>FICTION FOR 8+</h2> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="ivypocket" src="" /> </a></p> <h2><a href="">Kim’s pick</a>: <em><a href="">Anyone But Ivy Pocket</a></em> by Caleb Crisp</h2> <p>Most narrators for this age group are immediately likeable or sympathetic – not so the rather conceited Ivy Pocket and yet this new series has definitely won Kim’s heart. Ivy is a 12-year-old maid with rather grand opinions of herself (sounds refreshing, I must say) and the story is a very busy one with Ivy in charge of some precious cargo and a host of eccentric characters determined to take it from her.</p> <p>If your kids enjoyed the wonderfully strange humour of <em><a href="">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em>, or indeed the recent Victorian fantasy adventure <em><a href="">Withering-By-Sea</a></em>, this looks like fun.</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="limestreet" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Dani’s pick</a>: <em><a href="">88 Lime Street</a></em> by Denise Kirby</h2> <p>I’ll let the last few lines of Dani’s review do all the talking here: “I <em>loved</em> <em><a href="">88 Lime Street</a></em>, it starts out as a ghost story but quickly becomes something much more exciting – a room full of children all from different points in history fighting a race against Time itself! <em><a href="">88 Lime Street</a></em> is carefully written and never really gets any scarier than spooky. </p> <p>It’s like a cross between <em><a href="">Tom’s Midnight Garden</a></em> and an episode of <em>Doctor Who</em>.”</p> <hr> <h2>FICTION FOR YOUNG ADULTS</h2> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="singlestone" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Katherine’s pick</a>: <em><a href="">A Single Stone</a></em> by Meg McKinlay</h2> <p>Katherine describes this as, “a beautiful and delicate novel that tackles some big questions about gender and power”, and I heartily agree. The prose is stunning and the enclosed world that Meg McKinlay builds is the perfect device for the themes she’s exploring, such as how a society becomes corrupted by fear and lies. </p> <p>With a complex and likable main character, this story would really suit keen readers in Years 5/6 as well as high school students.</p> <hr> <p><a href=""><img alt="onetruething" src="" /></a></p> <h2><a href="">Athina’s pick</a>: <em><a href="">One True Thing</a></em> by Nicole Hayes</h2> <p>This is next on my list to read as I thoroughly enjoyed Nicole Hayes' debut about a girl who loves AFL, <em><a href="">The Whole Of My World</a></em>. This time Hayes has chosen the even muddier field of politics for her theme and I was reminded of Channel Ten’s <em>Party Tricks</em> when I read the blurb and saw the main character’s mother is Premier of Victoria. I saw a comment on Twitter the other day about YA novels about politics only ever being the dystopian kind – well not any more.</p> <p>Athina says: “Although the political backdrop is an unusual setting in young adult literature, Frankie’s story is compellingly familiar – she’s balancing family, friendship and struggling to belong.

Salsa is a very curious boy. He was highpoint halter yearling for South Dakota. As a four year old, he was used for huntseat lessons for a 12 year old girl.

We will value ONLY the 3D seismic based upon industry norms. I researched 2012 seismic contracts in Africa and Australia to arrive at a fair market value of $12,500 per square kilometre (km2) of 3D seismic. Porto has completed the following 3D seismic both on and offshore Portugal.
Offshore 3D - 1100 km2 x $12,500 = $13.8 million fair value
Onshore 3D - 500 km2 x $12,500 = $6 million fair value
Estimated fair value of Porto 3D seismic inventory is approx. $20 million (10 cents per share). This assigns zero value to the land itself or the underlying resources of oil & gas if they are fortunate to hit economic wells.
2012 3D Seismic average of $12,500 for Porto was based upon the following:
a) Murphy Oil – offshore Papua - $9 million 600 km2 –$15,000 per km2
b) Senex Energy – onshore South Australia – 790 km2 - $11 million – $14,000 per km2
c) Australia – $5 million for 400 km2 of offshore 3D seismic survey and reprocessing – $12,500 per km2
d) BHP Australia – $12 million for 923 km2 seismic survey and geotechnical studies - $13,000 km2
e) Pancontinental Oil - Offshore Kenya - $14 million for 680 km2 - $20,500 km2
f) Chariot Oil – Namibia - $100 million for 4500 km2 of 3D seismic - $22,000 per km2

Always one to keep her Twitter followers in the know on every single garment she wears throughout the day, Jessie posted an Instagram picture of her outfit ahead of the show, alongside the caption: ‘Bait ones before the show! In the bathroom pictures.’
She wore a simple pair of lace-up black boots in the snap with a miniscule pair of hotpants that showed of her long legs to the fullest.
These were teamed with a geometric design candy pink peplum that hugged her figure and made her look like a rather slender Christmas bauble.
The look was finished off with hot pink lipstick, hoop earrings and long dark hair curls, giving a playful and immature feel.
The voluminous hairstyle was causing Jessie – real name Jessica Cornish – difficulty by the end of her Singapore set however, with her later telling fans: ‘Just got off stage in Singapore my hair is knotty as f*** lol.’
In fact her cutesy appearance belied a very grumpy Jessie J, who added on her way home from the show: ‘Mmmm film it is.. *wide awake* #jetlag #bodyclockmashup.
‘Time zones are very serious. Being on one completely different to the country you are in is serious. Its all very serious *serious face*.’PUBLIC RECORD

Also, it doesn't need to be a single, but I really want a big spectacle of a video for TOUCH.

consider your festival dreams dashed. was a plan that would have used lasers to illuminate the nation's first national monument, attracted as many as 50,000 people, and starred one of the biggest names in music.
But it wasn't to be.
The National Park Service said Tuesday that it has rejected a proposal by Daft Punk, an electronic music group renowned for elaborate live concerts, to host a show on private land adjacent to the Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming.
Reed Robinson, superintendent for Devils Tower National Monument, said an agency representing the group, ICM Partners, approached the park in the fall and the park officially denied the request on Jan. 31.
Robinson said the park consulted with six Native American tribes about the proposal, all of which generally agreed that it would be a disrespectful use of one of the country's most sacred Native American sites.
"No event is going to be occurring in Devils Tower," Robinson said. "Anything that was proposed is a non-starter, is considered an adverse action according to the National Historic Preservation Act, and goes against the Park Service management approach." lighting equipment, like lasers, at the base of the park's 1,300-foot rock tower.
"This being a night skies park and a natural park and a sacred site to 24 different tribes, that would be considered sacrilegious and gets into that 'inappropriate use'," Robinson said. "And that meant maybe we would have to close portions of the main trail to facilitate this kind of stuff."
The group's agency also indicated that it wished to host as many as 50,000 people at the concert site, owned by rancher Odgen Driskill, about half a mile away from the monument.
"I don't know if that's logistically possible given the location of Devils Tower, but given that they won four — maybe five — Grammys, they might have been able to do it," he said. "I'm not sure."
Robinson said as discussions with Daft Punk's agency continued through the end of last year, the agency grew to understand the significance of the site to Native Americans and that the proposal was unlikely to be permitted.
Daft Punk is an electronic music duo from France that rose to popularity in the 1990s. At this year's Grammy Awards, the group earned five awards, including record of the year and album of the year.
[Editor's note: This story has been changed to reflect a clarification. The proposed concert site is on private land adjacent to the monument and the lasers would have been placed at the base of the tower.]
That would be awesome if they were trying to recreate Close Encounters of the Third
Kinda glad they didn't go ahead with it.
I wonder how many people will be wearing this at Coachella...

I had to get one, thanks!
win a grammy, then don't go out on tour to support new album. daft punk = wtf
If you knew anything about Daft Punk at all you wouldn't be expecting them to tour.
Say what you will about the merch they're selling and all... but I am loving the little ads they've put up for the items on facebook.
For example:
(maybe those are on their main web page too... but that site loads slow as fucking balls)
Apparently the Facebook ads are uniffiliated with Daft Punk
daft punk = a band/djs who do't tour for they're fans. Pretty damn selfish imo. I'm not hurt over the fact they don't want to do what other bands do, but touring is a great way to thank your fans for supporting your ass.
Who gives a shit if they don't tour?

I mean, that's before we get in to the thought that calling it "selfish" implies that you are somehow owed something by them.
(side note: why am I engaging with one of the two worst new posters on the board? Am I that bored today?)
At this point I truly think they are holding out for a 2017 tour, as to align with their previous ventures
Maybe they are waiting for James Cameron to make a 3d film for their concert .
Spicy pie is mainstream shit.
They don't "owe" fans anything, but everyone with a mild interest in them really wants to see them tour. The last tour is absolutely what they are most famous for and the fans want more. Ten years between tours is just too much.So, here is another poem. I must say I come up with them rather suddenly, and at the most inappropriate times.

Rebirth
Give me a reason why,
Tell me how to breathe.
I don't remember you,
I can't seem to see.
The darkness is too much,
A light in my vision,
I can't seem to reach,
But I always see.
Reaching out to your face,
A face in my mind.
I don't remember you,
But I can see your smile.
A smile so warm and soft,
I see when I close my eyes.
I don't know who you are,
But it fills me up with life.
Why do you reach for me,
What makes you breathe for me.
You say you'll save my soul,
Please let me be.
I'm afraid of the warmth,
I can't understand.
The light hurts my eyes,
You slip away like sand.
It hurts so bad, I want to scream,
But you hold me close to you.
It feels so cold, I want to sleep,
Please let me be.
A soft rhythm, over my heart,
I can hear your voice,
"Please don't go,
Stay with me."
A soft mouth against my own,
Teaching me to breathe.
A hand that reaches out to me,
Teaching me to walk.
And leads me to the light,
Away from the dark.
I know who you are now,
I remember your smile,
As you weep against my chest,
Unaware, you just brought me back to life.
I am in love with Trading Yesterday..

A while back, prominent atheist Dr. Richard Carrier explained how he was divorcing his wife – who supported him financially – in order to go polyamorous full-time.
The Yeti’s Roar, a libertarian atheist blog reacted to the news: (link removed)
In a recent blog post, entitled “Coming Out Poly + A Change of Life Venue”, the esteemed Dr. Richard Carrier PhD, discusses his “coming out” as polyamorous, an “orientation” that he just discovered at the young age of 47.
[…]Carrier claims that after 17 years of marriage, he cheated on his wife multiple times, for reasons that he won’t disclose. In the midst of his infidelity, he suddenly “discovered” (as a middle aged man) that he was polyamorous. Even though his wife attempted to make the marriage work by allowing him to see other women under the guise of an “open marriage”, Carrier still decided to kick her to the curb. So in Carrier’s view, his affairs were not a mistake, but rather a fun new “lifestyle choice” that he will pursue, regardless of the past commitment to his wife.
What is even more despicable about Carrier’s behavior toward his wife is the fact that she supported him financially.
[…] The only reason he has been able to live a comfortable lifestyle while blogging and writing obscure books is due to his wife’s financial support. The reason that he could afford to invest his time in getting graduate degrees from Columbia in subjects that will never land him a decent paying job is due to the support of his wife. The reason he was able to travel around the country for low paying speaking engagements instead of having to get a real job is due to his wife’s financial support. And how does he repay his wife for the support she has given him? He cheats on her, waits until he is making enough money where he no longer needs her income, and kicks her to the curb.
So, whenever Richard Carrier was talking about morality without God, now we know what he meant. He even dedicated his book on morality without God to his now ex-wife. How ironic. I feel very bad for his ex-wife and I prayed for her redemption. Although, she must take responsibility for choosing him – there were lots of other chaste, commitment-minded men out there, and she chose him.
But the new polyamoratheism news is that Carrier is actually searching for a new “date”.
I am not linking to his blog post, but it says: (H/T The Yeti’s Roar).
[…]I’m 0.5 on the Kinsey scale..
[…]I am also planning to have a hotel room, and am comfortable sharing it platonically. Certainly I would enjoy sharing it non-platonically, but I don’t expect it. I can’t believe (even though I know) there are still guys who assume the other sh*t buys them sex, thus necessitating I say this: if you are going to have sex with me, it has to be because it’s fun and you want to, not because it’s something you owe me. On the same understanding, if you have a place for me to crash in town (platonically or not), and are happy to have me over to spare me the cost of hiring a room, that would be lovely. And yes, if you are poly or open and live with a partner or two, I’m comfortable with that as well.
This also means you don’t have to live in the LA area to join me for this. If you can get to LA, and don’t mind sharing a room (at my expense), the opportunity remains.
This is Richard Carrier’s book on morality without God:
And the book is dedicated to his wife, now ex-wife:
For Jen…
My buxom brunette
My wellspring of joy
My north star of sanity
Indeed.
You can read a multi-part review of the book here on Deeper Waters (Nick Peters’ site)
I trust that everyone now understands what I was saying about the reasons why atheists jettison God and objective morality. Sexual freedom is definitely a big one, and probably the biggest. This is not a worldview, people, it’s not something that is derived from logic and evidence. It starts and ends with getting rid of moral accountability to the Creator. Period. End of issue.
Not that all atheists are as immoral as Carrier, and not all atheists are motivated by sexual perversion. But the primary motivation is always to be able to seek selfish pleasure apart from any responsibilities, expectations and obligations. Although atheists may try hard to look nice on the surface, there is no moral core that is stopping them from pursuing pleasure apart from morality.
Finally, I just want any atheists reading this to know that I am now in my late 30s, with so much income and net worth that it would make Richard Carrier’s head spin. Since I was a teen, the thing I’ve wanted most was to be married and to have children. And yet unlike Richard Carrier, I am still saving my first kiss on the lips for that one woman. I am a virgin, and determined to keep it so until I marry. I never thought that the wealth that I saved for her was to be used to break the rules so I could get what I wanted right now. When I made my decision to serve God, it meant serving him according to his moral character, whether I got what I wanted or not. When Christ calls a man, he call him to die to himself and his own self-interest.
There is no commonality between a Christian man sacrificing his own interests to serve God, and an atheist man who thinks that this life is all there is. We are running different playbooks in this life. There is no overlap. There is no sense in which an atheist is “moral” according to the Christian game plan. And atheist cannot be moral within the Christian worldview by picking and choosing what rules to follow. What is required is total abandonment to God’s calling and a 100% re-prioritization of your life. It’s not about doing X and Y, but not A and B, and getting a passing grade. It’s about putting Jesus Christ in as your commanding officer in every area and facet of your life. No atheist can be “moral” according to the Christian worldview, and none of their “moral” behaviors that ape our own count when their heart is oriented away from God.

About This Episode
Feature documentary Into Harm’s Way chronicles the honest and often painful look at the shadow war casts long after the guns have fallen silent, and at how the Vietnam War in particular, continues to occupy an unsettled place in the American psyche.
The West Point Class of 1967 arrived at the United States Military Academy during the early 1960s when it appeared that America was destined for a century of unrivaled success. Four years later, when members of that class graduated and were commissioned as officers in the United States Army, the country was in the middle of a strange and unpopular war in Southeast Asia. The Class of 1967 ended up paying a high price during the Vietnam War, yet most stayed strong, bonding as brothers and as soldiers in a way that has endured through to the present.
Larry Bridge, facilities and real estate governance manager, Procter & Gamble Co.
After ten years as a facilities manager for Procter & Gamble Co., Larry Bridge is convinced the company get by with less energy spending and smaller footprints.
Facilities manager on changing "work patterns" at P&G
CINCINNATI - We all had parents who turned down the thermostat and clicked off light switches to save energy. Now, of course, there’s an app for that. And Procter & Gamble Co. expects to save millions with it.
The IntelliCommand building management system, developed by Jones Lang LaSalle and Pacific Controls, reduced energy costs by 10 percent when P&G rolled it out in a Cincinnati pilot test earlier this year. Now, it’s installing the system in 76 of its biggest office properties worldwide.
“We’ve completed it in Asia and Latin America. We’re in the process of completing it in Western Europe right now,” said Larry Bridge, facilities and real estate governance manager at P&G.
Jones Lang LaSalle is a Chicago-based outsourcing partner that has managed P&G’s real estate since 2003. It partnered with Pacific Controls to launch the cloud-based energy management system in 2011. This video shows how it works:
The IntelliCommand system helped Jones Lang LaSalle win External Business Partner of the Year from P&G in early November.
The system allows Jones Lang LaSalle to remotely track energy usage on a real-time basis, allowing building managers to follow up on anomalies and shut down problems before they waste electricity – and money. The system is relatively cheap to install. Bridge said the pilot test cost “tens of thousands” for a 3.2 million-square-foot cluster of Cincinnati office properties. And those costs were recovered within three months of installation.
That’s a remarkable achievement in the energy savings game, where big capital investments in HVAC systems and solar panels often take years to pay for themselves.
“We’ll probably get close to several million (in savings) by the time we’re done with this,” Bridge said.
For Jones Lang LaSalle, the P&G results have “really given us leverage to take to other clients,” said Cindy Hill, a vice president in charge of sustainability on the P&G account.
In the Cincinnati pilot test, P&G installed IntelliCommand collection points in 12 buildings with 3.2 million square feet, including its global healthcare headquarters, numerous laboratories, a technical center and several mixed-use office properties. In 11 months, the system document energy savings totaling 4.4 million kilowatt hours. That’s enough energy to power approximately 440 homes.
“P&G had a pretty good infrastructure with a building management system,” said Hill. “So, if that component’s missing, the payback might be a little bit longer. Depends on how many points you put in and how much you want to actually watch and monitor and measure. That will vary the payback period. But I would say definitely within a year with most clients, you’re going to see that payback.”
The system helps P&G meet two of its major strategic objectives: Productivity improvements and sustainability.
The company announced a five-year goal of $10 billion in savings from productivity initiatives in 2012, including $1.2 billion in savings from reducing materials, manufacturing and shipping costs.
In 2010, P&G announced a host of new sustainability goals, including a 20 percent reduction in energy usage by 2020. In the company’s most recent sustainability report this month, P&G said it has achieved an 8 percent reduction in energy usage so far.
Bridge said the IntelliCommand system reduces energy costs in about 25 percent of its real estate portfolio. P&G is installing the system in buildings that it owns and can therefore control operating hours, lighting systems, heating and air conditioning units. Other technologies are likely to be used in manufacturing facilities.
“We’re looking ahead to … how we apply this in our leased space,” Bridge said. “We may not have total control over lighting and operating hours. But we want to know if equipment is running after hours. We want to know if lighting is left on after hours because that bill eventually comes back to us. This tool is looking like that’s going to give us some options there.”
Beyond IntelliCommand, Bridge said P&G has invested heavily in video-conferencing tools and other technologies to help employees reduce travel and work remotely. The more that happens, the more important it is to be able to monitor space remotely.
“It’s really interesting how work patterns have changed in the company,” he said. “We just use space differently, the way people work today. I was talking to someone today just about parking, you know, patterns we used to see. It would peak on a Wednesday, slower on weekends. We just don’t see those anymore. The patterns are all up in the air because people work so differently.”Added to My List as a guest*.

"Blending stylish looks, an impressive chassis and excellent performance, the Infiniti Q60 offers customers something a little bit different."
Starting from around £36,000 for the entry-level model, the Infiniti Q60 (previously the Infiniti G37) is a stylish and genuinely unique-looking coupe that stands out from the crowd. Powered by a modified version of the 3.7-litre V6 petrol engine from the Nissan 370Z, the sporty coupe isn't short on performance, either. Inside, it's luxurious, comfortable and well equipped. But with its high running costs, lack of engine variety and shortage of both rear-seat and boot space, the Q60 lacks the all-round competence of rivals such as the BMW 4 Series and Mercedes E-Class coupe.
MPG, running costs & CO2
Large six-cylinder engine isn't very fuel-efficient
Running a Q60 isn't cheap. Currently it's only available with a Nissan's thirsty 3.7-litre V6 petrol engine, which returns 27mpg fuel economy and emits 246g/km of CO2, so road tax is £490 a year.
Engines, drive & performance
On twisty roads, the Q60 performs well, with responsive steering and lots of grip
Buying a Q60 coupe is made easy by the fact that there's only one engine in the line-up. The 3.7-litre V6 is borrowed from the Nissan 370Z sports car, but it's more refined here to suit the Infiniti's more relaxed nature. There's still impressive performance on offer, though, with a 0-62mph time of 5.8 seconds.
A six-speed manual gearbox comes as standard, but there's also an excellent seven-speed automatic available as an option. When the road gets twisty, the Infiniti continues to perform well, with responsive steering and lots of grip. Some drivers may prefer a little more feedback through the wheel, though.
Interior & comfort
The Q60 is luxurious, but it's not up to class standards
The Q60 is refined, luxurious and comes with an impressive amount of standard equipment – even in the most basic GT trim. Cabin noise is almost non-existent, too, due to the Q60's excellent sound insulation. The back seats are cramped and awkward for adults, but up front there's plenty of leg and headroom and the seats are comfortable, with an excellent driving position.
Practicality & boot space
With a steeply sloping roof minimising space in the rear, the Q60 puts style ahead of practicality
Due to a steeply sloping roofline, space in the back of the Q60 is minimal. This results in a '2+2' seating arrangement, where the rear 'passenger' space is better used as additional luggage storage. Compared to its rivals, the Q60's boot is very small, too: at only 275 litres, it's over 150 litres smaller than what you get in both the BMW 4 Series and Mercedes E-Class coupe.
Reliability & safety
Infiniti as a company has a very strong record for reliability and the Q60 is no different
Despite using a large amount of Nissan parts, the Infiniti Q60 feels remarkably well built, although it doesn't feel as luxurious and prestigious as its premium brand image suggests. But Infiniti as a company has a very strong record for reliability and the Q60 is no different.
Price, value for money & options
Starting from around £36,000 for the entry-level GT model, the Infiniti isn't cheap
Starting from £36,000 for the entry-level GT model, the Infiniti is not a cheap proposition compared to similarly priced, better performing and more competent European rivals. Despite its relatively exclusive status and rarity, the Q60 also has poor residual values.- Create by Product

When you hear the word “contrast” what do you think of? Contrast plays an important role in our photographs – shadows versus sunlight, organic shapes versus geometrical, dark versus bright. When you are creating contrast in black and white photographs, you must create contrast between the white and black elements {tonal contrast}. When your image […] […] […]Photo credit: CNet

I used an *African cotton fabric I found in the remnants bin at Rolls and Rem. I was drawn to the colors instantly. I debated buying it, not finding it too much of a bargain at £3 a meter (Remnants can average £1.50 a meter at Rolls and Rems). I walked around the store with it and decided I couldn’t do without it. The colors and patterns were much too good to pass up.
Initially I thought I would use it for another gathered skirt. But after discovering I had enough for a Hazel dress I went for it.
This dress, surprisingly didn’t need many adjustments. Because the skirt is gathered I didn’t have to worry about waist size. The only changes I did were to the front and back side bodice pieces. I graded half an inch to each piece to get the waist measurement needed. And that’s it. Viola! That’s my kind of adjustment. I’m not going to lie. Sewing as a…uh…curvy woman can be such a big pain in the ass. Eighty percent of my patterns are suited for women smaller than myself so I am always having to change patterns to fit me. So it was such a nice relief not to do much to the Hazel pattern.
The dress came together very easily. I lined the skirt just because I’d love to wear it on cooler days with tights. I love how comfortable the dress is and that it has pockets. Bonus!
I cannot wait to get back from my trip to the States so I can whip up a yellow version. This is the type of pattern that can be made in various colors and prints and never look like the same dress. So why not make multiples? I am all about making more than one of things I enjoy wearing (hello, Ginger skirt!).

OMG…Mela, this is awesome. I love that fabric. This is by far my fave of all your makes. You should make more dresses from this pattern. On a side note, I am eating that milk cake as I type this comment.
Thanks Dibs! I am definitely going to make more from this pattern. It’s such a comfy dress.
Glad you’re enjoying the cake. I think I may need some soon :)
I love the dress on you, the style and colours really suit you.
Thank you!
That looks awesome! You were right to fall for that fabric- love it!
Thank you! I’m glad I didn’t leave it behind.
Gorgeous! That fabric is absolutely lovely – it looks so good as a dress. Where is this Rolls and Rems you’re talking about? Never heard about it before.
Rolls and Rems is located in Holloway and Lewisham in London. I LOVE their remnants bin. I have found such great bargains there.
Totally gorgeous in every way! You have a great eye for matching fabrics to patterns!
Thank you! I can say the same about you :)
Very nice. I think I might try this pattern as well.
I need a go-to that looks this fabulous! Nicely done, ma’am!
Too cute – great fabric!
OMG, OMG, OMG! This is one hell of a gorgeous dress Mela and you look adorable in it. You know, Hazel hadn’t tempted me until this very moment. It’s just lovely on you, but I think that’s got a lot to do with your awesome fabric choice…the print and colours are divine! Can I ask what fabric you lined it with please?
Thanks Marie! I used a silver acetate. I wore it on a super warm day and my legs didn’t feel too warm at all.
Thank you ;o)
No problem! I was originally going to use muslin but the one I ordered online looked like gauze. So strange :)
Gorgeous fabric. It’s worth spending a little more if you are going to wear it more!
The pattern is perfect for showing off the fabric. Very nice!
Thank you. I’m glad I bought it after a bit of hesitation.
The print and the simplicity of the dress and the pattern of the fabric really works!! Looks like Hazel may be a TNT pattern for you which is awesome!!!
Thank you. I’d love to see what you do with the Hazel pattern.
Mela, this is too gorgeous! Hurrah for African cotton! I must get myself to Rolls and Rems the next time I am in London – I really want to sew with African cotton again :)
Thank you.
It really is a great cotton to work with. It didn’t misbehave at all. Love it!
LOVE IT!!! you great in it. I wasn’t too keen on the pattern when it came out but you are making it look like something i need!
It’s a really flattering dress and easy to manipulate. I recommend it for sure.
Mela… I LOVE THIS! It’s so, so gorgeous! You look great in it, it’s a perfect fit, perfect fabric, perfect colors! Great job!
Thank you very much!
This dress is gorgeous! I love everything about it, the fit, fabric etc. you look beautiful in it
Thank you so much. That means a lot form you. You make the prettiest dresses!
Sometimes fabric and patterns match up perfectly, which is the case here!! I would have been suckered by that fabric, too, it’s lovely and the dress looks amazing on you!
That’s a striking summer dress & so great you didn’t have to make many pattern alterations.
Yes, I was so relieved. There’s nothing better than a quick make from tracing to hemming.
Great dress – the print is gorgeous and it looks great on you!
It is so pretty! African prints are so vibrant!
They really are. I need to invest in more. Not that I need any more fabric :)
So. Cute.
thats beautiful dress. Im a fan of pockets on sun dresses so i can have some pocket money for ice cream ! :o))
I like the way you think Rachel!
Oh, I love it. And, yes, I’m all about making the same pattern up over and over. After all that work of getting the right fit. Plus, I can’t help wanting to make every version I’ve dreamed up.
Exactly! Once you get a pattern fit right, why not do it again and again :) ? You also get more bang for your buck, as well.
Just stunning! I’ve been on the fence about the pattern but it looks seriously amazing on you! The fabric is stunning too and £3 p/m sounds like a good deal when you work the cost per wear out!!! (making time doesn’t count in my world cos I’m a slow seamster)
Thank you, Vicki. It definitely was a great deal. I can see myself wearing this dress quite a bit. I’ve already packed it for my trip tomorrow :)
I LOVE it! Such a fabulous fabric and it suits the Hazel pattern perfectly! Well done and in time for the nice weather! Have fun in the States!
Thank you! I’m really looking forward to it.
It is very, very cute! I keep debating buying the pattern… I really think I should concoct some reason that I “deserve” it! :)
Can I ask a slightly nosy question? How well do the straps hide bra straps? I’m always worry that because my bra straps are supportively/old-ladishly wide, they’ll show with this kind of dress. What did you find?
The straps hid my bra very well. Angie mentioned how the straps worked well for her too.
I bet you can add a half an inch to the pattern piece if needed.
Awesome! Thanks! (Now I have no excuses not to make one! :)
Mela this is perfect! The fit, the pattern, the way the fabric works ….what a winner. And what about the timing too. Nice one :-)
Wahou !! This dress and the colors are really great on you !
Love that you used an african fabric ! I have some in my stash and you make me want to sew it right now !
Faaaaaaaaaaabulous.
How positively lovely! I would not have been able to pass up that fabric either – it works perfectly as a Hazel dress! Very well done!
That’s an amazing dress! I’m going to have to hunt down that pattern. I hate all those pesky adjustments too!
Just so lovely…great fabric and amazing fit. You look gorgeous in it.
You look gorgeous in this outfit. I’d be making more of them…gotta go check out the pattern
Thank you. I really recommend it!
Seriously, your Hazel dress is one of my favorites. I love the fabric and it looks so flattering on you. Great job!
Thank you so much. It might be my favorite make so far :)
Lovely dress and great fabric. Can’t wait to see your yellow version
Hello again :) I made the yellow version and it’s quite bright and cheerful. Helps lighten me up on a dreary grey day.
What a cute dress! I love African fabrics. Glad I found your blog!
Thank you. African fabrics are so colorful and pretty. I was instantly attracted to the bold colors. Off to read your blog :)
Ohhh i love this little dress!!! you are “Sublime” ;)
Sorry for my poor english.
Now worries! Thank you!
So cute!! It fits you beautifully and I’m dying over that fabric. Love your shoes, too.
Thank you! Those are the first pair of flats that I found uber comfortable in a long while. They are from Asos, if you’re curious :)
This is just gorgeous. Suits you so well. (A post on my blog deserves a post on yours!)
Thank you :)Officers called to help remove a pair of guests who had overstayed their welcome at a Gretna motel discovered a meth lab in their room. Gretna Police arrested the two occupants and a third woman who tried to trash some of the evidence, according to Deputy Chief Anthony Christiana.
Management at the Luxury Inn & Suites, 1411 Claire Ave., Gretna, called authorities Sunday just about 1:30 p.m. after Eugene Wheeler, 37, of Gretna, and Jade Marinovich, 23, of Buras, refused to check out of room No. 211. The pair was not being kicked out for any violation. They had simply stayed past their checkout time, Christiana said.
Officers arrived and noticed that Marinovich appeared to be under the influence of some sort of substance. While talking to Wheeler, officers noticed in his room several empty packages of pseudoephedrine, the nasal decongestant also used in the manufacturing of methamphetamines, Christiana said. They also spotted a digital scale and several open packages of lithium batteries.
Wheeler vaulted over the second-floor balcony to the ground and took off running when officers tried to question him about the contents of the room. They later found him hiding in a bush four blocks away at 16th Street and Huey P. Long Avenue, the arrest report said.
Meanwhile, another motel guest, Melissa Mackles, 30, of Terrytown, attempted to get
rid of some of the evidence, Christiana said. Officers who had stayed behind to secure the room during the chase saw Mackles throwing out containers of lighter fluid, drain cleaner and other chemicals used to make crystal meth.
Christiana said Wheeler and company rented several rooms at the motel for their illegal venture. Hazardous materials crews from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office Investigations Bureau handled the search of those rooms.
They located a meth lab set-up, including a propane tank and tubing, hidden in the bathroom ceiling above the bath tub in room No. 211, the arrest report said. A white, powdery substance found on the scale later tested positive for crystal meth, the arrest report said.
Wheeler, of 3320 Wall Blvd., Gretna, was booked Monday at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center in Gretna with creation of a clandestine lab, possession of methamphetamines, possession of drug paraphernalia and resisting an officer. Bond was set at $506,000 bond.
But Wheeler is being held without bond because he is a fugitive from another jurisdiction. No information about that case was available Tuesday.
Mackles, of 908 Ellen Court, Terrytown, was booked with creation of a clandestine lab and obstruction of justice. Bond was set at $550,000 for the charges in connection with the meth lab.
But Mackles is being held without bond because she is wanted as a fugitive out of another jurisdiction and for two counts of probation violation. She was given a deferred two-year sentence in 2010 after pleading guilty to two counts of drug possession, according to records from the 24th Judicial District Court in Jefferson Parish.
Marinovich was booked with possession of drug paraphernalia, Chrisiana said. Bond was set at $500, but she was released Monday because of crowding at the jail.BeachGudellaphoto

Fantastic Shelter
posted 7 years ago
When I first moved to the Branson area the manager of the shelter at that time was kind enough to take in my 4 cats and keep them until I found a place of my own. I was staying with friends who had 4 cats of their own and weren't able to take in another 4. I was only expected to provide their food and litter. If not for this wonderful shelter I would have had to get rid of my babies. I will be forever grateful.
They do a great job here. It's a no-kill shelter, and they do the very best they can with what they have.
Pros: Staff
Cons: lack of funds

Wonders if AAA covers the tow?HARPERS FERRY - Lauren Spears and Aaron Green still speak in hushed, almost reverent voices when they describe the tranquil hours before their first baby was born -a special time spent underneath the moon, on the bank where the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers meet.
"It was 2 a.m. and very surreal. That's one of my favorite memories, because it was so beautiful standing barefoot underneath the moon and knowing this baby was going to come when the moon was full, " she said
That kind of unhurried, peaceful approach to labor was possible because the couple decided to have a home birth and used a midwife to help with the pregnancy as well as the delivery Sept. 28, 2012.
Submitted photoLauren Spears and Aaron Green cherish memories of the home birth of their daughter, Emily. The couple plans to use a midwife for their second child, who is due in August.
Although it was a decision made late in her pregnancy, neither Lauren nor Aaron ever second guessed that change to a natural birth or wished they had stayed with more traditional ob/gyn care.
"We just recognized they weren't going to respect our wishes as far as having a more natural birth. It felt like they were just giving lip service to us when we mentioned our ideas. They just weren't listening to us," Aaron said.
Right from the start, Lauren said she felt transformed and able to focus on the joy of this special, natural event.
"It was really powerful for me that I was able to let go of all of my fears surrounding the birth process. And in doing so, it opened me up to doing what would come naturally, and that just felt so right. There was no doubt this was meant to be," she said, adding that her entire labor lasted about 40 hours.
Nearly two years later, daughter Emily is a happy, gentle soul who will be joined by a brother in August.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the couple is again planning for a home birth and certified midwife Nannette Jenkins - who helped bring Emily into the world - is again an important part of their growing family.
"It's just really nice to know that Nannette is on our side and cares so much about all of us," Aaron said.
Jenkins, a mother of two whose practice, Riverside Midwifery LLC, is located in Shepherdstown, has helped deliver about 80 babies since becoming a midwife.
The popularity of this option is growing locally among families who want to experience childbirth in a different, more personal way, she said.
"When I stop to get a cup of coffee in a local shop and see moms whose babies I birthed, that's when it's really clear what this means," Jenkins said.

Chucktown refers to Charleston, South Carolina. Also known as The Chuck, Charlie-o, Chucktezzy, ect. Originally named Charles Town after King Charles, hence "Chuck"town. Not the West Virginian city of Charleston. Chucktown was also featured as a question on an episode of discovery channels Cash Cab, just for you West Virginians out there who disagree.

A nickname for the city of Charleston, West Virginia.
I live in chucktown.This winter, I’ve been dosing my kids up with Sambucol — an herbal black elderberry extract that supposedly helps combat colds and flu. I don’t know if it really works but my kiddos have been pretty healthy over here. I thought making my own elderberry syrup was out of the question because, well, I have no elderberries (do they grow here?). Then, I stumbled upon this blog, and her recipe which used dried elderberries to make syrup (also with photos of the steps along the way). I got all excited and ordered some dried berries from a local health food store. Then I made some syrup — my recipe is slightly different from hers since I had less honey on hand and slightly more elderberries in my bag — there are many recipes out there in google-land, which use varying amounts of water, berries, sweetener & spices. I just did what seemed to make sense and it worked.
I used 2 oz of elderberries — this was about 2/3 cup.
Add 3 cups of water and bring to a boil.
Let it simmer for about 15 minutes, then cool. Strain the berries out (I was left with almost 2 cups of liquid) and add some sweetener. I only added 1/2 cup of honey (it was all I had on hand).
While this syrup is not nearly as thick as the store bought kind, it is delicious!! This will make a healthy (and yummy) addition to smoothies. It would also be tasty in tea. I popped the bottle in the fridge (and the extra half bottle in the freezer). Now it’s time for me to kick back and take a tea, errr, medicine break.-

Fees, cuts save school sports
Despite deep budget cuts, middle school extracurricular activities will exist next year.
The Snoqualmie Valley School District presented its plan to pay for activities at its three middle schools to the school board, Thursday, June 25.
The district will be able to pay for the programs’ $339,527 cost by instituting participation fees and a 20 percent cut in coaches’ salaries, among other changes.
“It’s not perfect, but it does come pretty close to maintaining what our kids have,” Superintendent Joel Aune said.
The district will also generate additional revenue by increasing the cost for Associated Student Body cards by $15, reducing the number of events and games, and offering one-way transportation to events.
Participation fees will be $50 for most sports, jazz band and drama club. Football will cost $100. Other clubs will cost $35. There will be no cost for homework club.
The district is in new territory with the plan, and several questions remain about how it will work.
“We don’t know if $50 is a good number or if $40 is a better number. We just don’t know that,” said Assistant Superintendent Don McConkey, who led the plan’s development.
The district wanted to keep fees low to minimize any affect on participation. There are no caps on fees per student or family. The district did keep its “no cut” policy.
Several cost variables remain, McConkey noted.
Gas prices will affect transportation costs, which have been reduced by only offering buses for students to events.
Also, many bus drivers could be receiving a scheduled five percent raise next year, which would raise transportation costs.
While coaches agreed to a 20 percent pay cut, the district does not know how many coaches and club advisors will be moving up in their pay schedule next year.
The district also recommended reinstating the after-school activity bus and providing scholarships for extracurricular activities.
The availability of an activity bus could have a significant affect on participation at Chief Kanim Middle School in Fall City and Twin Falls Middle School in North Bend.
“I think that’s a must for us out here,” said school board member Rudy Edwards.
Community volunteers will be vital to making the program work, McConkey said.
One group is already at work.
Parents raised over $1,500 for the middle schools at a three-on-three basketball tournament at CKMS, Saturday, June 20.
The money will help provide scholarships at the each of the Valley’s middle schools, said Becky Evanson, the event’s organizer.
She proposed that the district give parents the option to pay for another student when signing up their own child.
“There are a lot of parents who’d have no problem paying that second $50,” she said.
The district will still be working out some details as the plan is implemented next year.
One parent raised a concern about safety given the possible number of participants to coaches, such as with cross country, which had 46 students at one middle school for the 2008-’09 school year. Under the district’s plan cross country will have only one coach.
The district has not set a participation threshold for offering an activity.
“Do we offer it if there’s only three kids or five kids who want to be in the green club or the cooking club?” board member Dan Bopp asked.
The district will consider it, McConkey replied.

Thank you for the kind words! Our product development team is always looking at new ways to make better products, so we will keep it in mind!!
So I buy lots of products from PC and I ordered some samples and came across this one and LOVED IT but whyy so expensive for 1.7oz!? Ugh heartbreaking.
Hello, and thank you for your comments! When we formulate our products, we take a good deal of time to see which packaging would work best for them, as far as both distribution and maintaining the efficacy of the ingredients. Rest assured, this packaging will keep PC4Men Nighttime Repair's air- and light-sensitive ingredients stable!
I used this product in the standard packaging before it was introduced into the men's line also. An excellent and elegant moisturiser. Perfect texture for me and stuffed full of goodies. Well done, PC !.
An above average moisturizer that does its job. The size of the bottle compared to the price is another story. It felt like I made a mistake and ordered the travel size. NP,.Texas Tech’s Seth Doege and Cody Davis named Big 12 Players of the Week

The two officers were in an unmarked police cruiser when they spotted the unidentified driver in a black Nissan Altima blow through a red light in South Ozone Park, Queens at around 2:30 a.m., police sources said.
They pursued the suspect more than three miles into East New York after running his license plate and realizing he was wanted for an earlier hit-and-run where he allegedly sideswiped a parked car, sources said.
The wild chase came to an end when the suspect slammed his car into a BMW that was stopped at a red light on Atlantic Avenue near the corner of Van Siclen Avenue, authorities said.
The unmarked police car then crashed into the Altima, causing the officers to suffer neck and back injuries, cops said. They were taken to Jamaica Hospital and were treated for minor injuries.
The five people in the BMW were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries, officials said.
The driver is in police custody at Jamaica Hospital and is expected to be charged with DWI and leaving the scene of an accident, sources said.What Is Dearness Allowance (D.A.)?
The dearness allowance is a part of the total compensation a person receives for having performed his or her job. For example, workers in India might have a base salary or pension, along with an allowance for housing and the dearness allowance. D.A. is a percentage of the original salary. The percentage is reviewed and may be changed on a six-month cycle.
One explanation for D.A., according to work guidelines, is that the Dearness Allowance is provided to help against rise in prices for those on pension. This allowance may also be provided to family members receiving benefits from a worker’s pension. For example, a central government order might change the Dearness Allowance by 6 percent for employees of the main branch of government, due to new information about living expenses and price increases. The amount might be paid in a lump sum at some point to bring the overall pension and allowances up to what they should be.
There are also times when a new level of Dearness Allowance might be established along with housing and transportation allowances. This generally occurs when the overall pay schedule is revised. Base salary levels are reported separate from the various allowances. In India the D.A. has a history dating back to World War II. At that time, many of the lower-paid employees received D.A. based on their wages or salaries. Many changes to Dearness Allowance and its computations have occurred over the last 60 years, according to both private and government studies.
One guideline suggests that the D.A. is paid twice each year (January and July) based on a percentage of pay in two specific months. Numbers used to calculate the D.A. include 12-month average of pay and a set index level to get the percentage increase in prices/cost of living. Dearness Allowance is paid on a range of base-pay levels.
According to the systems developers at tech company Taranaga, the combination of a Dearness Allowance with base pay was approved by the Indian government in New Delhi in 2007. What happened was that the D.A. (that protects pensioners in case of a cost-of-living increase) was combined at a 50 percent level with base pay. One of the details included in the decision also set a “ceiling” for certain benefits. The decision means that those benefits will be calculated on base pay plus daily allowance, rather than just on base pay.
There are similar cost-of-living adjustments and indexes in the United States and other countries. Some of these operate in the same way as the Dearness Allowance in India, giving percentage increases to make up for rising costs. Others are allowances for workers who must live and work in areas where the general cost of housing and meals is higher than a certain base amount. For example, some federal government employees are paid an “overseas” allowance that makes their total pay a bit higher than what they might receive in the U.S. These allowances vary with the country and the location an employee is assigned to.Category: Jobs

And now the Silverstone circuit is back in the race to once again host the 2010 British Grand Prix. At he beginning of this year, Gillett proudly announced he had signed a seventeen-year contract with FOM to host the event, and rejected the claims of his critics that it would be impossible to give the Donington Park circuit a complete revamp before the race in July 2010. But the critics were right, from the beginning the historic Donington circuit ran into problems. So when and where did it all go wrong?
Ecclestone and Silverstone
The British Silverstone circuit is not only regarded as a classical European race circuit, but is also the cradle of Formula One. On May 13, 1950 the first ever official Formula One Grand Prix took place at the Silverstone circuit, and was won by Italian Giuseppe 'Nino' Farina, in his Alfa Romeo. Until this day Great Britain, together with Italy, remain the only two countries which have been on the Formula One race calendar without any interruption since 1950.
Ecclestone already was very critical of the Silverstone circuit and its facilities during the last five years, but in 2008 things turned into an all time low, and it seemed the only thing Ecclestone and Silverstone still had in common, were the last five letters of their names.
As early as 2004, Ecclestone had stated Silverstone was: "...still like an old house that keeps getting repaired when the roof leaks." Venues like the Bahrain Grand Prix had raised the standards and Ecclestone wanted the Silverstone circuit to fall in line with these new standards and told them to invest their money in the future of the circuit.
In 2007 Ecclestone again warned the Silverstone circuit owners, the BRDC (British Racing Drivers' Club), and told them to 'wake up' and make plans to upgrade the pit and paddock facilities. A month later he warned them again, and demanded that improvements would be carried out before the race in 2010, if not, Silverstone would lose their contract after the 2009 venue. In June 2008, he upped his game, and stated in the media: "We are discussing the possibility of reaching an agreement with Donington to host the British Grand Prix." That was a clear message, but Silverstone didn't react, and in July 2008, during the race at Silverstone, the FIA announced that the British Grand Prix would be moved to Donnington. Formula One circuit. Finally, British Formula One fans will get the Grand Prix venue they deserve."
Ecclestone and Donington
So the FIA and FOM weren't happy with Silverstone and the BRDC anymore and moved the British Grand Prix to Donington. Ecclestone explained: "We wanted a world class venue for Formula One in Britain, something that the teams and British Formula One fans could be proud of. The major development plans for Donington will give us exactly that. A venue that will put British motor sport back on the map."
The last Formula One race at the Donington Park circuit was the 1993 European Grand Prix, and as it turned out, it was one of the most memorable races in the history of Formula One, with Ayrton Senna, Damon Hill and Alain Prost battling it out on a very wet and rainy circuit. But that was sixteen years ago, and today the circuit isn't really suitable for Formula One races anymore.
The circuit needed a major make-over to comply to modern day standards, and although the company which operates the Donington track, Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd, owned by Simon Gillett, didn't have the money to do that, they signed a seventeen-year contract with FOM. Gillett's company had acquired a 150-year lease of the circuit from Donington Park's owners, Wheatcroft & Son Limited, the family company of entrepreneur and race enthusiast Tom Wheatcroft, who sadly passed away on October 31, 2009.
A bridge too far for Donington?
Plans for the new circuit were made by architect Peter Wahl who worked together with German race circuit design guru Hermann Tilke to redesign the circuit layout. The cost of the development of the new circuit were at the time estimated at a ?100 million, and included the build of a Club House, the Hollywood and the Redgate suites, a Medical Center, a Media Center, new grandstands and a complete new pits and paddock complex, and a ?750,000 tunnel to provide access to the infield area, where the pits and paddock complex is located.
In January 2009, Donington received an official planning permission to re- develop the circuit, and works on the new access tunnel had begun. But there were already some signs things didn't quite go according to plan, a few months earlier Donington Park COO Lee Gill had left the company for unknown reasons. Many skeptics, like Ron Dennis and Frank Williams, had already expressed their concerns whether Donington would be able to secure the necessary funds, and doubted the plans would be realized in time for the 2010 British Grand Prix.
Financing the Donington project
By April 2009 the circuit had ran into serious financial problems, the Wheatcroft Company demanded the payment of ?2.47m for the lease of the circuit, apparently Wheatcroft hadn't received any payments since September 2008. The dispute was resolved in June and Gillett was still adamant his plans would be successful and insisted that the funding of his plans were still on course. In July, British newspaper the Guardian reported that the North West Leicestershire district council had sofar not received the actual planning application from the Donington circuit, and many people raised their eyebrows again.
In August Gillett announced that the Red Grouse Properties company was appointed to take over the construction project, again further fueling speculations the circuit would have financial problems. Although Ecclestone had already granted an extension of the deadlines as agreed in the contract, the circuit had fallen behind schedule and was running out of time. Ecclestone: "Even if they get the money, I cannot see how it will all be ready in time to go. It is very disappointing -- because we thought it would happen -- but they cannot go on missing deadlines."
In September the Donington Holdings PLC, the parent company of Donington Ventures Leisure Limited, finally came up with a plan to raise the necessary funds, they would issue high-yield bonds to raise the ?135m they needed to rescue the circuit. FIA and FOM had given Donington another deadline until October 26 to materialize their plans.
On October 23, after months of uncertainty, skepticism, financial problems and negative publicity, Simon Gillett issued a statement and told the media his plan had failed miserably. Gillett: "Despite higher than expected levels of interest and very positive early indications, the bond has failed to secure enough subscriptions." Ecclestone's reaction was clear: "They missed the deadline and really that's all there is to it. We kept extending that deadline to give them a chance, but they missed it. It's a pity, to be honest."
Now what?
I must say I admire Gillett's enthusiasm and tenacity, but he has made a few fundamental mistakes. He signed a contract with FOM without having secured the financial resources, he had not acquired the necessary planning permissions from the North West Leicestershire district council, it took him six months to get those permissions, and he probably didn't realize how difficult it would be to find ?135m in times of a global economic recession. The British government wasn't prepared to invest money in Silverstone or Donnington because all the money goes to FOM and capital investor CVC and is not re-invested in the circuits, in short, all the odds were against him when he embarked on his Formula One adventure.
What will happen to Donington now? The work has already started on the tunnel, the famous Bridgestone bridge has been taken down, and it will now take a considerable investment to get the circuit back into the state it once was.
The future
Ecclestone likes to brag about the new circuits in Malaysia, Bahrain, China, Turkey and Abu Dhabi, and it almost seems he is no longer interested in saving the traditional European circuits. True, these new circuits, and especially the circuits of China and Abu Dhabi, are marvels of modern technology and with all their glitter and glamour it seems they are a perfect fit for the new Formula One era.
But those circuits have been build with the money of the oil sheiks, Arab investors, or the governments of those countries. The races in Turkey and China are already under scrutiny, the number of spectators have drastically declined in recent years, and many people are wondering whether only 30,000 spectators are enough to justify a Formula One race. And whether Silverstone is outdated or not, the 120,000 spectators in 2009 didn't seem to mind that, and proved Europe is still very much Formula One-minded.
There is another thing FOM seems to have forgotten, we have been confronted with a global economic recession, which started at the second half of 2008, and the end is still not in sight. The recession has triggered an exodus of sponsors and manufacturers who withdrew from Formula One to cut the costs of their mother companies. However, FOM doesn't believe in cutting costs when it comes to promoting or hosting a Formula One race.
Price-wise FOM has raised the bar again and again, the show must go on, crisis or no crisis. Many circuits have since then ran into financial problems, not just Great Britain, but also France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Belgium have been struggling to keep their slot on the Formula One calendar. Many of those circuits now depend on the money they receive from the local authorities or the government to survive in Ecclestone's Formula One jungle. And when things go wrong, FOM doesn't lose one single penny, the tax payer's money will be used (some authorities prefer to use the word 'wasted') to cover the losses.
Will Silverstone host the British Grand Prix in 2010?
BRDC President Damon Hill has made it clear to FOM and FIA that he is not interested in a 'once-off' race in 2010, Silverstone is only interested in a long term contract. They also want reasonable circuits fees. Hill: "There's always been the question of the FOM fee, and ultimately that is the deciding factor. The money from the people [the spectators] who come to Silverstone goes to Formula One, and that money doesn't come back to develop the infrastructure of Formula One. None of that money has been re- invested with regard to the infrastructure of the circuits, and Silverstone is part of the infrastructure of Formula One."
The truth is very simple and easy to understand, no circuit owner, investor or government will ever invest money in a venue that doesn't make a profit, they might as well throw their money right out of the window. Belgium recently again reported a loss of over 5 million Euros over 2009, and that is exactly why Silverstone and the BRDC haven't reached an agreement with FOM yet, the only thing FOM can guarantee Silverstone, is the loss of many millions of Euros, and that is something that should change.
It is now time for FOM to show us Formula One is not just about money, Formula One has always been very profitable for FOM , CVC and Ecclestone, and now is the moment to return the favor to Formula One, the teams, the circuits and the fans, and do something about the fees the circuits have to pay, which in the end have led to this financially very unhealthy situation.Emergency Health Services Management

CTVNews.ca Staff
Published Wednesday, May 9, 2012 9:42PM EDT
Defence Minister Peter MacKay has apologized for a Department of National Defence booklet containing a photograph of convicted murderer Russell Williams.
The professional development booklet, which was issued last month, shows a photo of Williams sitting among other members of the Armed Forces.
As news of the botched booklet spread on Wednesday, Defence Minister Peter MacKay said he was planning to call the families of Williams' two victims and offer a personal apology.
"As soon as I became aware of this booklet, I immediately ordered the military to destroy all copies of the collected booklets," MacKay said in a statement.
"This is a terrible mistake for which the Canadian Forces are truly sorry."
Williams pleaded guilty to murdering two women and attacking two more during a series of escalating break-ins in eastern Ontario more than two years ago.
The Belleville Intelligencer reported that the photo was taken on Jan. 15, 2010.
Less than a month later, Williams had been arrested.
MacKay said that he was instructing his staff to ensure the mistake would never be repeated.
"I have also instructed my officials to immediately begin an investigation to ensure it does not happen again."The Knights
PLEASE NOTE: These concerts are on Monday & Tuesday.

I am not a beginer as such done about 50 halfs (PV1.35) and 11 marathons (PB 3.42) but last was in 2006. I was never a savvy trainer just used to go out and run no speed work or anything fancy - regret it now as if I structured my training sure I could have got better times
Now back at it and struggling to run 3 miles in 28 mins ! Aiming for a half next August (Helensburgh) so wgat s best ? stick at 3 miles till times improve or increase distance ? Shall I stick at 3 until I can run this in the time I am aiming for for half (per mile wise!) ?
The good news is that it may take a while to get it back but you will get it back. All those miles in your legs are not forgotten.
I don't think there is a marvellous answer out there for you and you already know what is required. Get out there and put miles into your legs in a gradual process.
No point in starting any sort of plan until you are comfortable running at least 6 miles. Do that in a gradual manner with the typical hard/easy routine say 5 miles followed by 3 miles the next day. Do not worry about speed or previous times, just get some miles in those legs. I reckon you will need a couple of hundred miles before you are ready to start anything more serious.
That should not be a problem though, if you can get yourself running again half decently by Jan 2012 you have 7 full months to get really fit and I do not see that as a problem for you.

I took two months off. That was bloody hard. I came back in, thinking i could do it at the same level. Big mistake. Just make sure you dont end up hating the sport. In the months since starting again, the pain, which normally my senses override i have not been able too. Only just now, feeling that love, and ignoring that pain again...
Good luck
Thanks both !!
Ran 4 days last week and one so far this. Its harder than I thought and am trying to "run before I can walk" but still remember the "Glory days" and am determined to get round that half in around 1:50 !!

Never one to bite his tongue, Smith had a few unsavory words for Jenkins after the Panthers 30-15 route of the Rams in Charlotte, N.C. Jenkins had to shadow Smith all day, and along the way, Jenkins managed to ruffle Smith’s feathers. The Charlotte Observer caught the best of it.
WATCH: Sam Bradford injured | Recap | Must-see photos
— “Well, he thinks he’s Deion (Sanders). He’s not.”
— After getting his 800th catch, the milestone coming against Jenkins, Smith said: “He’s just another notch on the bedpost. That’s 800. He ain’t not different.”
What really seemed to get Smith worked up was Jenkins making the matchup more personal than Smith would prefer.
.”
Smith didn’t offer any specifics. Players used to turn to media guides to dig up personal information about their opponents and try to use it as a distraction during the game. Now it’s easier, with everything at the touch of a keyboard.
“When you try to take it personal like that, I don’t have great humbling things to say,” Smith said, according to the Observer. “So he can take his (butt) back to St. Louis and watch the (expletive) film because I don’t play them games. And if I see him in the streets I’m going to punch him in his (expletive) mouth.”
Oh, you thought that was it?

Improving UX through Dirty Design
Jakob Thyness
Are modern websites too sleek for their own good? We put so much time and effort into our web site designs that we sometimes forget to ask what the user really wants. As often as not, the user is only interested in the content itself – only stopping to notice the interface when it gets between him and what he’s looking for.
Founded in perception psychology, the basic idea of Dirty Design is this: Each individual element on the screen needs to be correctly designed for its specific function. Each function will have an optimum form, and close adherence to this will increase the website’s usability. Consequently, most current web sites and applications can be improved by being "dirtied down".

Websites are products, too: Designing prototypes to ship fantastic sites
Jon Schlossberg
Clean design, smart IA and slick code make for a good website. To get from good to great, these three disciplines have to work hand-in-hand to make the user's experience really sing. But in the hullabaloo surrounding things like process, budget and deadlines, disconnects often develop between the visual design, the interaction design and the technology-- at the expense of user experience. In his talk, Jon Schlossberg, Product Designer at HUGE Inc, explains how to pull everything together with high fidelity prototyping. Jon details how prototypes can greatly improve the finished product, shares examples of prototypes for CNN.com, Jetblue.com and other sites, and offers tips for building great prototypes and fitting them into your workflow.

Freelancer Survival Tips
Jesse Friedman
Part of being a freelancer involves finding yourself ridiculously overworked, or embarrassingly underworked. Then there are the client phonecalls at midnight, the dreaded tax forms, the cabin fever, and of course the hours spent trying to get it through to your friends and family that you do actually have a real job.
With many losing their jobs in the recession, and university graduates struggling to get that first step on the career ladder, freelancing is becoming an ever more desirable and ultimately an increasingly competitive option.
This session will cover how to set up as a freelancer, working out how much you should charge, keeping track of expenses and writing a contract. There will also be plenty of tips on how to be a better freelancer, including remote working, keeping your sanity, staying competitive without reducing your rates, and how to get decent clients (and keep them) without spending a penny on marketing.

Paul Muldoon lost me about the same time he started writing poems about The Rolling Stones. Ted Kooser, our recent Poet Laureate, was a fine example of how to make traditional verse interesting. And of course some of our true masters are still alive and should be of interest in whatever style they continue to write–our Adrienne Richs, our Susan Howes, our Derek Walcotts, our William Logans, our Michael S. Harpers. They continue to find an audience even while slowly integrating new forms and types of poetry within their oeuvre.
The poet that gets slammed sometimes for being too pervasively simple, of rehashing too many old themes, is the now ancient W.S. Merwin. He found his way into the pages of The New Yorker a long time ago. He is nothing else but a poet; although a collection of prose reminiscences and essays have made their way into publication, his work in those genres simply reenacts a classicism more fittingly applied to poetry.
The following selection is from Merwin’s 1978 effort, The Carrier of Ladders.
You can also find more Merwin here and here.

The three-day programme which will take place at Manchester Business School, UK, between 3rd-5th, September 2014 costs £2,900, which includes all tuition and certification, visa support, accommodation and all meals. Delegates will also join Manchester Business School’s extensive alumni network.
A statement from the organisers read thus
“Strategies for Result-Driven Change management
Anticipating to and responding to change. Nothing can be more critical to organisational success in this era of globalisation and socio-economic development. Given rapid economic, commerce and social developments in sub-Saharan Africa over the past few years, this is particularly true for African organisations. Organisations operating in Africa must evolve in line with increasing investor interest, an expanding middle class and accelerated economic growth, among other major trends.
Managing change is an essential component of an organisation’s success and indeed, continued survival. Companies must continually innovate and evolve to ensure that they remain relevant and to maintain and expand their market share. Fundamentally, continual change is essential to boosting organisational performance.
There are powerful forces acting to change the political, economic, social, and market conditions in which organisations operate. At the same time, in many organisations, there are strong internal and structural resistances to change. Indeed, resistance to change can result in weakening employee morale and productivity, as well as the organisation becoming increasingly irrelevant in the marketplace in which it operates.
Overcoming resistance to change requires effective leadership and buy-in from both employees and other stakeholders. Achieving employee buy-in requires inspirational and powerful leadership. Effective leadership can enable organisations to foster creativity and innovation and continually anticipate and respond to change.
In order to improve the capacity of senior executives to manage change, TEXEM and Manchester Business School have collaborated in order to develop a bespoke executive education programme focused on change management. The three-day programme will be held at Manchester Business School, UK, between 3rd and 5thSeptember 2014. The programme cost of £2,900 includes all tuition and certification, visa support, accommodation and all meals. Delegates will also join Manchester Business School’s extensive alumni network.
Delivered by top academics and thought leaders, the programme will enable participants to overcome structural and organisational obstacles in order to promote change and boost organisational performance. The executive education programme is specifically tailored for African executives, ensuring it meets the precise needs of participants.
Executives responsible for change management will develop enhanced insight into the process of change through the latest research, academic thinking and discussions of real-world case studies. Delegates will learn exactly how to apply what they have learnt in the programme to their organisations, ensuring that they will be able to add immense value.
According to Alim Abubakre, CEO, TEXEM, “The programme has been designed to empower executives to respond to organisational challenges. It also aims to develop the skill-sets that senior executives need to excel in their dynamic operating environments. Executives who participate in the programme ‘Strategies for Results Driven Change Management’ will acquire the skills and competencies to boost organisational performance by anticipating and responding to change”.
Dr Nicholas Clifford, Academic Director, Manchester Business School said: “Many techniques have been developed to assist managers to achieve outstanding results, however, the real skill is in knowing how to apply these techniques. This can only come from those who can both manage and lead their staff towards such results. At Manchester we place as much weight on leadership as we do on management because both are essential to achieve real and lasting organisational change.”
TEXEM is an innovative service-based organisation that provides learning platforms for business professionals. Manchester Business School is one of the top business schools in the UK and the world, with triple accreditation from the AACSB, AMBA, EQUIS.

The two companies said they were able to come to an agreement for a new distribution agreement "in principle," according to a joint statement provided to The New York Times.
Fox pulls signal on Cablevision customers as negotiations "remain far apart"
Fox channels were pulled from Cablevision homes in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut on Oct. 16 because Fox and the cable operator failed to reach a new agreement over broadcast fees. Cablevision customers lost Fox 5 in New York and My9 in New York, Fox29 in Philadelphia and cable channels like Fox Business Network and National Geographic Channel.
The move comes just in time for Game 3 of the World Series, which is carried exclusively on Fox. However, Cablevision customers missed the first two games of the series, as well as the entire National League Championship and many other Fox prime-time programs.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
This was Cablevision's third programming blackout so far this year. The cable company lost Food Network and HGTV for three weeks in January over a contract dispute. Walt Disney Company pulled ABC from Cablevision homes in March, causing customers to miss the first 15 minutes of the Academy Awards telecast.
Fox reached a separate deal on Friday with Dish Network for Fox, FX and other channels after a three-week blackout.A Nordex spokesman told Windpower Monthly: "Pakistan has a huge growth potential and the new Feed in Tariff (FIT) offers an attractive price level for the industry. Based on the successful market entry we are now in the face of setting up a subsidiary in Karachi."
In October, Pakistan’s government introduced a FIT that is the second-most generous in Asia after Sri Lanka. Officials from Pakistan’s Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) is targeting eight 50MW wind projects to reach financial close by June.
Nordex signed a 250MW deal with four local developers in October 2011. The firm will supply 20 hot climate versions of its N100/2500 2.5MW turbines to each of the five wind farms covered by the deal. The wind farms are due to be built in 2012 and 2013.
When the deal was announced, Nordex CSO Lars Bondo Krogsgaard said Pakistan was its most important Asian market outside China.
It already had a deal for 50MW in 2010.

Introduction
This lesson features the climactic moments in the Gospel of Mark: The crucifixion of Jesus. We will also learn the message of the Gospel in three words (sin, substitution, and faith), as demonstrated by three figures that Jesus encounters in this passage. Perhaps a review of Passion Week would be helpful at this time. Passion Week began when Jesus entered Jerusalem (the Triumphal Entry) exactly one week before His resurrection. This Sunday has traditionally been called Palm Sunday, so named for the palm branches spread out before our entering Lord. On Monday of Passion Week Jesus entered the temple and cleansed it. On Tuesday or Wednesday of Passion Week Jesus delivered the Olivet Discourse. On Thursday the events of the Last Supper, Gethsemane, betrayal, arrest, and abandonment all took place. Today’s passage records the dark events of Friday of Passion Week, beginning in the wee hours of the morning.
Mark enjoys describing individuals who encounter Jesus. In this lesson, three such encounters will be highlighted. One person had known Jesus for more than three years; one never met Jesus, but nevertheless benefited from His death; one responded perfectly to Jesus after his first encounter with Him.
Peter demonstrates sin (14:53-72)130
14:53 Then they led Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and experts in the law came together. 14:54 And Peter had followed him from a distance, up to the courtyard of the high priest. the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he broke down and wept.
Two witnesses were required for capital punishment, according to Numbers 35:30 and Deuteronomy 17:6. Those who accused Jesus of claiming He would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days were perhaps misunderstanding Jesus’ statement in John 2:19 (mixed with Mark 13:2). Otherwise, Jesus never claimed to do such a thing.
Jesus had two trials, a religious one and a civil one. The religious one was overseen by Annas, then Caiaphas; the civil one by Pilate, then Herod, then Pilate again (Luke 23:6-12). Jesus had by-and-large veiled His messiahship until now. He first responds with “I am,” but then lets them have it with a very bold—and obvious—claim to messiahship (v. 62; note especially the reaction of the Jewish leadership).
Apparently, Jesus and Peter were both undergoing interrogation. “Following” Jesus has been a recurring theme in Mark’s Gospel.
Those who “follow” (ἀκολουθέω) Jesus in Mark’s Gospel:
- Peter and Andrew (1:18)
- Levi (2:14)
- Tax collectors and sinners (2:15)
- A crowd from Galilee (3:7)
- Large crowd (5:24)
- His disciples (6:1)
- Any who wish to come after Jesus (8:34)
- Invitation to the rich young ruler (10:21)
- Peter et al (10:28)
- Those going to Jerusalem with Jesus (10:32)
- Bartimaeus (10:52)
- Those at the Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem (11:9)
- Peter, from a distance (14:54)
- Mary, Mary, and Salome (15:41)
For the first time, however, someone is following Jesus “from a distance.”131 Sure, the literal meaning suggests a physical distance between Peter and the one he was following, but the notion of “following” in Mark’s Gospel almost always means more than merely walking behind someone. It suggests loyalty and allegiance. Peter was still following Jesus, but he want to distance himself from Jesus to ensure that he was safe from the danger. Notice what happens to Peter because he has permitted distance to develop in his relationship with Jesus. He denies his Lord . . . three times. He thought he was protected from the danger, but found that more danger lurks when distance separates us from the Lord. Does distance exist in your relationship with Christ?
Barabbas demonstrates substitution (15:1-20).
Who are Pilate and Herod? Pilate was the Roman governor of Judea (
They chose to release Barabbas over Jesus. I find it ironic that when Jesus proved to be a different type of Savior than they wanted, they chose to replace Him with one who was what they wanted—a political insurrectionist. Many thought Jesus, as the Messiah, would lead a revolt and conquer Rome; Barabbas had done just that. Do you serve the Christ who is or the Christ you want?
Flogging was not necessarily a part of crucifixion. Pilate was probably trying to disuade the crowd from crucifying Jesus (John 19:4-5). When they persisted, though, he had no choice.
Mark 15:16 describes the whole cohort, which comprised hundreds of soldiers. They struck him on the head with the staff after they had placed the crown of thorns on his head. Mockery ensued, beatings, etc. The crucifixion of Jesus was a lengthy, painful process, not a point in time. Perhaps the most painful part of the episode was their kneeling before Jesus in mockery, though it certainly foreshaddowed everyone’s kneeling before Him one day (Phil. 2:10-11).
Mark’s details pertaining to Barabbas paint a vivid picture of what Jesus did for you and me. Barabbas had been judged and legally condemned. Barabbas was guilty. Barabbas deserved death. Barabbas could do nothing to free himself. Jesus took the place of Barabbas and died on Barabbas’ cross. Barabbas was released. I am Barabbas.
The Centurion demonstrates faith (15:21-41)
15:21 The soldiers drafted a passer-by to carry his cross, a man coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus. 15:22 They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha (which is translated, “Place of the Skull”). 15:23 They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.132.
Note the brevity in the passage—“And they crucified him.” The event that all of history hinges on is given only cursory treatment. It is almost too sacred to elaborate upon; or too sacrilegious to consider that the second person of the Trinity was undergoing such cruelty. What they witnessed on the cross was a complete contradiction; it blew all of their categories. By definition, the Messiah was the furthest thing from a crucified criminal.
Cicero (106-43
Mark records only one of Jesus’ seven sayings from the cross. He quoted the first verse of Psalm twenty-two (much of this Psalm is victorious, leading some to speculate that perhaps He quoted the rest of the Psalm the moment He arose).
Mark customarily records an act or saying of Jesus, and then pans the audience to record their responses. Here, he merely records that Jesus was crucified, then he pans the crowd to record the response of the soldiers (15:24), the passers-by (15:29-30), the chief priests and experts in the Law (15:31-32), the criminals with Jesus (15:32), bystanders (15:35-36), the righteous centurion (15:39), and the women (15:40-41). He gets everyone’s response.
The Centurion is one of only a handful of people in the Gospel of Mark that respond appropriately to Jesus. A Centurion in the Roman army has charge of one hundred soldiers.
In Mark, the right response to Jesus is described in the very first verse: Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. The Centurion nailed it. And the Gospel demands such a response of faith every day. We exercise faith in the Gospel the first time for salvation, but every day after that we must walk by faith.
Meditation Verse
We conclude each lesson with one verse from the passage we’ve studied. We refer to it as a “meditation verse” to leave a broad range of uses: meditate, reflect, memorize, reread, etc. Our meditation verse for this lesson is Mark 15:39:
15:39 Now when the centurion, who stood in front of him, saw how he died, he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”
130 Unless otherwise indicated, all translations are taken from The NET Bible.
131 It was Peter who followed Jesus at a distance. Though, according to John 18:15-16, another disciple accompanied Peter.
132 Jesus refused a mixture that would have deadened the pain.share your experience with others

thanks, now pass on the savingsSince the update before the last update of the CF7 reCaptcha Extension (or the CF7 itself) the reCaptcha dialog does not show up in my contact form anymore. It worked before!
Also, experimenting with the Better reCaptcha plugin instead of the reCaptcha plugin did not change the situation.
At the moment, the only Captcha I'm able to include in my contact form is the old Really Simple Captcha, which works like a charm.
I'm not quite sure, whether the problem is caused by the CF7 plugin itself, the CF7 reCaptcha extension plugin, the reCaptcha plugin or the Better reCaptcha plugin. The fact that switching between the reCaptcha plugin and the Better reCaptcha plugin does not change anything leeds to my suspicion that the CF7 plugin or the CF7 reCaptcha extension plugin must be causing this (or a possible incompatibility to another 3rd party plugin).
Does anybody have an idea, how to get one of the reCaptchas, that are more sophisticated than the Really Simple Captcha, show up again?
Thanks in advance.

- ImportedBRANSON, Mo. -- The world's top anglers were fighting fish and the weather Thursday, in hopes of eventually landing a $100,000 dollar pay day.
The Bassmaster Elite Series kicked off at 6:30 in the morning on Table Rock Lake. The skies were clear over Taney and Stone Counties, in the early going, but the waters quickly became choppy after 60 mile an hour winds brought in rain and lightning.
"This is truly an athletic event, these guys will endure this," says Branson Fish Tales, fishing guide, Shane Pierce.
Pierce spends nearly every day on the water finding honey holes of fish for visitors, and had been caught in a thunderstorm before, like many of the anglers on the water were Thursday,
"You don't want to be out there when the static electricity is so much that when you cast your line, your line actually rises in the air," says Pierce.
"They are professionals... so they need to know how to read weather," said BASS Director of Operations, Eric Lope, referring to 108 anglers that traveled to Table Rock Lake from across the globe.
Lopez says the tournament has precautions in place when the weather gets bad: it can delay the start of the tournament or contact each angler by text through out the day. He says the problem is, due to the grand size of the Lake, not every angler will experience the same weather patterns.
The top prize for the four day tournament is $100,000, and points that will help decide the "Angler of the Year" award, similar to the Sprint Cup in NASCAR.
"We’re known for doing things up big," says Lopez referring to the Expo that will be held this weekend at the Branson Landing. In addition to helping the tournament pump some $1.5 million dollars into the local economy, it also gives spectators and visitors a chance to talk with professional, check out the latest fishing gear, and see the final weigh-in.
"So it’s really a carnival, slash festival, slash fishing expo, slash food festival," said Lopez.
The weigh-ins will be held Thursday and Friday at Table Rock State Park Marina, and at the Branson Landing on Saturday and Sunday at 3:15 p.m. The field uses its five heaviest fish each day, and will be cut down from 108 anglers to only 12 by Sunday. lowest of all the angelic orders, angels are tasked with delivering God's messages to humans in addition to being personal guardians. Angel has also become a generic term for any such kind of heavenly being..
A catch-all term for the collection of gods, monsters, and spirits that manifest in the Megami Tensei series. The English usage is derived from the Greek word "daimon," which was used to describe ethereal beings both benevolent and malevolent.
Dominions are sixth in the angelic hierarchy, named such for the authority they wrest on the lower five orders. They empower governments of God-fearing nations and teach how to chain the fleshly body to spiritual endeavors.Rise and shine, morning glory!

All Iowa Shop Hop
Click on the link above to get to the website of the All Iowa Shop Hop. I've had a few people stop by while they're out shop hopping and would love to have more! I'm open 9 to 6 today and next week, Monday thru Thursday, and tomorrow 1 to 4 if you want to come take a look. I've got my patterns and quilts displayed inside...just too hot and windy to have them outside most days.
Above are some blocks that came out of the middle of a comforter that was in tatters, so I took it apart and in the middle was another tattered quilt! I salvaged these blocks and I'm thinking of making them into wall hangings or pillows. Any suggestions? I think the fabrics are really old, I sent an email to a friend who knows a lot about civil war quilts and I'm hoping to learn more from her.

Clear Lake Trunk show and other half of my All Iowa Shop Hop
On the way home we traveled a different route than we did on the way up so we could hit more quilt shops. I used the All Iowa Shop Hop map to plan our route. The picture below is at Country Threads just outside of Garner.
Check out all these shops and more at the All Iowa Shop Hop, June 1-14. I hope lots of you can go on the shop hop, it should be lots of fun! I will be having an outdoor and indoor quilt show...and garden show, depending on the weather! I still have lots of spots left to stay the night while you're on the shop hop, for just $25 a night, so take my number with you and give me a call while you're on the road, if you need a place to stay while you're on the hop. I am about half-way between the Creston and Clarinda shops. Please take the time to come on down to Southwest Iowa... The Quilt Coop, down in the country, south of Clarinda, is definitely worth the trip. It has been nominated as one of the 10 best shops in the country, so if you haven't been there, make sure and check it out!

More All Iowa Shop Hop
I'm sorry I'm so slow in posting...May is a busy month here at the Farmer's Dotter. I've been trying to get my yard and flowers to look presentable for the AllIowaShopHop.com/ , so I may not be posting a lot.
I'll try and put a few more pictures of our shop hop, but I forgot to take my camera into a few of the shops....SORRY!
THE REST OF THE 1ST DAYS STORY! After leaving Creston, we headed on up the road to Winterset to the Fons and Porter shop and to the Ben Franklin store, where we found a few more goodies, of course.
From there, we headed to Adel, where Jacque Johnson has a cute little shop called Adel Quilting and Dry Goods. I found the cutest little scissors there that had polka dots on them, so I had to get a couple pair...like I need any more scissors or things with dots! That's Jacque above, with a
t-shirt quilt she was working on when she and a few of her friends came down and spent a couple nights with me almost a couple years ago. They were a fun group, as usual!
Next we went on to Des Moines, where we stopped at Creekside Quilting in Clive. I had never been in their shop before, it looked like they have a lot of interesting quilting goodies! A few of the girls seemed interested in coming down for a retreat...I would love to have them!
Next we tried to find the Quilters Cupboard in Ankeny, but I'd loaned my GPS to the kids, so we didn't make it there, darn!
Remember, all these shops AND MORE, will be on the shop hop, so make sure you have lots of time! I was headed to do a trunk show in Clear Lake that evening, so we were kind of on a time schedule.
From Ankeny, we headed north, taking Highway 69, to Ames. I love to travel the back roads, and spring its such a beautiful time to be out and about! Below is a picture of the Quilting Connection owner, holding the All Iowa Shop Hop paper. I have those here at my house now, and the passports, if anyone wants to pick one up, so you can start planning your trip! The Quilting Connection is like 2 shops..I think it was actually 2 stores to begin with, they have a lot to offer.
From Ames, we got on Interstate 35 and headed north to Clear Lake, just in time to check into our motel and meet up with a few of the guild ladies for supper before the trunk show. More on that later...sorry I'm so long winded today!18 years of experience

Dr. Miramontes is the worst doctor I have ever been to. I have suffered through visits with her for two years because I just didn't want to start the difficult search for another one. However, I can't take it anymore. She is rude, constantly distracted, does not listen, NEVER on time, and does not review patient files before coming to the room. She limits the subjects you can talk to her about per visit (even if they are all related). My blood pressure rises everytime I go to her office. FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR.
never again lack of proper care again and again
When I arrived promptly for my appointment this morning I was informed that Dr. Miramones does not accept my insurance any longer. The office was happy to schedule an appointment for me two weeks out. The office made a point to call and remind me of the appointment so the Drs time would not be wasted! I wish some one would have thought to let me know before I waited two weeks for nothing and will have to search out and wait for an appointment with another Dr. I wish someone had taken the time to update this website where it shows insurance that Dr. Miramontes accepts! I was informed this morning that she has not accepted this insurance since April, plenty of time to let waiting patients know and more that enough time to update the website! I think my condition might be serious I patiently waited two weeks to see Dr. Miramontes, I don't know how long it will take to find another dr and schedule an appointment. Very disappointed!!
Rude, unprofessional. Let's face it, your OB annual may not be the best time of the year but this doc makes it worse. She mis-diagnosed a breast "lump" and scared me silly. NOT cancer. There are far better doctors in town, keep looking.
This doctor is so rude, very unsympathetic. She doesnt review your symptoms properly that is why she gives you the wrong diagnostic. I changed doctors about 2 years ago and I am so glad I did. I am confident now that when I see my doctor that I will be given the attention, respect and correct information I deserve Patients like us brings bacon to these doctor's tables and we should be treated like we are the only patient they have, at least during the time of your appointment.
not really that happy with my last 3 office visits. Dr. Miramontes told me I had too many problems and she had other patient and could not help me with any more things. To make matters worse she said the lump she misdiagnosed and now I have to get another opinion. UGH! She has bad bed side manner and no patience. I dont recommend to her to any one!
Dr. Miramontes is the worst doctor I have ever been to. She is just awful. I don't know what kind of training she received in med school, but I think she may have chosen the wrong profession.
Through two preganacy's and regular illness she has been available for all our needs. I would recomend her to anyone and I have!
I think she's a very caring dr. She goes out of her way to make sure my kids and i are comfortable with all procedures and has personally returned my phone calls. She takes the time to make sure all of my concerns are addressed. She manages to be both professional and friendly. I deffinately recommend her.
Can be GRUMPY
Spends enough time to explain & listen now. That was not the case a few years ago. Good Dr, thorough, not too quick just right prescriptions.
Great Doctor, had a lot of trouble using my insurance. Staff had trouble running my card, even though Peachwood Med Grp takes my insurance.Depression and Suicide
Going. One in five college students believe that their depression level is higher than it should be, yet only 6% say that they would seek help.

Card Rulings:Junk Synchron
Please do not add "rulings" to the Rulings Pages that do not specifically appear on official sources. This is why your edits were reverted.
In addition, your "rulings" are incorrect. "Junk Synchron" works differently than "Skill Drain" - it negates effects which activate on the field, while "Skill Drain" negates a monster's effect while it is on the field. The effects of "Exiled Force", "Red-Eyes B. Chick", and "Chrysalis" activate on the field, so "Junk Synchron" will negate them. --Deus Ex Machina (Talk) 01:13, 27 October 2008 (UTC)
- I'd love see that article. This one is the closest thing I can find, and it mentions the exact opposite of what you say. Here's two quotes:
- Any effect that the monster activates while it is on the field will also be negated, even if the monster is removed from the field to pay a cost or in response to its effect.
- Example: Red-Eyes B. Chick
- Player A normal summons Junk Synchron and uses its effect to special summon Red-Eyes B. Chick. Next, she sends Red-Eyes B. Chick to the graveyard to activate its effect. Its effect is negated when it resolves, because it was activated on the field and is not activated in the graveyard.
- "Sending to the Graveyard" and "Tributing" are both costs. All costs occur at the same time, regardless of whether it's sending to the Graveyard, or Tributing, or paying LP, or discarding, etc. Also, Tributing doesn't always have to be on the field - Ritual Spell Cards can Tribute cards that are not on the field. However, by default, cards Tribute monsters from your side of the field.
- The effect activates on the field since the monster needs to be on the field in order for you to send it to the Graveyard to activate the effect. If it activated in the Graveyard, you would need to send it from the Graveyard to the Graveyard to activate the effect (which doesn't make sense, so it doesn't activate in the Graveyard). --Deus Ex Machina (Talk) 04:31, 28 October 2008 (UTC)
oh my god!!
your my new friend.i could not agree with you more on deltaneos and twotailedfox and the king of page control moneypony (he is a fag) having page control crap, are they always on this site or what?
Zeroblizzard: It sounds like a canned answer to me. However, I do understand where they are coming from, and I do understand that they are doing their best to provide the correct material for professional and caring (I do care about the game, personally) players. So, instead of being mad at them (I'm not saying that I'll never be, it's just that I'm not mad at them on this particular issue). By the way, this argument's a little dated (just saying). So, instead of being mad at them, I'm just mad at the "Official" rulings. (Look at the maximum of 3 rule, on the Harpie Lady stuff. It's complete bull that apparently card effects can activate in the deck or even before a duel starts that prevents having more than 3 Harpies being used in one deck.)
Don't you think that if Zombie Bed were to be made as a real card,they would have made it so by now? Besides,I'm sure there are a lot of anime-only cards that many would have liked to give tips to if the cards became real,but it never happened.PoirotH 12:37, 4 May 2009 (UTC)
Zeroblizzard - Look at Multiply. That card took forever to come out in TCG and Il Blud was an TCG only release for a while.
Gragonith trivia
- Saw the talk page. Things don't seem to be going your way. Too bad. Danny Lilithborne 14:30, September 4, 2009 (UTC)
That's all you have to say? This sounds more like politicking than anything else. Zeroblizzard 15:15, September 4, 2009 (UTC)Zeroblizzard

- Alright, consider this a warning. Screw around again and there will be consequences. Danny Lilithborne 09:36, September 5, 2009 (UTC)
- What rules have I broken? I won't do that again, but I want to see what penalties I can be forced to deal with in writing. By the way, you're not playing by the rules either. So before you start telling me that I've done something wrong, I'd like to see your reasons for getting rid of bad trivia backed up by yugioh wikia rules. Zeroblizzard 17:10, September 5, 2009 (UTC)Zeroblizzard
- I'm not going to ban you for disagreeing with me, but you know very well that messing with other user's user pages is not kosher. As for the trivia page, this isn't a game where you get to win if you play by the rules. Pages can be deleted at the administrator's discretion; simple as that. Danny Lilithborne 17:55, September 5, 2009 (UTC)
- Thank you very much for your answer. You have answered my question. I appreciate the response. It was not clear to me that administrators had discretion over which pages could be deleted (I guess admins can do that...duh?!?!?). Thank you. I will behave from now on.

War Arms
- Union Monsters don't provide their equipped monster their effect if they were placed on the field by a card effect other than "Roll Out" since they did not become an Equip Card by their own effect, so War Arms doesn't gain Spirit of the Six Samurai's effect. Check the rulings for "Union Rider" which steals an opponent's Union Monsters. Speedball 14:58, September 9, 2009 (UTC)
- There is no mention of a Union monster anywhere on Koa'ki Meiru War Arms. In fact, the same applies to the monsters whose effects closely resemble War Arms': Sword Hunter, Truckroid, Relinquished and Destiny Hero - Plasma. The monsters that they steal and equip to themselves don't have rulings and they have no precedents (that I can find, and spell monsters are monsters created by spell cards that aren't tokens), so why can't you?

Do you go by the nickname of Xiosuke on the IRC? Runer5h 23:05, November 19, 2009 (UTC)Runer5h
- No. Zeroblizzard 01:08, November 20, 2009 (UTC)Zeroblizzard
- That's odd... I told Xiosuke about a Coelecanth OTK involving Power Tool Dragon with Axe of Despair, Mist Wurm, and the Coelecanth itself attacking for the win. Then I noticed that you put that as a tip on the Coelecanth page... do you know Xiosuke, then, or is this just a crazy coincidence? Runer5h 01:16, November 20, 2009 (UTC)Runer5h
- That's a coincidence. I didn't make the Fish OTK that I put up in the tips (I'm surprised that you tracked me down about it, too...); I found it on TCGPlayer's Yugioh Site (). Zeroblizzard 01:33, November 20, 2009 (UTC)Zeroblizzard

Relinking?
What do you mean by saying relinking left and right? Do you mean the summary in my edit? Or anything else? I don't understand this clearly --Blackwings0605 15:14, March 17, 2010 (UTC)
- Sorry. I noticed on the changes page that a lot of links were being redirected, or "relinking" as I called them (mistakenly, I might add. I'm not going to be making that mistake again.). Zeroblizzard 15:23, March 17, 2010 (UTC)Zeroblizzard
RE overusage of linking
Well, for one thing, it makes it more confusing when you read it and see a link thinking it might be a different card. It also takes up more space on the editing page so it takes longer to load the editing page. It also takes longer to load the page you want to read.--Tapper930 15:29, March 17, 2010 (UTC)
- I can understand the confusion when editing a page part, but that comes with editing a page (it's part of the job). The loading part, though, is BS. Those two signs that indicate links are 1 byte a piece. That's unnoticeable in terms of internet usage (bandwidth), and as far as I can tell, the reason the editing pages take so long to long is because of the GUI (the interface of the wiki). Zeroblizzard 15:35, March 17, 2010 (UTC)Zeroblizzard
- If your computer was as slow as some, it would annoy you when it takes forever to load.--Tapper930 15:37, March 17, 2010 (UTC)
- What I'm saying is that it's not because of the links, it's the website itself. I'm willing to bet that for the people that use this website, it loads just as slow as other websites, like the New York Times website or Engadget. Zeroblizzard 15:42, March 17, 2010 (UTC)Zeroblizzard
- Deltaneos and other admins seem OK with it, why are you mad about it?
- Sorry for seeming mad. I'm dropping it. Zeroblizzard 17:50, March 17, 2010 (UTC)Zeroblizzard
Re: Can we get more in depth statistics for ourselves and the wiki?
I have no control over that type of thing. Someone would to write an extension that does that and then we could have it installed. The closest thing we have to any of them is the number of edits to talk pages, which you can see here. -- Deltaneos (talk) 21:33, March 17, 2010 (UTC)

Re: When/where is it OK to post anime pictures of cards?

Re: Transcripts
Transcripts of the speech, no. Full transcripts are copyrighted. Quoting small portions is fine, but we would need permission from the copyright holders to post the whole thing. Giving a record what was played in the Duel is fine and most episode pages already do it. There's nothing wrong with describing events in your own words. -- Deltaneos (talk) 15:55, July 3, 2010 (UTC)

Stop spamming; asking for new images
- Instead, go look up the card code (e.g. DCR-089) on ebay and upload them yourself.
- Either that, or scan your own cards like what I do sometimes. -Falzar FZ- (talk page|useful stuff) 22:52, July 24, 2010 (UTC)
- stop doing that. either people don't check the talk pages, or people who see the image AND has the ability to upload a better image will do so just by looking at the image. -Falzar FZ- (talk page|useful stuff) 01:06, July 25, 2010 (UTC)
Re: What is up with your edits
The reason I replaced the stars with Levels is because of 2 reasons. 1. The stars look weird on the page. 2. When editing it looks very confusing. Quotations are needed for the names of any card or archetype.--Tapper930 (talk • contribs) 17:09, August 1, 2010 (UTC)
RE: About the Magical Hats Unnecessary changes
- Because it clutters up the page with unnecessary information. If people want to see what a specific card does, they can click the link. That's what card pages are for. Also, a lot of the cards listed on the Hats page fall under the category of "you CAN use them, but god knows why you WOULD."--YamiWheeler (talk • contribs) 11:32, August 3, 2010 (UTC)DETECTIVES have released CCTV images after a card scamming device was found on a ticket machine at New Cross Station.
An investigation was launched in May this year after a member of the public spotted something suspicious when she tried to use the machine.
Now images have been circulated to help British Transport Police catch those responsible for fitting it.
Officers believe the device was fitted between 6.30am and 9.45am on May 29 and wish to speak to the men pictured to help with their enquiries.
Detective Constable Rebecca Crampton said: “We have conducted an in-depth investigation into the incident to try to identify the people responsible.
“This has included working through forensic opportunities, conducting anniversary visits, covert patrols, and speaking with witnesses.
“Images have been circulated to other forces and on police intelligence systems, but unfortunately to no avail.
“From viewing CCTV at the station, we have now isolated an image of men we believe were in the area at the time and who we believe may be able to help with our investigation.”
If you recognise the men or have information about the incident, please call British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference B9/LS of 8/11/12. Or you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
Anyone who witnesses suspicious activity at ticket machines should alert a member of staff or contact British Transport Police.
BTP’s tips to help prevent becoming a victim of fraud at ATMs and ticket machines:
• Always ensure that you cover your hand when typing in your PIN
• Be aware of your surroundings. Do not be distracted when using an ATM or ticket machine.
• Never use a ticket machine or ATM where other people are lingering. If you feel uneasy, use another machine.
• Report confiscated cards immediately. If you can, don’t leave the machine. Instead, call the bank from the machine or ATM using a mobile phone.
• Never rely on the help of strangers to retrieve a confiscated card.
• Keep close tabs on your day-to-day account activity, and immediately report any fraudulent or suspicious withdrawals.

You want a new nickname, a new logo, a new mascot and perhaps a new color scheme.
Amazingly, a town famous for fighting change at every turn is nearly universally behind this one. A Nola.com poll asked whether new owner Tom Benson should change the Hornets’ name, and more than 86 percent of the 5,035 respondents said yes.
It’s far from a done deal. A full rebranding of the franchise will take time — and a lot of money. Industry experts estimate such change could cost as much as $10 million. We’re talking stadium signs, marketing and promotional material. Everything must be rebranded, and it’ll take a lot of jersey sales to make up for the added expense.
Under normal circumstances, the NBA requires a minimum of two years’ notice for a franchise to rebrand. The league’s merchandising and marketing arms need reasonable notice to redesign the uniforms. So even if Benson and his executives decide to do this, it likely won’t become a reality before 2014.
Benson’s management team would be wise to consider the rebranding job the New Jersey Nets unveiled Monday.
Whether you’re gaga over the spartan urban look or not, you can’t argue with the strategy behind it. The logo and color scheme are unique and culturally significant. The new brand identity honors the New York City subway signs of 1957, when Brooklyn last claimed a major league franchise. The black-and-white color scheme is an ode to the famous tile patterns in the subway stations.
The Hornets’ rebranding needs to be planned just as carefully because you only get one chance to do this — and it must be done right. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Washington Wizards both made knee-jerk changes in recent years and have since returned to their original color schemes.
It makes no sense to make a change unless it’s going to be something original and positive.
There’s been talk of changing the color scheme to the Saints’ black and gold combination. In my mind, that would be a mistake.
The Hornets need to be treated as a separate entity. They aren’t, as one executive said recently, “Saints Light.” They need their own distinctive look just as the Celtics, Patriots and Red Sox do in Boston.
Besides, the black-and-gold colors aren’t naturally New Orleans. They were picked by original Saints owner John Mecom Jr. to honor his father’s Texas oil business. And while there’s no denying the local appeal to the color scheme, it doesn’t scream New Orleans the way, say, purple, green and gold do.
I would rather see the team keep its Mardi Gras-themed NOLA uniforms instead of adopting a black-and-gold scheme. It might work in Pittsburgh, but when did we ever copy anything from the Steel City?
New Orleans is a city of diversity, pageantry and excessiveness. What it isn’t about is uniformity.
The name change is a much more lively discussion. Scores of new names have been suggested since Benson made known his intentions last month. Some industrious fans have even gone so far as to submit graphic designs of logos and uniform schemes.
So far, few have stuck out, and most aren’t any better than “the Hornets.” Many are too provincial or obscure to be viable, and some are just downright silly.
I love the double entendre of the New Orleans Bounce, but I seriously doubt Benson does, despite his history of boogieing.
Of the scores of candidates, only one name I’ve seen so far catches my eye. Dukes has gained some currency in local circles, and it’s starting to grow on me.
It’s one of the few names that meets all the criteria of any name change: class, uniqueness and cultural significance.
La Nouvelle-Orleans was named in 1718 for Philippe II, who was the Duke of Orleans and the Regent of France at the time.
Another duke, Alexis Romanov, the Grand Duke of Russia, is believed to be responsible for the Mardi Gras colors of purple, green and gold. During his visit to New Orleans in 1872, the men of Rex adopted the Romanov family colors of purple, green and gold, which represented justice, faith and power.
And most Carnival krewes feature dukes in their courts.
Moreover, like the Saints, no other professional club owns the Dukes nickname. The Albuquerque Dukes were a minor league baseball team from 1972 to 2000. Since 2003, they’ve been called the Isotopes.
So Dukes is there for the taking. I can already see the marketing possibilities for the Dunkin’ Dukes and the Dancin’ Duchesses cheerleaders.
New Orleans could do much worse than Dukes. Whether Tom Benson thinks so is the $10 million question.

Abstract (Summary)The overall aim of the study is to describe and explain the formation and organisation of interactive media production in Sweden from the 1990s to the end of 2003, the period of the so-called IT boom and crash, through the development of a theoretical model and gathering of empirical material.In the theory, interactive media production is conceptualised as a practice in part taking place on a social field structured according to the division and integration of labour within and between firms, and logics and status. It is argued that social fields are formed through the entrepreneurial realisation of opportunity structures resting in pre-existing structural configurations, and through the allocation of resources. The organisational outcome is explained by the structural preconditions, aspects of formation (what, who, how) and firms’ demands for stability and flexibility, creating a set of interrelated positions that firms might occupy.Empirical data has been collected from four firm and one individual level survey aimed at interactive media producers in Sweden, conducted between 1997 and 2003. A second data source consists of 8,000 news articles and items focussed on IT and interactive media in Sweden. Third, visual analyses of web sites of firms producing interactive media solutions have been conducted. Finally, interviews with people active within the field have been made.The results show that the formation of interactive media production in Sweden should be understood in relation to the Swedish economic crisis of the early 1990s, visions of IT, and beliefs in a societal transition to a new economy and knowledge society. These ideas contributed to allocating massive resources, e.g. state initiatives, increased demands and investment capital, to those producers of interactive media solutions that came to be symbols of the new economy. The abundance of resources caused a rapid growth of firms engaged in interactive media production and a financialisation that led to a speculative bubble and a stock market crash, eventually making the social field dissolve.The majority of firms that produce interactive media solutions are small and reach flexibility and stability by having a large proportion of permanently employed skilled workers and extensively participating in collaborations with other firms, including customers. The division and integration of labour follows the logics and clusters of activities that structure the social field: techno¬logy, aesthetics and economy. A large proportion of Swedish organisations have further developed inhouse interactive media operations that taken together are larger than the more visible so-called Internet consultants.

Kevin Price from Renew America writes, "If you know of Ronald Reagan, you are likely to be aware of his 'three legged stool.' Reagan developed a success formula to build winning coalitions that was as simple as it was brilliant. A sample of that simplicity and one of the hallmarks of Reagan's policies was his 'three 'the military' leg. They believe that just as the government has gotten suspicious in its domestic spending, it has also lost its bearings when it comes to defense and has found itself being internationalists with muscle. Essentially, 'the three legged stool' is being replaced by a pogo stick. A single area of interest and concern — the economy, being the springboard for political success."
Price concludes, "The reality is the 'three:

I believe the real reason the GOP wants to promote a Christie ticket is because he maybe the only candidate of THEIR choice that wouldn't cave under Hillary's thumbs, nothing more nothing less.
President Ronald Reagan was A Constitutional Conservative!..................... Period!
Chris Christie is just another example ,of the GOP making the Choice, instead ,of the People. Christie has proved he will "go along to get along", we all saw him do it, embracing Obama, right in the most crucial part of the Election. Fat Boy, you cannot play both sides of the street, you are transparently open to whoredom, to the highest Bidder. We have a Country to save and preserve, and we need a person of Person of Unchanging prinicples. You are a Wolf in Sheep's clothing, and we know it.
Thanks. Christie is not conservative.

The scent of Truefitt and Hill’s lavender is, a decent enough rendition of lavender, however I think it might be a bit too sweet for my tastes. That having been said, it’s been quite a while since I’ve smelled actual lavender, so I’m not completely sure whether or not it’s an inaccuracy or not.
Strength-wise, it started off as one of those few soaps that were too strong (sickly even) when first applied to the face, but it faded swiftly enough during the course of the shave, and there was also some noticeable fading between shaves as well.
I didn’t have quite as good of an experience, lather-wise, with the Lavender than I did with other previous Truefitt and Hill. I wasn’t quite able to hit the sweet spot for ideal water content on either of my test shaves, and ended up overshooting and using something that was a bit too runny both days. In comparison to other Truefitt and Hill creams that I’ve tried, this would be good rather than great.
- 8/10 Scent Pleasantness
- 7/10 Scent Strength
- 8/10 Lather Quality (reflects new scoring as outlined here)
Overall, I give it a 7/10. Ok all-around, but nothing spectacular. Worth a shot if you really like lavender (although you should probably try it anyways just because you should probably try everything in the Truefitt and Hill sampler pack).
- Cost: $10.50 for a sample pack of 14 of their shaving creams, aftershave balms, and the pre-shave oil. Another 9 bucks gets you a sample of each of their colognes as well. $30 for a 190g tub of the cream, or $22 for a 75g tube.
Gear used:
- Brush: Ecotools Kabuki Finishing Brush
- Razor: Edwin Jagger DE81BL (Red)
- Blade: Bolzano Superinox
- Scuttle: Robert’s Feats of Clay #4
Ingredients: Water, Stearic Acid, Mystric Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut Acid, Glycerin, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, CI-15510, CI-17200, CI-42090, CI-60725.
Surprising about slow lather. All other T H creams I’ve used we’re super. I’ll have to try my lavender sample soon and see first hand.
Ok, this gave me a reason to pull out my T&H lavender sample this morning. Overall a positive experience.
First, I compared the texture of the lavender to a pinch from a tub of T&H lime, and there were no huge differences other than the pastel color of each. Same consistencies.
I only lathered up the lavender, using perhaps a little less than half of the sample, in a small metal shave bowl. Lather developed just fine, much like other T&H creams. The scent was nice but subtle, After about 30 sec, I had to add another 2 tsp of warm water to the bowl and do a few swirls with the loaded brush. And same again after yet another 30 sec, At that point, the lather was full, firm and slick. On first pass, the scent remained subtle. On second pass, the lather remained firm, just a few random bubbles, not runny at all; the floral scent was recognizable but still subtle. When cleaning up the face, the lather left a smoothness characteristic of the other T&H creams I’ve used. I’d easily give it an 8.
Fair enough. I definitely try for consistency, but it’s possible that I just had an off day both times I shaved with this.

By now you've no doubt heard about Foundry, one of three new battlegrounds that make up the Halo 3 Heroic Map Pack. This large voluminous warehouse is fashioned after the industrial spaces seen in the town of Voi during the Halo 3 campaign ("The Storm"). By default, Foundry is a great small to medium sized map that promotes some pretty frantic close quarters gameplay. But, beneath the surface, Foundry has much more to offer when combined with the power of Forge and a huge variety of brand new objects.Last week we invited members of the media to come to Bungie and get some hands-on time with all three maps prior to their release. After methodically dissecting and playing through games on all three maps, the latter part of the day was more free flowing with an emphasis on Forge editing, particularly in Foundry. As friends from EGM, IGN, Gamespot, Team Xbox, Halo.Bungie.Org, Tied the Leader and others fiddled around with custom games, I took a seat at one empty station and began work on my own masterpiece.As I mentioned above, Bungie has added a slew of new objects to the Forge palette for Foundry. You now have the ability to place and configure large objects like walls, stairs and ramps to literally craft your own unique multiplayer space. You can even place your own mancannons and shield doors. However, as cool as these items are, it's the wacky addition of a giant soccer ball that garnered the most attention from our visitors. And why not... after all, why on Earth would we include a gigantic ball in a sci-fi futurisitc shooter? Why not?Of course a soccer ball is no good without a proper field to play on so that's what I set out to create on Foundry. I had heard of various people within the studio goofing around with soccer type games but prior to this press visit I had never experienced it myself nor had I gotten much hands-on time with Foundry and Forge. Much to my surprsie, my new map came together quick and turned out to be really fun. Here's what I did...Step One - Cut a Hole in the BoxOk, well it's not so much cutting a hole as clearing out every default object that appears in the map. I set out to remove every wall, weapon and spawn point until I was left with one big giant empty warehouse. We'll save you the trouble of having to do that when we add empty versions of all three maps to Bungie Favorites next week.
By default, Foundry comes fully equipped for intense close quarters gameplay.
Once the level was clear I decided to wall off the back portion of the map, leaving one big square area for my 'field.' Initially I used fencing to create this barrier but once we started playing, it was only a matter of minutes before players were knocked over the wall into the out-of-play area. I solved this in real-time during the game by having my monitor drop a grav lift behind each wall so players could easily get back into the fray. In version 2, I simply made the walls a lot taller to avoid that problem all together.Step Two - Put Your Junk in the BoxOnce I had my general area setup it, it was time to add some objects back into the map and make it more functional. First up we needed some goals. One of the objects in the Forge palette is a "Fence Box" which, when turned on it's side, makes a perfect soccer goal. I placed once at each end of the map in the middle of the wall.I wanted to visually designate which goal was used for which team so I dropped in another new Forge object, "Sign A" and "Sign B." I put on one top of each goal. The "Sign B" is colored red, so, that became the Red Team goal.Next I had an idea to try and use Mancannons to faciliate corner kicks and as a means of speeding up the game and keeping the ball from getting jammed up in the corners. I dropped a Mancannon in each corner, all pointing outwards towards the center of the map (at a 45 degree angle). For aesthetics I added some orange cones on the sideline and set up the spawn points along the perimeter of my "field." Initially this was all I did to create my masterpiece but once the game started, I had another idea - how about dropping a Portable Cover equipment item for each team to use while playing goalie. It worked kind of well so I decided to make those a default part of my map - now one Portable Cover appears inside each goal.Lastly, I dropped one gigantic soccer ball in the middle of the map. Now we're just about ready to play....
Behold - The UNSC Spartan Soccer Facility.
Step 3 - Make her open the...ahh hell, just make the GametypeThere are tons of ways you could elect to actually play Spartan Soccer but here's how I set it up. The game itself is actually taking place within Forge. From the lobby, I made some quick edits to the Player Traits for the game (press X in the Forge lobby to bring up these options). The first change was to make players invulnerable to damage. We wanted to do this to allow the underlying Soccer game to be the focus and not have people dying and respawning all the time. However, this means that you can still assasinate players with strategically placed melee attacks (a strategy that would later prove quite useful). Primary weapon was changed to the Gravity Hammer. Swinging your hammer is the primary means of moving the ball around the map. Secondary weapon was none and I also removed starting grenades.Initially I didn't make this change but in retrospect, I think it may be more fun to also make some slight adjustments to the Player Speed as well. Fiddle with this to your own liking but a small speed boost will probably make the action on the field a bit more intense.Step 4 - Game On!Finally I saved everything and we were ready to play. We played the game with two teams of three and then myself acting as the referee (as a Forge monitor). This worked out really well. As the monitor I would grab the ball and drop it down in the middle, sort of like a game of Foosball, and from there things got crazy.
The red and blue teams started wildly swinging their hammers, pushing the ball across the field. It was cool to see the "corner kick" Mancannons come into play almost immediately. In fact, it later became a big strategic objective as some players made end-to-end goals by carefully hitting the ball into the cannons or feeding it to the shooter who waited in front of the opponent's goal. At the very least, it provides a really fast way to get the ball up field to your teammates.The Portable Cover equipment can be picked up by a member of each team and deployed as a last ditch effort to thwart a score. This actually worked quite well in our game. When a team scored, the monitor flies over and picks up the ball to reset the play again. At one point there was some controversy on the field and we decided a penalty was in order. You know those signs I mentioned earlier? Well, they happen to be Yellow and Red so I dropped a big sign ontop of the offending player, the Halo 3 equivalent of issuing a Yellow Card in a game. Totally unnecessary but totally hilarious.I also highly recommend that the referee/monitor also provides humorous play-by-play during the match along with yelling "GOOOOOAAAAALLLLLL!!!!!" when a score is finally made.Step 5 - Make it Your OwnThe great thing about Forge is that there are just so many possibilities to explore. As our game progressed, we experimented with some different concepts. What if we tried to play Polo instead of Soccer? I dropped a few Mongeese onto the map and the teams tried to drive around, pushing the ball and swinging a hammer from the Brokeback seat. I thought the concept was great but it didn't seem to work out quite as I had envisioned. We tried some Ghosts as well, which definitely spiced things up.I also thought it may be fun to have a rocket launcher available to each team for a shooter to take a long distance shot from across the field. Nobody really managed to line up a good shot at the ball thoug so it didnt' really work out in our tests. Other ideas that came up were experimenting with another Mancannon at each goal, the "Goal Kick" if you will. Maybe the defender could throw flare in the face of an attacker. Mabye a few precariously placed Fusion Coils could up the ante.While we had a great time playing OUR verison of Spartan Soccer, the point is that you can create any similar or wildly different experience on your own. We tried a quick Basketball variation as well - turning the "Fence Box" on it's back so it made a big square bucket and then placing Mancannons on the perimeter to take shots. It has potential but finding the right distance and placement of the Mancannons will take some work. In just a few days you can try all of this and more when Foundry and the Halo 3 Heroic Map Pack are released on Xbox LIVE Marketplace. Now, if only real soccer involved armor clad players and giant hammers, I could finally get into the "world's most popular sport." Until then, you can find me online - I'll be the striker with the flaming head bending it like Beck.Hand Painted Signs by Caetano Calomino

Tebow Debuts
Written by Tim Hoffman Monday, 16 August 2010 11:27
Tim Tebow debuted yesterday and made a big impact, at least in terms of people talking about his 3rd string performance as if it was anything special. A 8/13 statline for 108 yards with no passing TDs and no interceptions, matches him up favorably with just about any 3rd string QB going against a 3rd string defense so far this preseason.
He was about as good as a J.T. O'Sullivan, Patrick Ramsey, or a Jimmy Clausen were yesterday. But you'd never know it from hearing all the media talk about how not-shitty he looked...What's On

Leadership qualities earn young firefighter annual honor
Chris McClendon was named the Tonganoxie Fire Department’s fireman of the year at the department’s recent annual banquet. The 22-year-old Tonganoxie man was selected for the leadership role he has assumed with other young firefighters in the department. McClendon is also a volunteer on the Reno Township Fire Department.
Chris McClendon views his work as a volunteer for two local fire departments as more than another part-time job.
“It’s definitely a lifestyle,” the 22-year-old Tonganoxie man said. “It’s more than a job — 100 percent, it’s a lifestyle.
“You have to come down here to make sure the truck is ready to go. If you go to a fire in the middle of the night, that doesn’t mean you don’t have to go to work the next morning.”
McClendon has been a volunteer firefighter with the Tonganoxie Fire Department for just more than two years and has had the same position with the Reno Township Fire Department for more than a year.
His commitment to serve on two departments while working a 40-hour-a-week job with a Kansas City, Mo., tool and die company speaks to his dedication and ambition as a firefighter. It is a commitment that others have noticed.
McClendon was honored as the Tonganoxie Fire Department’s firefighter of the year at the department’s annual banquet Dec. 10.
Tonganoxie Fire Chief Dave Bennett said he and the department’s officers selected McClendon because of the example he set to other new firefighters.
“For being a young firefighter, he has taken a leadership role with the younger guys,” Bennett said. “He’s helped guide the younger generation with how we do things.
“He’s an extremely hard worker. A lot of people don’t know after we have a fire call, we have two-and-a-half hours of work back at the fire station. He is always one of the last ones to leave.”
It’s work that has to be done, McClendon said.
“It’s kind of routine,” he said. “You’ve got to get the truck back together before you can go on the next run.”
It was work he didn’t anticipate when he joined the department, McClendon said. As a green rookie, he didn’t realize just what would be involved, he said.
“I knew we would fight house fires, but I had no idea what we would be doing,” he said. “You never know what you are going to do, from running on a car wreck to helping somebody who has fallen down.”
Routine jobs are enjoyable because of the bonds he builds with other firefighters and the calls rewarding because he is helping others, McClendon said.
“I always like to go out and help people,” he said. “Obviously, that’s part of firefighting. I like the rush of fighting fires. But at the same time, you are helping people.”
McClendon has completed firefighting 1 and 2 and two hazardous materials courses and finished classes for emergency medical training, although he hasn’t yet taken the written test needed for certification. Once he passes that test, he will be eligible to work paid shifts for the Tonganoxie Fire Department.
His goal as a firefighter goes beyond that accomplishment.
“I’d like to maybe work my way up to be a full-time firefighter,” McClendon said. “I’d like to grow into more of a leadership role. We have lieutenants, captains and chiefs in the departments. I’d like to be an officer one day.”
Those are realistic goals, Bennett said.
“I told him at the banquet he has what it takes to make this a lifelong career,” he said. “He’s worked extremely hard, and he’s getting more education.”
McClendon said he has no idea how many hours he gives the two fire departments each week. He is careful to ration time for his wife, Jessica, and will have to make adjustments when the couple’s first child arrives in May, he said.
But his wife, the daughter of Tonganoxie firefighter Bill Derzinski, understands the commitment required of a volunteer firefighter and is confident he can manage the risk involved.
“She’s pretty happy for me doing it,” he said. “She wanted me to do it all along. I really didn’t have anything in mind, so I agreed to go for it. I decided I like it.
“It’s something I’m going to try to stay with.”

SHIMOGA: Principal District and Sessions Judge Vijay Siriyannavar said here on Thursday that the two Lok Adalat camps would be held here on September 23 and October 28 to mark the Suvarna Karnataka year for the amicable settlement of protracted litigations through negotiations.
Speaking to presspersons, he said that it had been proposed to dispose of at least one thousand litigations in each of these camps.
Cases pertaining to vehicle accidents in addition to 300 land acquisition cases under the Tunga and Upper Tunga irrigation projects would be taken up. He said the Lok Adalats would be helpful in disposing of 63,850 cases, which had been pending. He said 2,430 criminal and 2,644 civil cases apart from 4,836 motor vehicle accident cases were disposed of during the 29 Lok Adalats held in the district in 2005-2006. Compensation amounting to Rs. 99.71 lakh was paid to claimants in the cases.

Earlier this year, Australia made changes to their time zones that required a completely new JRE. Then, the US announced time zone changes for 2007 that required a completely new JRE...unless of course you don't mind reporting incorrect time during the affected periods.
I expected there might be some grumbling about the fact that you had to update an entire JRE just to update some exchangeable time zone data. For those that ignored the message the first time, your job just got easier. Sun just announced a beta version of a tool that will update the time zone data in place.. Hey, that's good news right?
More information about the tzupdater tool is available on the Sun Developer Network site. You can also download the tool on the Java SE downloads page.
This is still beta software, so you might want to test it on a non-critical system first. One caveat is that it only works with JREs provided by Sun.

Met Gala 2014: Gloves Get Some Red-Carpet Love
If the glove fits, the fashion pack will wear it. That’s the message received from this year’s Met Gala, where a handful of attendees were spotted sporting the elegant accessory.
PHOTOS: The Top 10 Best-Dressed at Met Gala
Channeling the signature glamour of the late couturier Charles James, whose designs inspired the ball’s theme this year, Tory Burch accented her sky-blue ball gown with opera gloves in white, as did Sarah Jessica Parker, who rocked them with her dramatic black-and-white Oscar de la Renta dress.
Dakota Johnson looked effortlessly chic in a midnight blue Jason Wu number and black elbow-length gloves, while Karlie Kloss opted for an edgy leather pair (over which she wore a knuckle-dusting diamond ring), to complement her dramatic black-and-gold Oscar de la Renta confection.
What do you think? of that without really interacting with other kids.
A couple of times he came running towards me with the beginnings of a crying face, though there was nothing wrong as far as I could tell. After the second time he did this, I realized he was doing so because he was hearing other babies crying. “Crap,” I thought, “The crying is contagious now.” But, then a few minutes later, as we were sitting down to eat a snack, something interesting happened.
A little baby girl, probably around 9 or 10 months old, was sitting on the floor and began to cry. Baby boy looked her way, then looked at me pointing to her. “She’s ok,” I told him. But, he continued pointing her way and started to go towards her beginning to cry as well. This time, though, he went up to her and patted the little girl’s back. My baby boy was trying to comfort her!
I realized the crying he was doing due to other babies crying wasn’t because the crying was contagious. He was crying out of sympathy! Another mom sitting nearby us with her 15-month-old boy said her little brother used to do the same when they were younger. He would cry whenever she cried.
I’ve noticed that the last few times my baby girl has been upset, her little brother looked at her and then started making up his face to cry as well. I just never put it all together until I saw him in action with another baby. My little baby boy is sympathetic! Sweet, isn’t it?!
Did your younger children do something similar with their older siblings?

Aw that is so sweet!
Thanks!
Aww that is very sweet. My son did the same thing for a little while till he figured out he can comfort by a hug or saying it’s ok. It’s sweet to see caring children
It’s absolutely adorable! I love seeing them get the emotion and that someone needs comforting, even if it’s by mimicking the emotion himself.SV8807 : Horse Point (The Mare)

So does the executive director of the D.C. lottery.
"That would be a challenge to our ability to continue to raise additional revenue,” says Buddy Roogow, the lottery official. “We just have to be as innovative as possible in order to maintain our own position."
He notes that the D.C. lottery has suffered a big drop in sales in recent years, accelerated when D.C. lost exclusive rights to Powerball. But last year finally ticked up a bit.
Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker has said that he would like to see casino gambling at National Harbor, but there is widespread opposition and so it by no means a done deal.
After all, about $65 million a year goes to the D.C. treasury and about half of D.C.'s lottery players are from Maryland and Virginia.
One D.C. resident and lottery player says he'd like to see the casino open in National Harbor.
"I'm for it - I ain’t hitting nothing in D.C. now,” says William Gipson. “Try something new."

“I know that Senate Bill 136 is a statewide bill, but in particular Lake Lanier, because of the urbanization of the area and the encroachment in direct relationship with Atlanta, we have an over population, especially on holidays,” said Sen. Renee Unterman, R-Buford. “Unfortunately, we’ve had several instances of boating accidents and boating drownings.”
The bill is formally named for three child victims in those accidents. Kile Glover and Jake and Griffin Prince.
It would place age limits on those who can drive boats and requires boaters born after 1997 to take free, online training or submit to a briefing even to rent a vessel.
Because half of boating fatalities involve drinking, the bill would drop the legal blood-alcohol from .10 to 0.8 to match the level for driving an automobile drunk. For consistency, the bill also lowers the level for illegal hunting while drunk.
The sponsors of the bill, working with Gov. Nathan Deal, also expanded the age for mandatory life jackets on a moving boat from 10 to 13..”Hourly JobAs Needed

Universal, Sony, EMI and Warner had sued Soto in 2008 in an attempt to shut down file-sharing applications powered by his Manolito P2P protocol, also requesting €13 million ($17.01 million USD) in damages. They were joined in their efforts by the local music rights group Promusicae, which now announced it will appeal the ruling. Soto, on the other hand, has said he wants to go after the labels and sue them for damages for wrongful prosecution.
The plaintiffs tried to blame Soto for copyright infringement committed by his users, pointing out his apps didn’t provide a proper mechanism to filter out copyrighted works. The court rejected this argument, however, and found P2P itself is neutral, according to a report from the Spanish newspaper El Mundo.
Pablo Soto may not be as famous as Shawn Fanning, but the Spanish P2P developer made some headlines when he briefly teamed up with the former Grokster CEO Wayne Rosso, who most recently was involved in an unsuccessful bid to buy The Pirate Bay. However, efforts to take Blubster worldwide and follow in the footsteps of KaZaA and LimeWire failed; the file sharing application never gained a lot of traction in the U.S.She’s a deity who tends to cause a little confusion. Even we at Godchecker were more baffled than usual and had to visit the Well of Urd for some answers.
However, our tireless research has come up with the following facts: FRIGG is ODIN’s wife and mother of BALDUR, who she tried her best to save from a gruesome mistletoe-based death. As Queen of ASGARD, she seems quite a sassy lady, keeps ODIN in check and usually gets her way (unless mistletoe is involved).
FRIGG knows everybody’s destiny, but will never reveal it. She is also in charge of housekeeping on a big scale. She rides a broom and sweeps away clouds when they pile up. Sort of air traffic control for the Gods. Or could it be something to do with witchcraft?

The Pet Adoption and Welfare Society of Carteret’s (PAWS) Thrift Store, currently located at 1211 Bridges St. in Morehead City, plans to relocate during the first quarter of 2013, according to a PAWS news release.
The new location will be 3010 Arendell St., formerly the site of Shoney’s and New Dawn restaurants.
A storewide sale of 50-percent off is currently underway in an effort to eliminate the existing inventory prior to the move.
PAWS said the new location will provide many advantages, including frontage on Arendell Street, spacious parking, more retail sales space and a much larger area to receive and sort donations.
PAWS Thrift Store was established in 2002 and is the main source of revenue for all of PAWS rescue and rehabilitation efforts for less fortunate animals in Carteret County. PAWS also operates a dog park and is currently raising funds toward the construction of its own animal shelter.
PAWS is an all-volunteer operated nonprofit organization and relies entirely on private donations.

Fredi Gonzalez has thrown around the idea of going to a six-man rotation for part of the Braves upcoming 20 game stretch. After a day off Thursday, the team does not have another day off until August 30. If this change were to happen, it wouldn’t come into effect until Tommy Hanson returns from the DL. Hanson is eligible to return August 15.
First, I wanted to briefly touch on some of the thoughts and theories of going to a six-man rotation. While many of these may not fully apply because it is only a short-term plan, it is interesting to get a general idea of the pros and cons. There are two types of six man rotations. One where a team has a standard rotation where one starter follows the next in a continuous cycle and the other where they use the sixth guy as a plug-in and keep the top starter(s) on a conventional four-day rest schedule. In the Braves case, they would be using the former. There is continuing debate whether six-man rotations are effective or optimal in some situations. Here is a good read from Sports Illustrated’s Joe Sheehan and his case against them. There are also various findings and a section of “The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball” that discuss the “recovery period” through large sampled studies using advanced metrics. Here is what their study concluded,
“Pitchers perform best with five days of rest, and worst with three days of rest. To manage our entire starting rotation effectively, four days of rest seems to be the optimal point. The current MLB pattern and scheduling the starting rotation works.”
You can see why there is a strong push against this type of rotation, a team shouldn’t give their sixth starter the same amount of starts as their best pitcher. It just doesn’t makes sense. As Sheehan puts it, “this is a horrible way to run a business, taking opportunities from your best and giving them to your worst.” Complied with the findings from “The Book”, that a pitcher actually performs better with four days of rest, there is no reason to change what is optimal.
Jeff Shultz, of the AJC, wrote a great article which introduced the discussion of a short-term six-man rotation. Gonzalez later revealed he is considering it, so it definitely warrants discussion. I wanted to talk about a couple of points Schultz made in the article before I get to my own.
“Tim Hudson has bone spurs in his ankle. He already has received two cortisone injections. The rest would help.” I agree here than an aging pitcher can always use extra rest, especially Hudson who has dealt with some nagging injuries in 2012. The Braves need Hudson healthy down the stretch.
“Ben Sheets has started four games after not pitching in two years. Wear and fatigue could be issues.” Sheets has been injured every year since 2003. Again, giving him an extra day in between starts probably can’t hurt. I’m not overly worried with the fatigue because he won’t all of a sudden be throwing 200 innings again. I’m just not sure if an extra day between starts for a couple of weeks would prevent an injury if one were to happen.
“Paul Maholm would be taken out of his every-fifth-day rhythm. If you consider that potentially catastrophic, raise your hand. (Anybody?)” See above. Catastrophic, no. Some effect, maybe.
“Mike Minor has long surpassed his career single-season high with 116 2/3 innings (he threw 82.2 last year). Another off day should be welcomed.” Minor threw 156 innings (AA/AAA/MLB) in 2010 and 183.1 innings in 2011 (AAA/MLB). Not sure why he only quoted MLB innings here because innings thrown in the Minors still count. As for 2012, he has currently thrown 122.2 innings and ZIPS projects him to throw 55 more for the rest of the season (178.7 total). As you can see that is less than last year. I see this as a non-issue.
“Medlen isn’t going to complain.” He never does.
“Hanson is in no position to complain.” Agree.
I agree with most of the points Schultz makes. There are definitely a lot of pros that push up against the theory of six-man rotations being less effective. The main reason I would be in agreement with a six-man rotation is the fact that the Braves really don’t have a true number one pitcher. All their pitchers are very similar and there is not much separation between one and six. They do not have a Cain or Greinke (ugh) or any number one starter that they would be skipping or taking away starts from. I also believe that the extra rest that Hudson and Hanson would cancel out any minimal drop off in production that “The Book” would suggest. Maybe the Braves would consider a plug-in sixth man around Hudson and maybe Hanson. I don’t believe the Braves will jumble up the rotation that much however. Further, in the case of another injury they would not have to stretch out Medlen again, assuming he would be the one rejoin the bullpen. He has been great as a starter thus far.
Another problem than can be found with going to a six man rotation is the lack of another arm in the bullpen or player off the bench. Using nearly a quarter of your roster to a starting rotation is not all that wise. I would keep the bullpen as is and send down a bench player. This player would most likely be Tyler Pastonicky (or Hinske, but that would never happen). It would leave the Braves without a true back-up shortstop, but Prado could fill the role if needed. This is not ideal, but it is better than losing arms to come in at the end of games.
As you can see this isn’t just adding another guy to the rotation. There are a lot of little factors that go this decision that could potentially change ones stance on the situation. Taking everything into account, I think it would be a good short-term play for the next 20 games (15 if Hanson comes back on schedule.) While I normally wouldn’t support a six-man rotation, for two weeks I think it can be beneficial to the team.

The Best of Hawaii was truly a wonderful adventure with Tauck and our superb tour director, Minna. We were treated like royalty with our hotels and extras from Minna. The reason I travel with Tauck is to see it all and experience the essence of a location. Our Hawaii trip was a nice blend of activities and free time.

We enjoyed our visits to the 4 islands on this tour, but were surprised to find that there were 43 of us on a bus. I was not expecting such a large group, and would not have booked the tour had I known that.
Our TD, Jeff, was excellent. Hotels and meals wonderful, and nice people.
On Oahu, we loved the outrigger canoe ride. Lots of fun! The luau was first class, with excellent entertainment, and good food. Due to rough surf, we missed the catamaran sail, which was disappointing, but couldn't be helped. But my best moments were simply watching whales and waves. Totally relaxing!
Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We are so pleased you enjoyed your overall journey and experienced so many wonderful memories. Your comments will be shared with our management and we look forward to hosting you on many future tours.

Our tour director was truly a Tauck treasure! Tauck moved us easily from island to island with a good balance of sightseeing and time to enjoy the resorts. Highlights were the Iolani Palace tour and welcome dinner, the outrigger canoe ride on Waikiki, the helicopter trip in Kaui, the trip up Haleakula, and the catamaran sunset sail.
It is hard to choose- between the outrigger canoe ride and the helicopter tour of Kaui.
We are so glad you enjoyed your journey to Hawaii! Thank you for your patronage.

Everything about this trip was spectacular - from the lei greeting at the airport followed by the limo ride to the Royal Hawaiian to the 5 star hotels and restaurants throughout the trip. Our tour guide was beyond terrific and made the trip effortless for us all. Every aspect of the tour was first class and memorable.
Hard to choose between the helicopter rides, the outrigger canoe experience, the cooking demo at Ruth's Chris or just the wonderful accommodations and restaurants we were able to enjoy. The scenery is both beautiful and varied. A trip not to be missed.

This was our second Tauck Tour, so we knew it would be special. Our tour director was excellent and he helped my husband and I schedule horsebackriding and a helicopter on the same day when we were in Kauai. We had no worries and were surprised how busy we were. Our favorite hotel was the Grand Hyatt and favorite island was Maui.
This is difficult to answer, but if I had to think on one moment, it would be the outrigger canoe ride in Oahu. We enjoyed all the other guests too - between our tour guide and the other people, we had a lot of fun.
We are so glad you had such a wonderful time in Hawaii - it truly is paradise! Thank you for your patronage.

A year ago I would have never believed I could do that. The feeling of accomplishment when I crossed that finish line was amazing and addicting. I decided right then and there that I was going to do more of these races. I have since signed up for two additional races in the next two months. I want to see if I can beat my previous race time. I keep thinking of how great it would be if there was one place that would track my progress so that when I have completed 3 or 4 races, I could look at all of the results and compare them to each other. This would tell me instantly if I had improved or not. The best I can do right now is manually track the results. I’m going to look into a comparison site for my races, but lucky for you Benchmark Email has recognized the importance of doing side by side comparisons with Real-Time Campaign Reports.

Either it comes on after separation of the modules prior to retrofire, or after pushing two distinctive buttons on the panel. But there has been no separation command, and the crew has not engaged the autoland program aboard the spacecraft. It is probably an electrical glitch, but there is a serious danger of proceeding with the autoland sequence if there is a short in the spacecraft somewhere. Kamanin tells Filipchenko not to get excited and await instructions from the ground. In Moscow and Yevpatoriya experts analyse the situation, pouring over electrical logic diagrams. After long debate they unanimously declare that the erroneous signal does not endanger the landing.
The autoland sequence cannot proceed without module separation occurring first. The cosmonauts are calmed, but still warned that the light may an indication of some larger fault. However in the event the landing proceeds normally. At 19:30 that evening the first practical demonstration of communications with Soyuz 8 via the Molniya transponder satellite is made.

Originally the Xbox One and PS4 versions of The Elder Scrolls Online were supposed to launch in jJune, but now it seems we won’t see them until around Christmas time.
Apparently publisher Bethesda and developer ZeniMax have pushed back the console launch to allow time to “solve a series of unique problems specific to those platforms.
“It has become clear that our planned June release of the console versions isn’t going to be possible. Though we have made great progress, we have concluded that we’ll need about six months to ensure we deliver the experience our fans expect and deserve,” said Bethesda in a statement to CVG.

If you purchase the PC or Mac version of The Elder Scrolls Online before the end of June, you’ll be able to transfer your character to the Xbox One or PS4 version when they are released.
You won’t have to pay full price for the Xbox One or PS4 version if you do this either. For $20 (£12) you can add the full, digital version of the console edition to your membership with an additional 30 days of game time.
“Whether you decide to take advantage of this offer or not, we promise to do everything we can to get the game released on both consoles as quickly as we can. We will keep everyone updated with additional details regarding characters transfers, specific offer dates and when you can expect console beta to start, and of course, when ESO on both consoles will launch.”

Ontario bishops scramble to make McGuinty’s ‘anti-bullying’ law fit with Catholic faith
THUNDER BAY, Ontario, June 8, 2012 (LifeSiteNews.com) – Catholic bishops in Ontario are scrambling to figure out how Catholic schools can remain true to Catholic teaching on sexual morality while at the same time abiding by McGuinty’s new law that forces the schools to open their doors to Gay-Straight Alliance (GSAs) clubs, which have close ties to the homosexualist political agenda.
Immediately after Bill 13 passed on Tuesday, the Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Ontario observed that they had expressed “serious concerns” regarding “certain aspects” of the Accepting Schools Act, but nonetheless stated that they will “seek to foster safe and welcoming school communities” in a way that “is in accord with our faith.”
A leaked memo from the Ontario Catholic School Trustees Association (OCSTA) one day prior to the bill’s passage allegedly suggests that one way for Catholic schools to remain uncompromised in adherence to the Catholic faith would be for principals to “allow students to call a group a ‘GSA’ if such a request is made”, but that such a group would “be a subset of a larger group such as a ‘Respecting Difference’ or ‘Open Arms’ group”.
Respecting Differences, put out by the province’s bishops and Catholic trustees earlier this year, says that any anti-bullying clubs set up should be “respectful of and consistent with Catholic teaching” and that they should be led by a carefully selected staff advisor who “must know and be committed to Catholic teachings.” The document states that clubs are not be used for “activism, protest or advocacy of anything that is not in accord with the Catholic faith foundation of the school,” and all outside speakers must be “respectful” of Catholic teaching. The document also discourages public discussion of issues surrounding sexual attraction, encouraging private counseling instead for students who may be struggling with such issues.
“The Respecting Difference Resource created for Catholic schools provides guidelines for ensuring that student-led groups to combat bullying reflect Catholic values and adhere to Ministry guidelines,” the leaked memo states.

In a move that corresponds to the proposed strategy outlined in the leaked memo, Bishop Fred Colli of the Diocese of Thunder Bay said that while Catholic schools will now accept Gay-Straight Alliances, the clubs will nonetheless adhere to Catholic teaching on sexual morality.
“Everything we do in our schools, every part of our curriculum, always has a Catholic component to it,” he said to the Kenora Daily Miner and News on Tuesday.
.”
Bishop Colli also stated that GSA clubs in Catholic schools would require “qualified adults” who would supply “good support” to the student clubs so as to ensure that they reflect Catholic values.
“We will remind the students about the teachings of the Catholic church and about what the Catholic faith expects of them and also about what our Catholic values are, because that’s the basis of our schools,” Colli said to CBC News.
Bishop Collie sought to assuage the concerns of Catholic parents and pro-family leaders who have said that Gay-Straight-Alliances will be used to promote the acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle.
“We’re going to say the Catholic church is not going to endorse or support homosexual lifestyles because we don’t see it as a proper lifestyle or a morally good lifestyle for people,” he said to the Kenora Daily Miner and News.
.”
But Ontario Gay-Straight Alliances Coalition lawyer Doug Elliott told the Gay and Lesbian news service Xtra! that if Catholics “driven by the position of the Vatican” think they have found a loophole in the legislation, then they will be hauled before the courts.
“If the schools try to play games with kids…, the law is clear. We won’t put up with any of that crap come September,” said Elliott. “If you’re not complying with the law, then we’re going to take you to court. It’s that.For years it was known as spring break central. It’s also been called the Venice of America and, of course, the gateway to the Caribbean.

Build and maintain healthy bones with Cal-D-K Essentials.
Cal-D-K Essentials is ideal for women and men of all ages who are interested in building and maintaining healthy bones. Bone is a dynamic tissue that is continually being reabsorbed and replaced by new bone in a process called bone remodeling. An adequate intake of bone-building nutrients throughout your lifespan is essential to achieve optimal bone remodeling. Cal-D-K Essentials is specifically formulated to provide a full spectrum of the key nutrients that your body demands for optimum bone-building and bone-remodeling.
When it comes to your bone health, make the choice that provides more than calcium and vitamin d.
This premium formula features the following high-quality ingredients:
•Calcium is an essential mineral for human health. It plays an important role in providing sturdy structure to the bones and teeth.
•Vitamin d is a fat-soluble nutrient essential for human health. It helps build and maintain healthy bones by affecting calcium balance. For example, vitamin d regulates calcium levels in the body, enhances calcium absorption from foods, controls the amount of calcium lost from the body and keeps blood calcium levels steady.
•Vitamin k is an essential nutrient for human health and plays a role in promoting bone health. It works by activating several proteins that help build strong bones.
•Magnesium is a mineral essential for human health. In the body, it is found predominantly in the bone and plays an important role in calcium and bone metabolism and bone cell function.
•Copper, Manganese and Zinc are trace minerals essential for human health. Copper is a component of collagen (a protein that is part of the connective tissue in bones, ligaments, cartilage and skin). Manganese and zinc are essential parts of many enzymes in the body, including enzymes involved in bone metabolism.
•Boron is an emerging trace mineral that may play a role in calcium and vitamin d metabolism.
•Silicon is an emerging trace mineral that may play a role in the formation of collagen required for bone and connective tissue health.

Unique experience with technology and its application and development of heavy oil resources
Sonoro is a Toronto Venture Exchange Oil & Gas publicly traded company focused on unconventional resources. Sonoro and its partners hold exclusive exploration rights to asphalt/bitumen (referred to as “ghir” in Iraq) in the Salah ad Din Province pursuant to the Asphalt License (the “License”) with the Salah ad Din Provincial Government (the “Provincial Government”). Due to recent events, this project has been placed in “Force Majeure” in July 2014 and the Company is seeking new opportunities. The Company has access and experience with several new technologies related to heavy oil and enhancing its profitability to provide superior alternatives to conventional development.
The Company retains a 1% gross overriding royalty on previous technology developed and sold to a private company in 2014 involving a sonic reactor in various potential applications excluding heavy oil solvent de-asphalting.
The Company also has remaining interests and rights with heavy oil solvent de-asphalting which it sold to PetroSonic Energy Inc. in 2012.
Sonoro has provided notice of “Force Majeure” to the Provincial Government in Iraq until such time as the security situation stabilizes.
As the Salah ad Din License is under “force Majeure” the Company currently has no operations ongoing with regards to this License and Project.BY Christine Chan on Mon November 12th, 2012

Invasions of privacy aside, the job of being a royal comes with more than a few perks. Not only do royals get to hobnob with foreign dignitaries and heads of state (in the name of work), but they also receive scads of gifts while gallivanting around the world. And we’re not just talking medals and books — though they’ve been given their fair share of those.
It can’t be easy for the gift givers: What can you offer the royal who has everything? On Wednesday, Clarence House published official lists of the gifts received by the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry in 2013. While not all of them inspire envy, there are more than a few that stand out for creativity.
Brown leather flying jacket
It’s no secret President Obama has a thing for leather jackets, and it looks like first lady Michelle Obama likes to gift them. She gave Prince Harry, a member of Britain’s Army Air Corps, a leather flying jacket during his trip to the White House last May.
Fleece jacket and bronze commemorative medal
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie grew so attached to his fleece jacket in the weeks after Superstorm Sandy that he gave Prince Harry a royal fleece of his own when he passed through New Jersey last May. The 29-year-old prince visited communities devastated by the storm during the trip.
3D printed doll
MakieLab co-founder Jo Roach presented Harry with one of the most creative (or terrifying) items on the list when they met last May: a 3D printed doll made to look like the prince. Harry’s miniature look-alike wore his own Army Air Corps beret and military uniform.
Bottle of whiskey and engraved hip flask
The commanding officer of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment knew the way to Prince Harry’s heart is with whiskey, the same spirit that kept him warm one night during his December charity trip to the South Pole.
Twelve bottles of olive oil
Because one just wouldn’t be enough, Princess Alia bint Al Hussein of Jordan gave Prince Charles 12 bottles of olive oil and a book during his March tour of the Middle East with Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.
An honorary degree
Last November, Prince Charles visited the Forest Research Institute University in India, where he was given an honorary doctoral certificate and two silk scrolls printed with an honorary doctoral citation.
Cuff links and framed portrait
Prince Charles and Camilla did not walk away from their November trip to Sri Lanka empty-handed. Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa offered them a pair of cuff links, a framed portrait, a commemorative banknote, hand-painted ceramic tea service and a white metal tea caddy.
Baby’s racing car overall
The people at Williams Formula One Technology Centre knew just the thing to give the grandparents-to-be: baby clothes. Maybe we’ll see little Prince George sporting these around Kensington Palace someday.
A velvet robe
Some of the most eclectic gifts on the list were given by unnamed individuals, including cardboard roses, 18 bottles of perfume and a velvet robe and slip for Prince Charles and Camilla.
Oodles of baby presents
The Clarence House lists didn’t even attempt to chronicle all the gifts that came pouring in to Prince William and Duchess Kate in honor of the birth of Prince George, but how could we forget the maternity gift box the Finnish government sent the royal couple before their little one's birth? The kit included baby clothes, a nursing pad, cloth diapers and even condoms for dad.
Gifts fit for a queen
Queen Elizabeth also receives her fair share of gifts every year, of course. A separate list published by Buckingham Palace on Wednesday revealed that the queen's gifts included a five-strand pearl necklace from the President of the United Arab Emirates and, more curiously, four enameled scarab beetles from Bangladesh, according to The Telegraph.Ratings based on 419 Verified Reviews

Beautiful property with gorgeous views !Posted May 18, 2015
Pros: The extremely large patio had both lounge chairs and a table with 4 chairs . The view with my morning coffee was fantastic!
Cons: None of the areas ever had change for larger bills.
Location: Mango Reef restaurant is on the premises and excellent. Local restaurants are nearby by taxi, with reasonable rates. Shopping area close as well.
The property is on a beautiful stretch of Grace Bay. Our suite included a large sitting room, kitchen, bedroom and a very large bath , with an additional half bath. We also had apartment sized washer and dryer, all kitchen appliances and refrigerator, property wide WiFi and a view of both the pool and ocean. Absolutely beautiful!

Affordable high quality resort at great locationPosted May 10, 2015
Pros: Easy walking distance to other resorts, nice quality, friendly staff, good food and drinks/pricing. Rooms are big and of high quality.
Cons: Shuttle service tends to be slow, they run on "island time" so call shuttle earlier than you really need it.
Location: On Grace Bay; near other nice resorts. You can walk to many other resorts and have food or drinks. Can take a cab to other restaurants and shopping.
Great location on Grace Bay. Easy walking distance to other resorts and restaurants. Very affordable for the area; you will see other resorts that are much nicer and also those that are much less nice so this is really middle of the road. Food and drinks are very good; the Mango Reef is a great restaurant with a wide selection of food. The bar has a wide selection of drinks that are priced better than nearby resorts. Pool is nice and has swim up bar but doesn't overlook the ocean. Nearby resorts have pools with ocean view. We went as a couple and had a great time, and we also saw many families there with young kids who seemed to also have a great time.

The Best Stretch of Beach in Turks & Caico'sPosted Apr 29, 2015
Pros: The Beach was awesome! One of the best in the world.
Cons: The pool and pool bar could be improved.
Location: The location was very central. 15 minutes from the airport. Close to Intown Shopping, Restaurants, other Beach front hotel bars and restaurants.
Our stay at the Alexandra was very comfortable and relaxing. We had an Ocean Front Suite on the first floor with a spectacular ocean view. The unit was well equipped, modern and clean. Housekeeping & maintenance was excellent. The Mango Reef "outside" restaurant was convenient and the food was good with plenty of options. The staff at the Hotel and the Mango Reef were friendly and attentive. I have to shout out to Ramon at Mango Reef, he is the best Waiter on the island and his service was impeccable. He loves what he does and it shows. He became a friend and one of many reasons why we would come back to this hotel. The concierge was friendly and informative about the island life, excursions, place to see and eat. We did not feel the need to rent a car as, there was always a shuttle or taxi around to take us where we wanted to go. Cab costs on the island were very reasonable.

Great ResortPosted Apr 28, 2015
The Food is spectacular. A little pricey just like everything on the island but every meals was very tasty and the portions were great. The wait staff were all very friendly and if you find your waiter is Trevor, you are in for great service. The pool was clean and the beach was beautiful. The resort was about 80% full and you could always find lounges on the beach and by the pool. the room had dishes and glasses and silverware, microwave, toaster, blender and coffee maker. Each day all the dishes were washed and the room cleaned. We spent time on the terrace, watching sunsets and just relaxing overlooking the pool.. Loved the vacation !!!

GREAT resort, especially for the price!Posted Apr 27, 2015
Pros: Location, location, location! Grace Bay is incredible.
Cons: More snorkel gear! Not much else needs improving.
Location: Walk to Bight Reef; use the free bicycles to cycle into town to shop; the fitness room is nice!
Check in was easy - although nothing was really explained to us (it was almost a "you're on your own" type of thing). But, that said, everything else about our experience at the Alexandra was wonderful. Just the right size (in our opinion); you didn't have to walk all over the place to get from one side of the resort (where our room was) to the other (where the reception office, gym, etc was). The pool was beautiful, the beach even better (Grace Bay is simply incredible) and the grounds were lovely too. We never had a problem finding sunloungers by the pool or on the beach, although the "primo" spots on the beach get snapped up early and quickly. It's not a far walk down to Bight's Reef to go snorkeling (I'd recommend doing that). If you're really looking forward to snorkeling though, I'd suggest bringing your own snorkel gear though. Even though the resort has gear, they let you check it out for an unlimited amount of time. Therefore, there's almost never any snorkel gear to be had. We had to wait 3 days for some gear to get returned so that we could go snorkeling. No big deal really, but just giving an FYI. The Mango Reef restaurant was amazing - we loved the food so much that we ate there almost every day. And the views - amazing! The cleaning staff were great - very thorough and would bring extra towels, etc, promptly.
Comfortable, good location, good restaurantPosted Apr 23, 2015
Turks and Caicos is beautiful, and the Alexandra is a nice hotel. Rooms were spacious, clean, well laid out (we had a one bedroom suite and paid a bit more for a higher floor so we had a nice view of the ocean despite not being in an ocean front room). The pool is really nice and the grounds are pretty and well maintained, with plenty of lounge chairs (never had to fight for a chair). The reason I gave only 4 starts is the resort lists having non-motorized water sport equipment available but they basically have no snorkel equipment. We tried multiple times to get masks/snorkels and they were always "out." Even when we arrived at 8am one morning there was only one mask and 3 snorkels available (plus a couple of old sad pairs of goggles). There's beautiful snorkeling to be done right down the beach and it was disappointing not to be able to get to do it (our family of four took turns with the single mask we were able to get). So I would say overall a really nice hotel, but spend a few hundred dollars and invest in some snorkels! Have people sign them out and make sure they return them or pay if they don't return them so that there are enough for people to use! Otherwise we had a great time and by the way the restaurant there, Mango Reef, is the best within walking distance (we tried Hemingways and Somewhere Cafe, both nearby on the beach, but Mango Reef has the best food).from New York, NY
Right in the middle of Grace Bay, Highly RecommendPosted Apr 21, 2015
Pros: Clean, great rooms with great, stocked kitchenette.
Cons: Restaurant Options, after staying a week, you wish there were a few more options on where to eat other than the same thing almost everyday.
Location: Bight reef is a short walk away for GREAT snorkeling.
We loved our stay at the Alexandria. Very attentive, friendly staff, we loved the Mango Reef Hotel and Dream Caicos snorkel tour that are both right at the hotel. Very centrally located in Grace Bay, so many good walking options and on the most beautiful beach in the Carribean! Highly Recommended!

Headlines (Scroll down for complete stories):1. NRA Director: Real Reason Behind Disclose Act2. German Press Already Sees Obama as Jimmy Carter3. Sarah Palin: I’ll Meet With Thatcher4. Emergency Room Visits to Rise Under Obamacare: Report5. Mayor Bloomberg Donated to Blagojevich’s Campaign6. Author Daniel Ruddy Featured on C-SPAN
1. NRA Director: Real Reason Behind Disclose Act
Democrats’ exclusion of the National Rifle Association from the Disclose Act reining in political spending by corporations shows that the bill is in fact a scheme to aid Democrats in the midterm elections, according to a member of the NRA’s board of directors.
The “cynical” decision by House Democrats “to exempt the NRA from the latest campaign finance regulatory scheme is itself a public disclosure,” board member Cleta Mitchell, a partner in the law firm Foley & Lardner specializing in campaign finance law, wrote in an opinion piece for the Washington Post.
“It reveals the true purpose of the perversely named Disclose Act namely, to silence congressional critics in the 2010 elections.”
The Disclose Act is a response to a Supreme Court decision that came down in January allowing corporations to sponsor election-related ads. The bill would require corporations, unions and nonprofit groups to disclose their top five donors if they participate in political activity, and to agree to other disclosures related to expenditures before elections.
The NRA objected to the bill, and some Democrats were wary of crossing the powerful organization by trying to limit its campaign ads.
So supporters of the legislation added language sparing from disclosure any organization that has more than 1 million members, has members in all 50 states, and relies on corporations for 15 percent or less of its contributions which effectively exempted the NRA. In a later version of the bill, any organization with more than 500,000 members would be exempt.
“The NRA’s wheel-squeaking bought it an exemption,” Mitchell wrote. “Tea party organizations arising spontaneously since 2009? Out of luck. Online organizations with large e-mail followings but no formal dues structure? Forget it.”
She also noted that while the bill technically requires unions as well as corporations to report donors of more than $600 a year, most union members’ dues add up to less than $600 a year and “thus members’ contributions to labor campaign-related spending wouldn’t need to be disclosed.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders had scheduled a vote on the bill for Friday, June 18, but they decided to pull the bill the night before after gun control advocates pledged to oppose it unless the NRA exemption was removed.
The NRA for its part said its position on the bill had been “misstated” by some and “intentionally misrepresented” by others.
A June 21 statement from Chris W. Cox, Executive Director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, declared: “The NRA has never supported nor would we ever support any version of this bill.”
However, he sought to provide the “proper context” for the NRA’s position.
“We believe that any restriction on political speech is repugnant. But some of our critics believe we should put the Second Amendment at risk over a First Amendment principle to protect other organizations. That’s easy to say unless you have a sworn duty to protect the Second Amendment above all else, as I do.”
Mitchell, who has served as legal counsel to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, believes the bill should be abandoned permanently.
“The Disclose Act isn’t really intended to elicit information not currently required by law,” she observed. “The act serves notice on certain speakers that their involvement in the political process will exact a high price of regulation, penalty and notoriety, using disclosure and reporting as a subterfuge to chill their political speech and association.
“This is not ‘disclosure.’ It is a scheme hatched by political insiders to eradicate disfavored speech. There is no room under the First Amendment for Congress to make deals on political speech, whether with the NRA or anyone else.”
Editor's Note:
2. German Press Already Sees Obama as Jimmy Carter
“If Barack Obama isn’t careful, he will become the Jimmy Carter of the 21st Century.”
That’s the view of a commentator writing for Germany’s Berliner Zeitung newspaper, who notes that Obama is in danger of becoming a one-term president like Carter.
German media weighed in with commentary after Obama’s June 15 speech about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and America’s energy future.
Der Spiegel magazine’s website observed: “President Barack Obama's address from the Oval Office U.S. government was prepared for, and Obama failed to mention any specific new ideas. ‘The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean-energy future is now,’ he declared, without offering policy details.”
Germany’s Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper said Obama was “cautious” and “vague” in his speech, and stated: “This president won’t lead America out of a crisis this way and he certainly won’t usher in a new era.”
And Berliner Zeitung opined: ."
3. Sarah Palin: I’ll Meet With Thatcher
Sarah Palin has confirmed that she has received an invitation to meet former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during a trip to London.
Last week the Insider Report disclosed that the former Alaska governor’s representatives had approached 84-year-old Thatcher to request a meeting, which would be “an enormous publicity coup for Sarah Palin,” a source told Britain’s Daily Mail.
Now Palin on her Facebook page writes: ."
4. Emergency Room Visits to Rise Under Obamacare: Report
Supporters of President Obama’s healthcare reform plan said one benefit would be a reduction in emergency room visits for nonemergency treatment but the opposite will likely be the case, according to a new report.
The premise touted by proponents of the reform was that Americans who lack healthcare insurance and cannot afford to see a private physician often seek treatment at a hospital emergency room which cannot turn them away and then fail to pay their bill.
The thinking went that the 32 million to 34 million currently uninsured people would receive coverage and be able to obtain treatment from a private physician or clinic.
But John C. Goodman, president and CEO at the National Center for Policy Analysis, states: “More people are likely to turn to the emergency room for their healthcare and they are likely to do so more frequently under the new health reform legislation.”
He notes that about half of the newly insured will enroll in Medicaid, and Medicaid patients seek emergency room care more often than the uninsured.
The reason, Goodman suggests, is that Medicaid fees are so low that patients have trouble finding private physicians willing to see them, and find that emergency rooms are the only place where they can receive care.
Also, the reform plan makes no provision for creating more healthcare providers, so as the newly insured seek to increase their access to healthcare, many are likely to turn to emergency rooms when they cannot get care at a doctor’s office.
Goodman points to Massachusetts, which cut the number of uninsured in half by enrolling residents in Medicaid and private insurance plans offered in a health insurance exchange. But no steps were taken to increase the number of healthcare providers, and as a result, the wait to see a new doctor in Boston is twice as long as in any other U.S. city.
Goodman also notes: “The use of emergency rooms for nonemergency care in Massachusetts today is as great as or greater than it was before the state health reform was adopted.”
5. Mayor Bloomberg Donated to Blagojevich’s Campaign
Testimony at former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s corruption trial revealed that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg contributed $25,000 to Blagojevich’s 2006 re-election campaign.
The money Blagojevich received from billionaire Bloomberg just days before the election was one of the largest donations in the governor’s successful campaign.
Bloomberg aides said he has regularly given large contributions to out-of-state politicians who share his views. Blagojevich and Bloomberg both advocate tougher gun control laws, abortion rights, and the importation of prescription drugs from Canada, The New York Times reported.
They have also shared Bradley Tusk, a Bloomberg aide who went on to serve as deputy governor to Blagojevich before returning to New York to run Bloomberg’s 2009 re-election campaign.
Testifying at Blagojevich’s trial on June 21, Tusk was asked by a Blagojevich attorney if he helped arrange for Bloomberg’s contribution. Prosecutors objected and the judge kept Tusk from responding, but Tusk later told reporters he had no role in securing the donation.
Blagojevich has pleaded not guilty to scheming to sell or trade the appointment to Barack Obama's Senate seat, and to plotting to launch a racketeering scheme using the powers of the governor's office. If convicted, he could face up to $6 million in fines and a sentence of 415 years in prison, although he would be certain to get much less under federal guidelines.
6. We Heard . . .
Historian Daniel Ruddy appeared on C-SPAN for a lengthy discussion of his new book about Theodore Roosevelt.
“Theodore Roosevelt’s History of the United States” (published by HarperCollins) draws upon Roosevelt’s own words to construct a unique history of the United States based on Roosevelt’s colorful insights and provocative views.
Ruddy appeared at BookPeople in Austin, Texas, to talk about the book, and “Book TV on C-SPAN2” aired the discussion on June 19.
Ruddy told the audience that Roosevelt had a “great love of history,” and that “maybe Winston Churchill is the only other person who rivals him in his excellence in both areas, writing about history and making history.”
C-SPAN posted the discussion online:
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edmund Morris, author of “The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt” and the acclaimed Reagan biography “Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,” wrote the Foreword to Ruddy’s book and called it “a splendid piece of work.”.We've pulled out all the stops for the botanical items in this year's Gala and some of the plants are sure to help transform your garden into a wonderland. As always, Japanese maples (Acer palmatum) lead the pack. Many of these maples are so new, there's virtually no other place to find them. 'Seiun Kaku', a brand new, vigorous form of the incredible 'Mikawa Yatsubusa' has congested growth of small, overlapping leaves like shingles on a pagoda. Almost completely unavailable in the United States yet is 'Summer Gold' with its bright foliage all season long. As a perfect complement is another maple Acer rufinerve 'Winter Gold' which not only forms an elegant small tree in summer, but electrifies the winter landscape with its brilliant amber-gold stems. Other rare and choice maples include A. davidii 'Dawn Rainbow', A. pictum 'Usugumo' and, A. ×conspicuum 'Phoenix'.
Maples aren't the only choice items in the auction though; witchhazels, hostas, ferns, and flowering trees and shrubs are all represented in this year's selection. This year in particular there is a wide array of dwarf and rare conifers that should make any cone-head drool. The diminutive Pinus mugo 'Paul's Dwarf' is a cute little bun while Picea pungens 'Spring Blast' is electric with brilliant gold new growth. Over a dozen rare conifers are included in the auction from small plants perfect for a rock garden or trough to large, landscape ready specimens that will make an instant impact. – Mark Weathington, Assistant Director and Curator of Collections

What do you think?Entertaining: Theme Parties and Pie Socials
NYC has just opened another "single food" restaurant. Totally Baked, serving only baked potatoes, joins restaurants like S'mac (only mac n' cheese), Peanut Butter and Co. (peanut butter creations), and Rice to Riches (rice pudding).
These niche restaurants convince customers that though they only do one thing, they do it really well. Each of them takes a basic, well-loved ingredient, and uses it as an opportunity for creativity in toppings, mix-ins, and other recipes.
All the buzz around Totally Baked's opening has us thinking about that classic niche party, the Pie Social, and all its delicious variations.
These food-themed parties are best as potlucks. Tell everyone the theme, and then let them get creative. It's like a cook-off without all the competition. (Okay, perhaps without all the overt competition.)
They don't have to be potlucks of course. A chili party could serve your three favorite recipes, along with a wide variety of toppings so guests can customize.
As we said, the classic example is a pie social, perfect for a summer party in the backyard. Tell guests to bring their favorite pie, sweet or savory. Non-baking friends can bring drinks or ice cream as accompaniment.
But theme parties aren't limited to just pie. Have a mac n' cheese party where everybody brings their favorite variation. (Serve plenty of salad to balance all that heavy food!) If you've got foodie friends, an ice cream social will allow everyone to show off what they're mixing up. And, you can choose a theme ingredient, such as summer tomatoes, then allow everyone to choose their own way of fixing them, and showing off their beauty.
After the Saveur butter issue, we were even considering having a butter party. We'd ask baking friends to bring a loaf of bread, serve 6 or 7 different gourmet butters, and then make something light for a "main course."

West, Barbara, Antiquity
Further (and final) comment on the origin of ancient human skulls from the River Thames (ANTIQUITY 62 (1988): 503-9; 69 (1995): 162-9) is prompted by comparison with the skulls from the London Thames tributary, the Walbrook.
Knusel & Carr's ANTIQUITY article on the Thames skulls (March 1995) attributes these finds to fluvial sorting, and states (p. 166): 'The same interpretation may be applied to the Walbrook crania (Marsh & West 1981).' It cites taphonomic studies (pp. 163-4):
In the process of dispersion bones often lose their original form ... crania lose their facial region, forming calvaria.... Many of the Thames basin crania examined are in this condition and have been eroded from water action as a result of being rolled along the river bottom.
This statement forms a main foundation for their argument: yet no data is offered to substantiate it. Despite their statement that the age, sex and condition of the Thames skulls were re-assessed (p. 163), the data on condition (percentages & photographs of completeness, 'erosion', 'river-bottom rolling', etc.) were completely excluded from their paper.
In the Walbrook study, half the skulls lacked the facial region (Marsh & West 1981: 90). Examples of the other half can be seen in FIGURE 1. The lack of abrasion marks (also noted in Marsh & West 1981, but not mentioned by Knusel & Carr), excellent condition and complete facial regions form a striking contrast to the assertions of Knusel & Carr.
As for craniometry, Chris Stringer (Natural History Museum) has made extensive use of cranial vault measurements in his research (see, for example, Stringer 1992), and comments (pers. comm. June 1995):
Knusel & Carr's [p. 163] paraphrasing of Howells (1989) is somewhat misleading. While Howells notes that the upper face is important, he by no means states that the cranial vault is unimportant. His 1973 monograph provides plenty of data for the usefulness of cranial vault measurements in discriminating populations, as is illustrated by the following quote: 'Whatever the agencies causing differences of cranial form in modern man, these differences have long been assumed to be deep-seated and relatively slow to change, and there is no indication to the contrary in this study.... In other words, the value of cranial distinctions in assessing genetic relationships of modern populations, as in tracing populations into the past, continues to seem considerable.
In addition to the references cited by Richard Bradley in his reply to Knusel & Carr (ANTIQUITY 69: 168-9), I recommend Ralph Merrifield's (1987) book, The archaeology of ritual and magic, which collates related discoveries, such as human skulls deposited with complete pots in the bottom of Romano-British wells. These did not arrive there by fluvial action.
Finally, I would point out that the idea that the Walbrook skulls represent differential deposition of bones by fluvial action was current at the turn of the century (Reader 1903; quoted in Marsh & West 1981: 91).

CHRISTOPHER KNUSEL & GILLIAN CARR(*) comment:
The intent of our publication was to refute any attempt to 'date' or provenance crania (not skulls, which include the cranium and mandible) on the basis of craniometrics. We found evidence of abrasion, erosion, or preservation of only calottes, calvaria, or cranial fragments of 33% of the total examined (60/178). …Juba —.
Dr. Mbennah said the radio will operate on medium wave and will be located in Malakal of the Upper Nile State far north of the country. Trans World Radio network is a multinational evangelical media that offers inspirational programming in various languages in the world via satellite, cable, internet and local AM and FM stations. The radio will provide people with religious programs and other social programs like health, education and agriculture.
Dr. Benjamin said the government would cooperate with the organization to help install the radio.
Although South Sudan has a number of radio stations beside South Sudan Radio which operate on both medium wave and frequency modulation (FM), coverage of the ten states is still low. There is hope for better coverage with the coming of Trans World Radio.The Dunbar number is a well known neurological construct that suggests our brains are only capable of maintaining good relationships with around 150 people (although it is believed to range from 100 up to 230 depending on the individual)..
Does the number apply equally to social networks however? I mean I’m sure many of us have networks that far exceed 150, be it on Twitter or LinkedIn. Dunbar himself conducted some research into this recently and he came to the conclusion that the mental limit applies just as much online as it does offline..#
That opinion isn’t shared by researchers at Oxford University however, who found that our social networking capabilities are relatively elastic. They suggest.
Of course, there is also much to support the so called weak connections within our social networks. Research last year highlighted the importance of what they termed familiar strangers. These are people we see regularly but who we don’t have any kind of relationship with, so people we see every day on the train to work for instance or at the gym.
The researchers suggest that the connections that evolve between these familiar strangers grows stronger over time. In other words, the more frequently we see that person on the train each morning, the more likely we are to become socially connected to one another.
Similarly it emerged recently that weak ties were the key to getting retweets on Twitter. It emerged that when both parties followed each other (ie a two way relationship), there was a 6% chance of either party retweeting a comment from the other. When the relationship was only one-way however, that probability rose to 9.1%, which is a boost of over 50%.
.
So does social media allow us to bust past the Dunbar number? I’d say the jury is still very much out.Hotel Deals

The early retirement program, announced earlier this month, would also offer leaves of absence as part of a program designed to cut 2,000 to 3,000 jobs. Also available are two retirement programs, one with a lump-sum payout and the other with an improved pension offering.
BellSouth would offer employees who leave the company for an educational or community service job a quarter of their Southern Bell salaries for up to three years.
``The purpose is to transition them into new careers,`` Southern Bell spokesman Michael Branigan said.
Details of the voluntary early retirement program were announced on Thursday. About 10,500 managers of 30,000 are eligible for the programs. Atlanta-based BellSouth employs about 103,000.
``Changes in technology have allowed us to do more with fewer individuals,`` Branigan said.
In one of the leave-of-absence programs, employees with at least eight years of service could take three years off without pay and would be eligible to get an equivalent job when they returned. Health benefits would be paid during the leave.
However, the job offer is not guaranteed. Reinstatement is ``subject to force conditions at that time,`` Branigan said. He said he could not elaborate.
Thomas Shea, managing principal of Right Associates` Florida and Caribbean outplacement company, said many companies offer leaves of absence for executives to do community service work. But it`s unusual to offer a program as an entree to a career in community service.
``If you have to reduce the work force, giving employees a number of ways to do it is the best way to go,`` he said. The risk for BellSouth is that its best employees may leave the company, Shea said.Samsung has just outed Black Editions of its Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S4 mini, weeks before it debuts its new Galaxy S5 smartphone. The Galaxy S4 Black Edition is pretty much identical to the standard S4, with a 1.9Ghz quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 5-inch 1080p display, 16GB of internal storage, a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera and unfortunately, only Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean - for now.
The Galaxy S4 mini Black Edition feautres the same specs as the smaller S4's, with a 4.3-inch Super AMOLED display, 1.7GHz dual-core processor, 8-megapixel rear-facing snapper and the same Android 4.2.2 OS on top. The Black Editions will however, "sport a high-quality leather-like textured black back cover and bezel" and also "come preloaded with a suite of eight dedicated wallpapers for both the home and lock screens as well as several new and exclusive ringtones".Today was another goodbye.At school. After so many years of being the one ‘left behing’ it is nice to be the one leaving. Sad though. Very sad. I would like to see my childrens friends graduate, go to their wedding and see them as parents. Call me sentimental… it makes me so sad. Also seeing how hard it is for my children. The distance is huge.
BUT i must say, we have loved many and have experianced alot if love in return, Like tonight some new friends invited us to their home for bengali food. Thankyou!!The feedback on Monday’s Blackberry post (see prior post “Throwing in the towel on my RIM shares” June 24-13) has been visceral. It seems that I’ve unknowingly crossed many RIM shareholders by following the ways of Legendary Investor Peter Lynch, and the passion is something to behold. I can break news about Canada’s $180 billion investment vehicle, CPPIB, or Kevin O’Leary’s shrinking asset base, but nothing has ever generated quite the hullabaloo like selling RIM after years and years of my unrewarded patience.
To be clear, I’ve not ditched my Q10, nor am I short BBRY. The post was a lament, which should not be taken as a criticism of those RIM shareholders who have chosen to stick around for an eventual turnaround. It may yet happen. The post was, however, a recognition that I had allowed blind loyalty / misplaced confidence in RIM management to allow me to ride RIM RIM quote could have been built by 12 year old programmers on a Saturday morning. Has RIM, RIM loses another reason that has historically kept their existing users from changing teams. As one RIM staffer might say: the QNX people are now running the company and they don’t care about what “used to work”. That’s a problem, and every RIM staffer who has been in Waterloo more than three years knows what I’m talking about. I doubt Mike or Jim would disagree, either.
If RIM RIM RIM shareholders are left to yearn for an eventual $20/share takeover, sadly, and that’s not a good enough reason to own BBRY right now relative to the other choices. Like Constellation Software (CSU:TS).

Mark I was going to email you as well
It looked very suspicious on your part to say you stuck with it that long and then suddenly you bail days before the catalyst of positive earnings and a string of announcements and positive guidance from THOR (many would believe you got a check in the mail or really large suit case full of American money & you slam BB/BBRY on A blog WHY???????? call in the PR team)
There is 182 million shares shorted & a 5 $ rise in the stock price, will cause the short position 1 billion dollars as a group & if they’re unable to unwind before 19 bucks(Jefferies Peter Misek’s target price) its btw 12 days to cover at present, at 24 (which is the next platform for the technical side) is 2 billion you see where i’m going
So it looks awfully suspicious to those of us Value investors who truly see a future at Black Berry
Here is my predictions:
EPS 1.00 street is .05
10M+ hand set sales street is 7+ 4m 10’s 3 m 7.0
4 Billion in cash
BBRY Estimates (in my utopia of course)
Street consensus estimate is 5 cents (.05) 3-4 million bb10 sales with 7.0 down to 3m units for a total of 7million
Q4 bbry beat the street by .50 cents .22 gain : street est.30 loss
Q1 if that happens again ,50 cent beat were going to 26$
If it goes over 1.00 with license deal with Sony and Lenovo ( lenovo having bought marketing & manufacturing rights to blackberry, 2Billion cash deal add that to the 4b were at 6b in cash)
RIM becomes RIM again (notice they haven’t changed legal name only the ticker symbol) serving software and service and pow to the moon .. 60 bucks, maybe 100 dollar with short squeeze
There are only 250m share available to cover 182m short I am contending the other 275m shares are with value investors who buy and hold ( ie: FFH, Mike L & yours truly)
OMG is this going to be ugly for shorts
if you own shares well breakup value of company is minimum 18$ Patents, cash, property and other saleable assets
If you’re a long option investor well there is risk, but in my estimation holding a position in the shares is good business
there o.oo down side according to my analysis of situation, but UP OMG ( that’s oh my goodness )
risk reward is perfect here folks buy the shares and don’t let any noise try to convince you of selling its the demand for shares and there short supply that influence stock up, so yes real share holders can control the price not day traders and junkie gamblers who would rather see a company fail for their personal benefit
So here I am retail investor who owned Apple in 1995 at 4 bucks and you are a in the investment business I presume with you being on BNN and all, what are you thinking ????????
It appears you better enjoy the money, some think, you sold your professional reputation out for.
If NO and you are genuine I will apologize in advance for the skeptical group
SORRY!

Good Call;
I gambled pretty heavy and lost.
I have been a loyal and admiring blackberry user thru many models, the last being the 9700. The phone started to give me some cryptic messages such as “28>=28″ and also stopped syncing to BDS. I thought what a perfect time to switch to Q10 with 4G. Love the hardware, love the speed for browsing. But am shocked at how cumbersome it is to do what I think are the most basic tasks. Try replying by text to a phonecall you cannot take since you are in a meeting. I could do that practically blindfolded earlier. Try copying a single phone number from a contact and texting it to someone else.
Within a week, started getting messages to update OS but would not wirelessly update the OS. It would freeze at 99% download. Found out that someone had hijacked my “Blackberry ID” and assigned a security question that I had no idea what it was. Only real help on support line was to setup a new fake email address and use that as an ID.
why is it impossible to customize the icons to have an icon for emails. Why can one not have contacts on the hub. Effectively now there are TWO home pages and it takes time to go from one to the other.
I am getting to slowly learn how to use the phone, but what is probably THE most disappointing is the battery life. I am at one notch by end of day even without too much time on the phone even though I do extensive emails.
Could Blackberry or RIM, not allow one to sacrifice some of the screen real estate and allow users to use the old features by placing the menu/phone/escape etc keys as “software” buttons, that one could use through the touchscreen.
I am not giving up on Blackberry. Just that I almost want my 9700 back. The device never broke, the software on it did and I could not reinstall the OS.
Yes, im a little disappointed with my bb10. Sometimes u have to keep averaging down. This approach doesn’t always work (think NT). But if you pick companies with sufficient cash, it works more often than not. So as a great Canadian (im referring to u) I’m a little disappointed to see u throwing in the towel. With a slow summer likely ahead, I’m still hoping to have the chance to buy more shares at cheaper levels.By Alan Duffy
Sunderland 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur – Premier League – 7th December 2013
Spurs battled to a precious victory at the Stadium of Light on Saturday, a result which takes some of the pressure off manager Andre Villas-Boas. Adam Johnson had given the Black Cats the lead after some fumbling from Hugo Lloris but a close-range effort from Paulinho before the break followed by a John O’Shea OG in the second-period secured a hard-fought, but deserved win for a Tottenham side who worked hard for the three points. Gus Poyet’s Black Cats can look at the plethora of OG’s they have conceded this season as a pretty big sign that things are going against them, but there was enough here to hint at a better future for the strugglers.

Unfortunately I don’t think it does take the pressure off of AVB as there are certain elements in the media that definitely have it in for him. I had the misfortune to listen to some of the match commentary on talkshite yesterday and the biased negative bullshit about Spurs and AVB spouted by the commentator and the hideous Stan ( I tweated/thought of that first) coleymore was hard to take. Then I stupidly tuned in again this morning only to hear some fat scouse ex footballer and his ignorant tart espousing the same kind of vicious bile.

Goodwill leased the 25,740 SF former Whole Foods building at the NEC of Lindsay and Warner in Gilbert. The store is expected to open in 2Q 2013. Goodwill also completed a 14,400 SF, 10-year lease is San Luis. That store is expected to open in 3Q 2013.
“We are honored to be able to help Goodwill of Central Arizona expand their presence in Arizona while positively impacting the community with each new store,” Kroot said. “Goodwill now has well over 60 stores in the area with many more planned for 2013/2014; we are continuing to search for great, high traffic locations.”
With 65 years of serving central Arizona’s communities, Goodwill of Central Arizona is one of the oldest and largest nonprofit agencies in Arizona. In 2012, it served more than 42,000 youth and adults on their quest toward self-sufficiency and secured more than 15,563 employment opportunities.

Capriotti’s Sandwich Shop has five other stores in Metro Phoenix.The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has asked for comments on a proposed rule that would require pension plan service providers to furnish employers and other plan fiduciaries with a guide to assist them in navigating fee disclosure documents.
In 2012, the DOL published a final rule requiring companies that provide services to employer-sponsored defined contribution plans, like 401(k)s, disclose information about the compensation they receive, including payments from third parties.
And while most companies have complied with the request, they don’t necessarily make it easy for providers or plan participants to understand what they are paying in fees. Many times the fee disclosures come in the form of lengthy documents or the information is spread out over multiple documents.
The proposal announced this week would amend the fee disclosure rule for service providers to require them to furnish a guide if disclosures are made using multiple or lengthy documents. The guide must specifically identify the document, page or other specific information so that employers can find the data quickly.
The notice of proposed rulemaking is open for public comment. The notice also references an announcement by the department to conduct focus group sessions with fiduciaries to pension plans with fewer than 100 participants. The purpose of the focus groups is to explore current practices and effects of the 2012 fee disclosure rule. The hope is these groups will give the department additional information about the need for this proposal and what disclosure formats would be the most helpful to plan fiduciaries.
 Borzi. “Much like a roadmap, a guide can help employers locate fee information, which will help them better understand what they are being charged by financial services providers.”November 28, 2012 — Penumbral Lunar Eclipse — Cairo, Egypt (Al Qâhirah)

The membership fees which ranged from the £100 per year one star service (To be thought of kindly come judgement day) to the £10,000 a year Gold five star plus service (Guaranteed entry to the Kingdom of Heaven with no questions asked and a free weekly entry into the sainthood lottery) are to be replaced with the old system of voluntary contributions of foreign coins and old buttons in the collection box each Sunday.
He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy.
"We had hoped that the membership scheme would prove more popular than it has been" said a spokesman for the nation's largest property holder. "But sadly it failed to catch the public's imagination".

"I found my way to the banjo completely by accident, through the roots of the banjo. We did an African percussion workshop at a Suzuki workshop that I was at. I started doing that as well as playing piano, and then from that started playing the kora, which is a West African traditional harp. It's basically a grandfather to the banjo. And then I heard Béla Fleck when I was 16 and just went banjo-crazy."
"Banjo has a reputation for being very unmusical, for being super loud, and for people having bad rhythm. It doesn't have to be that way. There's a whole vernacular that's only specific to the banjo and it doesn't apply to any other instrument. Bluegrass banjo is a really specific thing, because it's based on the playing of Earl Scruggs. A lot of banjo players learn all of that, and then everything else is a mystery. Improvising with harmony and single-note melody as opposed to improvising within the bluegrass vernacular are two very different things. I definitely view my job as trying to balance those out."
"I play full-time in a band called Joy Kills Sorrow—it's bluegrass mixed with indie rock. I'm very involved with the acoustic scene in Boston. It's close-knit. We all grew up meeting each other and playing together at bluegrass festivals all over the country; it's like a little bubble that travels from one place to the next. Everybody is very supportive."

June 26, 2013 — While elephants are threatened by poaching in many parts of Africa, they are flourishing in South Africa, says Wyoming Public Radio reporter Willow Belden. She recently returned from an assignment to report on efforts to control the country’s growing elephant populations.
“That’s because they live in protected game reserves and parks, where there’s little or no poaching, few predators and abundant resources,” says Belden, whose report was heard earlier this month on WPR’s weekly news and information program, “Open Spaces.”
Some game reserve managers say the elephants are multiplying too fast for their habitat to sustain, so they are using various forms of birth control to curtail their reproduction, she says. But other experts warn that controlling their numbers is the wrong approach.
“These issues parallel some of the challenges faced by wildlife managers in Wyoming, for example with wild horses,” Belden says.
While in South Africa, Belden traveled to a game reserve that uses a form of birth control on elephants. She interviewed the team that developed an elephant vasectomy procedure in Colorado, where they are based. She also spoke with leading South African ecologists who advocate a different approach -- restoring natural ecosystem processes so that elephants regulate their own numbers.
Belden’s trip was funded by the Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship, an award she received when she graduated from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism in 2011. The fellowship, which is intended to pay for an international reporting trip, is granted to four outstanding students each year.
Before joining the WPR news team, Belden spent a year in the Middle East on a Fulbright grant, conducting research in a Palestinian refugee camp, and writing for the Jordan Times and JO Magazine. Upon returning to the United States, she became a reporter and editor at New York City’s Queens Chronicle and received the Rookie Reporter of the Year award from the New York Press Association.
Her report has been accepted by National Public Radio’s popular “Morning Edition” program. To hear Belden’s report on South African elephants, visit, click on programs and select “Open Spaces.”

'Be brutally honest. Look at yourself and see if you look like you could be commercial," says Becky Rash, co-owner of Active Audio and Entertainment. "Ashlee Simpson is a little more regular-looking than her sister Jessica, and yet she [Ashlee] is a huge pop star. Decide, 'Am I going to market myself as a beautiful person, or am I going to go a different path, be a little rough-edged like Ashlee Simpson, to fit my image better?' It's really unfortunate that we have to be that shallow, but that's the way the industry works. You have to be beautiful to market your image that way, and if you saw me you'd know why I'm not a pop star." On Saturday, March 25, Rash and her husband and business partner will conduct a workshop entitled, "So You Wanna Be a Pop Star?" "We're going to give a broad overview of the way the business runs," says Rash. "People come to us after spending thousands of dollars, even a couple of years, and they have nothing -- they have a demo that they hate and they're no closer to their goal."
According to Rash the industry works differently for bands than it does for pop stars. "These days, with the advance in technology, bands are recording their own albums, selling their own albums, and out gigging themselves. They might have 1000 to 5000 fans before record labels are picking them up. This is happening for singers and singer/songwriter types as well. For a pop star, they don't need to have a following, but they do need to come to a record label ready." In the past it was common for labels to groom artists into stars. Rash says this is no longer the case. "What we find the most here locally are young, mostly girls, who are looking to be the next Beyoncé or Britney."
Rash believes that bands do not need record labels as much as pop stars. "The venues [at which bands and pop stars perform] are different," she says. "You can go to L.A., and there are clubs all over that love bands. That's a little bit different than someone like Beyoncé, who's got this amazing voice, but she's not the type who fronts a band. [Pop stars] are more likely to use tracks than bands, and they have dancers and that kind of thing."
Rash's company offers production services and vocal training. Becky Rash has been teaching production, songwriting, and voice for 15 years. There is a reason this workshop is also extended to "families of aspiring pop stars" -- a young star's failure to rise can often be attributed to the actions of his or her parents.
"Parents can pose problems for their kids. They can be the most talented in the world, but if professionals don't like to work with the parents, forget it," says Rash. "We've had kids that we've produced songs for and then refused [to continue]. We just couldn't stand to do any more work with them because their parents were so annoying."
Among the faux pas are parents who don't let their child make his or her own decision, parents who do not understand the level of professionalism required, and parents who try to take charge of the situation, "as if they know more than the professional," says Rash. "We had a daughter doing a recording session with us, and Mom would come to the recording session and have no regard for the recording process. She would bring her laptop and talk a lot. [Parents] need to understand that they need to be there, but to step back and let the professional work with the child."
Rash emphasizes that it can take a lot of money to try to be a pop star. "If you don't have any money, you need to start saving." Payment for voice lessons (if needed), a recording demo, songwriting (again, if needed), marketing, a website, photos, etc., can range from $10,000 to $200,000, "depending on how professional and all-out they want to go."
"If the talent is there, and all those other aspects are together, people like Ken and I -- semi-professionals who are lower on the ladder -- will recognize that talent and pool their resources. If we find a really talented person, we won't charge you -- we would want to help you with your career and take something from the back end [like a percentage of record sales]. If people are truly talented, [other] people will grab on for the ride." -- Barbarella

Mr Zeidan, who fled to Germany after being ousted by parliament when he lost a confidence vote this month, said: “Libya could be a base for al-Qaeda for any operation to Italy, to Britain, to France, to Spain, to Morocco, to everywhere. Weapons are everywhere, ammunition is everywhere.”

great being alble to walk to the lifts.
We spent a summer month at this condo at Bristol Mountain. The condo was beautifully decorated and very clean. It had all that we needed in the unit from linens to kitchen items. The owner was very attentive toward any concern we had. The area is beautiful and the mountain is scenic and pleasant in the summer. I highly recommend staying here winter or summer!
We had a great Fella's weekend at the Bristol Mt. Condo.
First, the major benefit is the ski in/ski out access. It's easier to ski to the condo than it is to ski to the lodge, it's that close!
Not many homes these days have actual wood burning fireplaces, this condo does and it's such a treat. Nothing better than winding down after a day on the slopes with a wood burning fireplace crackling in the background. Very adequate stereo system with plug for iPod/computer/tablet/device to listen to your own tunes.
Bedroom and bathrooms were very clean and comfortable, everything that is advertised is present on arrival.
This condo and location would be excellent not only for winter sports, but also for summer. It is very close to vineyards, wine trails, craft micro breweries (Custom Brewcrafters is awesome) and the finger lakes.
I purchased the weekend as a holiday gift for my 16yr old and my husband. They also invited another friend and dad. Both dads have made repeated boys' trips out west, staying in ski in/out accomodations. They said this experience was equally as fun minus the ski villages that are available out west! The townhouse was perfect for the boys in its location so close to the lodge and lift, clean, with all the amenities needed! Will do this again!!
The townhouse was bigger than in the pictures and so close to the ski hill, it was so easy to come in and out. Everything was clean and we really appreciated having everything there to make a fire; so cosy! The kitchen was well stocked, the beds were comfortable and having heat controls in each room kept everyone comfortable. Thanks again for a great stay.
Our group had an excellent time at Bristol Mountain! This is the second time we have rented a unit at North Star Village, but this one was the best. The owners met us there and made sure we were in and comfortable. Literally a stones throw from the Ski Lodge, and the lifts, you could take a break from the action, yet still feel like you were right there. Apres ski moments afterwards while the teens were still out skiing were enjoyed by all. The unit was cozy, but comfortable for 6 people, and had ALL the amenities needed for a GREAT TIME! Ski locker and clothes dryer were big hits! We'll definitely do this again!

Minster runs the table to MAC crown
Solid shooting from Minster golfers Ben Hogenkamp and Adam Sherman allowed the Wildcats to run the table in the Midwest Athletic Conference, capturing the conference boys golf tournament on Saturday at The Fox's Den to go along with a 9-0 regular season record.
Minster collected the 18 tournament team points to go with its 18 from winning the regular season title to score 36 points.
The Wildcats shot a 318, well ahead of runner-up St. John's 330. Versailles finished third in the tournament but still gained enough points in going 8-1 in the duals season to take second overall..
"It's nice to have the depth again," said Minster coach Mike Griner. "Placing three on the first team All-MAC is quite an accomplishment for us because we have 4-5 players who can be medalist on any given round."
Hogenkamp tamed the Fox's Den course this season, shooting a 2-under 70 to take the tournament title after finishing second behind teammate Craig Purpus last year.
"I started off pretty good," said Hogenkamp. "I had five birdies total.
"(The course) was pretty easy. We came over Wednesday to play a practice round and the pro told us all the tees would be played back. We came here today and the tees weren't too bad. ... Greens were a little fast."
Helping Hogenkamp in pacing the Wildcats was Sherman, who placed fourth in the tournament with a 77. Purpus shot an 85 with Austin Fischer carding an 86 to round out the scoring for the Wildcats.
Versailles' Wes Drees placed second with a 1-over 73. Brad Wannemacher of St. John's was third with a 74 and Coldwater's Mark Kaiser tied Sherman with a 77 to round out the golfers shooting sub-80.
In the All-MAC and Golfer of the Year standings, based upon the finish during the duals season and in the tournament, Wannemacher held off Drees 1511/2 points to 1491/2 points to take top golfer honors after placing fourth in the points standings.
Joining Wannemacher and Drees on the All-MAC first team were Kaiser, Parkway's Tyler Oliver, St. Henry's Doug Bruns, Hogenkamp, Purpus and Sherman, St. John's Brandon Hemker and Drew Fisher, New Knoxville's Caleb Allen and New Bremen's Martin Holdren.
Sectional tournament golf gets underway this week for Division II and III teams. Coldwater goes to Country Acres on Thursday for the Division II sectional while the other teams except St. John's and Versailles go to Hawthorne Hills in Lima on Thursday. St. John's will play Thursday at Auglaize Golf Club outside Defiance while Versailles is at Beechwood in Arcanum today for Division III play.

Mazel tov!AUSTIN, Texas -- People call coaches overpaid and that's fair enough, but I'm not sure.
Listen to this, from Florida's Billy Donovan: "If you go back and look at our conference in regular season from a year ago, we gave up nearly 40 percent from the three-point line. And the first thing that comes into question is why, what is the problem, what is going on? So we [emphasis mine] broke down every single three-point shot that was made against us or even taken against us, from the whole entire season last year . . ."
That chilling passage does provide a glimpse of the unfathomable horror these coaches endure. If forced to revisit every single three-point shot made or taken across a season, most people would opt for something more enjoyable, such as euthanasia.
Yet in a nation of grinding basketball with downward-trending scores, a state noted for ease and flip-flops has an emblem. Here's Florida, third in the country in scoring defense (53.7), fourth in field-goal percentage defense (.377), 12th in three-point defense (.301), and a threat to Florida's all-time field-goal percentage defense from peach-basket 1957-58 (.367). Twice this season, opponents scored 10 points or fewer in first halves against Florida.
"That's the biggest concern that I have, is just their defense," Minnesota coach Tubby Smith said ahead of the Minnesota-Florida second-round match.
Everywhere, there's defense. There's defense amok in the Big Ten, lauded as the top conference, and with Minnesota because, as Donovan put it, "Tubby has always been a terrific defensive coach and really sound offensively." There's defense in the first-round scoring, which went from 140.43 points five years ago to 132.75 points per game last year to 129.09 this year, leaving fans wondering what happened to those lost 3.66 points. There's defense causing general concern about distorting the sport, as Bob Thomason noted here Friday in a long, thoughtful quotation after his final game after 25 seasons coaching Pacific. "We've got tremendous athletes out there and nobody can cut or move or do anything," he said.
All over the place, we have people breaking down ever more available video of offense to hone defense. We have people studying stats until Florida guard Kenny Boynton said of Florida's so-so first half Friday, "As a team we were giving up just wide-open layups, defensive efficiency, I think they shot like 1.02."
(Note: The 1.02 refers to points per possession in a business full of men desperately trying to limit the points per possession of others, yearning for points-per-possession digits under 0.8, earning their salary yet again in obsession over points per possession.)
As an emblem for its defense, Florida has Mr. Scottie Wilbekin, a 6-foot-2, 176-pound junior guard from Gainesville who adores defense but seems a bit bewildered when people ask him about adoring defense. "I like stopping a player," he says. "It just brings satisfaction if he tries to do something and I stop him from doing it, I guess." Like all basketball players, he said, he can see some foes' frustration in facial expressions, or hear it in their comments to teammates.
"Some teams will start yelling at each other," he said.
Those are great nights.
"I think he has three qualities that enable him to be very, very good," Donovan said. ."
So in an absurd world, many people watch basketball for the artistic beauty of an offensive move, while many coaches must watch basketball for great feet and tough minds, or the many people who watch basketball might get mad at them.
"We're always evolving -- what works, what doesn't work," said John Pelphrey, the Florida assistant and former Arkansas head coach. So Florida, a program with three Final Fours and two national titles this century, tweaked its philosophy this year, "so much so that we now talk about how, hey, it's not a bad idea to have one or two guys who maybe lean toward defending, rebounding and energy as opposed to shooting and passing," Pelphrey said.
They set about -- Pelphrey kindly listed these -- fouling less, giving up fewer easy baskets, getting their pick-and-roll coverage down, keeping guys out of the lane -- basically, all the things that help in grindingly defensive America. Florida's defense became its signature for a head coach long perceived as more of a high-flying, three-point shooting kind of guy (even if that didn't quite cover all Donovan's talents).
"Now," Pelphrey said, "we wonder how much of it is coaching and teaching, or if we've just got some guys zeroed in on playing defense." That's because these downtrodden, put-upon coaches found some clues when they looked so tirelessly and forlornly at all those three-pointers (and attempts) across a season.
"So some of it was positioning, some of it was lack of screening coverages, guys being out of place, maybe not challenging hard enough," Donovan said.
They improved their positioning. If you can wake up mornings and go to work all day and get excited about improving positioning, you just might make it in defensive America.Reader's comments »

TAMPA, Fla. -- It was exactly the type of response Winnipeg Jets coach Claude Noel wanted to see from his players.
Humbled two nights earlier in an uninspired loss to the Florida Panthers, the Jets bounced back and played an excellent road game Thursday night, getting a late goal from Bryan Little to beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 2-1 at the Tampa Bay Times Forum.
From backup goaltender Al Montoya, to a group of penalty killers who killed off five Lightning power plays, including a two-minute, two-man advantage, to a fourth-liner who scored his first goal of the season the Jets put in a complete effort.
"You are just looking for a response and the response really has to be in the players' play and I thought we got that," Noel said after the Jets improved their record to 11-11-1 on the season. "The bench was alive, our guys were into the game and I thought we were good.
"We were all disappointed and asked ourselves questions and we knew we had to win the game in order for us to move forward because otherwise it just gets more negative. It was good, I'm pretty happy."
Right from the opening faceoff the Jets came out with more intensity and energy than they showed at any point in Florida and it paid off when Eric Tangradi scored his first goal as a Jet and second of his 56-game NHL career midway through the first.
The Jets held the lead for almost 40 minutes but NHL goal-scoring leader Steven Stamkos finally tied the game 6:57 into the third and the Jets had to hold off a flurry of Lightning chances before Little scored the winner with 4:08 left in the game.
"It was a pretty ugly game in Florida and everyone knows our effort wasn't good enough," Little said. "Tonight our effort was a lot better, we worked a lot harder and everything was more consistent about our game. It was a division game and it was a big two points.
"No one likes to hear that they are getting outworked, so I thought we did a great job tonight of responding and I thought we deserved to win."
Montoya and penalty killers like Ron Hainsey, Zach Bogosian, James Wright and Jim Slater deserve a lot of credit for the victory.
Montoya, who had not played in 10 games, was stellar in picking up his third win of the season, taking away angles with his great positioning and makes some key saves off some of the best shooters in the NHL.
"Coming in here tied with them in the standings, this was a big game for us and you've got to keep the score down in this building," Montoya said. "We did that tonight.
"It's not easy when you go in there every couple of weeks, but at the same time I'm not going to make an excuse about it and just be prepared."
To a man, the Jets and Noel pointed to the job of the penalty killers as the biggest key. Blue-liners Mark Stuart and Paul Postma both went off at 7:57 of the second period but the Lightning couldn't capitalize.
"They did an awesome job," Montoya said. "(The Lightning) had a tough time entering the zone and when they did we were pouncing all over loose pucks in the zone. I had to make one or two saves but I knew where the puck was going and once I made the saves the fellas did a great job of batting the puck out of the zone."
One of the best signs from the Jets was the number of players who talked about the fact that this win means very little if they can't come up with a similar performance back in Florida Friday night.
"This is huge but you have to realize, you enjoy tonight, cause it's a quick turnaround and we're going to have to get right back in there," Montoya said.
The injury-ravaged Panthers lost 7-1 at Washington Thursday night, but have been a tough opponent for the Jets every time the teams have faced off this season.
"We're gonna want to get back into Florida and put our best foot forward," Noel said.
The success or failure of this road trip hinges on it.

Those who were present when WillamChristensen's The Nutcracker had its Utah premiere in 1955 didn't know it was the start of a beloved tradition. But here we are - 50 years later in a more cynical age Ð yet Ballet West's version of The Nutcracker is still working its holiday magic.
The golden anniversary season of The Nutcracker opened Friday at Capitol Theatre to the usual adoring crowd.
A few changes were noticed: in honor of the anniversary, there was gold livery for Clara's wooden nutcracker and the human prince he becomes. The enchanted Christmas tree billowed and glistened with high-tech splendor as it grew and grew. The unpleasantly pink costumes Waltz of the Flowers' lead couple wore in recent years were replaced by outfits in subtler, classier pastels.
More important than such surface changes was the endearing sameness of the show, and the fact that people still line up to see it. It's a tribute to the inventiveness of Christensen, who blended vaudeville's showmanship with classical ballet's cachet.
This time, the story of a young girl's Christmas Eve dream was elevated by Christopher Ruud's dark, dramatic power as the mysterious toy-maker Dr. Drosselmeyer and Michiyo Hayashi's lighter-than-air performance as the Sugar Plum Fairy. Hayashi's partner, Hua Zhuang, was almost as lithe. Alas, the Snow couple, Seth Olson and Christiana Bennett, seemed rooted to earth by comparison. Alex Shaner made an adorable Clara.
Children always love the mechanical doll and dancing bear, nicely performed by Alison Harvey and John Frazer.
The costumes, the scenery, the Tchaikovsky score, the dancing - all add up to a sugar-sweet indulgence, and the holidays would be incomplete without them. Here's to another 50 years.

>>IMAGE his own marine retail business. And he drew upon a mantra of sorts at The Landing School, which reads as follows:
Superior technicians will:
• Deliver it right the first time
• Deliver it when promised
• Charge less than was quoted
• Deliver it clean
It would be hard to say that much better or more succinctly. And Adey told the 62 graduating students this June that they can build a satisfying, rewarding career by following those four principles.
After his talk, a longtime boater came up to Adey and expressed a sentiment that, unfortunately, is not unusual when boat owners get together to shoot the breeze. It had to do with the guy who works on the man’s boat. “Every time I pay this guy I always feel like I’m doing him a favor,” the boat owner told Adey. “I don’t feel like he wants my business or needs my business.”
That’s not the model for individual success or for growing our industry. “The model is do what you say you’re going to do,” Adey says. “That captures everything.”
It’s no secret that the typical frustration flash point for many boaters centers on lousy service. Although we may have hoped that the bad apples and unprofessional behavior were swept away in the Great Recession, it isn’t completely so. Things have gotten better, but old habits and old cultures die hard.
Adey is a pragmatist. Sooner or later, he says, all boats break. At that point, he continues, the industry needs the infrastructure — and the mindset — to fix them properly and provide the boater with a good customer-service experience. It doesn’t have to be a white-glove, Mercedes-Benz and cappuccino treatment, but it should be professional. “Fix it right, and fix it the first time,” Adey says. “We really want to raise the bar.”
Adey also understands the pressures and challenges of running a seasonal marine business, where you’re dealing with cost-conscious customers who demand a lot. “You try and jam 10 pounds into a 5-pound bag, and sometimes the subtleties get lost,” he says, “and that includes customer service.” He points to the Brewer chain of 22 full-service marinas from New York to Maine as an example of an organization doing things the right way in a seasonal environment.
Coincidentally, managing editor Rich Armstrong and I recently interviewed founder Jack Brewer and new Brewer Yacht Yards president and COO Rives Potts (see story on Page 36). It was no surprise that customer service, professionalism and ABYC certification were among the themes we discussed. “Customers are demanding,” says Brewer, the CEO and chairman. “They want service. They want it done now. They want it done right. And they want it at a fair price.” And, he noted, that’s the way it should be.
Adey agrees. “You need to give the customer something to believe in,” he says. “There is no more noble cause than for the customer to understand you’re looking out for his family. Safety and reliability are tough to beat.”
Potts told me that the Brewer yards are big supporters of ABYC certification. (The company had about 80 enrolled in the organization’s programs this year.) “We want our guys to be the best they can be,” says Potts, who is on the board of The Landing School. He says he’s always looking for skilled workers with the right attitude.
“The biggest thing I teach them is how to work around a boat,” Potts says. A repair job might cost several thousand dollars, but what the customer is liable to remember, he says, is the muddy footprint the tech left in the boat.
“One of the things I try and do is think of the big picture and think of relationships, instead of transactions,” he says. “That’s my mantra here: It’s relationships, not transactions.”
That’s a good one to remember. So is the one about the customer being right, even when he’s acting like a horse’s patoot. “Get in an argument, and 99 percent of the time we lose,” Potts says. “So come over to their side early and come out ahead.”
There has always been demand for good people, something that’s not going to change.
“Know the boats, figure out the business side and you can excel,” Adey says. “Deliver what the customer wants. Everywhere I go, they’re screaming for trained, well-spoken people.” And, he notes, “There’s the ethics and business acumen portion of it, too. Be clean in your business practices. Own up to your mistakes.”
Have fun with the customers, don’t take yourself too seriously and keep up with technological changes, he says. When it comes to new products and technology, Adey says, “Don’t put your head in the sand. You can’t know everything, but this is your trade. When a customer says ‘What is this?’ — if you don’t know, you’re going to be knocked down a few pegs.”
Keep pace through training and certification programs, webinars, reading, and attending boat shows and trade shows such as IBEX and MDCE. He also encourages everyone in the industry to get involved at some level — local, regional, national.
“Have a stake in your industry,” Adey says. “Give something back. And every opportunity you get is a chance to forward your business and the industry.”
That’s good commencement advice for the rest of us.
This is not rocket science!
1. You build/provide a good product/service
2. You price it fairly/for both you and your customer
3. You take good care of your customer
Service of any sort — routine maintenance, repairs, etc. — should start with the builder. Design for service: build easy systems access into the product. A serviceable implementation will reduce labor time/costs in the out years, no matter whether labor is provided by service contractors or by the boat owner. Reduced service cost can contribute to a better boating experience, and eventually more new boaters. And fewer bruises, scrapes, raw knuckles, sore backs, strained muscles… and less need for pain medication (of whatever variety) at the end of a service day.
Since 1979, out logo has said “We do what we say we’re going to do, when we say we’re going to do it.” Once you’re committed to doing things that way, the hardest part is remembering the comma goes after “do.” It is astonishing the following we’ve developed using that logo and sending out follow-up cards asking if the client would comment on service, cleanliness, and price.
All great points. And I should like to add the keeping your customer abreast of your progress, or problems and also being able to offer some options is also quite appreciated. Not every job can go just as planned, and as they say, sh__t happens……but you are far better off to keep your customer informed and explain how you are handling the situation.
Nobody gets it more right than Prince William Marina in Virginia, very simply; they just care. Its no wonder they lead in an industry where its all about customer service.Difference between revisions of "Testing for Privilege escalation (OTG-AUTHZ-003)"
Revision as of 13:18, the issue of escalating privileges from one stage to another. During this phase the tester should verify that is not possible for a user to modify his privileges/roles inside the application that could allow a privilege escalation.
Description of the Issue.
Black Box testing and example
Testing for role/privilege manipulation
In every point of the application where a user can create information in the DB ( a payment, add a contact, send a message), to receive information (statement of account, order details, etc.) o delete information (drop users, messages, etc.), it is necessary to record that functionality. The tester should try to access as another user to verify for example if it is possible to access a functionality that should not permicted by the user's role.
For example:
The following HTTP POST permits to the user that belongs to grp001 to access to order #0001:
POST /path/viewMyOrder.jsp HTTP/1.1 Host: [others HTTP Headers]
gruppoID=grp001&ordineID=0001
Verify if a user that not belongs to grp001 can modify the value of the parameters ‘gruppoID’ and ‘ordineID’ to gain the access to that reserrved data.
For example:
The following server's answer shows an Hidden field in the HTML released" with “SistemiInf9”? It is possible to become administrator?
For example:
In an environment in which the server sends an error message contained belives that the user will answer with the above message closing the session. In this condition, verify that modifying the parameters value it is not possible to escalate privileges. For example modifying the `PVValido` value from '-1' to '0' (no error conditions) it is possible to authenticate as administrator to the server.
Result Expected:
The tester should verifies to execute a successfull privilege escalation

In June, the Executive Board considered two recommendations from the Committee on Veterinary Medical Informatics. The board gave partial funding to only one of them.
The CVMI asked for $5,000 to send the director of the AVMA Secretariat for the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine International to three SNOMED meetings, two in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. Veterinary involvement in SNOMED will help ensure that the veterinary community can communicate effectively within the profession and that a common language is spoken between veterinary and human medicine. With an eye on the budget, the board chose to provide $3,000 for the director to attend the two meetings in the United States.
The committee also asked for $14,500 so that another member of CVMI could continue to serve as a liaison to the Health Level 7 and Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes standards organizations, two standards endorsed by the AVMA for the effective exchange of animal health information. The board requested CVMI to explore means of reducing the amount of the request and postponed their decision until the next board meeting. The CVMI will present options to the board at its July 22 meeting.Darjeeling Loose Tea Pouch
